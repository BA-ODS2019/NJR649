      "bodyText": "Hidden from public gaze for five years, one of the jewels in Melbourne\u2019s architectural crown, The Capitol \u2013 a 1920s design triumph of Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin \u2013 has reopened its doors. The RMIT University-owned theatre underwent a three-year $20m+ restoration after it was mothballed in 2014 after falling into disrepair. It originally opened in 1924 and was the first large picture palace in Victoria. One of the earliest examples of the art deco architecture, The Capitol was designed to evoke a crystalline cave with its geometric ceiling concealing more than 4,000 coloured lamps. \u201cThe Capitol represents one of the Griffins\u2019 masterworks,\u201d RMIT architecture school dean Martyn Hook told the Guardian. \u201cUnfortunately it was modified in the 1960s and 70s, which significantly damaged its heritage value. It would have been considered for a world heritage listing if the modifications that created the arcade and the new entry sequence \u2026 hadn\u2019t been completed.\u201d Hook noted that at the time of the theatre\u2019s opening the Great Depression was inching closer. Melbourne was a struggle town in the 1920s amid poverty and broken men returning unheralded from the first world war. \u201cWalking into that foyer [to watch a film for an hour] \u2013 the incredible removal from the gloom outside would have been an incredibly transformative experience,\u201d Hook said. The Griffins, a husband and wife team, had worked for Frank Lloyd Wright, one of America\u2019s greatest architects in Chicago, before they came to Australia. Marion Mahony was a pioneer and had been the first woman to obtain an architecture licence in Illinois, but she remained in the shadows of her better-known husband. In May 1912, Walter Griffin won an international competition to design an unnamed capital of Australia. It proved a bruising experience for the pair. In the end planners and politicians got in the way and Canberra wasn\u2019t built exactly according to their design. The Capitol and Newman College at the University of Melbourne were the Griffins\u2019 major projects in Melbourne. They also worked in Sydney and designed the suburb of Castlecrag. It\u2019s believed the famous geometric ceiling of The Capitol was Mahony\u2019s handiwork. Hook said architectural historians were only starting to understand the powerful creative influence of women who worked alongside modern masters. \u201cWomen architects in the 1920s and 1930s really struggled to have their voice heard in the male-dominated field. Certainly there would be many contemporary female architects who would argue that is still the case,\u201d he said. Architect Peter Malatt from Six Degrees, which oversaw the The Capitol refurbishment, said the project was a double-edged sword to work on. \u201cYou have to pay a lot of respect to what came before,\u201d Malatt said. \u201cA lot of the work on this job was to bring the building up to 21st century standard with all the codes. 80% of the work you really can\u2019t see, there\u2019s a huge amount of stuff behind the walls.\u201d Mallat said The Capitol was the first reinforced concrete building in Melbourne. It was considered cutting-edge back in its heyday in terms of the lighting systems and multi-use status as a cinema and office building. \u201cAll their decorative themes are based on their ideas of modernism but not modernism coming from a strictly industrial view point \u2026 they use a geometry that\u2019s really based on a respect for nature,\u201d he said. RMIT expects the 580-seat theatre to host more than 500 cultural events, festivals and performances each year. One of the first events scheduled is: Viva Varda, a retrospective film screening celebrating Agn\u00e8s Varda from 21-30 June.",

Some company to keep.</p> <p><strong>Ryu - who also triumphed at the 2017 ANA Inspiration - is one of only two players from the leading pack to have previously won a major championship.</strong> The other is Lexi Thompson, whose victory at the 2014 Kraft Nabisco (the ANA in one of its previous guises) stands as her only major title. That\u2019s scant reward for her talent, and a second major is long overdue. It would already have come at the 2017 ANA but for <em>that</em> infamous ball-marking controversy; if she can get her putter warmed up for the first time this week, her powerful tee-to-green game could get her over the line.</p> <p><strong>The rest are searching for their maiden major. </strong>Plenty are poised to stake their claim: Jeongeun Lee6, the current Rookie of the Year; Jessica Korda, who already has five tour wins to her name; Minjee Lee, who can boast five victories on the LPGA tour; Jaye Marie Green, who loves courses that are \u201ca grind\u201d; Mamiko Higa, whose opening-day 65 was the best by a debutant in US Open history. The 54-hole leaders Yu Liu and Celine Boutier - old pals from Duke University - have plenty filling their rear-view mirror. It\u2019s on!</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-02T16:34:45.446Z\">at 5.34pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Jeongeun Lee6 survived a late wobble to win the US Women\u2019s Open at the Country Club of Charleston. The South Korean, who began the day two shots behind joint overnight leaders Celine Boutier and Yu Liu, carded a final-round 70 to win by one. Lee finished bogey-par-bogey but Boutier was unable to get the birdie on the last she needed to take proceedings to a play-off. It meant Lee6, clinched her first win on the LPGA Tour. And that\u2019s your lot ... though a lovely wrap-up report will follow in due course. Congratulations to Jeongeun Lee6, commiserations to Celine Boutier, and thanks to you, dear reader, for joining us here. Next up, the Women\u2019s PGA at Hazeltime in three weeks ... and don\u2019t forget to join us for the men\u2019s US Open on June 13. See you then! Jeongeun Lee6, the 2019 US Open champion, speaks! \u201cI felt pretty nervous on 16, 17 and 18. I know I made two bogeys but I tried the best I could. All my shots were pretty good. I was calm because I knew I could play well. Throughout the year I couldn\u2019t imagine coming this far. I feel proud and I worked so hard.\u201d That was a genuinely sweet interview, because towards the end, Lee6 broke down in tears of happiness ... and that set her translator off too! \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she paused, \u201cI\u2019m just really proud of her!\u201d That\u2019s a lovely moment, one sure to become a part of this grand old tournament\u2019s rich legend. Jeongeun Lee6 was certainly No1 today. Having stepped on the gas after the turn to take the lead, the young South Korean never gave it up, despite that late wobble. That\u2019s thanks to the cushion she\u2019d built up by playing some sensational golf. She\u2019s the deserved victor. And so to the prize-giving ceremony. First up, Gina Kim of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, who is awarded with the medal for low amateur. Then the gold winner\u2019s medal is hung around Lee6\u2019s neck, and she\u2019s handed the famous old pot! So here\u2019s how the 74th US Women\u2019s Open ended up. -6: Jeongeun Lee6 -4: Angel Yin, Ryu So-yeon, Lexi Thompson -3: Gerina Piller, Mamiko Higa, Jaye Marie Green, Celine Boutier, Yu Liu -2: Ally McDonald, Jessica Korda Boutier chips up gamely from the swale down the side of 18. She\u2019s left with a four foot bogey putt ... and it lips out. A double bogey to start, and another to finish. Her flat stick has really let her down today. A miserable 75, and she looks so deflated. Poor Boutier, who will see that missed putt on 16 when she closes her eyes tonight. She drops out of second into a tie for fifth. Her playing partner and former Duke team-mate Liu ends with a 75 as well, both of the third-round leaders having started abysmally, unable to claw it back. A broad smile spreads across Lee6\u2019s face. Then suddenly emotions take over, as she doubles over, as if in pain, then dissolves into the happiest tears. She\u2019s soon back up and smiling again ... and covered in champagne! She\u2019s embraced by her compatriot Ryu So-yeon, before nipping into the clubhouse, presumably to mop up all that sticky booze. Boutier\u2019s got a perfect lie in the bunker, and plenty of green to play with. But her splash out is awful, only just making it onto the dancefloor, then curling off down the swale to the right. Jeongeun Lee6 is the 2019 US Open champion! Boutier has birdied this hole twice already this week. So it should hold fewer fears for her than the rest of the field. But pressure does funny things. She pushes her approach into the bunker to the right of the green, and so she\u2019ll need to Birdie Kim it from the sand if she\u2019s to force a play-off. Lee6 so close now. Boutier crashes a drive down the middle of 18. Prime position to become only the third player today to make a birdie on this fiendish closing hole. The tension at the Charleston is palpable. Here\u2019s Boutier on 17 with a 30-foot birdie attempt. It\u2019s never going in, always staying on the high side, but that\u2019s a par. She\u2019ll need to birdie the last to force a play-off. Liu\u2019s race is run with bogey at 17; she\u2019s -3. Up on 18, Thompson shows Boutier the way by nearly slamdunking her second into the cup for eagle. That\u2019s a birdie, though, only the second all day at 18! She ends the week at -4. Meanwhile Green finishes with a 74, a disappointing end to an otherwise fine week\u2019s work. She\u2019s -3. Boutier\u2019s tee shot at 17 finds the centre of the green, but it\u2019s not particularly close. She looks gutted, presumably of the mind that she\u2019s thrown away her chance at the last hole. But events on 18 may cheer her up a little, because Lee6 can\u2019t make her par putt. She\u2019s stumbled home after looking so impressive all afternoon, dropping two strokes in the last three holes. But she\u2019s still in the lead, and only two players can stop her. Not an ideal finish - bogey-par-bogey - but there are worse places to be in. -6: Lee6 (F) -5: Boutier (16) -4: Yin (F), Ryu (F), Liu (16) Boutier\u2019s only three feet from the cup at 16 ... and she shoves her short birdie putt, the ball horseshoeing out. Just a par. Those early-round putting woes are back with a vengeance. The gap at the top is still two, though Lee6 has plenty to do to save her par at 18 ... and her chip up isn\u2019t great, but it isn\u2019t bad either. A little bit short and eight feet to the right of the cup. A real test to finish. Then again, winning the US Open isn\u2019t supposed to be easy. Lee6 does indeed get a free drop. But she\u2019s still dropping into the thick rough, and her ball sits right down in the cabbage. She\u2019s 161 yards from the hole, and doesn\u2019t look too confident, happy to take full instruction from her caddie. She lashes out and sends her ball greenwards ... but it stops just short of the fairway. Another test to get up and down for par, her third in a row. The nerves have certainly kicked in on this closing stretch. Lee6\u2019s drive at 18 bounds over a bunker down the left of the fairway, and plunges into deep rough. Much may depend on the lie. And she doesn\u2019t have a good one. But her stance may be impeded by a nearby drain cover, so she\u2019ll be having a word with the match referee I\u2019ll be bound. Especially as Boutier has just creamed her second at 16 to a couple of feet. That\u2019s quite wonderful, and this tournament is back in the balance! Lee6 has left herself a puzzle of a putt. Downhill and with the grain, then uphill and against it. There\u2019s a fair bit of left-to-right movement as well. What she\u2019d give for a two-putt par. But she nearly drains it! A couple of joules of energy less, and that would have dropped, but it horseshoes out. She\u2019s left with a three footer - a tricky little one under the circumstances - and it\u2019s calmly converted. That\u2019s a superb par. Boutier meanwhile can\u2019t make her birdie putt on 15, so the gap remains at two. Liu nearly joined her at -5 but her birdie putt died to the left one turn short. -7: Lee6 (17) -5: Boutier (15) -4: Yin (F), Ryu (F), Green (15), Liu (15) A 7-iron for Lee6 at the 157-yard par-three 17th. She pulls it, and though it finds the green, she\u2019s left herself a long two putts for par. Meanwhile back on 15, Boutier\u2019s third is nothing better than average, and she\u2019s left facing a good 25 feet for the birdie she desperately requires. Lee6 chips up to six feet on 16, but her par putt slips by. That\u2019s her first bogey since the opening hole, all down to that poorly judged approach shot. The lead at the top is now just two, with second-placed Boutier in prime position down the par-five 15th after two straight ones. If she birdies that, the pressure is really on Lee6, who hasn\u2019t got a tour victory, never mind a major, to her name yet. Will doubts creep in? -7: Lee6 (16) -5: Boutier (14) -4: Yin (F), Ryu (F), Green (15), Liu (14) Pars for Thompson and Green on the par-five 15th. At -4 and -3, their slim chances are pretty much gone, unless we\u2019re about to witness something very dramatic. Meanwhile Ryu So-yeon signs for a final round of 71. The 2011 champion ends the week at -4. A rare mistake by the leader. Lee6, sending a wedge into 16 from 120 yards, leaves herself well short, and the ball topples off the false front and rolls back down the fairway, 9th-at-Augusta style. A testing up and down coming up. And a test of her nerves. Elsewhere, it\u2019s a three-putt bogey for Jessica Korda on 16. She\u2019s -3. And Yu Liu bogeys 14, the result of a poor approach and underhit putt; she\u2019s -4. Green can\u2019t make the par save on 14. That might be her race run, because Lee6 wedges delightfully to five feet at 15, and makes a precious birdie that gives her a big cushion at the top. -8: Lee6 (15) -5: Boutier (13), Liu (13) -4: Yin (F), Ryu (17), J Korda (15), Green (14) -3: Piller (F), Thompson (14) Green elects to putt up again ... and this time she underhits it. She\u2019s left with another test from eight feet. Meanwhile a stroke of luck for Lee6 on 15, as she sends her second, a fairway wood, a little off line, towards the bunkers to the right of the fairway. But her ball takes a bounce back in, and she ends up on the short stuff. A sign that this is going to be her day? Another poor wedge in from Green. This time it\u2019s after a perfect drive at 14, her ball disappearing down a slope to the left. Thompson finds the dancefloor, though, despite sending her drive into the thick stuff down the right. Par for the big-hitting Jessica Korda at 15; she really needed something there. She remains at -4. Thompson\u2019s second into 13 falls off the back of the green. Three putts coming back, and her hopes of a first US Open look gone for another year. She\u2019s -3. But Green makes her par saver, and stays within two of Lee6, who can\u2019t make her birdie putt on 14. Meanwhile Jessica Korda is back up to -4, where she started, after clipping her second at 14 to kick-in distance. -7: Lee6 (14) -5: Green (12), Boutier (12), Liu (12) Lee6 wedges straight at the flag from prime position in the centre of the 14th fairway. It\u2019s a bit short, and her ball threatens to topple backwards off the green\u2019s false front, but it hangs on and she\u2019ll have a look at birdie from 15 feet. The 23-year-old tour rookie isn\u2019t showing any nerves yet ... unlike Green, who sends an appalling wedge into 13 from 120 yards, miles from the flag. Her long birdie putt ends up six feet wide; she\u2019s faced with a tester she\u2019ll really need to make if she\u2019s to keep any pressure on the leader. Birdie for Ryu So-yeon, who very nearly eagles 15 after knocking her second to 15 feet. The putt dies off to the left and it\u2019s just a birdie. She\u2019s -4 and the two-time major winner will be ruing that double bogey on the opening hole. Meanwhile a miserable finish for Charley Hull, who double-bogeys the long 18th, all her good work mid-round undone. A 72 and she finishes level par for the championship. The difference between a top-ten and top-20 finish. A dropped shot for Celine Boutier at 11, the result of sending her tee shot long, then failing to hit the uphill 12-footer she\u2019d left herself. She\u2019s -5. Meanwhile Jaye Marie Green\u2019s second into 12 topples off the left-hand side of the green and down a swale. She\u2019s left with a tricky up and down to save her par. Out comes the putter, and she flies he ball up the hill and ten feet past. She can\u2019t make the one coming back, and suddenly a gap\u2019s developed at the top! -7: Lee6 (13) -5: Green (12), Boutier (11), Liu (11) Jeongeun Lee6 is making her move! A wedge from 100 yards at 12 to four feet, and in goes the putt. That\u2019s back-to-back birdies for the player whose fan club back home in Korea is called Lucky 6. She\u2019s already got top-ten finishes under her belt at the Evian, the US Open and the ANA. This could be Lucky 6\u2019s lucky week, because currently Lee6 is No1. -7: Lee6 (12) -6: Green (11), Boutier (10) -5: Liu (10) Green is one dimple away from rolling in a monster birdie putt on the par-three 11th. She stays in a tie for the lead at -6. But her partner Thompson drops a stroke, the result of finding the bunker to the left of the green. Shortsided, and with the ground sloping away viciously, she does extremely well just to hold the green. It\u2019s a hell of a bunker shot. But she\u2019s left with a 25-footer coming back, and her ball shaves the hole. She\u2019s -4. A stunning up-and-down by the co-leader Celine Boutier on 10. She\u2019s long and right, down the swale, and faced with a tight lie under some hanging branches. So she bundles her chip into the face of the bank, taking much of the sting out of the shot, and rolling her ball to six feet. In goes the par saver, and that\u2019ll feel like a birdie. She remains at -6. Lee6 is going round with Mamiko Higa, who is in the process of carding a final round as bad as her opening round of 65 was superb. The Japanese debutant has already bogeyed 3, 6, 8 and 10, and now she\u2019s yipped a tiddler at 11, having hit a tee shot that made Lee6\u2019s aforementioned effort look distinctly average. What a miss. But when it\u2019s not your day, it\u2019s not your day. Thompson makes a par at 10 that feels like a birdie. Out of position from the tee, she ends up facing a nervy ten-footer to scramble par. In it goes, and that\u2019s two momentum-saving putts in a row. She remains a shot off the leaders, whose number now include Jeongeun Lee6, the South Korean rookie having caressed a 7-iron to six feet at the par-three 11th. This tournament is really hotting up! -6: Lee6 (11), Green (10), Boutier (9) -5: Thompson (10), Liu (9) -4: Yin (F) -3: Piller (F), Ryu (13), J Korda (11) Angel Yin finds the 18th green in two big strokes. She started the day six back, and if she ends up winning this, it\u2019ll be a US Open record. With that in mind, she gives a long birdie putt plenty of oomph - no point dying wondering - and leaves herself a little five-foot tester coming back. And she can\u2019t make it. She gave that a bit too much, too. Hey, it\u2019s better than leaving them short. Such a shame, her first and only birdie of the day at the very last. It\u2019s still a brilliant 68, but though she\u2019s the new clubhouse leader at -4, chances are she\u2019ll come up short. Liu prods gingerly at her eagle putt, and it\u2019s always dying on the low side. Such a shame. But a kick-in birdie isn\u2019t to be sniffed at. She moves to -5, repairing more of that early damage. Par for Boutier. Meanwhile Jeongeun Lee6 - so called because there are five other players on the Korean tour with the same name - has one of those is-it-good-or-bad-luck moments at 11. She\u2019s over the back of 10, and sends her chip trundling straight at the flag. It hits the stick but fails to drop, stopping just beside the hole. But she\u2019ll make her par, and that would have gone sailing 20 feet past had it not hit the stick. So it\u2019s swings and roundabouts. She stays one off the lead at -5. If Green\u2019s second into 9 was good, Liu\u2019s is simply sensational! She draws back her fairway wood and gives the ball a smooth skelp from 272 yards. Arrowed straight at the flag, it ends up ten feet past, and she\u2019ll have a great look at eagle! Good luck guessing which way this tournament is going to go, because after all that early nonsense, the best players in the world are beginning to play their shots. Coming up, ladies and gentlemen: major championship golf, Sunday, the back nine! Thompson is faced with a monster putt up the 9th. The best part of 100 feet. Her pace is almost perfect, her direction less so, the ball breaking a good 12 feet to the left of the hole. But she knocks in the birdie putt. That took moxie, because she\u2019d just witnessed Green\u2019s eagle effort shaving the left of the cup. Green shows a little frustration at not converting after that stunning second shot, but she\u2019ll take the birdie that gives her a share of the lead. Both players seem pretty happy as they swan off to the 10th. Meanwhile Yin nearly drains a long one on 17 but will have to settle for par to remain one off. -6: Green (9), Boutier (8) -5: Yin (17), Lee6 (9), Thompson (9) -4: Liu (8) Gerina Piller has missed her fair share of short putts since the turn. But she makes missable par savers on 17 and 18, and she\u2019s signing for a very fine 68. It won\u2019t be enough to win, but she\u2019s the clubhouse leader right now. -6: Boutier (8) -5: Yin (16), Lee6 (9), Green (8) -4: Thompson (8), Liu (8) -3: Piller (F), Korda (9), Higa (9) Jaye Marie Green sends a pearler of a 3-wood into the heart of the par-five 9th. It\u2019s one of the shots of the day, rolling serenely onto the putting surface, past the pin, then curling back towards the cup off the backstop. She\u2019ll have a look at eagle from 15 feet or so. Lexi Thompson is between clubs, so opts for 4-iron and only just makes the front of the green. But birdie is on. Angel Yin drains a 35-footer on 16 to get to within one stroke of the lead! She\u2019s currently putting together a flawless four-under round, and the score she could end up posting would ask several testing questions of the jittery folk making up the final few groups. Meanwhile it\u2019s a 72 for Ariya Jutanugarn, who ends the defence of her title At +2. She\u2019ll always have Shoal Creek. Jessica Korda finds herself in a bunker guarding the par-five 9th. She can only flop out weakly into another bunker just in front. She hammers the sand in anger, but cools her boots quickly, splashing the second bunker shot out to 15 feet, a decent result from a very difficult lie. But she can\u2019t make the par saver, and that\u2019s a costly six on a hole that\u2019s been giving up birdies today. She\u2019s -3. Meanwhile Thompson and Green both go very close to birdie at 8, but stay at -4 and -5 respectively. Putts are beginning to drop! Birdie for Lexi Thompson at 7. She\u2019s a little unlucky with her approach, which looks good for a minute but takes a big hard bounce through the green. But no matter, because she sends a putt from the fringe straight into the cup. She\u2019s -4 again. Birdie for the ANA Inspiration champ Ko Jin-young, and she\u2019s -3. That\u2019s a fine response to yipping a short birdie putt on 9. A third birdie of the day for the big-hitting Angel Yin at 15; she\u2019s suddenly in the mix at -4. But bogey for Green at 5, and now Boutier has the sole ownership of the lead. This is going to chop and change all afternoon, isn\u2019t it. -6: Boutier (6) -5: Lee6 (8), Green (7) -4: Yin (15), Korda (8), Thompson (7), Liu (6) -3: Piller (16), Ko (10), Madsen (9), Higa (8) Liu\u2019s tee shot at the par-three 6th topples down the bank to the right. A heavy-handed chip up costs her another shot. She\u2019s back to -4. But her playing partner - and former title-winning team-mate at Duke University - Boutier rolls in a 15-footer for birdie. Reward for a lovely 5-iron in! She\u2019s turned this around magnificently after a dreadful start, and grabs back a share of the lead. -6: Green (6), Boutier (6) -5: Lee6 (7) -4: J Korda (8), Higa (7), Liu (6) Gerina Piller will be cursing her putter. For the third hole in a row, she misses a putt from less than ten feet. The last two were for par, this one at 15 was for birdie. She remains at -3, two off. -6: Green (6) -5: Lee6 (7), Boutier (5), Liu (5) -4: J Korda (7), Higa (7) -3: Piller (15), Yin (14), Thompson (6) Are the final pair turning it around? Celine Boutier finds greenside sand at the par-five 5th in two, then splashes a long bunker shot to two feet. Birdie. Yu Liu makes birdie too, and the pair are back to -5, just one off Green\u2019s lead. Jeongeun Lee6 continues to go along very nicely: the rookie of the year opened bogey-birdie, but since then it\u2019s been drama-free pars all the way. The latest comes at 7, and she\u2019s sitting very nicely at -5. The last nine pairings are currently +23. That\u2019s the pressure of trying to win your first major, the task set for the vast majority of these players. But Jaye Marie Green could be good for this, you know. She\u2019s missed the cut in her last four tournaments, but the one before that was the ANA Inspiration, and she tied for 12th there. She\u2019s on record as saying she loves to grind out a score, and that\u2019s why she enjoys the majors. She tied for 18th at the PGA last year, and for 15th at the British Open. A solid par for her at the par-three 6th, and she remains a shot in the lead at -6. This is absurd. Now it\u2019s Mamiko Higa\u2019s turn to slip out of the leading group, letting a ten-footer slip by at 6. Then Lexi Thompson fails to commit to an eight-footer at 5 and has to settle for par. But finally someone makes a positive move! Jaye Marie Green sticks her approach at 5 to kick-in distance, and that\u2019s a birdie that gives her the outright lead of the US Open! -6: Green (5) -5: Lee6 (6) -4: J Korda (7), Higa (6), Boutier (4), Liu (4) -3: Piller (14), Yin (13), Thompson (5) Yet another dropped shot by Liu, this time at 4. Her friend from Duke and playing partner Boutier stops the bleeding with par, very nearly draining a 50-footer for birdie. The 54-hole leaders are both three over for their rounds, now one off the lead at -4. Charley Hull is going along very nicely today. The 23-year-old from Kettering was out in 35, birdies at 7 and 9 offsetting bogey at 6. She finished this tournament in a tie for tenth place last year, and another high finish is on the cards, especially the way the leading groups are playing. She\u2019s -2 through 11, just three off the lead. If Hull, Piller or Yin posts a target, the rest of the field will have some serious thinking to do. Piller\u2019s momentum has deserted her. In more ways than one. A straight uphill ten-footer for par at 14 isn\u2019t given enough welly, and that\u2019s back-to-back bogeys. She\u2019s -3. She allows herself a wry smile; she knows she got spooked by the sight of her name suddenly at the top of the leader board. Shades of Patrick Cantlay at this year\u2019s Masters. A miserable three-putt bogey on the par-four 13th puts a stop to Piller\u2019s gallop. She slips back to -4. But as things stand, she\u2019s one of only two players in the top ten currently under par for their round today. The other is the 20-year-old Californian Angel Yin, who was out in 34 after birdies at 5 and 9. Boutier meanwhile drops another shot at 3, while Thompson makes it three bogeys in the first four holes, three-putting from the back of 4. This is carnage. Nobody can make a putt right now! -5: Lee6 (4), Higa (4), Green (4), Liu (3) -4: Piller (13), J Korda (5), Boutier (3) -3: Yin (11), Ryu (7), Thompson (4) Jessica Korda misreads an eight-foot birdie putt on the par-five 5th. A big right-to-left break not factored in at all. A good chance to share the lead spurned on the easiest hole on the course. She remains at -4. One of the tour\u2019s biggest hitters, Korda should be making hay around Charleston, but her putter has been stone-cold all week. She took 37 putts yesterday. By the looks of things, her flat stick is conspiring against her again today. Piller\u2019s birdie putt at 12 shaves the hole. No four in a row; no share of the lead. She remains at -5. But staying put is absolutely fine, because everyone else is heading the wrong way. Liu can\u2019t get up and down from greenside vegetation at 2, and she\u2019s opened with back-to-back bogeys. Meanwhile Thompson overrules her caddie on the 182-yard par-three 3rd, selecting an 8-iron instead of the proffered 7-iron. Probably just as well, because she whistles it through the green and into a deep bunker at the back. She can\u2019t get up and down to save par. Green also fails to scramble from the sand, and all of a sudden Gerina Piller, who started seven back today, is tied for the lead! -5: Piller (12), Lee6 (4), Green (3), Boutier (2), Liu (2), Higa (4) -4: J Korda (4), Thompson (3) -3: Yin (10), Ryu (6) The 1st has been playing the toughest on the course, so it\u2019s no wonder so many players have been shedding shots on it today. Throw in the tension of the final day at the US Open, and there you have it. Boutier looked particularly nervous, though. By all accounts she missed a series of short putts on the practice green, which doesn\u2019t augur well at all. But here\u2019s somebody who isn\u2019t looking nervous: Gerina Piller, who has just made it three birdies in a row, this time at 11. She\u2019s five under for her round, and on exactly the same mark for the tournament, just one off the lead! -6: Green (2), Liu (1) -5: Piller (11), Lee6 (3), Higa (3), Thompson (2), Boutier (1) Boutier\u2019s second at 1 is dreadful, a hybrid pulled into thick grass down the left. She\u2019s zig-zagging down this opening hole, her nerves betraying her. The following wedge into the green is overly conservative, and she\u2019s got a long putt left for par. She can\u2019t make it, then yips the bogey putt. A double. Meanwhile her playing partner Liu sends her second down the swale to the left of the green ... and she can\u2019t get up and down. Bogey, and a very shaky start by the 54-hole leaders. Thompson can\u2019t make her par saver and she slips to -5. Par for Green. A bounce-back birdie for Lee6 at 2; she\u2019s -5 again. Meanwhile the leaders tee off. Celine Boutier\u2019s drive leaks off a little to the right, but Yu Liu sends a calm one down the middle. And there\u2019s another birdie for Gerina Piller! She\u2019s already got a top-ten finish at the US Open to her name, in 2016. Now -4, another could be on the cards this year. Back in the groove after taking a sabbatical in 2018 after the birth of her first child. Thompson is right up against the lip of the bunker, and has no chance of reaching the green. She takes her medicine and advances the ball as far as she can, before knocking a wedge pin high. But she\u2019ll be left with a 25-footer across the green to scramble par. Meanwhile on 1, par for first-round leader Mamiko Higa, but bogey for Jeongeun Lee6. While back the tee Lexi Thompson has pulled her opening drive into the sand down the left. Her playing partner Jaye Marie Green splits the fairway. -7: Liu, Boutier -6: Higa (1), Thompson, Green -4: Korda (1), Lee6 (1) -3: Piller (9), Lopez (1) Everyone, that is, with the exception of Gerina Piller. The 34-year-old from Roswell, New Mexico, is an identifiable flying object this afternoon. She\u2019s out in 33, after making birdie at 3, 5 and 9. That\u2019s sailed her up the leader board to -3. Here we go, then! A fast start is essential if the chasing pack want to hunt down Yu Liu and Celine Boutier. But that\u2019s not what the 2011 champion Ryu So-yeon has made. A double-bogey six at the opening hole, and her challenge looks pretty much kaput from the get-go. She\u2019s -1. The opening hole has also taken little chunks out of Nanna Koerstz Madsen and Minjee Lee, both of whom have started out with bogey. They\u2019re both -2. And it\u2019s a bogey at 1 for Gaby Lopez as well; the 25-year-old Mexican slips to -3. Everyone heading the wrong way. Welcome to our live coverage of the second major of the year: the US Women\u2019s Open at the Country Club of Charleston in South Carolina. Sit tight, because this promises to be quite a ride. Here\u2019s how the top of the leader board looks after three rounds: -7: Yu Liu, Celine Boutier -6: Lexi Thompson, Jaye Marie Green, Mamiko Higa -5: Jeongeun Lee6 -4: Gaby Lopez, Jessica Korda -3: Nanna Koerstz Madsen, Minjee Lee, Ryu So-yeon A tightly packed race for the oldest and grandest major in the women\u2019s game. This is the 74th staging of the championship, and should the 28-year-old South Korean Ryu So-yeon prevail this afternoon, she\u2019ll join an elite group of multiple US Open champions. The 2011 winner would be added to a list that includes title-hoovering legends such as Babe Zaharias, Mickey Wright, Betsy Rawls, Annika Sorenstam, Karrie Webb and Inbee Park. Some company to keep. Ryu - who also triumphed at the 2017 ANA Inspiration - is one of only two players from the leading pack to have previously won a major championship. The other is Lexi Thompson, whose victory at the 2014 Kraft Nabisco (the ANA in one of its previous guises) stands as her only major title. That\u2019s scant reward for her talent, and a second major is long overdue. It would already have come at the 2017 ANA but for that infamous ball-marking controversy; if she can get her putter warmed up for the first time this week, her powerful tee-to-green game could get her over the line. The rest are searching for their maiden major. Plenty are poised to stake their claim: Jeongeun Lee6, the current Rookie of the Year; Jessica Korda, who already has five tour wins to her name; Minjee Lee, who can boast five victories on the LPGA tour; Jaye Marie Green, who loves courses that are \u201ca grind\u201d; Mamiko Higa, whose opening-day 65 was the best by a debutant in US Open history. The 54-hole leaders Yu Liu and Celine Boutier - old pals from Duke University - have plenty filling their rear-view mirror. It\u2019s on!",

It was codenamed Operation Neptune, and it aimed to push Nazi Germany out of occupied France. Five beaches in Normandy, codenamed Omaha, Utah, Juno, Sword and Gold, were the main targets for landing a large number of troops by sea.</p>\n    <p>At 10pm on 5 June 1944, troops began departing from British shores to head across the Channel. Five assault groups set sail under darkness in an armada of about 7,000 vessels. Just after midnight on 6 June, aerial bombardment of enemy positions on the Normandy coast began. Special operations troops were also parachuted into France.</p>\n    <p>US troops landed on Omaha and Utah beaches at about 6:30am. About an hour later Canadian forces landed at Juno, and British troops landed at Gold and Sword. Soldiers had to get off their boats, wade through the water, and seize control of the beach, all the while under heavy and sustained fire from German defensive positions.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How was the plan kept secret?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Despite involving a large number of troops, keeping D-day secret was vital to the success of the operation. A disinformation campaign had led the Germans to believe that Operation Fortitude was the main plan for the allies to invade the continent, via a two-pronged attack involving Norway and Calais. Even once the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/d-day\">D-day</a>&nbsp;landings had begun, German commanders were convinced they were just a diversionary tactic before the real invasion.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is it called D-day?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The D in D-day actually has no particular significance to Operation Neptune. It was common practice in the military to make plans that used the term, where the D stands for the day when operations commenced. Military planners also set H-hour, the time at which a plan was to begin.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What happened next?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>By the end of the day, the allies had disembarked more than 135,000 men and 10,000 vehicles on to the beaches, and established bridgeheads of varying depths along the Normandy coastline. This came at the cost of 4,400 allied troops being killed, with thousands more injured or missing.

      "bodyText": "Wrecks and ruins that are among the last vestiges of the great engineering achievements for D-day have been given heritage protection before the 75th anniversary of the Normandy invasion on 6 June. They include six concrete structures built as replica landing craft for troop training, and sunken tanks lost along with crew during assault rehearsals that went badly wrong off the south coast of England. Portions of the famed Mulberry floating harbours are also to be protected. During the final preparations for D-day, General Dwight D Eisenhower, the supreme Allied commander, described the southern portion of England as \u201cone vast camp, dump and airfield\u201d. Six weeks before 6 June 1944, troops rehearsed an assault codenamed Exercise Smash at Studland beach, Dorset, watched by Eisenhower, Winston Churchill and King George VI. Seven army tanks known as Duplex Drive (DD) Valentine tanks, modified to be amphibious tanks so they could leave their landing craft further from shore, were lost because of bad sea conditions. Six crew members died. A valuable lesson was learned, and on D-day the tanks were released only in shallow water. Today, the Valentine tanks in Poole Bay, which have been awarded scheduled monument status, represent the largest surviving group of their type anywhere in the world. Also given monument status \u2013 reserved for nationally important sites \u2013 are two Centaur cruiser tanks, designed to fire at concrete targets such as pillboxes, and two armoured bulldozers, designed to clear the invasion beaches of obstacles, which were lost when a 286-ton landing craft capsized off Selsey Bill, West Sussex, en route to Normandy on D-day. Components of the ingenious artificial Mulberry harbours, made in huge sections, towed across the Channel, and assembled off the beaches so the allies could rapidly land supplies and equipment, are also being saved off Pagham Harbour, West Sussex, after being damaged during stormy weather before being towed to France. Troops had to rehearse how to get on and off landing craft at speed, and for this purpose special replica landing craft installations were made from concrete, designed to represent the top deck of the craft with its front ramp down. Six of these structures, used for training American troops at Braunton Burrows in Devon, have now been given Grade II listing.

Fatou Bensouda, the ICC prosecutor, has, however, already mentioned inquiries into \u201calleged crimes against migrants transiting through Libya\u201d.</p> <p>The Mare Nostrum search and rescue policy launched in October 2013, the submission says, was \u201cin many ways hugely successful, rescuing 150,810 migrants over a 364-day period\u201d.</p> <p>Criticism of the policy began in mid-2014 on the grounds, it is said, that it was not having a sufficient humanitarian impact and that there was a desire to move from assistance at sea to assistance on land.</p> <p>\u201cEU officials sought to end Mare Nostrum to allegedly reduce the number of crossings and deaths,\u201d the lawyers maintain. \u201cHowever, these reasons should not be considered valid as the crossings were not reduced. And the death toll was 30-fold higher.\u201d</p> <p>The subsequent policy, Triton, only covered an \u201carea up to 30 nautical miles from the Italian coastline of Lampedusa, leaving around 40 nautical miles of key distress area off the coast of Libya uncovered,\u201d the submission states. It also deployed fewer vessels.</p> <p>It is alleged EU officials \u201cdid not shy away from acknowledging that Triton was an inadequate replacement for Mare Nostrum\u201d. An internal Frontex report from 28 August 2014, quoted by the lawyers, acknowledged that \u201cthe withdrawal of naval assets from the area, if not properly planned and announced well in advance \u2013 would likely result in a higher number of fatalities.\u201d</p> <p>The first mass drownings cited came on 22 January and 8 February 2015, which resulted in 365 deaths nearer to the Libyan coast. It is alleged that in one case, 29 of the deaths occurred from hypothermia during the 12-hour-long transport back to the Italian island of Lampedusa. During the \u201cblack week\u201d of 12 to 18 April 2015, the submission says, two successive shipwrecks led to the deaths of 1,200 migrants.</p> <p>As well as drownings, the forced return of an estimated 40,000 refugees allegedly left them at risk of \u201cexecutions, torture and other systematic rights abuses\u201d in militia-controlled camps in Libya.</p> <p>\u201cEuropean Union officials were fully aware of the treatment of the migrants by the Libyan Coastguard and the fact that migrants would be taken ... to an unsafe port in Libya, where they would face immediate detention in the detention centers, a form of unlawful imprisonment in which murder, sexual assault, torture and other crimes were known by the European Union agents and officials to be common,\u201d the submission states.</p> <p>Overall, EU migration policies caused the deaths of \u201cthousands civilians per year in the past five years and produced about 40,000 victims of crimes within the jurisdiction of the court in the past three years\u201d, the report states.</p> <p>The submission will be handed in to the ICC on Monday 3 June.</p> <p>An EU spokesperson said the union could not comment on \u201cnon-existing\u201d legal actions but added: \u201cOur priority has always been and will continue to be protecting lives and ensuring humane and dignified treatment of everyone throughout the migratory routes. It\u2019s a task where no single actor can ensure decisive change alone.</p> <p>\u201cAll our action is based on international and European law. The European Union dialogue with Libyan authorities focuses on the respect for human rights of migrants and refugees, on promoting the work of UNHCR and IOM on the ground, and on pushing for the development of alternatives to detention, such as the setting up of safe spaces, to end the systematic and arbitrary detention system of migrants and refugees in Libya.</p> <p>\u201cSearch and Rescue operations in the Mediterranean need to follow international law, and responsibility depends on where they take place. EU operations cannot enter Libya waters, they operate in international waters. SAR operations in Libyan territorial waters are Libyan responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>The spokesperson added that the EU has \u201cpushed Libyan authorities to put in place mechanisms improving the treatment of the migrants rescued by the Libyan Coast Guard.\u201d</p>",

The stark accusation, that officials and politicians knowingly created the \u201cworld\u2019s deadliest migration route\u201d resulting in more than 12,000 people losing their lives, is made by experienced international lawyers. The two main authors of the submission are Juan Branco, who formerly worked at the ICC as well as at France\u2019s foreign affairs ministry, and Omer Shatz, an Israeli lawyer who teaches at Sciences Po university in Paris. The allegation of \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d draws partially on internal papers from Frontex, the EU organisation charged with protecting the EU\u2019s external borders, which, the lawyers say, warned that moving from the successful Italian rescue policy of Mare Nostrum could result in a \u201chigher number of fatalities\u201d. The submission states that: \u201cIn order to stem migration flows from Libya at all costs \u2026 and in lieu of operating safe rescue and disembarkation as the law commands, the EU is orchestrating a policy of forced transfer to concentration camps-like detention facilities [in Libya] where atrocious crimes are committed.\u201d The switch from Mare Nostrum to a new policy from 2014, known as Triton (named after the Greek messenger god of the sea), is identified as a crucial moment \u201cestablishing undisputed mens rea [mental intention] for the alleged offences\u201d. It is claimed that the evidence in the dossier establishes criminal liability within the jurisdiction of the ICC for \u201ccausing the death of thousands of human beings per year, the refoulement [forcible return] of tens of thousands migrants attempting to flee Libya and the subsequent commission of murder, deportation, imprisonment, enslavement, torture, rape, persecution and other inhuman acts against them\u201d. The Triton policy introduced the \u201cmost lethal and organised attack against civilian population the ICC had jurisdiction over in its entire history,\u201d the legal document asserts. \u201cEuropean Union and Member States\u2019 officials had foreknowledge and full awareness of the lethal consequences of their conduct.\u201d The submission does not single out individual politicians or officials for specific responsibility but does quote diplomatic cables and comments from national leaders, including Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. The office of the prosecutor at the ICC is already investigating crimes in Libya but the main focus has been on the Libyan civil war, which erupted in 2011 and led to the removal of Muammar Gaddafi. Fatou Bensouda, the ICC prosecutor, has, however, already mentioned inquiries into \u201calleged crimes against migrants transiting through Libya\u201d. The Mare Nostrum search and rescue policy launched in October 2013, the submission says, was \u201cin many ways hugely successful, rescuing 150,810 migrants over a 364-day period\u201d. Criticism of the policy began in mid-2014 on the grounds, it is said, that it was not having a sufficient humanitarian impact and that there was a desire to move from assistance at sea to assistance on land. \u201cEU officials sought to end Mare Nostrum to allegedly reduce the number of crossings and deaths,\u201d the lawyers maintain. \u201cHowever, these reasons should not be considered valid as the crossings were not reduced. And the death toll was 30-fold higher.\u201d The subsequent policy, Triton, only covered an \u201carea up to 30 nautical miles from the Italian coastline of Lampedusa, leaving around 40 nautical miles of key distress area off the coast of Libya uncovered,\u201d the submission states. It also deployed fewer vessels. It is alleged EU officials \u201cdid not shy away from acknowledging that Triton was an inadequate replacement for Mare Nostrum\u201d. An internal Frontex report from 28 August 2014, quoted by the lawyers, acknowledged that \u201cthe withdrawal of naval assets from the area, if not properly planned and announced well in advance \u2013 would likely result in a higher number of fatalities.\u201d The first mass drownings cited came on 22 January and 8 February 2015, which resulted in 365 deaths nearer to the Libyan coast. It is alleged that in one case, 29 of the deaths occurred from hypothermia during the 12-hour-long transport back to the Italian island of Lampedusa. During the \u201cblack week\u201d of 12 to 18 April 2015, the submission says, two successive shipwrecks led to the deaths of 1,200 migrants. As well as drownings, the forced return of an estimated 40,000 refugees allegedly left them at risk of \u201cexecutions, torture and other systematic rights abuses\u201d in militia-controlled camps in Libya. \u201cEuropean Union officials were fully aware of the treatment of the migrants by the Libyan Coastguard and the fact that migrants would be taken ... to an unsafe port in Libya, where they would face immediate detention in the detention centers, a form of unlawful imprisonment in which murder, sexual assault, torture and other crimes were known by the European Union agents and officials to be common,\u201d the submission states. Overall, EU migration policies caused the deaths of \u201cthousands civilians per year in the past five years and produced about 40,000 victims of crimes within the jurisdiction of the court in the past three years\u201d, the report states. The submission will be handed in to the ICC on Monday 3 June. An EU spokesperson said the union could not comment on \u201cnon-existing\u201d legal actions but added: \u201cOur priority has always been and will continue to be protecting lives and ensuring humane and dignified treatment of everyone throughout the migratory routes. It\u2019s a task where no single actor can ensure decisive change alone. \u201cAll our action is based on international and European law. The European Union dialogue with Libyan authorities focuses on the respect for human rights of migrants and refugees, on promoting the work of UNHCR and IOM on the ground, and on pushing for the development of alternatives to detention, such as the setting up of safe spaces, to end the systematic and arbitrary detention system of migrants and refugees in Libya. \u201cSearch and Rescue operations in the Mediterranean need to follow international law, and responsibility depends on where they take place. EU operations cannot enter Libya waters, they operate in international waters. SAR operations in Libyan territorial waters are Libyan responsibility.\u201d The spokesperson added that the EU has \u201cpushed Libyan authorities to put in place mechanisms improving the treatment of the migrants rescued by the Libyan Coast Guard.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Reality TV is fuelling young people\u2019s anxiety about their bodies, which can lead to suicidal thoughts, according to a survey released ahead of the new series of Love Island. As one of ITV\u2019s most high-profile programmes, there have been calls for the show to feature more plus-size participants to properly reflect society, as scrutiny grows of the effect reality TV has on contestants and viewers. The Mental Health Foundation is concerned about the impact some television programmes, including Love Island, have on viewers, particularly those targeted at younger audiences who are most likely to feel anxious about their bodies. Almost one in four people (24%) aged 18-24 say reality TV makes them worry about their body image, according to the YouGov survey of 4,505 UK adults released by the foundation. More than one in seven (15%) said they had self-harmed or deliberately hurt themselves because of concerns about their body image, and 23% had experienced suicidal thoughts because of concerns in relation to their body image. As well as the effect on viewers, there has been heightened concern for the mental health of people appearing on reality TV. Two people are believed to have killed themselves after going on Love Island, and The Jeremy Kyle Show was cancelled by ITV last month after the death of a contestant. Afterwards, it emerged more people who had appeared on The Jeremy Kyle Show had subsequently killed themselves. Although the deaths were not directly linked to appearances on the show, Love Island has instituted new measures to ensure participants are looked after by the production team for more than a year after they take part in the programme. Dr Antonis Kousoulis from the Mental Health Foundation said: \u201cLove Island has issued mental health aftercare guidelines for contestants, but they must also take into consideration the potential damage being done to viewers. \u201cOur research clearly shows that a large number of young people say reality TV has a negative impact on how they feel about their own bodies. Concern about body image is linked to anxiety, depression and feelings of shame and disgust.\u201d He added that the programme projected body images that are \u201cnot diverse, [are] largely unrealistic and [are] presented as aspirational\u201d. ITV\u2019s Richard Cowles told the Guardian last year that the contestants were chosen by the producers to represent an \u201caspirational version\u201d of the show\u2019s audience. \u201cClearly the contestants are extremely attractive \u2013 they have to be for the format to work \u2013 but we\u2019re not saying the whole world looks like that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is an aspirational show.

Adverts for cosmetic surgery during broadcasts of Love Island were banned last year following complaints that they painted a false image of perfection and exacerbated young people\u2019s insecurities. It is understood dieting products will also not be advertised during the show this year. Recent research has found people can feel increased distress and shame about their bodies when they see images of \u201cideal\u201d bodies. The Mental Health Foundation called on ITV to work with the Advertising Standards Authority to vet all adverts during the show, clearly publish details of the psychological support offered to contestants and ensure the show does not include any remarks that are shaming or discriminatory, or could trigger mental health conditions. An ITV spokesperson said: \u201cITV celebrates diversity of every sort across our range of programmes and this year\u2019s Love Islanders come from a diverse range of backgrounds with a mix of personalities. \u201cWe have already published a detailed statement on our duty of care processes for Love Islanders before, during and over a year after their appearance on Love Island.\u201d \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, contact Samaritans on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

I think it\u2019ll be very important. It certainly will be very interesting. There\u2019s a lot going on in the UK. And I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to work out very well for them.</p> <p>\u201cAs you know, they want to do trade with the United States, and I think there\u2019s an opportunity for a very big trade deal at some point in the near future. And we\u2019ll see how that works out.\u201d</p> <p>May called the visit \u201ca significant week for the special relationship and an opportunity to further strengthen our already close partnership\u201d.

The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said the comments were deeply concerning.</p> <p>\u201cThe ambassador\u2019s comments are terrifying and show that a real consequence of a no-deal Brexit, followed by a trade deal with Trump, will be our NHS up for sale. This absolutely should not be on the table,\u201d he said. \u201cNigel Farage and the Tories want to rip apart our publicly-funded and provided NHS. Labour will always defend it.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson was also pressed on whether the US would seek a loosening of agricultural standards, including the importation of chlorinated chicken. He said the products should be offered to British consumers who could decide whether to buy them.</p> <p>\u201cThere will have to be some deal where you give the British people a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerican products can come over \u2026 but if the British people like it, they can buy it; if they don\u2019t like it, they don\u2019t have to buy it.\u201d</p> <p>In his Sunday interview, the US ambassador also issued a veiled warning to May\u2019s successor over the involvement of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/29/drop-huawaei-or-we-could-cut-intelligence-ties-us-warns-uk\">Huawei in UK infrastructure</a>, saying he would \u201ccaution\u201d the British government not to make any rushed decisions. </p> <p>The highly controversial decision is reported to have been given the go-ahead after a tense national security meeting where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/24/the-guardian-view-on-huawei-if-may-wants-to-trust-we-must-keep-verifying\">May had the casting vote </a>to allow Huawei to build \u201cnon-core\u201d parts of the network, despite cabinet opposition. The defence secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/02/how-will-history-judge-gavin-williamson\">Gavin Williamson </a>was sacked for leaking details of the meeting.</p> <p>Speaking to CBS, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, underlined the growing UK government doubts about Huawei being given access to UK 5G networks.</p> <p>He said that China \u201chave said they want to have an 80% market share of telecoms technology and in other areas like artificial intelligence, they want a 90% market share by 2025 \u2026 And we have to ask as western countries whether it\u2019s wise to allow one country to have such a commanding monopoly in the technologies that we\u2019re all of us going to be depending on.\u201d</p> <p>He added that the UK would \u201cnever take a decision that affected our intelligence-sharing capability with the United States\u201d.</p> <p>Sajid Javid, who is also running to be Tory leader, said he would oppose Huawei\u2019s involvement in the network. \u201cI would not want any company, whatever country it is from, that has this high degree of control by a foreign government, to have access to our very sensitive telecommunications network,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Other topics likely to be on the president\u2019s agenda will include the Middle East peace plan, set out in meetings with British officials by Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and architect of the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/17/trumps-deal-century-peace-israel-palestine\">\u201cdeal of the century\u201d</a>, though the UK is likely to warn the plan needs more emphasis on political rights for Palestinians.</p> <p>The Trump team are also likely to probe Downing Street to see if, once outside the EU, the UK might support US economic sanctions to force Tehran to reopen the nuclear deal.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump will land in the UK on Monday amid anger over comments made by his ambassador suggesting the NHS should be \u201con the table\u201d in future trade negotiations. His visit also came as cabinet ministers vying for the Tory leadership suggested they could tear up plans for the Chinese tech giant Huawei to build parts of the UK\u2019s 5G network, after the ambassador, Woody Johnson, warned it was \u201ca big risk\u201d. Trump, who will meet the Queen at Buckingham Palace on the first day of his state visit, will be met by thousands of protesters in London the following day during a visit packed with pomp, pageantry and controversy that has seen numerous calls for its cancellation. Johnson stoked opposition on Sunday after suggesting the UK would need to allow US agricultural products, including chlorinated chicken, on to the UK market as part of any post-Brexit trade deal, as well as US private sector involvement in the NHS. The administration is said to see the visit as an opportunity for a \u201creset moment\u201d on trade, with Theresa May set to formally resign on Friday. Addressing the prospect of a transatlantic trade deal, Trump told reporters before leaving the US: \u201c(We\u2019re) going to the UK. I think it\u2019ll be very important. It certainly will be very interesting. There\u2019s a lot going on in the UK. And I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to work out very well for them. \u201cAs you know, they want to do trade with the United States, and I think there\u2019s an opportunity for a very big trade deal at some point in the near future. And we\u2019ll see how that works out.\u201d May called the visit \u201ca significant week for the special relationship and an opportunity to further strengthen our already close partnership\u201d. She stressed the need to build closer trading ties. \u201cWe are the largest investors in each other\u2019s economies and our strong trading relationship and close business links create jobs, opportunities and wealth for our citizens,\u201d she said, adding that the government was looking forward to \u201cbuilding on the strong and enduring ties between our countries\u201d. Trump, who has endorsed the Tory leadership frontrunner Boris Johnson, had been a vocal critic of the prime minister\u2019s proposed Brexit deal, which would have kept a customs arrangement with the EU for free movement of goods, which the US believed would scupper any comprehensive deal. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, became the first leadership contender to explicitly rule out any trade deal that put the NHS on the table. \u201cI love our NHS \u2013 it\u2019s been there for me and my family when we have needed it most, and I want to make sure it is always there for all families,\u201d he said ahead of the president\u2019s arrival. \u201cSo I have a clear message: the NHS is not for sale and it will not be on the table in any future trade talks.\u201d The US ambassador, who is a close friend of the US president, said every area of the UK economy would be up for discussion when the two sides brokered a trade deal. Asked if the NHS was likely to form part of trade negotiations, he told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \u201cI think the entire economy, in a trade deal, all things that are traded would be on the table.\u201d Asked if that specifically meant healthcare, he said: \u201cI would think so.\u201d His comments prompted an alarmed reaction from opposition politicians. The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said the comments were deeply concerning. \u201cThe ambassador\u2019s comments are terrifying and show that a real consequence of a no-deal Brexit, followed by a trade deal with Trump, will be our NHS up for sale. This absolutely should not be on the table,\u201d he said. \u201cNigel Farage and the Tories want to rip apart our publicly-funded and provided NHS. Labour will always defend it.\u201d Johnson was also pressed on whether the US would seek a loosening of agricultural standards, including the importation of chlorinated chicken. He said the products should be offered to British consumers who could decide whether to buy them. \u201cThere will have to be some deal where you give the British people a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerican products can come over \u2026 but if the British people like it, they can buy it; if they don\u2019t like it, they don\u2019t have to buy it.\u201d In his Sunday interview, the US ambassador also issued a veiled warning to May\u2019s successor over the involvement of Huawei in UK infrastructure, saying he would \u201ccaution\u201d the British government not to make any rushed decisions. The highly controversial decision is reported to have been given the go-ahead after a tense national security meeting where May had the casting vote to allow Huawei to build \u201cnon-core\u201d parts of the network, despite cabinet opposition. The defence secretary Gavin Williamson was sacked for leaking details of the meeting. Speaking to CBS, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, underlined the growing UK government doubts about Huawei being given access to UK 5G networks. He said that China \u201chave said they want to have an 80% market share of telecoms technology and in other areas like artificial intelligence, they want a 90% market share by 2025 \u2026 And we have to ask as western countries whether it\u2019s wise to allow one country to have such a commanding monopoly in the technologies that we\u2019re all of us going to be depending on.\u201d He added that the UK would \u201cnever take a decision that affected our intelligence-sharing capability with the United States\u201d. Sajid Javid, who is also running to be Tory leader, said he would oppose Huawei\u2019s involvement in the network. \u201cI would not want any company, whatever country it is from, that has this high degree of control by a foreign government, to have access to our very sensitive telecommunications network,\u201d he said. Other topics likely to be on the president\u2019s agenda will include the Middle East peace plan, set out in meetings with British officials by Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and architect of the so-called \u201cdeal of the century\u201d, though the UK is likely to warn the plan needs more emphasis on political rights for Palestinians. The Trump team are also likely to probe Downing Street to see if, once outside the EU, the UK might support US economic sanctions to force Tehran to reopen the nuclear deal. The US has hopes that a Boris Johnson premiership might back Trump\u2019s approach. Trump will be accompanied by his wife Melania and his four adult children for the three-day visit. He will attend a state banquet at Buckingham Palace with May and the Queen on Monday. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn,, the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, and the Lib Dem leader, Sir Vince Cable, have declined invitations to attend. Trump is expected to meet May for formal talks in Downing Street on Tuesday and on Wednesday will travel to Portsmouth for the 75th anniversary of the D-day landings at Southsea Common, alongside over 300 D-day veterans and other world leaders. The Stop Trump coalition said it was expecting huge crowds at its demonstration on Tuesday, after an estimated 250,000 people protested during Trump\u2019s last visit. A giant inflatable Trump baby blimp, last seen when it was flown at his previous trip in June 2018, will fly again on Tuesday. The protests have been backed by a senior Church of England bishop, who suggested Christian followers of Trump in the US were misinterpreting the faith. Paul Bayes, the bishop of Liverpool, said Trump\u2019s populist way of doing politics was \u201ctoxic and dangerous\u201d. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with him, I think he\u2019s mistaken in many of his policies, and I think that the Christians who identify with him, especially in the US, are not properly responding to what our Christian faith says they should do.\u201d",

Ultrarunning, with all its backpacks, poles and food, was not really running. It was running with all the joy bludgeoned out of it. So when an editor asked me to run the 165km Oman Desert Marathon to write an article about it, I said no: 100 miles across sand, in the heat of Oman. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/02/how-the-sheer-hell-of-ultrarunning-led-me-to-a-strange-peace\">It sounded like hell</a>.\u201d But, Finn writes, as the days went by he began to become obsessed by the idea. \u201cThe more I thought about it, the more I began to see it not as a running race, but as an adventure. And who knew what I might discover about myself along the way?\u201d</p> <p><strong>Social media platforms are no longer innovators in terms of speech, publication and the public sphere</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/commentisfree/2019/jun/02/social-platforms-facebook-debate-regulation\">writes Emily Bell</a>. \u201cThey are incumbents, gatekeepers, publishers, however you want to describe them. In other words they are done with disruption, and will therefore inevitably become perpetuators of incumbency themselves.\u201d Despite the clumsy and often self-serving arguments by social media companies over whether to remove content such as the video manipulated to show Nancy Pelosi apparently slurring her words, the debate is a sign of how close we are to a return to mainstream \u201cnormality\u201d.</p> <h2>Sport</h2> <p><strong>The cricket World Cup has had its first nerve-jangler \u2013 and its first upset \u2013 as Bangladesh beat South Africa by 21 runs.</strong> Faf du Plessis\u2019s men needed a record run-chase to defeat the Tigers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/02/cricket-world-cup-south-africa-bangladesh-match-report\">They did not make it</a>.</p> <p><strong>For the Matildas, the intense scrutiny of the World Cup has already begun,</strong> forged in the furnace of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/03/concern-but-no-panic-as-matildas-wilt-under-intense-oranje-spotlight\">a 3-0 defeat by the Netherlands</a> in Saturday\u2019s warm-up. \u201cIt\u2019s a delicate balancing act to ensure that too much experimentation against key World Cup rivals doesn\u2019t leave the squad psychologically deflated,\u201d writes Richard Parkin.</p> <h2>Thinking time: the radical joy of Keith Haring</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"596d9daa7ef763e86223c91b2582e5234ec56ec7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/596d9daa7ef763e86223c91b2582e5234ec56ec7/0_0_2704_1622/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Haring wrote a manifesto that included the words: \u201cThe public has a right to art/The public is being ignored by most contemporary artists/Art is for everybody.\u201d\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keith Haring wrote a manifesto that included the words: \u2018The public has a right to art/The public is being ignored by most contemporary artists/Art is for everybody.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steur/Sunshine/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Keith Haring lived and worked in New York from 1978 until his death, aged 31, from an Aids-related illness. In his final few years, he was invited all over the world to make work, and if you want to see some real-life Keith Haring art, you still can. There is public work by Haring in Philadelphia, San Francisco, Antwerp, Berlin, Paris, Melbourne; on hospitals, at schools (often made with children), in an LGBT community services centre. His work \u2013 the radiant baby, the barking dog, the dancer, the three-eyed smiling face \u2013 is simple, cheerful, upbeat, instantly recognisable. But Haring did much more than provide cute cartoons. He was publicly minded. His art faced outwards. He wanted to inform, to start a conversation, to question authority and convention, to represent the oppressed. Those cute figures are political.</p> <p>\u201cPeople forget that back in the 1980s, he was talking about socially important issues: apartheid, Aids, environmentalism, how capitalism increases inequality \u2013 and he was using very accessible language,\u201d says Darren Pih, co-curator of a major Keith Haring exhibition in the UK. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jun/02/public-has-right-to-art-keith-haring-tate-liverpool-exhibition\">there\u2019s a renewed interest in the artistic era in which Haring operated</a> \u2013 that collaborative time in New York where pop and rap and art met and mixed, a time that started in the mid-to-late 70s and ended, in essence, with a trio of deaths: first Warhol in 1987, then Basquiat in 1988 and finally, Haring, in February 1990.</p> <h2>Media roundup</h2> <p>China is prominent in the headlines this morning, with the <strong>Australian Financial Review</strong> reporting on its front page that <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/news/world/asia/china-strikes-corporate-america-in-escalation-of-trade-war-20190602-p51trg\">China has escalated the trade war with the US</a> by taking aim at FedEx.

In South Korea a baby is one on the day it is born, and turns two on New Year\u2019s Day, even if it is the very next day. Opinion and analysis \u201cI never wanted to run an ultra marathon,\u201d writes Adharanand Finn. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved running, the freedom of it, the childish abandon, but I was a 10K and half-marathon runner, a \u2018real\u2019 runner (in my eyes), someone who pushed the pace and gunned for fast times. Ultrarunning, with all its backpacks, poles and food, was not really running. It was running with all the joy bludgeoned out of it. So when an editor asked me to run the 165km Oman Desert Marathon to write an article about it, I said no: 100 miles across sand, in the heat of Oman. It sounded like hell.\u201d But, Finn writes, as the days went by he began to become obsessed by the idea. \u201cThe more I thought about it, the more I began to see it not as a running race, but as an adventure. And who knew what I might discover about myself along the way?\u201d Social media platforms are no longer innovators in terms of speech, publication and the public sphere, writes Emily Bell. \u201cThey are incumbents, gatekeepers, publishers, however you want to describe them. In other words they are done with disruption, and will therefore inevitably become perpetuators of incumbency themselves.\u201d Despite the clumsy and often self-serving arguments by social media companies over whether to remove content such as the video manipulated to show Nancy Pelosi apparently slurring her words, the debate is a sign of how close we are to a return to mainstream \u201cnormality\u201d. Sport The cricket World Cup has had its first nerve-jangler \u2013 and its first upset \u2013 as Bangladesh beat South Africa by 21 runs. Faf du Plessis\u2019s men needed a record run-chase to defeat the Tigers. They did not make it. For the Matildas, the intense scrutiny of the World Cup has already begun, forged in the furnace of a 3-0 defeat by the Netherlands in Saturday\u2019s warm-up. \u201cIt\u2019s a delicate balancing act to ensure that too much experimentation against key World Cup rivals doesn\u2019t leave the squad psychologically deflated,\u201d writes Richard Parkin. Thinking time: the radical joy of Keith Haring Keith Haring lived and worked in New York from 1978 until his death, aged 31, from an Aids-related illness. In his final few years, he was invited all over the world to make work, and if you want to see some real-life Keith Haring art, you still can. There is public work by Haring in Philadelphia, San Francisco, Antwerp, Berlin, Paris, Melbourne; on hospitals, at schools (often made with children), in an LGBT community services centre. His work \u2013 the radiant baby, the barking dog, the dancer, the three-eyed smiling face \u2013 is simple, cheerful, upbeat, instantly recognisable. But Haring did much more than provide cute cartoons. He was publicly minded. His art faced outwards. He wanted to inform, to start a conversation, to question authority and convention, to represent the oppressed. Those cute figures are political. \u201cPeople forget that back in the 1980s, he was talking about socially important issues: apartheid, Aids, environmentalism, how capitalism increases inequality \u2013 and he was using very accessible language,\u201d says Darren Pih, co-curator of a major Keith Haring exhibition in the UK. And there\u2019s a renewed interest in the artistic era in which Haring operated \u2013 that collaborative time in New York where pop and rap and art met and mixed, a time that started in the mid-to-late 70s and ended, in essence, with a trio of deaths: first Warhol in 1987, then Basquiat in 1988 and finally, Haring, in February 1990. Media roundup China is prominent in the headlines this morning, with the Australian Financial Review reporting on its front page that China has escalated the trade war with the US by taking aim at FedEx. Scott Morrison has pledged $250m for infrastructure projects in the Solomon Islands, the ABC and the Australian report, in what the Oz calls \u201ca bolder strategy to counter the expansion of China\u2019s influence in the Pacific\u201d. The Sydney Morning Herald leads with a declaration from Chinese defence minister Wei Fenghe that \u201cChina was \u2018correct\u2019 to send the army into Tiananmen Square in 1989 because it led to \u2018stability\u2019.\u201d Coming up The federal court trial between state-owned timber company VicForests and Friends of Leadbeater\u2019s Possum begins today. The group alleges logging in Victoria\u2019s central highlands is in breach of federal environment laws.

A statement on the CRO\u2019s website said the man, who was part of a group of three, had sustained a suspected broken femur deep in the cave. His fellow cavers rushed to get help, with one staying to direct emergency services to the site. When they arrived, however, rescuers realised it was a narrow and difficult cave system. The narrowness of the passages, the CRO said, caused severe difficulties for rescuers and required \u201cmajor engineering work simultaneously at many places\u201d. \u201cIn the meantime, the casualty was provided care by a team doctor assisted by trained casualty carers, who monitored his condition, as well as packaging him for the eventual extrication,\u201d the CRO said in an update on Sunday. \u201cUnfortunately, due to the nature of his injuries, and the extended time needed to create a navigable way out, the casualty succumbed to his injuries and died just prior to the extrication beginning.\u201d In total, 94 volunteers worked an estimated 1,626 hours to attempt to bring the man to the surface. \u201cOur sincere and heartfelt condolences go to his family and friends,\u201d CRO wrote on Facebook. \u201cOur thoughts and deepest thanks are also with everyone who were involved.\u201d While the rescue at Fountains Fell was underway, a 36-year-old woman was injured when she fell 6m at County Pot, in Ease Gill, Cumbria. Her leg was treated, put into a splint, and she was flown to hospital in Blackpool for treatment. The caves on the Yorkshire Dales are a well-known tourist attraction, with 2,500 known caves including the longest system in Britain, the 89km-long Three Counties.",

No one in this squad was expected to come into World Cup contention but he may well reconsider after this performance.</p> <p>England took the field with five caps against a star-studded Barbarians side who had 478 and, although they were outscored six tries to seven, 26 points from the fly-half Marcus Smith steered them home. Smith turned down a trip to Argentina for the Junior World Cup for this fixture and it is a decision vindicated on this evidence. His Harlequins teammates Alex Dombrandt, who scored two tries, and Joe Marchant can also consider their chances of featuring in Jones\u2019s wider plans in the coming months enhanced.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/01/jack-nowell-injury-exeter-chiefs-rob-baxter-saracens\">Jack Nowell injury is a pain for Exeter and a concern for Eddie Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It must be said the Barbarians threatened to romp to victory \u2013 coming from 38-12 down to trail by three points \u2013 and it should also be acknowledged that one or two of them, Joe Marler perhaps among them, may have overdone it a touch off the field last week. But that should not take away from the credit Jim Mallinder deserves.</p> <p>Mallinder in effect ruled out the possibility of replacing Jones, should the latter move on after the World Cup, but, taking the reins last week with the Australian keeping a watchful eye on proceedings, he certainly enhanced his reputation given that England, just like their opponents, had barely a week to work together.</p> <p>Smith was the official man of the match but Dombrandt was arguably more impressive. The 22-year-old is in his first season of professional rugby but has been the Premiership\u2019s break-out star and he brought a physicality from blindside flanker that the Barbarians could not live with. Marchant, too, shone at outside centre.</p> <p>Four years ago an uncapped Henry Slade impressed in this fixture and ultimately made Stuart Lancaster\u2019s final 31-man World Cup squad. Asked if any of this squad could do likewise, Mallinder said: \u201cYes. I think we\u2019ve seen players in that squad who played really well for England, have played for the U20s and won Junior World Cups. All they have done is the best they could possibly do. Everybody had an opportunity, playing for England, being watched and giving themselves a chance and I think there are quite a number of players today who have given themselves a good chance.\u201d</p> <p>Countless handling errors had given the opening exchanges a frustrating stop-start rhythm and, indeed, England the first try. The loose ball was seized on by Johnny Williams, who freed Josh Bassett on the left \u2013 the Wasps wing too quick for Filipo Nakosi. The Barbarians responded with a try for their captain, James Horwill, in his final appearance, collecting Colin Slade\u2019s crossfield kick.</p> <p>England added three points with a Smith penalty before Francois Louw\u2019s close-range effort put the Barbarians ahead, but a flurry of three tries in the last eight minutes of the first half put England in command with a 31-12 lead at the interval. The first started with Marchant wriggling through the middle, feeding Alex Mitchell, who showed his pace to streak clear before Simon Hammersley went over \u2013 Smith with the final pass. Smith was next over five minutes later, dummying and forcing his way past Richard Hibbard while the third was finished by Dombrandt but owed everything to Mitchell, who picked off an interception to free the Harlequins flanker.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>They continued the same way after the break \u2013 Williams given a try on a plate by Dombrandt, but the Barbarians finally then clicked into gear. Charles Piutau was at the heart of it, bamboozling England\u2019s defence with his mazy running, as Mark Atkinson, twice, and Rhodri Williams scored the tries to bring the Barbarians back into contention.

      "bodyText": "With a minute or two left of this hugely promising victory for the most callow of England sides Eddie Jones made his exit \u2013 no doubt with plenty to ponder. No one in this squad was expected to come into World Cup contention but he may well reconsider after this performance. England took the field with five caps against a star-studded Barbarians side who had 478 and, although they were outscored six tries to seven, 26 points from the fly-half Marcus Smith steered them home. Smith turned down a trip to Argentina for the Junior World Cup for this fixture and it is a decision vindicated on this evidence. His Harlequins teammates Alex Dombrandt, who scored two tries, and Joe Marchant can also consider their chances of featuring in Jones\u2019s wider plans in the coming months enhanced. It must be said the Barbarians threatened to romp to victory \u2013 coming from 38-12 down to trail by three points \u2013 and it should also be acknowledged that one or two of them, Joe Marler perhaps among them, may have overdone it a touch off the field last week. But that should not take away from the credit Jim Mallinder deserves. Mallinder in effect ruled out the possibility of replacing Jones, should the latter move on after the World Cup, but, taking the reins last week with the Australian keeping a watchful eye on proceedings, he certainly enhanced his reputation given that England, just like their opponents, had barely a week to work together. Smith was the official man of the match but Dombrandt was arguably more impressive. The 22-year-old is in his first season of professional rugby but has been the Premiership\u2019s break-out star and he brought a physicality from blindside flanker that the Barbarians could not live with. Marchant, too, shone at outside centre. Four years ago an uncapped Henry Slade impressed in this fixture and ultimately made Stuart Lancaster\u2019s final 31-man World Cup squad. Asked if any of this squad could do likewise, Mallinder said: \u201cYes. I think we\u2019ve seen players in that squad who played really well for England, have played for the U20s and won Junior World Cups. All they have done is the best they could possibly do. Everybody had an opportunity, playing for England, being watched and giving themselves a chance and I think there are quite a number of players today who have given themselves a good chance.\u201d Countless handling errors had given the opening exchanges a frustrating stop-start rhythm and, indeed, England the first try. The loose ball was seized on by Johnny Williams, who freed Josh Bassett on the left \u2013 the Wasps wing too quick for Filipo Nakosi. The Barbarians responded with a try for their captain, James Horwill, in his final appearance, collecting Colin Slade\u2019s crossfield kick. England added three points with a Smith penalty before Francois Louw\u2019s close-range effort put the Barbarians ahead, but a flurry of three tries in the last eight minutes of the first half put England in command with a 31-12 lead at the interval. The first started with Marchant wriggling through the middle, feeding Alex Mitchell, who showed his pace to streak clear before Simon Hammersley went over \u2013 Smith with the final pass. Smith was next over five minutes later, dummying and forcing his way past Richard Hibbard while the third was finished by Dombrandt but owed everything to Mitchell, who picked off an interception to free the Harlequins flanker. They continued the same way after the break \u2013 Williams given a try on a plate by Dombrandt, but the Barbarians finally then clicked into gear. Charles Piutau was at the heart of it, bamboozling England\u2019s defence with his mazy running, as Mark Atkinson, twice, and Rhodri Williams scored the tries to bring the Barbarians back into contention. When Dave Heffernan then went over at the back of a driving lineout England were staring down the barrel. Another Smith penalty restored a degree of their calm and a stunning run down the left wing from Marchant eventually led to Dombrandt\u2019s second score which settled matters, even if Taqele Naiyaravoro had the final word in the left-hand corner.

      "bodyText": "Anthony Joshua confirmed his intent to enforce an immediate return fight with Andy Ruiz Jr, admitting he was so confident in the run-up to his astounding defeat he had not bothered asking whether a rematch clause was in the contract. The shock of Saturday\u2019s extraordinary upset was still palpable inside Madison Square Garden when the former champion finally spoke early on Sunday morning after suffering four knockdowns in a one-sided defeat that cost him his the WBA, WBO and IBF heavyweight titles and his undefeated record. \u201cIt\u2019s not expected,\u201d the 2012 Olympic gold medallist said. \u201cBookies said I was a favourite. One shot on the top of the dome rattled me a bit and I tried to stay in there a few more rounds. But the better man won. Respect to Andy and I\u2019ll move forward now. \u201cI didn\u2019t even ask about a rematch clause because I was so confident I was going to win. If it\u2019s there, we\u2019ll go again and I\u2019ll get the titles back. I\u2019m going to beat him up. I\u2019m not dwelling on it. You just correct it, you adjust, you sit down, you focus and you go again.\u201d The surprise result torpedoed a much-anticipated title unification fight between Joshua and Deontay Wilder, who has held the WBC\u2019s version of the heavyweight championship since 2015. That fight was, until Saturday night, the biggest that could be made in the sport today, but instead becomes a slain golden goose representing a cautionary tale for the industry on the perils of letting superfights marinate too long. But Joshua, positively upbeat given the circumstances, took a philosophical tack as he pondered his future. \u201cTrust me, I come from a good family, but where I was at in life, I\u2019ve dealt with more shit than this,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with some real big losses and I\u2019ve bounced back. Life is a journey. This is boxing. What I have to do is re-evaluate the situation, make it better and we go again. We didn\u2019t come this far to stop, we didn\u2019t come this far to fold under pressure. We came this far and I definitely feel like we can go a lot further.\u201d Eddie Hearn, Joshua\u2019s long-time promoter, confirmed the contracted option for an immediate rematch with Ruiz and said it will take place in the UK in November or December, adding that it should take precedence over any mandatory title defences and \u201cprobably\u201d be for all three belts that were on the line on Saturday night. \u201cAJ got sloppy,\u201d Hearn said. \u201cIt was a beautiful combination in the third round. He was in total control of the fight but he got sloppy and never recovered. Listen, tonight was [Ruiz\u2019s] night but AJ will come back 100% and we will make the rematch in the UK in November or December. But this night now belongs to Andy Ruiz. \u201cAJ has the heart of a lion and will come back stronger. Now at least we know the opponent for the end of the year in the UK. Absolutely we will enact the immediate rematch. He will be devastated when it sinks in. It makes the fall fight a must-win.\u201d Hearn acknowledged Joshua\u2019s inexperience may have worked against him in his debut on American soil but refused to make excuses for his fighter. \u201cYou know that 22 fights in he\u2019s still learning the sport of boxing,\u201d the promoter said. \u201cHe\u2019s always been learning on the job. Unfortunately when you have to learn on the job, sometimes in the biggest of arenas, something can go wrong. And it\u2019s brutal when it goes wrong. \u201cThere\u2019s no hiding place when you\u2019re in there. There\u2019s no excuses. I\u2019d love to be able to stand here now and tell you [Joshua had] a terrible camp or had these injuries but it\u2019s not true. He won fair and square, Andy Ruiz. \u201cTomorrow, the day after, the coming weeks, this is going to eat him up inside. Great fighters come back and improve. Some fighters never come back the same. The future will show how Anthony Joshua responds.\u201d",

She is, though, wrong-footed and plays a loose shot when she gets drawn into a long baseline rally. It goes to 30-15. Then comes some powerful hitting to force two match points. Muguruza saves the first with a smart return of Stephens\u2019 second serve. Then deuce is forced by some more decent baseline hitting from the Spaniard. Nerves kicking in? She forces another match point with her own brand of long hitting. Then back to deuce when she gets too impatient and plays an attempted winner beyond the line. Muguruza then presents Stephens with another match point when missing a winner that was going begging. At least she saves the next with a lashing, risky winner. Then forces a break point with a shot down the line. Real nerve from her, a lifeline is in her grasp. Stephens hits a timely ace for another deuce. Then comes a loose shot from Muguruza for a fifth match point of this game. The first serve hit the net, then the second forces an error from Muguruza. The American goes through. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6839f3ab2e75e0948e040e81d51ab1a4274a32c4\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6839f3ab2e75e0948e040e81d51ab1a4274a32c4/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephens beats Muguruza 6-4 6-3.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephens beats Muguruza 6-4 6-3.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michel Euler/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-02T18:12:17.783Z\">at 7.12pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5cf40c348f087dd73466c98b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-02T17:52:12.528Z\">6.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Stephens will serve for the match. </strong>She gets 30-0 up on Muguruza\u2019s serve, then comes to the net to force break point with a bludgeoning passing shot.

The umpire has to get down from his seat to point out where it landed. The older man by 14 years wins. Truly amazing. Tsitsipas storms off.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s the reports from today at Roland Garros. Kei Nishikori is already a set up on Avignon\u2019s Beno\u00eet Paire, winning that 6-2. There\u2019s a possibility that match could be completed by the end of the day, but here is where we close the blog for today. See you tomorrow for more. Thanks for reading. Stephens climbs up to 30-0 against an opponent who looks to have lost her mojo completely. She is, though, wrong-footed and plays a loose shot when she gets drawn into a long baseline rally. It goes to 30-15. Then comes some powerful hitting to force two match points. Muguruza saves the first with a smart return of Stephens\u2019 second serve. Then deuce is forced by some more decent baseline hitting from the Spaniard. Nerves kicking in? She forces another match point with her own brand of long hitting. Then back to deuce when she gets too impatient and plays an attempted winner beyond the line. Muguruza then presents Stephens with another match point when missing a winner that was going begging. At least she saves the next with a lashing, risky winner. Then forces a break point with a shot down the line. Real nerve from her, a lifeline is in her grasp. Stephens hits a timely ace for another deuce. Then comes a loose shot from Muguruza for a fifth match point of this game. The first serve hit the net, then the second forces an error from Muguruza. The American goes through. Stephens will serve for the match. She gets 30-0 up on Muguruza\u2019s serve, then comes to the net to force break point with a bludgeoning passing shot. And then Stephens\u2019 return is whipped too close to Muguruza, who can only hit into the net. Kei Nishikori, the seventh seed, and Benoit Paire, the Frenchman, are in action on Court Suzanne-Lenglen. They were made to wait by the epic that preceded it. Stephens and Muguruza has gone with serve again, so it\u2019s 4-3 to the American. Muguruza holds her serve despite Stephens trying her best to break. A couple of wild shots cost her that chance. It\u2019s 3-3 in the second set. Stephens serves to go 3-2 up. Now to put pressure on her opponent\u2019s serve. Avitaj emails in about that Wawrinka, Tsitsipas game: \u201cVery rarely am I made to question my belief that no sport can match football for the drama it can conjure. This match was a rare exception. Give me this sort of real life twists and turns drama over Game of Thrones anyday. Neither player really deserved to lose, but the person most pleased with the outcome is probably Federer considering the length of the match.\u201d Game of the tournament so far? In the remaining singles game of the day, Stephens and Muguruza has gone with serve in the second set, where it\u2019s 2-2. Something must break, to quote dear old Ian Curtis. Tsitsipas wafts a baseline shot out of play, and then hits a backhand into the net. Then makes another error, to hand two match points to Warwinka. Tsitsipas smashes his own face in rage, then forces an error to get it back to 30-40. And then a thrashing, rather desperate backhand passing shot from Wawrinka catches Tsitsipas unawares. The umpire has to get down from his seat to point out where it landed. The older man by 14 years wins. Truly amazing. Tsitsipas storms off. Over five hours of work has come to nothing. Wawrinka looks more comfortable now, and one drop shot to go 30-15 up has Tsitsipas struggling all over the place. He goes 7-6 up. The crowd sounds rowdy and refreshed, especially so after a disputed line call on a Wawrinka save. Tsitsipas plays out a fairly regulation hold and now it\u2019s time to put the pressure on that Wawrinka serve. It\u2019s 6-6 in the final set and there is no tie-breaker, unlike the rest of the majors. This match now into its sixth hour. Right, that\u2019s us - John Brewin is here to take you through to the end. On Chatrier, Stephens has broken Muguruza for 5-3. It\u2019s warming right up there. What a match this is. A comfortable hold for Tsitsipas and it\u2019s 5-5; this set, he\u2019s the one pushing the pace, trying things, while Wawrinka is turning it up when he has to - at 0-15, he introduces some forehand to proceedings, then after a backhand to backhand, round comes the forehand again. The level of fitness it takes - both physical and mental - to do this, is absolutely awesome, and I actually mean \u201cawesome\u201d as in something which generates awe, rather than just \u201cvery good\u201d. Anyway, Wawrinka goes long and suddenly Tistsipas has break point ... can he keep it forehand? Yes he can, but so can Wawrinka! He smashes two when Tsitsipas comes to the net, and the second is just too much despite a dive. Brilliant! Not brilliant! A double fault, and another chance for yerman ... which he wastes, carting a forehand from the centre of the baseline outside the line - he\u2019s now 5/27 on break points, but Wawrinka nets a backhand and here comes another! Ach! Tsitsipas goes wide of the line, just, and round again! But check out the big balls on Stan! He powers through, and at 5-6 Tsitsipas will now serve to stay in it once more! Phew! We\u2019ve been going four hours 42 minutes when Tsitsipas comes out to serve to stay in the competition. Effort, lads. Stephens has broken Muguruza back, but will need to inject more pop into her serve if she\u2019s to get anywhere. Tsitsipas holds again again he\u2019s ticking but in a good way, quickly getting 0-15 via backhand down the line. So Wawrinka turns it up and makes 30-15, then blasts his way to the game. This is unrelenting, intense, incredible stuff! Muguruza leads Stephens 3-2 with a break and looks exceedingly up for it. \u201cAs this tournament has gone on my initial call that Muguruza\u2019s trainers were cool looks vindicated,\u201d emails Chris Collinson. \u201cThere have been some truly dire outfits since then - and those white Nike trainers you gave a no to look pretty duff to me as well. Call the style police!\u201d Joan Rivers is turning in her grave. The ones I posted earlier were Nadal\u2019s and are a total disgrace. Tsitsipas is going to win this unless he chucks away his serve or Wawrinka hits a streak on his serve. He\u2019s playing better and running harder, elements which are linked, so without a breaker to split them, it\u2019s impossible not to go for the younger man. That said, both men hold - Wawrinka is still in front, by 4-3. \u201cYour tennis coach mate seems unduly biased against one-handers,\u201d tweets @SiberianTraps. \u201cFed, Stan, Thiem, Tstitsipas, didn\u2019t become top 10-ers and/or grand slam champs with weak backhands.\u201d It\u2019s all relative, isn\u2019t it? If you\u2019re playing those lads, which wing are you targeting? I don\u2019t see how you\u2019re getting the same power and control as you do with two, either. Stephens is on the board against Muguruza, eventually winning a game that lasted almost 10 minutes. It\u2019s 2-1 now. Wawrinka gets to 40-15 but without convincing, and it\u2019s not surprising when he ends up at deuce. This is a chance to Tistsipas, and he\u2019s not waiting to be asked! A deep backhand is enough for his 23rd break point - he\u2019s only taken five all match - and loses this one too, going down the line and wide with a forehand when cross-court was the play. Anyway, Tsitsipas soon earns another with another deep groundstroke, but Wawrinka\u2019s serve is too good, setting up the winner. He then closes out the game, but only just, Tsitsipas botching a point that was near enough won to cede advantage. Tsitsipas is the better player now, holding to 15 and ratcheting up the pressure on Wawrinka\u2019s next service game. Wawrinka isn\u2019t hitting as hard as earlier, meaning he can run around his backhand more easily. On Chatrier, Muguruza breaks immediately to love, the consolidates to 15. She might just be running into form. Tsitsipas holds easily, but then with Wawrinka at 40-30, he loses focus with the court open so goes long and has to play a deuce. He takes it easily, and the players share a laugh with the crowd in the meantime, but in forrin I\u2019m afraid. 2-1 Wawrinka. My tennis coach mate is back on Tsitsipas, saying he can improve his serve but probably not his backhand. \u201cYou don\u2019t really see much improvement in a player\u2019s groundstroke past his age. Not in terms of it going from being alright to being good. You occasionally see not so good to solid, but not really beyond that, and just the physicality of a one-hander means it has a low ceiling for how good it can be.\u201d Chatrier is almost empty as Muguruza and Stephens get to it. People. I am not having these. Stephens and Muguruza are at the net, Muguruza playing air shots in intimidating style, as she does. He wakes up, punishing a succession of groundstrokes until he can come in to paste a backhand winner down the line. But he then gives Tsitsipas a look at a second serve ... only for Tsitsipas to swipe a miserable effort wide. And what a serve Wawrinka delivers to reach \u00e9galit\u00e9, out wide to the backhand, followed by an ace to the forehand side. Maybe he did actually have the power-nap, because there\u2019s another ace! Suddenly, Tsitsipas is dictating, powering to 0-30 - Wawrinka looks like he could use a power-nap. And when he goes long with a backhand, he can feel the match slipping away - what does he have left? My days they\u2019re spoiling us: Stephens-Muguruza is almost upon us. Wawrinka gathers himself, letting the game go inasmuch as he had that choice to prepare for the decider. A love hold for Tsitsipas, and he\u2019ll now play just the third fifth set of his career. I feel exhausted just looking at them, and what a match this has been, everythig we hoped it\u2019d be. Meanwhile, on Lenglen, Wawrinka has invited Tsitsipas to serve for it. He plays Nishikori or Paire next - all the best, lads. And he does. 5-2 Tsitsipas, while on Chatrier, Nadal leads 5-3; Londero, though, has made him fight for it. Wow, what is what from Wawrinka! Three unforced errors and he\u2019s broken again! If Tsitsipas can consolidate for 5-2, we\u2019ll be set for the decider we deserve. We\u2019ve seen all of Stefanos Tistsipas out there today. His forehand is to die for, his game intelligence is excellent, his volleying is good ... but he needs more free points on his serve and to improve a backhand that\u2019s decent but a weakness at this level. It takes a lot, technically, mentally and tactically, to hang with Wawrinka in this form, and he\u2019s given him plenty. Whatever the outcome, he\u2019ll be a better play for this row, and given how good he already is, when you see how much improving he has to do, you realise how good he can be. Ey up, Wawrinka has 0-30. But Tsitsipas smites a forehand winner and garbles invective to celebrate, then wins the next point too, reaching 40-30 without playing a backhand. And when he does, he floats one into the net! Oh dear. And look at that! On advantage Wawrinka, he races into the net and just need to get the ball over it, but can\u2019t help punching it instead ... and it flies wide! Wawrinka is back in the set! Wawrinka is on the board in set four trailing 1-3; Nadal leads Londero 4-1. Tsitsipas\u2019 forehand is dictating now, bringing him back from 15-40 to consolidate. He leads 3-0, and it looks like we\u2019re going to have waselves a decider. Well who saw that coming? Nadal breaks Londero, and leads 2-1 in set three. After he finishes it off, sometime in the next half hour, we\u2019ve got the joy of Stephens-Muguruza. Ah, excellent - Abhijato Sensarma is back. \u201cStefanos\u2019 surname is pronounced as \u2018tseat-see-pass\u2019... Created a bit of confusion at first, but I had grown accustomed to it by the time his epic showdown v Federer came to an end in the Australian Open. I\u2019m pretty sure that soon, the rest of the world will grow accustomed to it too!\u201d Believe. I was going for a shorter vowel sounds. An easy hold for Tsitsipas opens set four - he needs more of them and, more pertinently, more free service points. Anyway, when Wawrinka has a go they end up at deuce, and man could Tsitsipas use this. A belting forehand gives him a chance, but he has just 3/15 in the match, so ... and he wafts a backhand wide. But it doesn\u2019t matter because his forehand comes to saves him. What a shot it is, the clincher sent from backhand corner to backhand corner, and I almost feel ill from over-indulgence; fantastic stuff. Tsitsipas leads 2-0. In the meantime, the court\u2019s been spruced - it should play more like hard now. Tsitsipas has gone for a lag. \u201cWhich will take more time -- the completion of this match, or making every person in the stadium correctly pronounce Tsitsipas\u2019 name?\u201d asks Abhijato Sensarma. How does one pronounce it? Is it not as it reads? A lovely forehand winner from Tsitsipas gives him 30-15, but another point to Wawrinka means the set is almost his ... then a serve down the middle, a desperate return ... and the ball soars over the baseline. Wawrinka leads Tsitsipas by two sets to one! Nadal holds serve and now leads Londero 2-0. I\u2019ve got a real feeling for him in this one. Tsitsipas fights back from 0-30 to 30-all, then finds himself facing set point ... so rams a serve out wide and stretches into a lovely volley at the net at Wawrinka goes cross-court. Glorious. Less so, though, is the backhand volley that goes long to cede another set point ... but Tsitsipas just rams another serve out wide, anticipates Wawrinka will go down the line, and there\u2019s another perfect volley. This time, he capitalises, forcing Wawrinka to serve for the set at 5-4. Wawrinka attacks the Tsitsipas backhand and consolidates easily enough. Obviously, Nadal is now 5-2 up in the second set against Lodero. Wawrinka rinses and inside-out backhand down the line and Tsitsipas applauds, then is warned for taking too long over his serve. A double-fault follows and Wawrinks looks sets for 0-40 when he goes to pile a forehand down the line ... except what a backhand volley Tsitsipas finds at the net, and his applause is reciprocated. But suddenly Wawrinka is hot, and another forehand down the line gives him two break points ... he only needs one, when a net cord entices Tsitsipas to swipe miles away from anywhre, towards Versailes. 4-3 Wawrinka. At 30-15, Tsitsipas has a chance, on the T and dominating the rally, but the ball flicking the net confounds him and the game is over shortly afterwards. Lodero is enjoying himself against Nadal; they\u2019re 2-2 in set two. Wawrinka quickly makes it 2-2 and then, at 0-15, he mass-murders a backhand cross-court. Quickly, it\u2019s 15-40, but just as quickly it\u2019s deuce, and Tsitsipas then cleans up the game. His ability to play the big points naturally is very special. Brilliant from Tsitsipas, who saves a break point with a dashing forehand then quickly polishes off the game - thanks in part to a volley so good Wawrinka applauded. I wonder if Tsitsipas will be the next new name on a major trophy. I doubt it\u2019ll be this one and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019ll be soon, because I don\u2019t see him beating Nadal on clay or Djokovic on anything else, but he\u2019s the first player I\u2019ve seen the ability and mentality to succeed the existing hegemony. Two quick holds open set three. Tsitsipas reminds me of McEnroe, in that when he loses his rag it doesn\u2019t distract him - rather, he\u2019s able to reset and play brilliantly. \u201cAccording to the Franco-Swiss commentators on Swiss TV,\u201d emails James Ferguson, \u201cTsitsipas broke a racket out of anger during the break at 5-4 to get a warning. And he could have lost that long Wawrinka service game earlier when he hit a shot into the stands after a rally ended to give Stan the advantage. Stan argued with the chair, saying it should have been a second warning, i.e. a penalty of a point. He had a point ... but then we would have missed all those amazing subsequent rallies!\u201d Stan the grass, dearie me. I now know who I want to win this match. On Chatrier it\u2019s much more sedate: Nadal breaks again to give him the first set 6-2. Lovely from Tsitsipas, consecutive banging forehands giving him 15-30. But a wild forehand brings Tsitsipas level ... only for a backhand down the line to give him set point number six ! Wawrinka goes wide with a backhand ... and there it is! One set each, and we\u2019ve been going two hours and 11 minutes! Here\u2019s yer Federer report... Brilliant from Tsitsipas, calmly making it 6-5. This set\u2019s been loads better than the first, which wasn\u2019t bad itself. On Chatrier, Nadal survived a long service-game of his own, and now leads 4-2. Tsitsipas gets to 15-40, and two set points - he is, er, pumped. And amped. He gets a soft second serve to attack, the wind dips it under his racket, and said racket french kisses the clay by way of remonstration; that\u2019ll teach it Stefanos. Tsitsipas then goes long with a forehand, and it\u2019s deuce. Tsitsipas is proper ticking, a-cursin\u2019 an\u2019 a-cussin\u2019, when he saves a game point, and he quickly finds another set point. AND LOOK AT THAT! Amazing de-fence from Tsitsipas - wind-assisted, probably, the ball holding up every time he gives it air - but then Wawrinka loses patience, chopping a drop that leaves him standing. Amazing. Both players are angry now, and Wawrinka has a prolonged exchange with the umpire, asking that Tsitsipas have a point taken off, the grass, before attempting to close out. He cannot, and a backhand flies wide to hand Tsitsipas a further set point; a colossal forehand hauls it away from him. But Tsitsipas is such a competitor, and a succession of forehands take the next point; obviously an ace down the middle brings us back to deuce. What a game this is, what players these two are, and perhaps the entire match is right here. Wawrinka closes out a 13-minuter for 5-5, and can Tsitsipas raise it again? Londero is on the board, and it\u2019s now 3-1 Nadal. Tsitsipas has been warned for unsportsmanlike conduct, but no one seems to know what he did. I bet it was terrible! Stan fights back immediately and brings up 30-40. But Tsitsipas outlasts him in the next rally and a forehand goes into the net - an unforced error by definition, but pressure is pressure. Still, Wawrinka earsn himself another go and Tsitsipas dominates the rally, his forehand humming. But he eschews a volley and yerman doesn\u2019t need to be asked twice, ripping a backhand pass to break back a second time this set. Things are getting hot. Guess what, pals! Nadal breaks Londero immediately, and leads 2-0. From 40-30, Tsitsipas plays two impeccable points - his forehand is booming - then messes up his breaking chance but unloading the suitcase at a return. He gets another chance though ... and have a look! A belting forehand - another one, which suggests he changed his tactics for this game - screeches past Wawrinka, and yerman will now serve for one set all! \u201cThe tennis he\u2019s playing is predictable ... it\u2019s just so right,\u201d says Mats on Tsitsipas, which is interesting. There\u2019s a similar element in cricket, featuring bowlers with lovely actions - Brett Lee, say - who are easier to play than bowlers with messy actions - Wasim Akram, say - because they give you a good look at the ball. A hold apiece on Lenglen; Tsitsipas leads 4-3 in set two and looks the likelier, but there\u2019s not much in it. \u201cSo nice to see Stan healthy and playing well again after recovering from his knee troubles,\u201d emails James Ferguson. \u201cBut Tsitsipas is a really likeable and entertaining player as well - and have you ever seen someone else hit a tennis ball that changes direction in mid air like a Roberto Carlos free kick?\u201d Yep, these are a great bunch of lads, and extremely well-matched. The standard hasn\u2019t quite taken off yet, but hopefully we\u2019re getting there. Out come Londero and Nadal. It\u2019s extremely windy on Lenglen, and Tsitsipas finds himself losing a point which gives Wawarinks deuce from 40-0. Wawrinka then punishes a return ... and another! We\u2019re back on serve at 3-2, and how Tsitsipas will regret the 40-0 point when he tried an expansive forehand for his own pleasure. Londero and Nadal are imminent. I reckon the Spanish lad might edge that one. On Lenglen, has the tide turned? Tsitsipas is such an emotional competitor but such a strong competitor. It means he play with flair and feel, while putting errors behind him, and he forces a point for a double break. Wawrinka, who\u2019s not hitting the ball as hard as before - unsurprising, because he\u2019s not in the greatest shape, even for him - saves it, but soon faces another. He saves that too, earns a game point, and polishes it off with an ace. Federer will play Wawrinka or Tsitsipas next. Good luck, lads. That win was so comprehensive the government are thinking about defunding it and various middle-class parents have opened a free school around the corner. Excellent from Tsitsipas, who consolidates; on Chaterier, Federer is serving for it. A tennis coach mate of mine notes that one-handed backhands - of which both these lads are exponents - are crap, 15% flashy winners. If they\u2019re so good, why do these two keep hitting it to each other\u2019s backhand?\u201d A long forehand gives Tsitsipas break point, so Wawrinka canes down a service winner. Easy. But Tsitsipas then crafts a lovely point; they hit corner to corner, until he powers down the line, comes in, and lets one drop out with impeccable judgment. But he can\u2019t convert, can\u2019t convert again ... then a net-cord help him out. This time, a huge forehand into the backhand corner is good enough, and there\u2019s the first break of the match! Tsitsipas (6)6-7 2-0 Wawrinka. Federer breaks and consolidates. He leads 5-2 in the third. Tsitsipas begins set two with a love hold; can he make an impression on Wawrinka\u2019s? Mayer has just held onto his serve under all sorts of pressure. He still trails by two sets to love, but it\u2019s 2-2 in the third. Thanks John. Tsitsipas has lost sets in each of his last two matches, but neither was against a player of this calibre. He looked to be in control of that breaker, but arsed it up and now he\u2019s got bare work to do. The first set is won by Wawrinka, whose heavy serve gives him a set point chance, and then Tsitsipas double faults. Oof. That\u2019s a gift when there is so little between the two of them. Tsitsipas turns the air blue again, as well he might. That was a mess of his own making. Tsitsipas gets a mini-break to go 3-2 up after Stan wallops a winner wide, then forces his opponent into an error that takes it to 4-2 before his attempt to lob up a backhand fails. That makes it 4-3, and the set looks to be going to the wire as it goes to 4-4 when Wawrinka steps out of the way of a long baseline hit from Tsitsipas, who begins to voice his frustration with himself as it goes to 5-4 to Stan. Some great work forces Wawrinka into the back of the court before he cannot get to a smashed winner to make it 5-5. Then, Wawrinka has to do more chasing before committing the error that hands Tsitsipas set point at 6-5. He misses his first serve, and that gives Wawrinka chance to hit a passing shot to go to 6-6. As predicted, Tsitsipas and Wawrinka goes into a tie-break. There is very little between the two at the moment. Federer holds his serve to go 1-0 up in the third set. Tsitsipas says a rude word as he makes a mess of a shot to go 0-2 down in the tiebreaker, but then battles back to blast a winner and gets back to 2-2. Federer claims two set points on Mayer, and wins on the second, to go two sets up. It\u2019s 6-2 6-3 and Fed looks on course for an easy passage. Wawrinka and Stefanos Tsitsipas is heading towards a tie break with the Swiss No. 2 leading the set 6-5, but the Greek player looking handy with his service game. Here\u2019s the wire report on Konta\u2019s success, with Kevin Mitchell\u2019s piece to follow later. Big Stan is serving well and goes 5-4 up, such that Tsitsipas needs to hold his serve or lose the set. Federer has rather more difficulty, and is taken to deuce by Mayer, before then claiming the game to go 5-3 up in the second set. Mayer manages to hold his serve against Federer but is still a break down the second set at 4-3 to the Swiss meister. Tsitsipas serves out to go 4-4 with Wawrinka but breaks his racket in the process. Right, I\u2019m off for some dinner; John Brewin will chill with you for the next thirty or so. Tsitsipas gets to 0-30 only for Wawrinka to level things, but then Tsitsipas opens up the court to spank a forehand into the backhand corner, set off for the net and despatch the approach. All that earns him the first break point of the match, but Wawrinka saves it and quickly closes out, sealing the deal with an ace. Federer consolidates. Meanwhile, on Lenglen, Tsitsipas, who looks like he plays for Melchester Rovers in the 70s, holds to 15. This one hasn\u2019t caught fire yet because the serving\u2019s been too good. Federer opens the second set by breaking to love. Cheers for coming, Leonardo. The players exchange backhands - it\u2019s glorious - so glorious that a bird flies across the net to admire. At Wimbledon, that\u2019d be appreciated as the most hilarious gag ever rendered, but some how the humour doesn\u2019t translate to French; they replay the point and that\u2019s that. But what\u2019s this?! Cliff Richard is singing Je ne regrette rien! A love hold for Tsitsipas. He\u2019s so lovely to watch, always looking for backhands, volleys and angles. That was ok, I suppose. Federer lazily swats a high volley and that\u2019s the first set to him, 6-2. Mayer forces - ok, \u201cforces\u201d Federer to serve for it at 5-2, while Wawrinka is serving first in the other match. He does so really well, holding to 15, and I chastise myself for liking the look of Tsitsipas to win but both players to win a set. If Wawrinka plays well, he\u2019s still too good (probably). Federer now leads 5-1 - it turns out he\u2019s quite good at tennis. On Lenglen, Tsitsipas, whose mates, I hope, call him Tzitzit, and Wawrinka are warming up. \u201cLovely lazy Sunday afternoon for watching the tennis,\u201d says Luke Forrester. \u201cIn stark contrast to certain other sports currently taking place (*cough*Cricket World Cup*cough*), the French Open is on free-to-air TV \u2013 in fact, if you have a digital package which includes Eurosport, then you have the choice of two channels on which to watch it. I\u2019ve plumped for Eurosport over ITV4, on account of the irritating peloton advert which airs during Every. Single. Ad break. I\u2019m going to have Bloc Party stuck in my head for the rest of the day.\u201d I\u2019d agree - I\u2019m on Eurosport too. Back to Konta, she played really well today, despatching a decent opponent with relative ease. She\u2019s finding the best way to use what she has and conceal that which she doesn\u2019t have, hitting well into the corners, especially off her forehand, and putting her opponent under pressure over and over again. Federer has consolidated so leads Mayer 2-0. Next, we\u2019ve got Tsitsipas-Wawrinka, the match of the tournament so far, by far. Ok then, go on. Konta says she feels very fortunate for the way she played - pretty well throughout the match - and says she and Vekic played some good matches together. She knew it could go either way, so tried to focus on the good stuff she did. Vekic earns the chance to hit a winner but then goes cross-court with the gap down the line; 15-0. Next an ace, then another service winner, and Vekic goes long! Having never won a match in Paris, Konta is now in the quarter-finals, her fourth in slams, and she\u2019ll play Stephens or Muguruza! Sauce from Konta! She gets to 0-40 and Vekic fights back to 30-40, only for a drop to seal the game! Konta will now serve for the match! They\u2019re underway on Chatrier, where Federer has broken Mayer in the first game of the match. Konta\u2019s forehand cross-court has worked really well today and it gets her 40-15. But then a long forehand followed by a backhand winner for Vekic gives us deuce, and I wonder if the match will be settled right here. Konta punishes a backhand winner cross-court with Vekic expecting down the line but Vekic hangs in there, saving game point, and when Konta goes long with another forehand cross-court, entices a further error! We\u2019re back on serve at 4-4, Konta by one set to love. Well lookee here! Konta puts the pressure on Vekic\u2019s serve and Vekic cannae cope. At 30-40 a forehand goes long and this is nearly over! Konta leads 6-2 3-2. Out come Federer and Mayer. The court is much fuller now, the various mevinim weirdly happy to have missed a belter that they paid to watch. People. Vekic is fighting hard, and holds to 30. Konta is playing really well here. Next on Chatrier we\u2019ve got Mayer-Federer. Don\u2019t mind if I do. That was a really enjoyable match, and Konta and Vekic are getting to it too. They\u2019re 2-2 in the second. Martic, who has never reached a slam quarter before, covers her face. She says that she\u2019s waited so long for this moment, she doesn\u2019t even want to think about how long - she\u2019s 28, so. She then says that both players struggled because it meant so much, but she fought hard - and she really did. She plays Vondrousova next, and will need to up it another level to have a chance in that one. Martic\u2019s lobbing and retrieving has been first-rate today, and when she telegraphs then over-hits a drop, a gorgeous rendition of the former gets her out of trouble and gives her two match points! She only needs one! What a win that is, coming from a set down and then a break down in the final set, also fighting through some big-arse deuces. Konta around the net post to Vekic\u2019s ankles ... and she deflects a winner into the opposite corner! That\u2019s very nice, and it\u2019s now 2-1 to her, Konta by one set to love. Brilliant from Martic, taking advantage of some loose serving early in the game to retrieve brilliantly again, a lob getting her 0-40. Kanepi saves the first break point, but then Martic reads a drop and lifts a winner into the backhand corner. She\u2019ll serve for the match in two shakes of a lamb\u2019s tail. Vekic powers through her first service-game of set two and launches herself into Konta\u2019s; it\u2019s hard out there, but Konta is hard too, and from 30-all she sees it away. Martic fights back from 15-40, only to chuck in a double at advantage ... and another at deuce! Gosh. But Kanepi goes long with a forehand ... then Martic works a chance to run around her backhand and go down the line ... but misses. She saves another break point though, and this has been a really fun match \u2013 the standard isn\u2019t the highest but the levels are similar, and the drama is amping up. Martic finally secures a gigantic hold fo fo fo, and you\u2019d not be surprised to see her break next up. \u201cFrom what you are seeing, who is playing better -- relative to their best potential ability/talent -- among the top three,\u201d asks Keith. \u201cFederer Nole and Nadal. Nadal dropping a set: any significance to his form? Due to age/injuries?\u201d It\u2019s hard to say. I guess Nadal will eventually drop off, but I\u2019d not read too much into the Goffin match. Djokovic looks good so far, and I\u2019d expect him to get to the final, but you just can\u2019t back against Nadal, just as you can\u2019t really back against Djokovic at Wimbledon or Flushing Meadow. Meanwhile, there\u2019s another long one in progress on Lenglen. With the set apparently lost, Vekic relaxes and starts hitting, getting herself 0-30. Konta closes to 30-all before a forehand winner earns break point ... only for Konta to find a winner of her own. We go backwards and forwards with break points and deuces, Konta showing great control to find her best tennis on the biggest points; eventually she forces herself through, holding to win the first set 6-2. Martic curses herself after Kanepi saves two break points; Martic then saves game point before a backhand onto the line from Kanepi saves a third break point. This might just be the crucial game of the match ... and Kanepi takes it after Martic works her position only to pick a poor drop-shot. 4-3 Kanepi in the decider. Konta is looking good, breaking Vekic again for 5-2. She\u2019ll serve for the set after change of ends. Martic again takes her eye off it as Kanepi again ups it, and though she retrieves well, can\u2019t keep coming from behind in rallies. Kanepi thrashes her way to two break points and it looks like Martic is going to find what she needs once more, saving one and putting herself in position to take the next ... before backhand onto the toes forces her to tee up a winner with a looping half-volley. Back on serve at 3-3 in the final set. Three successive holds after three successive breaks on Lenglen. Konta leads 4-2, and looked really confident in that last game. At 2-2, Martic forces a break point, then tamely goes long with a forehand. Kanepi then nicks the top of the net and when Martic skips into her next return, does similar! Martic leads 3-2 in the decider, and so far in this match, has found the extra class when she\u2019s really needed it. Lovely from Konta. At 40-30, she cleanses a forehand down the line forcing Vekic to deuce. But Vekic holds it down, clinching the game with an ace down the middle. 2-3, Konta still with the break. On which point, I should add that it\u2019s extremely hot out there. It\u2019s hot in north London too, so I know how they feel. Konta saves a break point to hold, and now leads Vekic 3-1. The standard isn\u2019t the highest, but both players are showing signs of warmth. Brilliant from Martic, coming back from 40-0 to deuce and in fine style, retrieving brilliantly to either hit winners or force errors. The latter gets her break-back point, but then a return off the frame ruins her hard work ... until Kanepi goes long with two booming forehands. It\u2019s now 2-1 Kanepi in the decider and it looks like Martic, if she can stay focused, is the better player. ...Martic saves one break point with a nice high volley at the net, but then nets a forehand. She fought so hard to get back into this, only to lose concentration. Meanwhile, Konta has broken Vekic again. Huge hold for Kanepi, who not only needed it, but needed a convincing one too. And suddenly, she\u2019s got three break points, hollering to the skies when a Martic forehand goes long... Konta has got to be one of the least-fun players to watch, what with her interminable routines and general lack of sauce. I\u2019m hoping that at some point all this becomes part of the entertainment - people grown on you and such - and she does well to fight back to 30-40 from 0-40 before hitting a slice into the net. 1-1. On Lenglen, Konta immediately earns two break points, and only needs one! Vekic goes wide with a forehand down the line, and it\u2019s an iffy start to her first slam quarter. Martic holds to 15! She\u2019s looking great out there now, and the match is level. Kanepi 7-5 2-6 Martic. Konta and Vekic are on court knocking up, while on Chatrier, the tide has turned; another one of those table-tennis backhands, this time a drop, means that Martic has the double break and will shortly serve to make it one set apiece. Yup, Martic is into this. She consolidates, and is hitting her groove. As I was saying, Kanepi plays a loose service game and Martic is there to take advantage. 3-2 her in the second; Kanepi by one set to love. Kanepi-Martic is so tight. It\u2019s 2-2 now in the second, but I\u2019d favour Kanepi whose hitting looks more solid. Oh yes! That\u2019s brilliant from Martic, scrabbling at at 0-40 to stay in the point with various moon balls, then dashing in to play a table-tennis backhand down the line for a winner. Back on serve in second, Kanepi by one set to love. That\u2019s a fine performance from the 19-year-old, who didn\u2019t let Sevastova feel her way in and was ruthless when the weakness became apparent. She\u2019ll play Kanepi or Martic next, and will fancy herself against either. Martic has made 12 forehand errors versus four by Kanepi, who blazes a forehand from the T for 0-30. Martic needs to have a think here, because she\u2019s quickly facing three break points ... a double fault means Kanepi only needs one. Eight games in a row for Vondrousova, who leads 6-2 5-0. Sevastova will serve to stay in it, but knows that it\u2019s a stay of execution at best. On Chatrier, Kanepi has held in the first game of the second set. And look at that! A clever lob gets Kanepi back into the rally, and she bangs away until Martic nets! Kanepi takes the first set 7-5, and Martic needs to find a way of moving her around so she can\u2019t just sit down on her shot and blaze. Meanwhile, on Chatrier, Kanepi leads 6-5 and 30-40... Oh dear. Vondrousova hits a floaty drop and Sevastova trudges in only to somehow hit the top of the net. She\u2019s three break points down, and looking extremely forlorn - perhaps the schedulers knew something. 6-2 4-0 it is. Vondrousova has made 0 unforced backhand errors and Sevastova has made 14. Six games in a row for Vondrousova now; Konta and Vekic should get themselves ready. It\u2019s nearly over on Lenglen. Vondrousova has broken Sevastova, who is playing like a diluted version of herself. She trails 2-6 0-2. Martic and Kanepi are really well-matched, Kanepi bringing the power and Martic the touch. I wonder if Kanepi can keep hitting like this - if Martic can nab the first set, I\u2019d expect her to take the second - but for now, it\u2019s hard to pick between them at 5-5. Four games in a row for Vondrousova, whose drop-shot game is bang on-point - which is a bad sign for Sevastova, who fancies herself at them too. Kanepi and Martic are 4-4, but Martic\u2019s racket is on its last warnin, very nearly introduced to the clay. In the meantime, Kanepi makes it 5-4. Vondrousova is too for Sevastova at the moment and gets herself two points for the set. Sevastova saves the first, then then slides one over the net forcing Vondrousova wide ... only for her to run it down and clout a winner around the post and into the back corner! Vondrousova 6-2 Sevastova. Vondrousova consolidates, and Sevastova will now have to serve to stay in the set. Meanwhile on Lenglen, Vondrousova has broken again, synching it with another lovely drop. The angles she finds, with her forehand especially, are very pleasing indeed. She leads 4-2. Kanepi is hitting it much harder than Martic, and brutal hitting off both wings equalises the break. 3-3, and this is brewing. Vondrousova hasn\u2019t won a game since the fall and she finds herself 15-40 down. A lovely drop saves one break point, but then a forehand into the net gives Sevastova her break back. And there it is: Martic breaks Kanepi for 3-2. Vondrousova doesn\u2019t seem to be paying her hand any mind, and she forces Sevastova to deuce before allowing her on the board with a hold. 3-1. Kanepi and Martic are both looking in decent touch \u2013 it\u2019s 2-2 there, but Martic is perhaps starting to assert herself. It doesn\u2019t look bad - a graze off the clay I think - and we\u2019re quickly back underway. Vondrousova falls and hurts her hand \u2013 she has the trainer out. On Chatrier, Kanepi starts with a hold then pushes Martic to deuce, but she hangs on at we\u2019re at 1-1. Sevastova feels she\u2019s a chance when a winner gives her 30-15, but a swinging lefty serve out to the backhand quickly reacquaints her with reality. Still, after an ace is confiscated following a mark-check, they end up at deuce, before Vondrousova brings it home. 3-0 her. There\u2019s got to be a way of ensuring that the courts are full for these matches. There\u2019s hardly anyone on either of them. Sevastova played an absolute brute of a match on Friday, hanging in there to outlast Elise Mertens (3) 6-7 6-4 11-9, so she might have some tightness to shake, or some tiredness if it goes long. And Vondrousova breaks her immediately to lead 2-0. Martic has looked in good touch here, beating good players - Jabeur and Mladenovic - with ease, then Karolina Pliskova, the number two seed, 3 and 3. At 28, she probably isn\u2019t asserting herself as a force in the game, but might just have run into the form of her life. Opening up, we\u2019ve got Kanepi v Martic [31] on Chatrier and Vondrousova v Sevastova [12] on Lenglen. I\u2019d have those the other way around, but we\u2019re splitting class. Salut! We\u2019ve got some serious gear going down today, with one absolute belter in men\u2019s and women\u2019s and plenty else besides. Stefanos Tsitsipas v Stanislaw Wawrinka and Sloane Stephens v Garbine Muguruza are matches which not only pit two of the best players against each other, but the most inventive, graceful and compelling ones too. All four of them will feel they can do something here, and none of them wait to be asked. And as well as that, we\u2019ve got Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Nishikori v Paire, Vondrousova v Sevastova and Vekic v Konta. On y va!",

      "bodyText": "Western Australian police commissioner Chris Dawson says the \u201cvast volume\u201d of Aboriginal children who are charged with a criminal offence could be dealt with through community justice arrangements and not end up in custody. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Western Australia are 27 times more likely to be put under youth justice supervision than non-Indigenous children, second only to the Northern Territory where every child in custody is Aboriginal. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Dawson said many children that currently face youth detention could be dealt with in a community justice arrangement, similar to a new model being trialled in the Kimberley community of Bidyadanga, 185km south of Broome. There, young people face justice in the form of hearing the hurt caused by their actions in a community gathering under the lore tree. The arrangement is supported by both police and elders. \u201cI strongly support these approaches, rather than truck or fly a young person to be remanded in custody some 2,000km south, taken off country, taken away from their parents and carers and their community, and expect that they\u2019re going to come back better people for it,\u201d Dawson said. \u201cClearly if there are persons in custody that have committed very serious offences \u2026 then I am not saying that it would never be a case that a young person may have to be kept in custody. \u201cBut there\u2019s a vast volume of them where it does not make any sense to take them away from country, but that doesn\u2019t mean taking away justice.\u201d Dawson said it was part of a broader push to address why Aboriginal children who are found by police to be breaking the law are more likely to end up in court than non-Indigenous children, who are more likely to be placed in a diversionary program. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s systemic racism,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not at all saying it\u2019s a totally free zone in terms of any elements of racism \u2026 but I would not characterise it and nor does the [cultural safety audit conducted last year] characterise it as systemic. \u201cWe know there are elements of racism, and I have taken action against officers that have been racist and one very recently is no longer in the force.\u201d He said the push to raise the age of criminal responsibility from the current age of 10 was a \u201csubject of current discussion\u201d with the government. But he defended a decision not to classify the death of Aboriginal woman Cherdeena Wynne, who died in hospital in April, as a death in custody or a death in police presence, which would trigger a mandatory inquest. \u201cI don\u2019t have any information before me to say that she was in custody,\u201d Dawson said. \u201cThe deceased person was certainly not arrested.\u201d He said the final determination on the classification, cause and circumstances of Wynne\u2019s death would be a matter for the state coroner, and he believed they would decide to hold a public inquest. \u201cThe fact that police are in attendance should not connote that the death of a person is connected to police attendance,\u201d he said. Police were called to help ambulance officers find Wynne after she jumped out of an ambulance following a self-harm attempt on 4 April and placed her in handcuffs, according to a police statement following her death, to \u201cprevent injury to herself and emergency services\u201d. She then lost consciousness and was un-cuffed while police and paramedics tried to revive her but she died five days later. Dawson was appointed commissioner in 2017 .

      "bodyText": "In Melbourne, there is a palpable sense that the city is growing \u2013 and fast. But as apartments are put up and rents rise, there is also increased attention on whether the vulnerable are becoming the collateral damage of the city\u2019s economic boom. Victoria spends about half the national average per person on social housing. There are about 80,000 people on the public housing waiting list, including 25,000 children. A report last week found homelessness was being increasingly concentrated in Australia\u2019s capital cities, including Melbourne, a change driven by rising rents. So it was little wonder when the Victorian treasurer, Tim Pallas, was selling his new budget to social service groups last week that he stressed there was more social housing to come. Even before next year\u2019s budget. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give much of the time frame away,\u201d Pallas said, \u201cbut there will be more in this financial year.\u201d The government was already facing criticism over its priorities. The Victorian Council of Social Service chief executive, Emma King, said the budget \u201cblows almost $2bn on a mega prison\u201d. \u201cFor $2bn, we could have built tens of thousands of social housing units to fight homelessness,\u201d she said. The budget did contain a commitment to build 1,000 public housing units over three years, making good on an election pledge. That is well short of the 3,000 a year the Council to Homeless Persons (CHP) says are needed \u201cjust to house those on the priority waitlist\u201d. \u201cResearch has identified that Victoria has a shortfall of 102,800 social housing properties,\u201d the CHP chief executive, Jenny Smith, said. Labor also continued funding for a program that helps about 4,000 victim-survivors of family violence find a home in the private market and created a grants program to help fight homelessness among LGBTI people. But Smith added that despite the increased funding in the budget, social housing would represent a reduced proportion of overall housing: from 3.44% in 2018-19 to 3.42% in 2019-20. The death of 25-year-old Courtney Herron, who was sleeping rough when she was killed, has also put housing and homelessness in the spotlight. The premier, Daniel Andrews, was forced to defend that the budget only committed to build 1,000 new public units. \u201cThat\u2019s the number we committed to at the election last year,\u201d Andrews told ABC radio. \u201cWe will build the housing units we can afford to build.\u201d Libby Porter is an RMIT academic who is unimpressed by the government\u2019s record. \u201cIt\u2019s just laughable they think 1,000 units is anywhere near close to what we need,\u201d Porter said. She noted that ABS figures released last week showed only 66 public housing dwellings were approved in Victoria in the first quarter of 2019. A few days after the budget, Porter released a report on the government\u2019s $185m Public Housing Renewal Project, which was opposed by the Coalition and the Greens. While the government will build 1,000 new public housing units, it also plans to sell 11 public housing estates to developers on the condition they redevelop the properties and provide a 10% net increase in social housing. While public housing is owned and managed by the government, social housing is a broader term that includes properties run by not-for-profits. Porter\u2019s analysis suggests that, of the first three inner-city housing estates where the government has struck a deal with a developer, the result will be additional social housing units but fewer bedrooms. None so far will be \u201cpublic units\u201d. It means the redeveloped community housing units will end up serving fewer low-income Victorians. Defending the plan, the Victorian housing minister, Richard Wynne, said the government was seeking to \u201cmatch demand to supply because times have changed\u201d. \u201cThese days 80% of need is for one or two bedroom properties, while most of our older housing stock is three bedroom properties,\u201d he said. Porter acknowledged the \u201cneed for one bedroom units\u201d, but said the way families registered on the housing waiting list often lead to a \u201cmismatch between the stock available and the person presenting\u201d. Like social service groups, the Greens have questioned the government\u2019s priorities. \u201cThis budget is spending almost 10 times more on new prisons than it is on new public housing,\u201d the Greens leader, Samantha Ratnam, told parliament last week. The $1.8bn will fund a new jail at Lara, near Geelong, and upgrade other correctional facilities. The 1,000 new public housing units will cost $200m. There are 160 homes funded for the 2019-20 financial year, according to the budget papers. Pallas suggested the investment in new prisons was unfortunate but necessary. \u201cNobody gets more upset than the treasurer [about] actually having to put more money into building prisons,\u201d he said. Asked why successive Victorian governments had not build enough public homes, he told the Vcoss breakfast it was a \u201cdaunting task\u201d. \u201cI think somewhere in the 1970s we dropped the ball as a state,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about that. \u201cThe fact that we put a little over $200m into providing more social and public housing in this budget is really a start but there\u2019s a lot more to do.\u201d",

For the hundreds of thousands of people who lined the streets of Merseyside, however, the team\u2019s homecoming on Sunday was greeted with the sort of adulation expected of a city where fans have long lived by the maxim that football is more important than life or death. A sea of red swelled the route of an open-top bus that carried the triumphant team and their manager, J\u00fcrgen Klopp. Hours earlier, Klopp and the Liverpool captain, Jordan Henderson, had emerged from a plane at Liverpool\u2019s John Lennon airport bearing the European Cup following their 2-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. \u201cNow we won something and we will carry on,\u201d Klopp said of a result that put paid to lingering suggestions that the German was the unluckiest manager in football after a run of six final defeats. For the majority of the players, it was their first major trophy, coming after they lost the Champions League final to Real Madrid a year ago and Manchester City pipped them to the Premier League title by one point last month. \u201cWe want to win things, 100%.

In an echo of some of the circuitous routes to Madrid taken by countless Liverpool and Spurs fans, Barnes also revealed how he had slept outside Barcelona airport following a marathon detour from a family holiday in Greece. \u201cI got to Barcelona at 2am, I had to get a train to Madrid, it was not until 5am, the train station is not open until 4am,\u201d he told the Liverpool Echo. \u201cFrom 2am until 4am I was lying on the floor outside the train station with a lot of homeless people before the station opened.\u201d Another image that was to become one of the defining moments of the weekend was that of Henderson embracing his father after collecting his winner\u2019s medal.

      "bodyText": "Bathed in late afternoon sun, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, boarded a steamboat on Lake Geneva. He was there for drinks and nibbles with the King of Holland and the head of Nato, a glamorous end to a busy day at the Bilderberg summit. Representing the White House, Jared Kushner wore a beatific smile as he strode towards the boat, thinking, perhaps, of how best to sell a war with Iran over a glass of frascati. Security at the wharf was drum tight. Amid a sea of secret service personnel, Pompeo was accompanied by the US ambassador to Switzerland, Ed McMullen. The pair looked keen to continue the geopolitical strategizing over canap\u00e9s. The secretary general of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, was flanked by heavily armed bodyguards as he strode along the jetty. He has attended the last three Bilderberg meetings, turning up for \u201cinformal discussions\u201d with a watchful squad of security and staff. Officers aboard a Swiss police launch scoured the waterfront for trouble. Nothing broke the golden calm apart from a lone voice from the quayside that advised Pompeo, in French, that he should play more tennis as he might be looking a little overweight. That was the gist of it, at least. Up on deck, King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands chatted to James O Ellis, a former head of US Strategic Command, now a director of Lockheed Martin. A Netflix board member squeezed past on his way to the bar. For the Dutch king to be seen networking with Lockheed Martin at Bilderberg might not be the best look: in the 1970s a lobbying scandal involving the company caused his grandfather, Prince Bernhard, to resign his public offices. Decades later, Bilderberg\u2019s heady mixture of senior public figures, lobbyists and investors discussing policy behind closed doors remains hard to defend on transparency grounds. Even the air around the steamboat soiree, filled with the happy chatter of diplomats, industrialists and press barons, has an air of corruption about it. Although that might just be the gruyere puffs. At the ship\u2019s stern a former chief executive of Google, Eric Schmidt, broke off from chatting to the CEO of French finance giant Axa to take snaps of the lake. An influential figure, Schmidt is chair of the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Innovation Board and also heads a new US government advisory group on artificial intelligence. Bilderberg has a keen and growing interest in hi-tech and AI. Schmidt\u2019s fellow Bilderberg insider Peter Thiel, the billionaire founder of PayPal and a director of Facebook, was seen arriving with the Swedish physicist and AI expert Sara Mazur. They were followed along the jetty by LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, another adviser to the Pentagon on tech. The Microsoft board member and Bilderberg regular practically floated up the gangplank, looking delighted to feel the sun on his skin. There were almost as many billionaires on the boat as there were bodyguards. And there were more journalists and commentators clinking glasses with bank bosses than outside the security cordon, reporting on the event. This year\u2019s conference was more than usually packed with \u201cembedded\u201d reporters who, as part of the deal, say nothing about what goes on. Here\u2019s journalist John Micklethwait, editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News, happily putting it away between the head of Unesco on the left and another director of Axa on the right. The Italian journalist Stefano Feltri strolled on board with the cheery Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte. Feltri is right there, in the middle of one of the year\u2019s biggest diplomatic summits, but he won\u2019t be saying a word about it because of that white lanyard round his neck. As the sun set on Lake Geneva, the boat set off for Chillon Castle, where Pompeo gave a Q&amp;A and participants were treated to a banquet. It\u2019s always fun to thrash out \u201ca new strategic order\u201d over a fondue. In all, it was a bit eerie watching such a relaxed, twinkly drinks party in the context of a conference featuring so many Pentagon officials and advisers and Nato strategy chiefs.

I have been in practice for 33 years and I have carried out euthanasia on sick, injured and very aged pets on an almost daily basis. The article suggests, with reference to one report, that animals frequently vomit or soil themselves on entering the room where euthanasia is to take place. I have euthanised animals in my clinic, in people\u2019s homes, in people\u2019s gardens, even in their cars, and this has never been my experience. Performing gentle humane euthanasia is a defining experience for a small-animal veterinarian. It is also the source of our most heartwarming feedback from clients. We are proud that we are able to comfort them and bring them to a reconciliation that a peaceful end to life is far preferable to prolonged suffering, and that we can perform this service with gentleness and dignity. Most of my clients choose to be present, but when they do not, the assistance of experienced and caring nurses, sedation as necessary and the very minimum of restraint, if any at all, ensures that all pets can leave this life with the peace and dignity we would want for our own. It would be a tragedy if this poorly evidenced representation of the most important function we perform in companion animal medicine were to dissuade anyone from seeking the best, most compassionate end-of-life care and advice that veterinary professionals and their support staff can provide.

      "bodyText": "Senior Conservatives have expressed alarm that the leadership contest could become unmanageable and chaotic after a 13th candidate, Sam Gyimah, entered the race. At least four other MPs are believed to be considering joining the fray next week, leading one minister to describe some of the hopefuls as \u201cvanity candidates\u201d. The 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, which will set the rules and run the contest, is expected to meet on Tuesday, and the rules are due to be agreed by the party board on Wednesday. Sir Graham Brady has stood down as the committee\u2019s chair and is mulling running for the leadership himself. Members of the committee\u2019s executive told the Guardian they believed there was a clear case for a rule change. \u201cI favour a proposer, seconder and 10 supporters. The alternative is a large-scale cull after the first ballot,\u201d one committee member said. MPs will begin voting after Theresa May steps down on Friday. In past contests, in each round the candidate with the fewest votes dropped out. The committee has previously held bi-weekly votes and is now considering holding votes daily. Several of the leading candidates, many of whom have between 30 to 40 endorsements, are known to favour a rule change, believing it could halve the number of opponents. The universities minister, Chris Skidmore, who has backed Sajid Javid, tweeted: \u201cThis \u2018vanity candidate\u2019 phenomenon is becoming a joke \u2013 I hope the 1922 Committee bring in new rules so that candidates have to be nominated by a fixed proportion of the parliamentary party.\u201d The former trade minister Greg Hands joked on Twitter that he \u201cmight have the casting vote\u201d given the large number of candidates. The 13 in the running are Javid, Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Matt Hancock, Jeremy Hunt, Andrea Leadsom, Esther McVey, Rory Stewart, James Cleverly, Mark Harper, Kit Malthouse and Gyimah. Others who may still announce they will run include Brady, Penny Mordaunt, Priti Patel, Jesse Norman and Steve Baker. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, and Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, have not ruled themselves out. Should all of these run, it would take the number of candidates to 20. In a joint opinion piece with the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, Patel wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that candidates who had minimal support should realise they did not have time to learn on the job. \u201cThose who have thrown their hats into the ring, with minimum support but imbued with an enormous sense of self-worth, need to think a little more carefully,\u201d the piece said. Over the weekend some of the leadership candidates set out their plans for resolving the Brexit crisis. Leadsom, the former leader of the Commons, said she would not attempt to renegotiate May\u2019s Brexit deal and instead would pursue a managed no deal. She told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show she would pass legislation to protect EU citizens but also attempt to secure side deals based on the withdrawal agreement to keep goods moving across borders \u2013 a suggestion the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has explicitly ruled out. She said she believed \u201cthe withdrawal agreement is dead, that we can\u2019t reopen the withdrawal agreement bill and the UK parliament won\u2019t vote for it. Even if, to use the common parlance, we were to leave with no deal, there would be arrangements in place. What I\u2019m suggesting is making an offer to the EU for things that were already agreed in the withdrawal agreement, that will enable us to leave with a managed exit.\u201d Barnier has previously said there cannot be \u201cmini-deals\u201d if the UK crashes out of the bloc. Leadsom dismissed the possibility of parliament preventing a no-deal departure, saying she believed a prime minister pursuing a \u201cmanaged exit\u201d and guaranteeing citizens\u2019 rights would not lose a confidence vote. Javid, speaking later on the same programme, said he would not want to extend Brexit beyond the end of October but would not ignore parliament if it forced his hand. \u201cI want to leave with a deal but if I have to choose between no deal and no Brexit I would pick no deal,\u201d he said. Asked if he would contemplate another extension, he said: \u201cThat\u2019s not something I would do, but we are a parliamentary democracy \u2026 so if it\u2019s the law, I would not break the law.\u201d Sources close to Gove, the environment secretary, suggested he was prepared to delay Brexit until the end of next year rather than leave without a deal on 31 October. Hancock wrote to colleagues on Sunday setting out plans to renegotiate the Brexit deal and warning that leaving without a deal on 31 October was unrealistic because of the likelihood of it being blocked by parliament. He said no deal was |not a policy choice available to the next prime minister\u201d. Several candidates received high-profile endorsements: Johnson from Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, and Stewart from David Gauke, the justice secretary, and the Tory grandee Ken Clarke.

In 2003 the iTunes Store added the ability to buy tracks legally rather than using popular peer-to-peer file sharing sites such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/31/napster-twenty-years-music-revolution\">Napster, which had arrived in 1999</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe attraction of Napster was not just that it was free, but more importantly, it gave people a way to connect with pretty much any piece of music,\u201d the former Warner Music vice-president Paul Vidich <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/itunes-10th-anniversary-how-steve-jobs-turned-the-industry-upside-down-68985/\">told Rolling Stone in 2013</a>. \u201cWhat Steve was doing with iTunes was to replicate that type of experience \u2013 a vast catalogue, available on a singles basis, with a convenient interface. It had to be easier than Napster.\u201d</p> <p>Although other companies \u2013 including Microsoft and Sony \u2013 had considered launching music stores, they \u201cweren\u2019t companies that had demonstrated Apple\u2019s sophistication with regard to software\u201d, according to Vidich. \u201cIt really took a company that was able to bridge those two things and come up with an attractive consumer product.\u201d</p> <p>But in the ephemeral world of tech, iTunes \u2013 and its use of downloads \u2013 quickly became old-fashioned as companies including Spotify introduced successful streaming models as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/05/10-years-of-spotify-should-we-celebrate-or-despair\">music\u2019s most radically democratic era</a>\u201d began.</p> <p>Launching in 2008, Spotify offered unlimited ad-free access to its catalogue of music for a fee (now \u00a39.99 a month for its premium service). The company claims to have 217 million users worldwide with <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-04-29/spotify-reports-first-quarter-2019-earnings/\">100 million paid subscribers</a> to the service. In comparison, Apple Music has approximately <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8487726/apple-music-56-million-users-report\">56 million paid subscribers worldwide</a>.</p> <p>There was a period when iTunes looked like it could still be the future. In December 2013, it scored a huge success when Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s eponymous fifth album sold 828,773 copies on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/itunes\">iTunes</a> Store in the first few days of its surprise release. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to release my music the way I\u2019ve done it,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\">Beyonc\u00e9</a> said in a statement. \u201cI am bored with that. I feel like I am able to speak directly to my fans.\u201d</p> <p>But two years later the singer and a long list of other pop stars \u2013 including Madonna and Kanye West \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/31/jay-z-spotify-music-streaming-relaunch-tidal-support-artist\">would help to launch Tidal</a>, her husband Jay Z\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/05/tidal-10-things-you-need-to-know-jay-z-madonna-music-streaming\">Spotify and iTunes competitor</a>.

      "bodyText": "It was once heralded as a possible saviour of the music industry in the digital age, famously annoyed fans by forcing a U2 album on them, and its 20,699-word terms and conditions have even inspired a graphic novel, but now Apple is to replace its iTunes download service. According to a report by Bloomberg, the tech company will announce that three separate apps for music, TV and podcasts will supersede iTunes, as Apple seeks to reposition itself as an entertainment service rather than a hardware company powered by products such as the iPhone. The move is expected to be part of the keynote address by the Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, at the company\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California, which starts on Monday and will focus on software updates and Apple\u2019s new approach to apps. Launched on 9 January 2001, iTunes was Steve Jobs\u2019s then revolutionary platform for music storage, where users could rip their CDs into digital form. In 2003 the iTunes Store added the ability to buy tracks legally rather than using popular peer-to-peer file sharing sites such as Napster, which had arrived in 1999. \u201cThe attraction of Napster was not just that it was free, but more importantly, it gave people a way to connect with pretty much any piece of music,\u201d the former Warner Music vice-president Paul Vidich told Rolling Stone in 2013. \u201cWhat Steve was doing with iTunes was to replicate that type of experience \u2013 a vast catalogue, available on a singles basis, with a convenient interface. It had to be easier than Napster.\u201d Although other companies \u2013 including Microsoft and Sony \u2013 had considered launching music stores, they \u201cweren\u2019t companies that had demonstrated Apple\u2019s sophistication with regard to software\u201d, according to Vidich. \u201cIt really took a company that was able to bridge those two things and come up with an attractive consumer product.\u201d But in the ephemeral world of tech, iTunes \u2013 and its use of downloads \u2013 quickly became old-fashioned as companies including Spotify introduced successful streaming models as \u201cmusic\u2019s most radically democratic era\u201d began. Launching in 2008, Spotify offered unlimited ad-free access to its catalogue of music for a fee (now \u00a39.99 a month for its premium service). The company claims to have 217 million users worldwide with 100 million paid subscribers to the service. In comparison, Apple Music has approximately 56 million paid subscribers worldwide. There was a period when iTunes looked like it could still be the future. In December 2013, it scored a huge success when Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s eponymous fifth album sold 828,773 copies on the iTunes Store in the first few days of its surprise release. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to release my music the way I\u2019ve done it,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 said in a statement. \u201cI am bored with that. I feel like I am able to speak directly to my fans.\u201d But two years later the singer and a long list of other pop stars \u2013 including Madonna and Kanye West \u2013 would help to launch Tidal, her husband Jay Z\u2019s Spotify and iTunes competitor. Even though Tidal has since struggled, the streaming model has proved to be the most robust digital music service as downloads have declined. In December 2016, physical sales \u2013 bolstered by a revival in vinyl \u2013 overtook digital downloads with \u00a32.4m spent in one week compared with the \u00a32.1m made from digital music purchases. In 2014, a marketing stunt, in which U2\u2019s album Songs of Innocence was automatically added to 500 million users\u2019 iTunes accounts, backfired when customers complained at not having a choice over whether it was included on their device. U2\u2019s lead singer, Bono, apologised a month later. The writing seemed to be on the wall for iTunes when the tech company launched Apple Music in 2015, with rumours circulating that iTunes would not exist beyond 2020. A streaming service in a similar mould to Spotify, Apple Music signalled a move away from a download model, and arrived at the same time as the company\u2019s radio service, which featured regular shows from DJs such as Zane Lowe, Drake and the Louis Vuitton menswear artistic director Virgil Abloh, as well as artists including Nicki Minaj and Elton John. Apple did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.",

      "body": "<p>On Thursday, voters in Peterborough will take part in one of the most intriguing parliamentary byelections in recent memory. The constituency saw a knife-edge duel between Labour and the Conservatives at the 2017 general election and at last month\u2019s European poll, 38% of voters in the city backed the Brexit party. A first seat in the House of Commons for Nigel Farage\u2019s party is a distinct possibility. If that happens, it will send tremors through middle England, of which Peterborough is typical in many ways, not just geographically.</p> \n<p>Economically, Peterborough performs averagely amid struggles with productivity. Wages are stagnant and it has been reshaped by migration, with foreigners arriving to work in the surrounding farmlands and distribution depots, contributing to a decade as the UK\u2019s fastest growing city between 2001 and 2011.</p> \n<p>But many Peterborians feel life is getting worse; nothing catastrophic, but a noticeable unravelling. Stagnation of living standards and diminishing prospects, as much as Brexit and migration, are likely to shape how they vote.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e840bcb1-ba9d-49d4-a86b-bd41d28f5fe1\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>With one of the country\u2019s fastest rising city populations, at almost 200,000, Peterborough ranks slightly below the UK average on many social and economic measures. Median annual pay of \u00a327,238 is more than \u00a32,000 lower than the national average, unemployment is 1.4 percentage points higher at 5.7% and the proportion of 16- to 64-year-olds with no qualifications is 22% greater. Life expectancy is lower and rates of premature death from cardiovascular disease are higher.<br></p>\n    <p>Skills are a problem. Only 12% of the city\u2019s educational institutions were ranked as outstanding, compared with 20% across England, and the council has cut spending on children\u2019s and young people\u2019s services over the last five years by 55%. The council\u2019s overall budget has fallen 14% in actual terms over that time as central government funding shrank from \u00a355m in 2013-14 to \u00a310m in 2019-20. Productivity is lower than the rest of the UK and more of its working age people have no formal qualifications than the national average.</p>\n    <p>In the last 15 years there has been considerable migration from eastern Europe, including the Baltic states, joining longer established British Asian groups that make up almost 12% of the population, above the average of almost 8% for England. The extent of eastern European immigration is reflected in the nearly 11% of the population that identified as \u201cother white\u201d in the 2011 census, compared with 4.6% for England.</p>\n    <p>Since the May 2019 local elections, the council has been in no overall control, but is led by the Conservatives, which retain the most seats. The last parliamentary election in 2017 was won by Labour with 48.1% of the vote, beating the incumbent Conservatives by just 607 votes. The Lib Dems were on 3.3% and the Greens on 1.8%. Ukip did not put up a candidate.<br></p>\n    <p><b>Robert Booth</b></p>\n    <p><i>Sources: Resolution Foundation, Opportunity Peterborough, Peterborough City Council</i></p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>One way to understand the changes people here have lived through is to visit 124 Eyrescroft, a three-bedroom, one box room, ex-council house on the Bretton estate. The housing scheme was built in the 1970s during a wave of optimism, after Peterborough was designated to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/may/15/sterile-or-stirring-britains-love-hate-relationship-with-new-towns\">a new town</a> by Harold Wilson\u2019s government. The vision was to build four leafy townships around the cathedral city\u2019s historic centre.</p> \n<p>The first tenants of 124 Eyrescroft were the Hobbs family with their five children \u2013 Keith, Joanne, Debbie, Martin and Steven. When they arrived in 1975 from south London they found a local pub, numerous play areas and that everyone knew their neighbours.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere was Irish Anne, Difna next door, Sylvie in 117,\u201d Keith Hobbs, now 49, told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>Their father had a steady job in the Freemans catalogue warehouse. \u201cWe\u2019d leave our bikes outside the door and the door unlocked, but now you can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used to have a guy picking up the litter and weeding. If there was an issue with the paths, the council would come out. The state of the paths now is unbelievable. It\u2019s changed completely, and has gone downhill\u201d.</p> \n<p>Today, 124 Eyrescroft\u2019s past as a proud family home is just a memory. It has been subdivided into five rooms, all let out to different tenants. It is partially clad in rotten wooden panels with weeds erupting from its front path.</p> \n<p>One of the owners, collecting rents of around \u00a3280 a month per room \u2013 which adds up to well over the rental price of a three-bed house \u2013 is Mark Homer. He and Rob Moore are prominent local buy-to-let landlords, who together have built up a portfolio of some 500 properties in Bretton and across Peterborough since around 2005. 124 Eyrescroft, (which Homer owns with another man) was bought for \u00a3107,000 in 2007, which suggests it has long since paid itself off. (Homer disputes this suggestion). Homer, 39, drives a bright white Porsche 911 Carrera S and lives in a listed farmhouse near affluent Stamford. Moore boasts of driving Ferraris and flying helicopters. The pair set up a business teaching others how to do the same, selling courses named Buy-to-Let Boom and No Money Down.</p> \n<p>When Homer tries to show the Guardian the house he can\u2019t find it, admitting: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been here for 10 years.\u201d</p> \n<p>During the recession, he and Moore bought homes close to repossession and then rented them back to the original owners who had now moved on to housing benefit. They would aim to buy homes in the worst, most distressed condition and fix them up, Homer said. One had been lived in by a known paedophile and nobody wanted it. They offered tenants a discount to stay there. Some properties were burned out. But a three-bedroom house worth \u00a380,000 would rent for \u00a3500, a healthy 7% yield after the recession hit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76f8deaf6ba832a59739a7dff9f7674902a04ac0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76f8deaf6ba832a59739a7dff9f7674902a04ac0/0_412_5596_3358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Property developer Mark Homer at his office in Peterborough.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Property developer Mark Homer at his office in Peterborough.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Pope/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Dozens of people have lived in 124 Eyrescroft in recent years, records show. Yves Okofo, a care worker who arrived from France three years ago, lives there now. He works up to 60 hours a week and has little to do with his neighbours. \u201cWe don\u2019t socialise much,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get in and you get out.\u201d</p> \n<p>The leaders of Peterborough city council are concerned about the impact private landlords have had on social cohesion.</p> \n<p>\u201cBuy to rent hasn\u2019t helped build community,\u201d said John Holdich, the Conservative leader. \u201cPeople are in six months and are gone. They don\u2019t play a part in the community.\u201d</p> \n<p>His colleague, Cllr Irene Walsh, represents a ward on the Orton estate, built at the same time as Bretton, where Homer and Moore own more houses. She said they have tried staging community meals to bring people together, but it didn\u2019t work. Now they are trying community litter-picking, a solution that in itself reflects the deep cuts to the council\u2019s funding since 2010. Central government funding fell from \u00a381m to \u00a310m today and the council\u2019s total budget for 2019/20 is \u00a325m lower than the \u00a3176m available in 2013/14.</p> \n<p>Thousands of new homes have been built in Peterborough in a new estate called the Hamptons, but many are too expensive for people with the most basic needs. Some have been bought up by buy-to-let landlords, including at least one based in Singapore. Rents have been going up even if wages haven\u2019t, tenants report. Since 2017, the number of households across Peterborough presenting themselves to the council as homeless has more than doubled to 2,300.</p> \n<p>Outside the food bank at the Salvation Army, Jade Meins, 31, a mother of two collecting a food parcel, said the father of her five-year-old daughter has been homeless for five months since they split up. He had spent spells sleeping rough. She said she has been looking for work for two years and faced a six-month delay to get on to universal credit. She is now paying interest charges on an advance she received. She grumbles about foreign arrivals getting jobs that local people want. Many people dismiss that argument, saying the incomers work hard, are reliable and do work others won\u2019t. But people do feel alienated by other impacts of migration. Rita Donavan, 70, a nurse in Peterborough for 52 years now volunteering at the food bank, said: \u201cI came here to do my training, but I wouldn\u2019t come here today.\u201d</p> \n<p>She gave the example of communication problems, with so many languages being spoken. \u201cWhat you could treat in half an hour in A&amp;E is taking you four times as long once you get through to Language Line [a translation service].

      "body": "<p>It was just before Christmas in 2013 when Brian Henderson, a retired police officer from Washington, Tyne and Wear, went to have a cyst removed from his neck only to be told it was cancer and that there was no guarantee, as there never is with that cruel, indiscriminate disease, that he would see it off.</p> \n<p>At first he did not want to tell his son, Jordan, because he was worried about how it might affect the performances of a player, then 23, who was already finding it hard enough to prove he was worthy of succeeding Steven Gerrard at Liverpool. Then, when father and son finally had that dreadful, life\u2011changing conversation, the 59-year-old decided it would be better for Jordan not to see him while he was undergoing treatment.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2019/jun/02/liverpool-parade-champions-league-trophy-in-pictures\">Liverpool bring home Champions League trophy \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is brutal, radiotherapy. \u201cThe worst thing I\u2019ve ever had in my life,\u201d Brian says. He reckons he lost four stone during the long, gruelling process to shrivel the carcinoma in his throat. A tumour had to be cut out of his tongue, leaving a hole the size of a 50p piece, and he needed surgery to remove the lymph nodes from both sides of his neck.</p> \n<p>Brian had once played on the wing for the England police team but in the summer of 2014 he was too unwell to catch a flight to Brazil to watch his son play in the World Cup for England.</p> \n<p>All of which might offer a little extra context if you have seen that wonderful clip of father and son meeting by the side of the pitch in the Estadio Metropolitano, an hour or so after Jordan had lifted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/01/tottenham-liverpool-champions-league-final-match-report\" title=\"\">the European Cup on Liverpool\u2019s behalf</a>, and holding one another in an embrace that was so tight, so loving, so beautifully spontaneous, it felt as if we were witnessing a moment that might surpass anything we had seen during the final itself.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7954817a-e919-4942-a437-8d18bf680763\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HAKCT7vPrhg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It was difficult to know how long they were clamped together. It was quite some time, though, before they prised themselves apart. And, again, it would have needed a flint heart not to be moved by the power of that father-son bond when a television reporter from Optus Sport stopped Brian \u2013 spectacles, pink shirt, grey hair \u2013 to ask if it was even possible to sum up his emotions.</p> \n<p>He started by telling the story of taking a 12-year-old Jordan to Old Trafford to see the 2003 Champions League final between Juventus and Milan. Jordan, he said, had been so mesmerised by the size of the occasion, the full stands, the colour, the noise, he had told his father on the journey home he would play in such a game one day.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jun/02/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-promise-nearly-man-champions-league-final\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp fulfils Liverpool promise to shed nearly-man tag in Madrid | Andy Hunter</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>How did it feel, Brian was asked, at that precise moment when his son was about to lift the trophy and the entire football world was watching? \u201cIt\u2019s just very emotional,\u201d he said, with that lovely north-east accent. \u201cThe tears come. You start shaking. You grab your wife, you grab your daughter-in-law, you grab anybody that\u2019s around you \u2026 just so, so happy.\u201d</p> \n<p>By this stage the stands were virtually empty and the crowds were on their way back to the beer\u2011soaked pavements of central Madrid where, if you had seen how many Liverpudlians were shoehorned into Spain\u2019s capital, it is fair to say the city could forget about getting too much sleep.</p> \n<p>Those supporters probably did not realise that, if they had hung around a bit longer inside the stadium, they would have seen some of the night\u2019s more tender moments. The scene, for example, when a couple of Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s mates somehow found their way on to the pitch to have a kickabout with one of the red-shirted heroes. They started off with some keepie\u2011ups. Then Alexander\u2011Arnold was generous enough to play one of his defence-splitting passes and suddenly one of his friends was running through the middle, bearing down on goal with the chance to stick the ball into the net. Never mind the fact it was past midnight and the beaten Tottenham players had already started boarding their coach outside.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a01464202dcbdefa193773390cda7c9d118cf70d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a01464202dcbdefa193773390cda7c9d118cf70d/0_0_2700_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Liverpool forward Rhian Brewster takes a selfie with Trent Alexander-Arnold after the final whistle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Liverpool forward Rhian Brewster takes a selfie with Trent Alexander-Arnold after the final whistle.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Stephen/ProSports/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Usually the team who win this trophy would disappear into the tunnel for their champagne and dressing-room selfies. Here, most of them stayed on the pitch because that was the easiest place for their families to locate them. Toddlers wearing Liverpool shirts with their dad\u2019s names emblazoned across the back frolicked in the silver tickertape. Alisson\u2019s wife, Natalia, could not be there because she was expecting their second child, so Liverpool\u2019s goalkeeper Face-timed her to show the medal he had just won.</p> \n<p>The only minor problem came when Dejan Lovren took a pair of scissors to the goal where Divock Origi had swivelled on his left foot to score a goal described by one commentator as his own version of that Gary Lineker, Italia 90, finish.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2019/jun/02/champions-league-final-2019-tottenham-0-2-liverpool-in-pictures\">Champions League final 2019: Tottenham 0-2 Liverpool \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Lovren tried to cut away a piece of the netting to take away as a souvenir. At which point a clutch of worried-looking men in suits \u2013 Uefa officials, no doubt \u2013 pointed out they could not be absolutely certain this was permitted. Virgil van Dijk fancied a bit of that net, too, and was not impressed at all by their jobsworthiness. It did not make any difference. No player had found a way past Van Dijk all season, but this was one battle he was not going to win.</p> \n<p>No matter. Kevin Keegan, one of the heroes of the 1977 final, always used to say that when Liverpool brought back European trophies to Merseyside it made him feel as though they were in Ancient Rome, like warriors returning from a bloody conquest to show off all the gold and loot they had plundered. J\u00fcrgen Klopp and his players will find out for themselves when their open-top bus sets off from Allerton Maze into the city centre.</p> \n<p>It was estimated there would be 50,000 Liverpool fans in Madrid but it turned out there might have been twice that \u2013 outnumbering their Spurs counterparts in such a way it was possible to wander along Gran Via or any of the main thoroughfares in Madrid and forget there were two English clubs in the final.</p> \n<p>That is not intended to belittle Spurs, who have a 62,000-capacity stadium now and are regarded by some as possessing the best away support of all the London clubs. Yet the past few days have served as a reminder about the sheer size of Liverpool, their right to be considered one of the giants of the sport and \u2013 judging by the number of Asian, American and Australian accents (and that is just the As) \u2013 their global reach in this internet age.</p> \n<p>There are only Real Madrid, with 13, and Milan, on seven, who have won the European Cup more times than Liverpool\u2019s six and Klopp was right when he said his players have to soak in these moments \u2013 cherish them, remember them, recognise this kind of euphoria does not come along too often.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/02/mo-salah-liverpool-spurs-champions-league\">Mo Salah says photo of Kyiv pain inspired him to score against Spurs</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It would be easy to write that Liverpool must use this victory as the platform to find a way past Manchester City next season and to dwell on the fact they still have the aching disappointment of going 29 years without winning the English championship.</p> \n<p>Right now, though, is this the moment for think\u2011pieces about how a team who have won the European Cup, reached consecutive finals and accumulated 97 points in the league, setting all sorts of club records in the process, can do any better? They have not done too badly.</p> \n<p>Next season, Klopp promised, he could guarantee another epic battle with City. But first he wanted to celebrate and drink and sing, including his own version of Salt\u2011N\u2011Pepa\u2019s Let\u2019s Talk About Sex (Klopp making it \u201csix\u201d) during one interview.</p> \n<p>Enjoy it now, he said, because you never know what the future can bring.

      "bodyText": "It was just before Christmas in 2013 when Brian Henderson, a retired police officer from Washington, Tyne and Wear, went to have a cyst removed from his neck only to be told it was cancer and that there was no guarantee, as there never is with that cruel, indiscriminate disease, that he would see it off. At first he did not want to tell his son, Jordan, because he was worried about how it might affect the performances of a player, then 23, who was already finding it hard enough to prove he was worthy of succeeding Steven Gerrard at Liverpool. Then, when father and son finally had that dreadful, life\u2011changing conversation, the 59-year-old decided it would be better for Jordan not to see him while he was undergoing treatment. It is brutal, radiotherapy. \u201cThe worst thing I\u2019ve ever had in my life,\u201d Brian says. He reckons he lost four stone during the long, gruelling process to shrivel the carcinoma in his throat. A tumour had to be cut out of his tongue, leaving a hole the size of a 50p piece, and he needed surgery to remove the lymph nodes from both sides of his neck. Brian had once played on the wing for the England police team but in the summer of 2014 he was too unwell to catch a flight to Brazil to watch his son play in the World Cup for England. All of which might offer a little extra context if you have seen that wonderful clip of father and son meeting by the side of the pitch in the Estadio Metropolitano, an hour or so after Jordan had lifted the European Cup on Liverpool\u2019s behalf, and holding one another in an embrace that was so tight, so loving, so beautifully spontaneous, it felt as if we were witnessing a moment that might surpass anything we had seen during the final itself. It was difficult to know how long they were clamped together. It was quite some time, though, before they prised themselves apart. And, again, it would have needed a flint heart not to be moved by the power of that father-son bond when a television reporter from Optus Sport stopped Brian \u2013 spectacles, pink shirt, grey hair \u2013 to ask if it was even possible to sum up his emotions. He started by telling the story of taking a 12-year-old Jordan to Old Trafford to see the 2003 Champions League final between Juventus and Milan. Jordan, he said, had been so mesmerised by the size of the occasion, the full stands, the colour, the noise, he had told his father on the journey home he would play in such a game one day. How did it feel, Brian was asked, at that precise moment when his son was about to lift the trophy and the entire football world was watching? \u201cIt\u2019s just very emotional,\u201d he said, with that lovely north-east accent. \u201cThe tears come. You start shaking. You grab your wife, you grab your daughter-in-law, you grab anybody that\u2019s around you \u2026 just so, so happy.\u201d By this stage the stands were virtually empty and the crowds were on their way back to the beer\u2011soaked pavements of central Madrid where, if you had seen how many Liverpudlians were shoehorned into Spain\u2019s capital, it is fair to say the city could forget about getting too much sleep. Those supporters probably did not realise that, if they had hung around a bit longer inside the stadium, they would have seen some of the night\u2019s more tender moments. The scene, for example, when a couple of Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s mates somehow found their way on to the pitch to have a kickabout with one of the red-shirted heroes. They started off with some keepie\u2011ups. Then Alexander\u2011Arnold was generous enough to play one of his defence-splitting passes and suddenly one of his friends was running through the middle, bearing down on goal with the chance to stick the ball into the net. Never mind the fact it was past midnight and the beaten Tottenham players had already started boarding their coach outside. Usually the team who win this trophy would disappear into the tunnel for their champagne and dressing-room selfies. Here, most of them stayed on the pitch because that was the easiest place for their families to locate them. Toddlers wearing Liverpool shirts with their dad\u2019s names emblazoned across the back frolicked in the silver tickertape. Alisson\u2019s wife, Natalia, could not be there because she was expecting their second child, so Liverpool\u2019s goalkeeper Face-timed her to show the medal he had just won. The only minor problem came when Dejan Lovren took a pair of scissors to the goal where Divock Origi had swivelled on his left foot to score a goal described by one commentator as his own version of that Gary Lineker, Italia 90, finish. Lovren tried to cut away a piece of the netting to take away as a souvenir. At which point a clutch of worried-looking men in suits \u2013 Uefa officials, no doubt \u2013 pointed out they could not be absolutely certain this was permitted. Virgil van Dijk fancied a bit of that net, too, and was not impressed at all by their jobsworthiness. It did not make any difference. No player had found a way past Van Dijk all season, but this was one battle he was not going to win. No matter. Kevin Keegan, one of the heroes of the 1977 final, always used to say that when Liverpool brought back European trophies to Merseyside it made him feel as though they were in Ancient Rome, like warriors returning from a bloody conquest to show off all the gold and loot they had plundered. J\u00fcrgen Klopp and his players will find out for themselves when their open-top bus sets off from Allerton Maze into the city centre. It was estimated there would be 50,000 Liverpool fans in Madrid but it turned out there might have been twice that \u2013 outnumbering their Spurs counterparts in such a way it was possible to wander along Gran Via or any of the main thoroughfares in Madrid and forget there were two English clubs in the final. That is not intended to belittle Spurs, who have a 62,000-capacity stadium now and are regarded by some as possessing the best away support of all the London clubs. Yet the past few days have served as a reminder about the sheer size of Liverpool, their right to be considered one of the giants of the sport and \u2013 judging by the number of Asian, American and Australian accents (and that is just the As) \u2013 their global reach in this internet age. There are only Real Madrid, with 13, and Milan, on seven, who have won the European Cup more times than Liverpool\u2019s six and Klopp was right when he said his players have to soak in these moments \u2013 cherish them, remember them, recognise this kind of euphoria does not come along too often. It would be easy to write that Liverpool must use this victory as the platform to find a way past Manchester City next season and to dwell on the fact they still have the aching disappointment of going 29 years without winning the English championship. Right now, though, is this the moment for think\u2011pieces about how a team who have won the European Cup, reached consecutive finals and accumulated 97 points in the league, setting all sorts of club records in the process, can do any better? They have not done too badly. Next season, Klopp promised, he could guarantee another epic battle with City. But first he wanted to celebrate and drink and sing, including his own version of Salt\u2011N\u2011Pepa\u2019s Let\u2019s Talk About Sex (Klopp making it \u201csix\u201d) during one interview. Enjoy it now, he said, because you never know what the future can bring. Something Brian Henderson, one of the proudest dads you will ever see, knows very well.",

      "body": "<p>Murray Gell-Mann, who has died aged 89, was the leading figure in the study of elementary particle physics in the middle years of the 20th century. His work transformed the way that physicists conceive matter at the smallest length scales.</p> <p>In 1950 the world of atomic and nuclear physics was relatively straightforward: atoms consisted of positively charged nuclei formed of protons and neutrons, with negatively charged electrons orbiting around them like planets round the sun, held together by photons, the quanta of quantum electrodynamics (QED). By 1975 the subject had changed beyond recognition, largely due to Murray\u2019s work. Protons and neutrons were no longer elementary particles: instead they themselves were composite structures formed of three quarks held together by gluons, the quanta of quantum chromodynamics (QCD).</p> <p>In 1964 Murray had introduced quarks as the basic building blocks of matter and five years later he received the <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1969/summary/\" title=\"\">Nobel prize in physics</a> for the classification of elementary particles and their interactions.</p> <p>The son of Pauline (nee Reichstein) and Arthur Gell-Mann, Murray was born in New York. His father had arrived from Czernowitz in Austria (now in Ukraine) 15 years earlier and had opened a language school in lower Manhattan. The school failed and the family were forced repeatedly to move, although Arthur eventually managed to find a job as a guard in a bank. Arthur, however, was fluent in several languages and was a self-taught mathematician.</p> <p>It was soon clear that Murray was a child prodigy. At seven, he won a spelling bee set by a local radio station open to children under 12. When he was eight <a href=\"https://www.cgps.org/\" title=\"\">Columbia Grammar</a>, a private school on the Upper West Side, gave him a full scholarship and at 14 he won a scholarship to Yale University. His father insisted that he study a subject that would be financially rewarding so suggested engineering. Murray refused and they compromised on physics. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree at 18, moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and completed his doctoral dissertation two years later.</p> <p>In 1951 he moved on to a post-doctoral position at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton with <a href=\"https://www.atomicheritage.org/profile/j-robert-oppenheimer\" title=\"\">Robert Oppenheimer</a>, and a year later to the University of Chicago with <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1938/fermi/biographical/\" title=\"\">Enrico Fermi</a>. During this period he studied the new particles that were being produced at particle accelerators and in cosmic rays. The new particles seemed to be produced in pairs in collisions of normal particles: if a lambda particle was seen then so was a K-meson or kaon. But then the lambda decayed into normal particles. So did the kaon.</p> <p>Murray realised that the particles were being produced through the strong nuclear interaction but then decayed through a much weaker interaction. He concluded that there must be a new quantum number which he called \u201cstrangeness\u201d to distinguish the normal particles from the new particles and that strangeness was conserved in strong interactions but not in weak interactions. So the proton and neutron were normal, with zero strangeness, while the lambda had strangeness of minus one unit and the kaon had strangeness of one unit.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBmUmLTGj1Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NBmUmLTGj1Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Murray Gell-Mann talking about quarks, complexity and the environment</figcaption> </figure>   <p>He moved to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1955, and the following year became their youngest full professor. He was soon appointed as professor of theoretical physics. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/feynman\" title=\"\">Richard Feynman</a> was also professor of theoretical physics, and the two men became both friends and rivals. Their styles were very different: Feynman was flamboyant, tieless, in shirtsleeves, and with a strong Brooklyn accent; Murray was always impeccably dressed and careful to enunciate every word according to received pronunciation, whether in English, French, German or Spanish.</p> <p>In 1955 Murray married Margaret Dow, an English archaeologist who had been working at the Institute in Princeton. She was distinguished in her own right, having participated in 1952 in a dig at Mycenae where she had found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/02/riddle-labyrinth-margalit-fox-review\" title=\"\">Linear B</a> tablets.</p> <p>Feynman and Murray were both working on weak interactions, responsible for the radioactive decay of both particles and nuclei. They found that these decays could be understood in terms of weak currents, just as electromagnetism required an electromagnetic current. The crucial difference was that parity (left-right symmetry) was violated in the weak current, whereas it was conserved in the electromagnetic.</p> <p>After a fruitful year as a visiting fellow in Paris, in the summer of 1960 Murray returned to Caltech, where I became one of his doctoral students. He still wanted to find a way of including all the strongly interacting particles in the same scheme, whether they were normal particles like the proton or strange particles. He encountered Richard Block, a mathematician at Caltech, who was an expert in the branch of mathematics called Lie group theory, and discovered that some of the physics problems he was considering involved examples of these groups: ie, the symmetry that physicists called isotopic spin that applied to nuclear forces was called the special unitary group in two dimensions SU(2) by mathematicians.</p> <p>Murray discovered that the corresponding Lie group in three dimensions SU(3) included both isotopic spin and a quantum number that could well be strangeness.</p> <p>The neutron and proton in the SU(3) scheme then had to be accompanied by six strange particles, and they were. But for the particles called mesons, the three normal pions or pi-mesons should have been accompanied by four strange kaons, and they were, but additionally by a normal meson to make up the eighth \u2013 however, this eighth was not known. Murray promptly predicted it, and it was found within 12 months. He playfully named this algebraic scheme where particles came in groups of eight the \u201ceightfold way\u201d, after the eightfold way of traditional Buddhism.</p> <p>But why three dimensions? The mathematics suggested that the basic entity involved three states, not eight. So in 1964 Murray suggested that the elementary particles were not the proton and neutron, but these three entities, which he named quarks after a quote from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/apr/28/finnegans-wake-james-joyce-modern-interpretations\" title=\"\">Finnegan</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/apr/28/finnegans-wake-james-joyce-modern-interpretations\" title=\"\">s Wake</a>, \u201cThree quarks for Muster Mark\u201d. The difficulty with quarks was that they had to be fractionally charged, and no such objects had ever been seen.</p> <p>As the 1960s progressed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/jan/24/obituaries.highereducation\" title=\"\">Richard Dalitz</a> and his co-workers at Oxford University showed that the particle spectrum that had been seen ex- perimentally was consistent with the quark model. Then experiments at much higher energies at Stanford in California showed that the scatter- ing of electrons from protons and neutrons was explained if the protons/neutrons consisted of pointlike quarks.</p> <p>Why, however, were quarks not directly observable? And what held them together to form protons, neutrons and the other particles? These were the questions that Murray tried to understand in the early 70s. He was convinced that an invariance property of QED called gauge invariance could be based more generally on Lie groups and was the key to any understanding. This led to a theory similar to QED but where the quarks possessed another much stronger \u201ccolour\u201d charge as well as their electric charge.</p> <p>Murray and his collaborator Harald Fritzsch were leaders in developing what Murray called quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is now accepted by physicists as being part of the standard model of elementary particle physics, which applies to all particle interactions other than gravity.</p> <p>In 1980, just after Murray had turned 50, Margaret was diagnosed with cancer, and she died the following year. He became depressed: he had already won the Nobel prize and most other prizes and honours in physics, so he now turned to new fields to conquer.</p> <p>From his childhood onwards he had been interested in birds, nature and sustainability. He had long wanted to apply the mathematical principles of theoretical physics to other fields, especially those that dealt with biological phenomena.</p> <p>He was fascinated by language and its origins. Murray thought that future scientific development would involve the study of really complex phenomena: physics was not simple, but the origins of language or cognitive development were of a different order of complexity. With his wealth of contacts, he set about obtaining funds for the Santa Fe Institute, situated in the hills overlooking Santa Fe, which would study such problems. He left Caltech for the Santa Fe Institute in 1993 and settled in the city.</p> <p>Murray always had wide interests. At the beginning of the 60s, with some of his physicist colleagues, he founded the Jason division of the <a href=\"https://www.ida.org/\" title=\"\">Institute for Defense Analysis</a>, which provided advice to the US military. He was chair of a Jason working group on anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defence in 1961 which realised that the installation of an ABM system reduced strategic stability since it made a pre-emptive nuclear strike by an opponent more likely.</p> <p>He reported those conclusions to a <a href=\"https://pugwash.org/\" title=\"\">Pugwash</a> conference in India in 1964 to be greeted with ridicule by Soviet representatives at the conference.

      "bodyText": "Murray Gell-Mann, who has died aged 89, was the leading figure in the study of elementary particle physics in the middle years of the 20th century. His work transformed the way that physicists conceive matter at the smallest length scales. In 1950 the world of atomic and nuclear physics was relatively straightforward: atoms consisted of positively charged nuclei formed of protons and neutrons, with negatively charged electrons orbiting around them like planets round the sun, held together by photons, the quanta of quantum electrodynamics (QED). By 1975 the subject had changed beyond recognition, largely due to Murray\u2019s work. Protons and neutrons were no longer elementary particles: instead they themselves were composite structures formed of three quarks held together by gluons, the quanta of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In 1964 Murray had introduced quarks as the basic building blocks of matter and five years later he received the Nobel prize in physics for the classification of elementary particles and their interactions. The son of Pauline (nee Reichstein) and Arthur Gell-Mann, Murray was born in New York. His father had arrived from Czernowitz in Austria (now in Ukraine) 15 years earlier and had opened a language school in lower Manhattan. The school failed and the family were forced repeatedly to move, although Arthur eventually managed to find a job as a guard in a bank. Arthur, however, was fluent in several languages and was a self-taught mathematician. It was soon clear that Murray was a child prodigy. At seven, he won a spelling bee set by a local radio station open to children under 12. When he was eight Columbia Grammar, a private school on the Upper West Side, gave him a full scholarship and at 14 he won a scholarship to Yale University. His father insisted that he study a subject that would be financially rewarding so suggested engineering. Murray refused and they compromised on physics. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree at 18, moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and completed his doctoral dissertation two years later. In 1951 he moved on to a post-doctoral position at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton with Robert Oppenheimer, and a year later to the University of Chicago with Enrico Fermi. During this period he studied the new particles that were being produced at particle accelerators and in cosmic rays. The new particles seemed to be produced in pairs in collisions of normal particles: if a lambda particle was seen then so was a K-meson or kaon. But then the lambda decayed into normal particles. So did the kaon. Murray realised that the particles were being produced through the strong nuclear interaction but then decayed through a much weaker interaction. He concluded that there must be a new quantum number which he called \u201cstrangeness\u201d to distinguish the normal particles from the new particles and that strangeness was conserved in strong interactions but not in weak interactions. So the proton and neutron were normal, with zero strangeness, while the lambda had strangeness of minus one unit and the kaon had strangeness of one unit. He moved to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1955, and the following year became their youngest full professor. He was soon appointed as professor of theoretical physics. Richard Feynman was also professor of theoretical physics, and the two men became both friends and rivals. Their styles were very different: Feynman was flamboyant, tieless, in shirtsleeves, and with a strong Brooklyn accent; Murray was always impeccably dressed and careful to enunciate every word according to received pronunciation, whether in English, French, German or Spanish. In 1955 Murray married Margaret Dow, an English archaeologist who had been working at the Institute in Princeton. She was distinguished in her own right, having participated in 1952 in a dig at Mycenae where she had found Linear B tablets. Feynman and Murray were both working on weak interactions, responsible for the radioactive decay of both particles and nuclei. They found that these decays could be understood in terms of weak currents, just as electromagnetism required an electromagnetic current. The crucial difference was that parity (left-right symmetry) was violated in the weak current, whereas it was conserved in the electromagnetic. After a fruitful year as a visiting fellow in Paris, in the summer of 1960 Murray returned to Caltech, where I became one of his doctoral students. He still wanted to find a way of including all the strongly interacting particles in the same scheme, whether they were normal particles like the proton or strange particles. He encountered Richard Block, a mathematician at Caltech, who was an expert in the branch of mathematics called Lie group theory, and discovered that some of the physics problems he was considering involved examples of these groups: ie, the symmetry that physicists called isotopic spin that applied to nuclear forces was called the special unitary group in two dimensions SU(2) by mathematicians. Murray discovered that the corresponding Lie group in three dimensions SU(3) included both isotopic spin and a quantum number that could well be strangeness. The neutron and proton in the SU(3) scheme then had to be accompanied by six strange particles, and they were. But for the particles called mesons, the three normal pions or pi-mesons should have been accompanied by four strange kaons, and they were, but additionally by a normal meson to make up the eighth \u2013 however, this eighth was not known. Murray promptly predicted it, and it was found within 12 months. He playfully named this algebraic scheme where particles came in groups of eight the \u201ceightfold way\u201d, after the eightfold way of traditional Buddhism. But why three dimensions? The mathematics suggested that the basic entity involved three states, not eight. So in 1964 Murray suggested that the elementary particles were not the proton and neutron, but these three entities, which he named quarks after a quote from Finnegans Wake, \u201cThree quarks for Muster Mark\u201d. The difficulty with quarks was that they had to be fractionally charged, and no such objects had ever been seen. As the 1960s progressed Richard Dalitz and his co-workers at Oxford University showed that the particle spectrum that had been seen ex- perimentally was consistent with the quark model. Then experiments at much higher energies at Stanford in California showed that the scatter- ing of electrons from protons and neutrons was explained if the protons/neutrons consisted of pointlike quarks. Why, however, were quarks not directly observable? And what held them together to form protons, neutrons and the other particles? These were the questions that Murray tried to understand in the early 70s. He was convinced that an invariance property of QED called gauge invariance could be based more generally on Lie groups and was the key to any understanding. This led to a theory similar to QED but where the quarks possessed another much stronger \u201ccolour\u201d charge as well as their electric charge. Murray and his collaborator Harald Fritzsch were leaders in developing what Murray called quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is now accepted by physicists as being part of the standard model of elementary particle physics, which applies to all particle interactions other than gravity. In 1980, just after Murray had turned 50, Margaret was diagnosed with cancer, and she died the following year. He became depressed: he had already won the Nobel prize and most other prizes and honours in physics, so he now turned to new fields to conquer. From his childhood onwards he had been interested in birds, nature and sustainability. He had long wanted to apply the mathematical principles of theoretical physics to other fields, especially those that dealt with biological phenomena. He was fascinated by language and its origins. Murray thought that future scientific development would involve the study of really complex phenomena: physics was not simple, but the origins of language or cognitive development were of a different order of complexity. With his wealth of contacts, he set about obtaining funds for the Santa Fe Institute, situated in the hills overlooking Santa Fe, which would study such problems. He left Caltech for the Santa Fe Institute in 1993 and settled in the city. Murray always had wide interests. At the beginning of the 60s, with some of his physicist colleagues, he founded the Jason division of the Institute for Defense Analysis, which provided advice to the US military. He was chair of a Jason working group on anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defence in 1961 which realised that the installation of an ABM system reduced strategic stability since it made a pre-emptive nuclear strike by an opponent more likely. He reported those conclusions to a Pugwash conference in India in 1964 to be greeted with ridicule by Soviet representatives at the conference. But the Soviet Union came to realise the logic of those arguments and an ABM treaty was eventually agreed between the US and Soviet Union in 1972. President George W Bush decided that the US should leave the treaty in 2002. Russia has responded recently by announcing the development of a series of technologically new missile systems. He was appointed by Richard Nixon to the presidential science advisory committee in 1968 and served until 1972. Bill Clinton appointed him to his committee of advisers on science and technology from 1993 to 2000. He was at various times a regent of the Smithsonian Institute, a director of the committee on world environment and resources of the MacArthur Foundation, a fellow of the American Physical Society and a foreign member of the Royal Society.

When I last saw him in Santa Fe, he came to my home for dinner. I offered him a glass of Freixenet, the sparkling wine. Freixenet, he said: that\u2019s Catalan for a grove of ash trees.

      "body": "<p>There are nappies in my wardrobe, but I have no children nor a sexual fetish. Instead, I have a problem shared by millions of women (and some men): I cannot always control my bladder as well as I want to, no matter how many toilet visits I have made beforehand. I have incontinence, and I am not alone: in the UK, up to 40% of women have incontinence at some point, either because they have given birth or are menopausal, because of genetics, or simply because of age. Up to 70% of expectant and new mothers experience incontinence, and a quarter of men over 40 \u2013 though, given how shameful it is thought to be, the figures are likely to be conservative. We mask, we hide, we cope.</p> <p>The pelvic floor \u2013 a sling of muscles stretching from the tailbone to the pubic bone \u2013 supports the bladder, bowel and womb. These muscles are meant to contract to stopper any flow of urine. (The muscles are also sometimes referred to as a \u201ctrampoline\u201d \u2013 a sour joke for women who know trampolining is a sure way to wet pants.)</p> <p>Incontinence, says the NHS, can be caused by childbirth, long-term cough, constipation, being overweight, pelvic surgery, repeated heavy lifting or menopause. There are several varieties: urge incontinence, when your urge to urinate is so sudden you can\u2019t control it; overflow incontinence, when you have trouble emptying your bladder fully and leak; and total incontinence, when your bladder cannot hold urine. Functional incontinence, where other conditions prevent you getting to a toilet in time, is one reason. Another is ageing muscles, which makes incontinence common among the elderly: after the age of 70, 17% of women and 12% of men have some incontinence. Mine is stress incontinence, which can be triggered by laughing, coughing, sneezing or jumping, because my pelvic floor can\u2019t prevent my bladder from emptying under the pressure.</p> <p>My bladder problems arrived with the menopause, which is normal: nearly half of women report trouble with continence after their last period, either because the lack of oestrogen thins the lining of the urethra, or because of muscle weakness. I am not ashamed of being menopausal, so why am I ashamed of my pelvic floor weakness? But I never admitted to the nappies, sold as \u201cincontinence pants\u201d and posted in anonymous envelopes. For months on end, they were my salvation because they weren\u2019t bulky or obvious, and they meant I could run for hours and not smell like a toilet afterwards.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Though it is less common than in women, men get incontinent, too \u2013 often later in life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, I have now found better options in the form of modern and more stylish incontinence knickers that absorb urine, made by companies such as the Manchester-based Giggle Knickers. Co-founder Anne Davidson says she wanted to create incontinence pants that looked like \u201ca comfortable pair of knickers\u201d \u2013 a product that makes it easier to break the stigma around the condition. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a basic thing you should be able to do,\u201d says Davidson. \u201c[Incontinence] is associated with being a baby, or being old \u2013 like you\u2019ve lost it a bit.\u201d</p> <p>If you look at the figures, incontinence is an epidemic: 14 million people have bladder problems in the UK. The <a href=\"https://www.csp.org.uk/publications/physiotherapy-works-urinary-incontinence\" title=\"\">last recorded estimate, from 2000, of how much incontinence costs</a> the NHS for women living outside care settings was \u00a3233m, with another \u00a3178m for self-care (such as my \u201cmagic pants\u201d and nappies). Though it is less common than in women, men get incontinent, too \u2013 often later in life, as a result of prostate troubles. Davidson says men have written to her asking her to make a product for them, because they are cutting up their wives\u2019 sanitary pads and using those. Often they suffer in silence. And it is suffering: sanitation specialists talk of the \u201cbladder leash\u201d, when people stay at home because they dare not go out in case they don\u2019t find a public toilet. Urinary incontinence is embarrassing, diminishing and disabling.</p> <p>Many women only approach their doctors for help when they have reached a point of desperation, or need surgery. The Nice guidelines on incontinence are clear: the first step for anyone suitable is exercises. You know the ones \u2013 the squeezes and the pulses you do, though you are never sure if you are doing them right. They don\u2019t work for everyone: women who have had surgery that has cut through nerves and tissue, or women with neurological issues or medical conditions can do all the pelvic floor exercises they like, but they will still leak. But in cases of stress incontinence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/06/five-ways-to-strengthen-your-pelvic-floor\" title=\"\">strengthening the pelvic floor</a> can improve life for 70% of sufferers.</p> <p>A few years ago, I was referred to an incontinence clinic, where a kind nurse took a look and told me I was fixable, but that I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/07/pelvic-floor-exercises-with-imaginary-eels\" title=\"\">had to do the exercises</a>. I said I would, and didn\u2019t. Who does? Studies show up to half of women either don\u2019t do their exercises correctly (the pelvic muscles are hard to isolate) or stop doing them. I was given a Kegel device, named after the Chicago gynaecologist Arnold Kegel, who invented the squeezes. This pulsed electricity at my pelvic floor \u201ctrampoline\u201d. If I used it regularly for many weeks, there was a slight improvement, but I lapsed. It was boring, and I was unsure whether it was working.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5363b0b37bc66d4cfded272acf84c29752fc9e36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5363b0b37bc66d4cfded272acf84c29752fc9e36/0_109_2500_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elvie Trainer Side View\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Elvie Trainer \u2026 you insert it like a tampon, the \u2018tail\u2019 connects with a smartphone app via Bluetooth, and off you go</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: shoot/Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then I was sent an <a href=\"https://www.elvie.com/shop/elvie-trainer?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsdDhr9bF4gIVh7PtCh2WhgEAEAAYASAAEgLtvfD_BwE\" title=\"\">Elvie trainer</a>. The Elvie is sea-green and curved, and it looks like it could be an alien gadget in Guardians of the Galaxy. It\u2019s straightforward to use: you insert it like a tampon for your short exercise session, the \u201ctail\u201d connects with a smartphone app via Bluetooth, and off you go. There are other apps <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/apps-library/squeezy/\" title=\"\">aimed at encouraging Kegel exercises, such as Squeezy</a>. But Elvie combines several elements: biofeedback, so that it can sense whether you are squeezing correctly; alerts if you are doing them wrong; and gamification, a tech term meaning that users are lured by targets and competition.</p> <p>Elvie\u2019s founder is Tania Boler, a former specialist in sexual health, HIV and reproduction who has worked for the UN. Her own incontinence was triggered in 2011 by giving birth, which can stress the pelvic floor either because of the pressure of a growing foetus and a uterus expanding to accommodate it, or because of birth trauma.<strong> </strong>\u201cI suddenly realised I didn\u2019t know anything about my pelvic floor,\u201d says Boler.</p> <p>She read the literature and found women\u2019s health to be vastly under-researched. Surely, Boler thought, it was time for a product that made pelvic floor exercises easier? But this was years ago, before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/30/sorry-gwyneth-paltrow-but-steaming-your-vagina-is-a-bad-idea\" title=\"\">vaginal steaming</a> became a celebrity trend. She was trying to sell what is now called \u201cfemtech\u201d to an overwhelmingly male tech industry, and was, predictably, scorned.</p> <p>Then, in 2013, Boler entered an innovation competition run by the UK government and won \u00a3100,000. She handed in her notice the next day, then convinced Alex Asseily, the founder of the electronics company Jawbone, to invest (he became a co-founder of her company a year later). She wanted a device that had a sound medical foundation, but was fun to use \u2013 so she looked to gaming for what she needed. The games industry term is \u201csticky\u201d, meaning people come back because of the targets and rewards. With Elvie, the competition is with yourself, but is still compelling.</p> <p>One of Elvie\u2019s core customer bases is young women \u2013 who think the menopause is decades away. \u201cWomen in their 20s,\u201d says Boler, \u201cwho are not thinking about motherhood, but want to strengthen their pelvic floor either because they are very into exercise, or because they are more conscious about being healthy.\u201d There are also more immediate benefits. \u201cObviously a stronger pelvic floor means better sex. People say: \u2018Is it a sex issue or a health issue?\u2019 But it\u2019s both. If women are doing it for sex and it has knock-on health benefits, that\u2019s even better.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/06/five-ways-to-strengthen-your-pelvic-floor\">Five ways to strengthen your pelvic floor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If incontinence was less unspeakable, women would not end up needing surgery that can be distressing and sometimes \u2013 as class action suits over vaginal mesh implants show \u2013 harmful. Elvie costs about \u00a3150 when bought privately, but can now be prescribed in NHS secondary care. \u201cIt\u2019s just switching what we think of typically as a negative health issue,\u201d says Boler, \u201csomething that we\u2019re embarrassed about and don\u2019t want to think about, and turning it into something positive.\u201d</p> <p>I love my Elvie and my magic pants, and will continue to use both for as long as I need. Is it fun to insert a green tampon-like device every morning for five minutes and do a series of lifts, squeezes and strength tests while my cat watches in puzzlement? No, but it works. What is fun is running for 20 miles and not having to dash to my car to change because I smell of stale urine. What is fun is making myself better, with a little help from technology. </p>",

For months on end, they were my salvation because they weren\u2019t bulky or obvious, and they meant I could run for hours and not smell like a toilet afterwards. However, I have now found better options in the form of modern and more stylish incontinence knickers that absorb urine, made by companies such as the Manchester-based Giggle Knickers. Co-founder Anne Davidson says she wanted to create incontinence pants that looked like \u201ca comfortable pair of knickers\u201d \u2013 a product that makes it easier to break the stigma around the condition. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a basic thing you should be able to do,\u201d says Davidson. \u201c[Incontinence] is associated with being a baby, or being old \u2013 like you\u2019ve lost it a bit.\u201d If you look at the figures, incontinence is an epidemic: 14 million people have bladder problems in the UK. The last recorded estimate, from 2000, of how much incontinence costs the NHS for women living outside care settings was \u00a3233m, with another \u00a3178m for self-care (such as my \u201cmagic pants\u201d and nappies). Though it is less common than in women, men get incontinent, too \u2013 often later in life, as a result of prostate troubles. Davidson says men have written to her asking her to make a product for them, because they are cutting up their wives\u2019 sanitary pads and using those. Often they suffer in silence. And it is suffering: sanitation specialists talk of the \u201cbladder leash\u201d, when people stay at home because they dare not go out in case they don\u2019t find a public toilet. Urinary incontinence is embarrassing, diminishing and disabling. Many women only approach their doctors for help when they have reached a point of desperation, or need surgery. The Nice guidelines on incontinence are clear: the first step for anyone suitable is exercises. You know the ones \u2013 the squeezes and the pulses you do, though you are never sure if you are doing them right. They don\u2019t work for everyone: women who have had surgery that has cut through nerves and tissue, or women with neurological issues or medical conditions can do all the pelvic floor exercises they like, but they will still leak. But in cases of stress incontinence, strengthening the pelvic floor can improve life for 70% of sufferers. A few years ago, I was referred to an incontinence clinic, where a kind nurse took a look and told me I was fixable, but that I had to do the exercises. I said I would, and didn\u2019t. Who does? Studies show up to half of women either don\u2019t do their exercises correctly (the pelvic muscles are hard to isolate) or stop doing them. I was given a Kegel device, named after the Chicago gynaecologist Arnold Kegel, who invented the squeezes. This pulsed electricity at my pelvic floor \u201ctrampoline\u201d. If I used it regularly for many weeks, there was a slight improvement, but I lapsed. It was boring, and I was unsure whether it was working. Then I was sent an Elvie trainer. The Elvie is sea-green and curved, and it looks like it could be an alien gadget in Guardians of the Galaxy. It\u2019s straightforward to use: you insert it like a tampon for your short exercise session, the \u201ctail\u201d connects with a smartphone app via Bluetooth, and off you go. There are other apps aimed at encouraging Kegel exercises, such as Squeezy. But Elvie combines several elements: biofeedback, so that it can sense whether you are squeezing correctly; alerts if you are doing them wrong; and gamification, a tech term meaning that users are lured by targets and competition. Elvie\u2019s founder is Tania Boler, a former specialist in sexual health, HIV and reproduction who has worked for the UN. Her own incontinence was triggered in 2011 by giving birth, which can stress the pelvic floor either because of the pressure of a growing foetus and a uterus expanding to accommodate it, or because of birth trauma. \u201cI suddenly realised I didn\u2019t know anything about my pelvic floor,\u201d says Boler. She read the literature and found women\u2019s health to be vastly under-researched. Surely, Boler thought, it was time for a product that made pelvic floor exercises easier? But this was years ago, before vaginal steaming became a celebrity trend. She was trying to sell what is now called \u201cfemtech\u201d to an overwhelmingly male tech industry, and was, predictably, scorned. Then, in 2013, Boler entered an innovation competition run by the UK government and won \u00a3100,000. She handed in her notice the next day, then convinced Alex Asseily, the founder of the electronics company Jawbone, to invest (he became a co-founder of her company a year later). She wanted a device that had a sound medical foundation, but was fun to use \u2013 so she looked to gaming for what she needed. The games industry term is \u201csticky\u201d, meaning people come back because of the targets and rewards. With Elvie, the competition is with yourself, but is still compelling. One of Elvie\u2019s core customer bases is young women \u2013 who think the menopause is decades away. \u201cWomen in their 20s,\u201d says Boler, \u201cwho are not thinking about motherhood, but want to strengthen their pelvic floor either because they are very into exercise, or because they are more conscious about being healthy.\u201d There are also more immediate benefits. \u201cObviously a stronger pelvic floor means better sex. People say: \u2018Is it a sex issue or a health issue?\u2019 But it\u2019s both. If women are doing it for sex and it has knock-on health benefits, that\u2019s even better.\u201d If incontinence was less unspeakable, women would not end up needing surgery that can be distressing and sometimes \u2013 as class action suits over vaginal mesh implants show \u2013 harmful. Elvie costs about \u00a3150 when bought privately, but can now be prescribed in NHS secondary care. \u201cIt\u2019s just switching what we think of typically as a negative health issue,\u201d says Boler, \u201csomething that we\u2019re embarrassed about and don\u2019t want to think about, and turning it into something positive.\u201d I love my Elvie and my magic pants, and will continue to use both for as long as I need. Is it fun to insert a green tampon-like device every morning for five minutes and do a series of lifts, squeezes and strength tests while my cat watches in puzzlement? No, but it works. What is fun is running for 20 miles and not having to dash to my car to change because I smell of stale urine. What is fun is making myself better, with a little help from technology.",

      "body": "<p>For Liverpool this has been a season of two extraordinary statistics: 11.7mm and 64%. It was the former that denied them a goal (albeit a freakish one via John Stones and Ederson) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/03/manchester-city-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">away to Manchester City</a> in January, and it was with the latter they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/01/tottenham-liverpool-champions-league-final-match-report\" title=\"\">won the Champions League</a>. Neither makes much sense. That games can be swayed by margins as fine as that defies comprehension. But it feels at least as incredible that Liverpool could win a Champions League final with 64% pass accuracy.</p> <p>Liverpool worry about pass accuracy far less than many sides. Their pass completion rate of 79.9% in the Champions League was the 21st highest of the 32 teams who reached the group stage and beyond this season. They are happy to take risks. They play at high tempo. They are exceptionally good at winning back the ball, which possibly means they protect possession less assiduously than certain sides. They get the ball forward quickly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/02/mo-salah-liverpool-spurs-champions-league\">Mo Salah says photo of Kyiv pain inspired him to score against Spurs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speed is prized over precision \u2013 or, at least, that is how they used to be; that is how the template tells us it should be. This season, though, Liverpool have been notably more controlled. In the league their pass completion was 84.4% as opposed to 83.8% last season. They have not pressed so hard. Regains in the opposition\u2019s final third are down almost 9%. Passing sequences of 10 or more resulting in a shot are up 21.5%. They have not gone quite so hell for leather.</p> <p>Neither mode, neither the tumultuous storming of the past nor the more deliberate recent style, was much in evidence on Saturday. Liverpool\u2019s greatest triumph in 14 years, the win that ended J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s run of six successive final defeats, that ensured this stirring period in the club\u2019s history would not be characterised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/12/liverpool-wolves-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">by near misses</a>, came with 64% pass completion. To put that in context, that is 0.1% more than Cardiff over the course of this season, and less than any other Premier League club. It is also 7% less than Red Star Belgrade, who had the lowest pass completion of any side from the Champions League group stage onwards.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Klopp dismissed concerns that Liverpool hadn\u2019t played all that well. Sometimes resilience, digging in, is what it takes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The statistic tallies with the general impression of the final as a bitty affair when neither side produced anything like their best form and perhaps in part explains Klopp\u2019s reluctance to discuss the mechanics, his laughing dismissal of concerns that Liverpool had not really played all that well. Sometimes resilience, digging in, is what it takes, and Liverpool did that.</p> <p>Quite why it was such a scrappy game is another issue. It can be an inevitable danger when two sides who like to press meet: they end up locked in a tussle when there is insufficient time for creativity. Klopp and Mauricio Pochettino have, in their own ways, reawakened the spirit that underlay English club\u2019s dominance of Europe in the late 1970s and early 80s; it is unsurprising then that they should also produce a final to evoke memories of those attritional days when it felt that every final finished 1-0.</p> <p>So, too, would this one but for Divock Origi\u2019s late goal, one that seemed almost a pastiche of the most mocking interpretations of the English game, a corner bobbing about, bouncing off head after head before falling for him to slam his finish into the bottom corner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4627c2673f4951e96a19da5e3ac6c02ddec7c07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4627c2673f4951e96a19da5e3ac6c02ddec7c07/16_41_1448_869/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spurs v Liverpool\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liverpool\u2019s Divock Origi makes it 2-0 \u2013 a goal \u2018that seemed almost a pastiche of the most mocking interpretations of the English game\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manu Fern\u00e1ndez/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet that is not an adequate explanation why this was such a scruffy game.

      "bodyText": "For Liverpool this has been a season of two extraordinary statistics: 11.7mm and 64%. It was the former that denied them a goal (albeit a freakish one via John Stones and Ederson) away to Manchester City in January, and it was with the latter they won the Champions League. Neither makes much sense. That games can be swayed by margins as fine as that defies comprehension. But it feels at least as incredible that Liverpool could win a Champions League final with 64% pass accuracy. Liverpool worry about pass accuracy far less than many sides. Their pass completion rate of 79.9% in the Champions League was the 21st highest of the 32 teams who reached the group stage and beyond this season. They are happy to take risks. They play at high tempo. They are exceptionally good at winning back the ball, which possibly means they protect possession less assiduously than certain sides. They get the ball forward quickly. Speed is prized over precision \u2013 or, at least, that is how they used to be; that is how the template tells us it should be. This season, though, Liverpool have been notably more controlled. In the league their pass completion was 84.4% as opposed to 83.8% last season. They have not pressed so hard. Regains in the opposition\u2019s final third are down almost 9%. Passing sequences of 10 or more resulting in a shot are up 21.5%. They have not gone quite so hell for leather. Neither mode, neither the tumultuous storming of the past nor the more deliberate recent style, was much in evidence on Saturday. Liverpool\u2019s greatest triumph in 14 years, the win that ended J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s run of six successive final defeats, that ensured this stirring period in the club\u2019s history would not be characterised by near misses, came with 64% pass completion. To put that in context, that is 0.1% more than Cardiff over the course of this season, and less than any other Premier League club. It is also 7% less than Red Star Belgrade, who had the lowest pass completion of any side from the Champions League group stage onwards. The statistic tallies with the general impression of the final as a bitty affair when neither side produced anything like their best form and perhaps in part explains Klopp\u2019s reluctance to discuss the mechanics, his laughing dismissal of concerns that Liverpool had not really played all that well. Sometimes resilience, digging in, is what it takes, and Liverpool did that. Quite why it was such a scrappy game is another issue. It can be an inevitable danger when two sides who like to press meet: they end up locked in a tussle when there is insufficient time for creativity. Klopp and Mauricio Pochettino have, in their own ways, reawakened the spirit that underlay English club\u2019s dominance of Europe in the late 1970s and early 80s; it is unsurprising then that they should also produce a final to evoke memories of those attritional days when it felt that every final finished 1-0. So, too, would this one but for Divock Origi\u2019s late goal, one that seemed almost a pastiche of the most mocking interpretations of the English game, a corner bobbing about, bouncing off head after head before falling for him to slam his finish into the bottom corner. Yet that is not an adequate explanation why this was such a scruffy game. It was the 10th meeting of Klopp and Pochettino and the majority have been entertaining, high-quality affairs. Perhaps it was tension, perhaps the heat or the three-week break since either side last played \u2013 something that also seemed to hamper the first half of the Europa League final. There is also a sense of familiarity. These are two managers who know each other well, who know how to interfere with each other\u2019s plans and who have had three weeks to plot doing so.

In a sense, though, once Liverpool had gone ahead through the penalty, that mattered less than his defensive performance. Not that it was policy but the disjointedness of the game ended up suiting Liverpool. \u201cSomething changed in the world of football,\u201d Klopp said in February after the 0-0 draw at Old Trafford in February, which came five days after the goalless draw at home to Bayern Munich. \u201cEveryone adapted to it and we have to make sure we adapt.\u201d This is not a new defensive age \u2013 far from it \u2013 but by discovering a capacity to resist, and by pairing central defenders in Virgil van Dijk and Jo\u00ebl Matip who excel at the traditional virtues of defending \u2013 heading, marking, tackling \u2013 at least as much as playing the ball out, Liverpool have discovered a competitive advantage.",

      "body": "<p>In the first three months of 2019, Facebook removed about 2bn fake accounts from its servers. This is roughly equivalent to all the legitimate accounts the company has on its platform. The figures are in one sense incomparable: legitimate accounts on social media are (at least supposedly) real people.</p> <p>Fake accounts can be proliferated at such volume and speed, and removed as quickly, because they are both auto-generated and auto-deleted. In other words, robots arguing with each other, and the Facebook robots prevailing.</p> <p>Contrast the efficiency of this type of content decision with another, where robots are not so skilled: nuanced political and cultural decisions, such as should we remove a video which is \u201cnot real\u201d? Or an even more wide open question, should neo-Nazis have access to advertise their views? Both are the latest detonations in an ongoing battle around how public debate and discourse should be regulated.</p> <p>Twitter announced last week that it was talking to a range of academic experts about what to do about extreme rightwing presence. On one level this is an admirable approach, to ask experts about the mechanics of online radicalisation, harassment and extremism as an input into policy. On another, it is an absurd overthinking of a simple business question \u2013 do you want your platform to be plagued by neo-Nazis? Twitter is no doubt hoping the academic consultation will yield an answer which allows them to act. But it is not the only platform continually grappling with the same problems, none of which will solve themselves. For the past week, media headlines in the US have been largely dominated by a short doctored video of Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi slurring her words circulated largely on social platforms. YouTube took it down, but Facebook left it up.</p> <p>Just as the embers of the debate were dying around Facebook\u2019s responsibility, and even capacity, to deal with it, Pelosi reignited them by saying Facebook\u2019s inability to remove the video showed that it was, in fact, a conscious participant in the Russian efforts to derail the 2016 presidential election. \u201cWe have said all along: \u2018Poor Facebook, they were unwittingly exploited by the Russians\u2019 \u2026 I think wittingly, because right now they are putting up something they know is false.\u201d</p> <p>This is a very big claim and one which ought to worry Facebook, coming, as it does, from the heart of the Democratic leadership. Hillary Clinton followed this up in a commencement speech to Hunter College graduates describing the video as \u201csexist trash\u201d.</p> <p>She laid into Facebook: \u201cThe big social media platforms know their systems are being manipulated by foreign and domestic actors to sow division, promote extremism and spread misinformation \u2013 but they won\u2019t get serious about cleaning up their platforms unless consumers demand it.\u201d</p> <p>Facebook had fielded Monika Bickert to answer questions from Anderson Cooper on CNN about the video. Bickert is Facebook\u2019s most thoughtful and knowledgeable executive, heading its product policy and counter-terrorism. Her talking points were very familiar: Facebook\u2019s approach is to flag when something is false, to reduce its reach through algorithmic throttling, but not to remove material altogether unless immediate harm flows from it.

      "bodyText": "In the first three months of 2019, Facebook removed about 2bn fake accounts from its servers. This is roughly equivalent to all the legitimate accounts the company has on its platform. The figures are in one sense incomparable: legitimate accounts on social media are (at least supposedly) real people. Fake accounts can be proliferated at such volume and speed, and removed as quickly, because they are both auto-generated and auto-deleted. In other words, robots arguing with each other, and the Facebook robots prevailing. Contrast the efficiency of this type of content decision with another, where robots are not so skilled: nuanced political and cultural decisions, such as should we remove a video which is \u201cnot real\u201d? Or an even more wide open question, should neo-Nazis have access to advertise their views? Both are the latest detonations in an ongoing battle around how public debate and discourse should be regulated. Twitter announced last week that it was talking to a range of academic experts about what to do about extreme rightwing presence. On one level this is an admirable approach, to ask experts about the mechanics of online radicalisation, harassment and extremism as an input into policy. On another, it is an absurd overthinking of a simple business question \u2013 do you want your platform to be plagued by neo-Nazis? Twitter is no doubt hoping the academic consultation will yield an answer which allows them to act. But it is not the only platform continually grappling with the same problems, none of which will solve themselves. For the past week, media headlines in the US have been largely dominated by a short doctored video of Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi slurring her words circulated largely on social platforms. YouTube took it down, but Facebook left it up. Just as the embers of the debate were dying around Facebook\u2019s responsibility, and even capacity, to deal with it, Pelosi reignited them by saying Facebook\u2019s inability to remove the video showed that it was, in fact, a conscious participant in the Russian efforts to derail the 2016 presidential election. \u201cWe have said all along: \u2018Poor Facebook, they were unwittingly exploited by the Russians\u2019 \u2026 I think wittingly, because right now they are putting up something they know is false.\u201d This is a very big claim and one which ought to worry Facebook, coming, as it does, from the heart of the Democratic leadership. Hillary Clinton followed this up in a commencement speech to Hunter College graduates describing the video as \u201csexist trash\u201d. She laid into Facebook: \u201cThe big social media platforms know their systems are being manipulated by foreign and domestic actors to sow division, promote extremism and spread misinformation \u2013 but they won\u2019t get serious about cleaning up their platforms unless consumers demand it.\u201d Facebook had fielded Monika Bickert to answer questions from Anderson Cooper on CNN about the video. Bickert is Facebook\u2019s most thoughtful and knowledgeable executive, heading its product policy and counter-terrorism. Her talking points were very familiar: Facebook\u2019s approach is to flag when something is false, to reduce its reach through algorithmic throttling, but not to remove material altogether unless immediate harm flows from it. Hence terrorism and scientifically inaccurate claims about vaccinations are gone, but Holocaust denial and a clearly misleading clip that affects the democratic process are not. \u201cWe are not in the news business,\u201d Bickert told Anderson Cooper. \u201cWe are in the social media business.\u201d Engineers and lawyers in Silicon Valley are often mocked for their lack of facility in communications, but over the years they have been remarkably effective in constructing a whole language which casts a gauzy blanket of euphemism over a heap of ugly truths. They have eradicated all meaning and distinction around dramatically different social, cultural and political interactions by labelling them \u201ccontent\u201d, they have made the diseased metaphor of \u201cvirality\u201d a virtue, and rebranded sales people \u201cinfluencers\u201d. Even the phrase \u201csocial media\u201d is a positive denominator which hides a multitude of sins. The business Facebook is in is advertising (to be clear), and the \u201csocial media business\u201d is not only the news business (increasingly), it is also the politics business, the public health business, the terrorism business, the education business, the everything in bytes business. In fact, the approach that Bickert described of flagging material as false, and reducing the reach of it, telling people who have seen it that it is wrong, is not a bad strategy and it exceeds the measures taken by many media outlets with their own material who would readily criticise Facebook. It is a necessary measure but not sufficient. In other matters, Facebook is on shaky ground.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s threats of higher import tariffs against Mexican goods can be better understood not as an escalation of his trade war with the rest of the world, but as the act of a desperate man, prepared to upset most US business leaders to achieve his aim of building a border wall with the country\u2019s southern neighbour. His anger, which he will bring with him on a state visit to London on Monday, is not so much with Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s administration in Mexico City as with Congress, which has blocked the border wall, or at least restricted funding to such an extent that its completion is unlikely before the next presidential race gets under way. Like a frustrated bull, taunted by his new Democratic masters in the House of Representatives, he is going beyond the aggressive tactics honed on his reality TV show, the Apprentice, which he hosted in its first 14 seasons. Trump is now fighting back with a carefully arranged display of unhinged belligerence that appears to tell the House Democrats he is prepared to wreck his own mini economic boom to secure victory. No wonder investors spent Friday searching the global markets for havens for their money. The presidential order came out of the clear Washington sky late on Thursday to the shock and dismay of traders, who have mostly bet that Trump is all bluster and would soon find a way to claim victory from only modest concessions from his various battles over trade. Spooked by the prospect of a hit to growth from higher tariffs, they scuttled back to the security of German bonds. Trump, it should not be forgotten, has already secured a trade deal with L\u00f3pez Obrador, which has been dubbed Nafta 2. It\u2019s a mildly revamped version of the first Nafta trade deal covering a raft of imports to the US from Mexico and Canada that Trump says will benefit US workers. The deal, he said in his state of the union address earlier this year, will help American farmers and workers and ensure \u201cthat more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words: Made in the USA\u201d. The problem for him is that like his demand for a border wall, the Nafta 2 agreement is also stuck in Congress. Plenty of US business leaders, upset at the extra costs of higher tariffs on imported goods, have pointed out the contradiction in Trump\u2019s argument that Nafta 2, which is supposed to enhance free trade, can fit alongside punitive tariffs ostensibly introduced to tackle migration. L\u00f3pez Obrador was especially incensed, given he presented a draft Nafta 2 bill to the Mexican parliament on Thursday, only half an hour before Trump said he planned to propose new tariffs, which start at 5% on all Mexican exports to the US from 10 June, before further monthly increases that could take the total to 25% by October. The Mexican president is probably going to need to deliver some concessions to persuade Trump to back off. He is in a difficult position when trade with the US is the lifeblood of the Mexican economy. So there will, no doubt, be some proposals in the next few days for tighter migration rules. L\u00f3pez Obrador said as much in a speech delivered a day later in the eastern city of Veracruz after he had calmed down. Yet it\u2019s difficult to see what he can do when Trump\u2019s real battle is with Nancy Pelosi in the house. She is playing a game with Trump much like a toreador toys with his prey, frustrating him with eloquently argued objections to each of his initiatives, rather than going for the kill. Pelosi is under pressure from her left flank to move more forcefully against Trump and, in particular, to begin impeachment proceedings. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is among many leftists who want to move more quickly against the president to drum him out office without further delay. That\u2019s not Pelosi\u2019s way. With an eye on next year\u2019s race, the Democratic leadership has decided the best tactic should be to provoke Trump and turn him into a frothing wounded beast unable to see through the red mist, kicking against his friends and enemies alike as he tries to stave off defeat. Given Trump\u2019s failure in the 1990s to win his battles with banks and other lenders to his property empire, such that he was forced to file for bankruptcy proceedings, taunting him into defeat is probably the best plan. Unfortunately, life for exporting companies in the global economy could become very difficult. Extra tariffs on Chinese goods are already depressing trade between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Europe\u2019s economy is slowing after a recovery that became almost totally dependent on German expansion and that, in turn, was built on exports to China that have now slowed. Oil prices have slumped back to nearer $60 (\u00a347) a barrel when they were heading to $80 only a few weeks ago. And stock markets are in retreat. There are governments that will also be exposed by a decline in trade, especially those that have borrowed heavily in recent years. Without the income from trade, they will struggle to meet their debt obligations and may default. Already the International Monetary Fund, which acts as the lender of last resort to member nations, is talking to leaders in South America and Africa about the need for emergency loans should Trump\u2019s tantrums intensify, tariffs multiply and trade growth stall. The situation could get ugly, especially when populist movements are on the rise and are campaigning, like the US president, for a sense of national identity to become an expression of economic self-interest. Trump knows the \u00a31.1tn of tax cuts he pushed through Congress in his first year of office are a distant memory. His audience needs fresh meat, and with a domestic agenda stuck in Congress, he needs to use every one of the executive powers at his disposal to slay his Democratic enemies. In a long line of presidential battles with Congress, this one is set be Hemingway-esque for the time it will take to play out and its emotional intensity.

Residents praise its schools; tourists flock to its beaches; there is a strong military presence. The municipal centre where the attack happened is a collection of neat local government buildings in a bland but pretty setting of trimmed lawns, flower beds, trees and a gazebo. But it is also home to a Confederate statue that troubles some African American citizens.</p> \n<p>On Saturday afternoon, Pastor Chris Mitchell of the <a href=\"https://lifeatthegate.com/connect/\">Gateway City </a><a href=\"https://lifeatthegate.com/connect/\">church</a> led a group in prayer, then broke down in tears as he said \u201cthe Lord is good\u201d and embraced colleagues.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis was impromptu,\u201d explained the 38-year-old, wearing a grey T-shirt. \u201cLast night we went to bed at one, woke up at four and just wept, asking God, what can we do? Just organically we felt we needed to be here. We were compelled.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe said prayers for the families. I can\u2019t imagine what they\u2019re going through. A mother described it as the same sort of feeling she had on September 11 2001. That might sound like overkill to some but for us, it is that weighty.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fe32c6732fd55661ceb899446e26c665eb34e3d6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe32c6732fd55661ceb899446e26c665eb34e3d6/0_0_480_640/375.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Mitchell.\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pastor Chris Mitchell: \u2018Last night we went to bed at one, woke up at four and just wept, asking God, what can we do?\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Smith</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mitchell was born in Ohio but has lived in Virginia Beach for 27 years. \u201cI don\u2019t think any person ever thinks it\u2019s going to take place in their backyard, the place they think of as home. A friend of mine called and said this is unprecedented. There has never been anything remotely like this in any way. We are in equal parts shocked and devastated.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet the city will recover, he insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s a transient community because of the military presence but it\u2019s a strong community. People are known for their hospitality and their warmth.\u201d</p> \n<p>The municipal centre sits adjacent to an upmarket shopping strip: Princess Anne Center for Dental Arts, Online Formals Dress Boutique, Acupuncture, Courthouse Veterinary Clinic, Salon Mosaic. And there is Gun Shop, where a handwritten note in the window read: \u201capologise for any inconvenience, we are closed until Tuesday.\u201d Its phone went to voicemail. A message went unreturned.</p> \n<p>Nearby, a gift shop called <a href=\"https://www.penloversparadise.com/\">A Pen Lovers Paradise</a> was open for business. Its owner, Pamela Huynh, recalled Friday\u2019s events: \u201cI was at my front door and saw people on my front lawn. I said, \u2018Do you know what\u2019s going on?\u2019 A woman said, \u2018There\u2019s an active shooter in our building\u2019 and pointed across the street. I came in, locked up and went home. I was scared to death. I didn\u2019t know where he was. I thought, I\u2019m not going to stay here by myself. I was terrified.\u201d</p> \n<p>A mass shooting was as unimaginable here as anywhere. Huynh, 58, said: \u201cIt\u2019s normally quiet here. This is like the quietest part of Virginia Beach; on a Saturday there would be no cars in the parking lot. Virginia Beach is a fun-loving place and family oriented. It\u2019s a place you come to get away from it all, enjoy yourself, relax and feel safe \u2013 normally. I think it will heal, but it will take some time.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>\u2018A combative environment\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>The municipal centre contains something else: <a href=\"https://pilotonline.com/news/government/local/article_69fac9e6-af74-53b2-a1be-0a3d651bd5a1.html\">a statue of a soldier, erected in 1905.</a> The plinth states, \u201cPrincess Anne County Confederate Heroes\u201d \u2013 a tribute to the southern troops who fought to preserve slavery during the American civil war. It is a reminder of the state\u2019s chequered history. In 2017, attempts to remove a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee in Charlottesville triggered deadly in neo-Nazi violence. Virginia\u2019s governor, Ralph Northam, who has visited people injured in the shooting, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/10/virginia-ralph-northam-not-going-anywhere-calls-to-resign\">defied calls to resign</a> earlier this year after a photo of someone wearing blackface resurfaced from his page in a medical school yearbook from 1984.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"06247d175702f48c64d8b563da7041553d3d1906\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06247d175702f48c64d8b563da7041553d3d1906/0_0_480_640/375.jpg\" alt=\"A confederate statue near Municipal Building Two.\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Confederate statue near Municipal Building Two.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Smith</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jared Grooms, who is African American, lives two minutes from the municipal centre. While he does not allege that the gunman had a racial motivation, he believes the statue is telling.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Confederate influence and the lack of diversity are relevant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems some equivalent to the culture of a combative environment.\u201d</p> \n<p>The city has backed Republicans for president for the past half-century. Grooms, a 22-year-old biology graduate, added: \u201cVirginia Beach is racially segregated: there are two definitely \u2018white\u2019 schools and the remainder are known as the \u2018diverse\u2019 schools. We expect mass shootings in America, but I\u2019m not surprised it happened in Virginia Beach.\u201d</p> \n<p>Earlier on Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.mbaexchange.com/consultant/1052106-dr-pauline-jennett-principal-consultant/\">Pauline Jennett,</a> an educator from Boston who is African American, was hauling her luggage after a long train and bus ride. She reflected: \u201cVirginia Beach is idyllic and people are super-friendly; it\u2019s touristy but not over the top touristy. But as an African American who\u2019s been coming here for decades, it is the south. You will see Confederate flags being sold along with souvenirs. But on a day-to-day level nobody bothers you.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jennett had considered cancelling her annual trip here when she heard about the shooting. \u201cIt was quite startling,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt fear and anger. I called the hotel yesterday and said, \u2018Should I still come?\u2019 They said it\u2019s fine. I never heard of anything like that in Virginia Beach.

      "bodyText": "Twelve stars and stripes flags were planted on the grass verge, one for each of the lives cut short. Floral tributes accumulated in their midst with the prosaic details of price tags: $6.99 for one bunch, $4.87 for another. Police officers and TV crews went about their work, the latter shaded by white canopies. In a nearby carpark, mourners joined hands as a pastor offered a prayer and a woman strummed a guitar. This was Virginia Beach, a day after 12 people died when a man entered a city municipal building and started shooting. Police say 40-year-old DeWayne Craddock, who worked for the city as an engineer, was confronted by officers and killed. Eleven of the victims were city employees. The other was a contractor. So Virginia Beach would be etched into a collective conscience that also bears names such as Virginia Tech, Newtown, Orlando, Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, Parkland and Pittsburgh. A common narrative thread runs though them \u2013 a mass shooting was unthinkable here \u2013 but each has a distinct story and grieves in its own way. Virginia Beach, the state\u2019s biggest city with around 450,000 people, has the surface charm of the American dream. Residents praise its schools; tourists flock to its beaches; there is a strong military presence. The municipal centre where the attack happened is a collection of neat local government buildings in a bland but pretty setting of trimmed lawns, flower beds, trees and a gazebo. But it is also home to a Confederate statue that troubles some African American citizens. On Saturday afternoon, Pastor Chris Mitchell of the Gateway City church led a group in prayer, then broke down in tears as he said \u201cthe Lord is good\u201d and embraced colleagues. \u201cThis was impromptu,\u201d explained the 38-year-old, wearing a grey T-shirt. \u201cLast night we went to bed at one, woke up at four and just wept, asking God, what can we do? Just organically we felt we needed to be here. We were compelled. \u201cWe said prayers for the families. I can\u2019t imagine what they\u2019re going through. A mother described it as the same sort of feeling she had on September 11 2001. That might sound like overkill to some but for us, it is that weighty.\u201d Mitchell was born in Ohio but has lived in Virginia Beach for 27 years. \u201cI don\u2019t think any person ever thinks it\u2019s going to take place in their backyard, the place they think of as home. A friend of mine called and said this is unprecedented. There has never been anything remotely like this in any way. We are in equal parts shocked and devastated.\u201d Yet the city will recover, he insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s a transient community because of the military presence but it\u2019s a strong community. People are known for their hospitality and their warmth.\u201d The municipal centre sits adjacent to an upmarket shopping strip: Princess Anne Center for Dental Arts, Online Formals Dress Boutique, Acupuncture, Courthouse Veterinary Clinic, Salon Mosaic. And there is Gun Shop, where a handwritten note in the window read: \u201capologise for any inconvenience, we are closed until Tuesday.\u201d Its phone went to voicemail. A message went unreturned. Nearby, a gift shop called A Pen Lovers Paradise was open for business. Its owner, Pamela Huynh, recalled Friday\u2019s events: \u201cI was at my front door and saw people on my front lawn. I said, \u2018Do you know what\u2019s going on?\u2019 A woman said, \u2018There\u2019s an active shooter in our building\u2019 and pointed across the street. I came in, locked up and went home. I was scared to death. I didn\u2019t know where he was. I thought, I\u2019m not going to stay here by myself. I was terrified.\u201d A mass shooting was as unimaginable here as anywhere. Huynh, 58, said: \u201cIt\u2019s normally quiet here. This is like the quietest part of Virginia Beach; on a Saturday there would be no cars in the parking lot. Virginia Beach is a fun-loving place and family oriented. It\u2019s a place you come to get away from it all, enjoy yourself, relax and feel safe \u2013 normally. I think it will heal, but it will take some time.\u201d \u2018A combative environment\u2019 The municipal centre contains something else: a statue of a soldier, erected in 1905. The plinth states, \u201cPrincess Anne County Confederate Heroes\u201d \u2013 a tribute to the southern troops who fought to preserve slavery during the American civil war. It is a reminder of the state\u2019s chequered history. In 2017, attempts to remove a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee in Charlottesville triggered deadly in neo-Nazi violence. Virginia\u2019s governor, Ralph Northam, who has visited people injured in the shooting, defied calls to resign earlier this year after a photo of someone wearing blackface resurfaced from his page in a medical school yearbook from 1984. Jared Grooms, who is African American, lives two minutes from the municipal centre. While he does not allege that the gunman had a racial motivation, he believes the statue is telling. \u201cThe Confederate influence and the lack of diversity are relevant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems some equivalent to the culture of a combative environment.\u201d The city has backed Republicans for president for the past half-century. Grooms, a 22-year-old biology graduate, added: \u201cVirginia Beach is racially segregated: there are two definitely \u2018white\u2019 schools and the remainder are known as the \u2018diverse\u2019 schools. We expect mass shootings in America, but I\u2019m not surprised it happened in Virginia Beach.\u201d Earlier on Saturday, Pauline Jennett, an educator from Boston who is African American, was hauling her luggage after a long train and bus ride. She reflected: \u201cVirginia Beach is idyllic and people are super-friendly; it\u2019s touristy but not over the top touristy. But as an African American who\u2019s been coming here for decades, it is the south. You will see Confederate flags being sold along with souvenirs. But on a day-to-day level nobody bothers you.\u201d Jennett had considered cancelling her annual trip here when she heard about the shooting. \u201cIt was quite startling,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt fear and anger. I called the hotel yesterday and said, \u2018Should I still come?\u2019 They said it\u2019s fine. I never heard of anything like that in Virginia Beach. It felt a little piece of the world that wasn\u2019t going to be touched by violence like that.\u201d \u2018Virginia Beach strong\u2019 Hours after the carnage, Bobby Dyer, the mayor of the city, told the world: \u201cThis is the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach.\u201d That was plain to see amid the solemn flags, flowers and police tape at the municipal centre. But less than 10 miles away on the coast, life carried on as if nothing had happened in a city where tourism is a $2.45bn industry, bringing more than 10 million overnight visitors a year. Shoppers idled in beachwear stores or ate pizza or ice cream on Atlantic Avenue. A ferris wheel turned in a fairground. Music blasted from loudspeakers. A \u201cmilitary village\u201d was set up on the beach, including a naval hovercraft, as part of a \u201cpatriotic festival\u201d. Men on motorbikes, engines rasping, performed flips and other stunts on the sand. Motorboats sped by in the water, planes trailing advertisements flew above. People strolled the boardwalk, sunbathed or splashed in the Atlantic ocean, as blissfully unaware of danger as in a Hollywood movie. Among those on the pier were Robin Michals and her husband Marc, whose friend survived the massacre, telling them he had been within three feet of the gunman and later stepped over a dead body as police led him out. Marc, 55, who owns a marketing company, put the city seal with a black ribbon on his Facebook page.

On Sunday, Gauke, the justice secretary, backed Rory Stewart, the outsider candidate and international development secretary, who has ruled out a no-deal exit. \u201cI\u2019ve seen his ability to be both strategic and on top of the details as a minister,\u201d Gauke said. \u201cHe\u2019s an excellent communicator, I think he has got an ability to connect with people, he\u2019s got an ability to bring people together in order to find a way through the Brexit impasse and I think he could win a general election.\u201d Gauke said he would not be able to serve in a cabinet that actively pursued no deal. \u201cI accept that we should prepare for it but if it is an objective in saying \u2018no-deal is the right answer\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t support that policy,\u201d he said, though he ruled out possibly voting against the government in a confidence vote. The Tory grandee Ken Clarke also backed Stewart on Sunday, while the rest of the 40-strong group of One Nation MPs are likely to choose between Hancock, Stewart and Gove, who has been endorsed by the former education secretary Nicky Morgan. Rudd, regarded as the leading pro-European voice in the cabinet, wrote in the Observer on Sunday that candidates should concede that Britain will not leave at the end of October and start work on a new deal with Brussels. The work and pensions secretary, who met Boris Johnson this week to discuss a possible collaboration, is thought to have concluded their positions are irreconcilable. The former universities minister Sam Gyimah on Sunday became the 13th candidate to enter the race, and is the only one who has pledged to offer a second referendum.",

One theory is that turning one year old at birth takes into account time spent in the womb \u2013 with nine months rounded up to 12. Others link it to an ancient Asian numerical system that did not have the concept of zero.</p> <p>Explanations for the extra year added on 1 January are more complicated.</p> <p>Some experts point to the theory that ancient Koreans placed their year of birth within the Chinese 60-year calendar cycle, but, at a time when there were no regular calendars, tended to ignore the day of their birth and simply added on a whole year on the first day of the lunar calendar. The extra year on 1 January became commonplace as more South Koreans began observing the western calendar.</p> <p>Now, though, an MP is attempting to end the tradition, claiming that many of his compatriots fear it makes South Korea, Asia\u2019s fourth-biggest economy and a global technology giant, appear out of step with the rest of the world.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest problem is that the legal age and the age used in everyday lives are different,\u201d says Hwang Ju-hong, who recently introduced a bill that would require the government to use international ages in official documents and to encourage people to use them in everyday life.</p> <p>\u201cThe international age is used in courts, hospitals and public offices, while the Korean age is used in people\u2019s daily lives. The different calculation method causes a lot of confusion and inconvenience.\u201d</p> <p>Hwang, who claims to have widespread support among MPs and the public, said parents with babies born in December worry that their offspring will encounter problems when they mix with children who are physically older and bigger but, in Korean terms, are the same age.</p> <p>\u201cThey worry about the possibility that their babies may be at a disadvantage at daycare centres because of their relatively small size,\u201d he says, noting that China abolished its traditional age system during the Cultural Revolution, while Japan adopted international ages in the early 1900s. North Korea started using international ages in 1985.</p> <p>The South Korean age system can be particularly disconcerting for the parents of children born late in the year. Kim Sun-mi, whose daughter was born on 30 December last year, said she preferred to give her child\u2019s age in months while she was still very young.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll start using her Korean age when she grows up a bit,\u201d Kim said. But she believes it is \u201cabsurd\u201d that her daughter celebrated her second birthday only two days after she was born. \u201cThe Korean age system poses many disadvantages for babies that are born later in the year,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI even saw some online posts about how some people plan their pregnancies so their babies won\u2019t be born later in the year. Some people even \u2018cheat\u2019 by waiting to register their babies\u2019 birth in January. I really hope the bill will pass.\u201d</p> <p>Not all South Koreans agree that the traditional calculation is anachronistic, arguing that it reflects the importance east Asian societies place on the lunar calendar, as opposed to the solar calendar observed in the west.</p> <p>\u201cUnifying the age calculation so it falls in line with the international age system would mean breaking with traditional ideas of time based on the lunar calendar,\u201d said Jang Yoo-seung, a senior researcher at Dankook University\u2019s Oriental Studies Research Centre.</p> <p>\u201cSome people say that it\u2019s weird for babies born in December to turn two after just a few days, but it\u2019s the same for international ages. A baby born today, and another who was born last year and is due to celebrate his or her birthday tomorrow, have birth dates that are almost 12 months apart, but they\u2019re both \u2018zero\u2019 years old.</p> <p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t the Korean age and the international age system coexist, in the same way that the traditional lunar new year holiday and Christmas coexist?\u201d</p> <p>Seoul resident Kim Yun-soo, whose Korean age is 32, agrees that the change should not be enforced in a misguided attempt to imitate the west. \u201cThe Korean age system originates from recognising the time babies spend in their mother\u2019s womb, which is part of Korea\u2019s traditional culture,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not completely opposed to using the international age system, but I wonder if it\u2019s necessary to impose it on people.\u201d</p> <p><em>Kyungmi Choi in Seoul and Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>",

Others link it to an ancient Asian numerical system that did not have the concept of zero. Explanations for the extra year added on 1 January are more complicated. Some experts point to the theory that ancient Koreans placed their year of birth within the Chinese 60-year calendar cycle, but, at a time when there were no regular calendars, tended to ignore the day of their birth and simply added on a whole year on the first day of the lunar calendar. The extra year on 1 January became commonplace as more South Koreans began observing the western calendar. Now, though, an MP is attempting to end the tradition, claiming that many of his compatriots fear it makes South Korea, Asia\u2019s fourth-biggest economy and a global technology giant, appear out of step with the rest of the world. \u201cThe biggest problem is that the legal age and the age used in everyday lives are different,\u201d says Hwang Ju-hong, who recently introduced a bill that would require the government to use international ages in official documents and to encourage people to use them in everyday life. \u201cThe international age is used in courts, hospitals and public offices, while the Korean age is used in people\u2019s daily lives. The different calculation method causes a lot of confusion and inconvenience.\u201d Hwang, who claims to have widespread support among MPs and the public, said parents with babies born in December worry that their offspring will encounter problems when they mix with children who are physically older and bigger but, in Korean terms, are the same age. \u201cThey worry about the possibility that their babies may be at a disadvantage at daycare centres because of their relatively small size,\u201d he says, noting that China abolished its traditional age system during the Cultural Revolution, while Japan adopted international ages in the early 1900s. North Korea started using international ages in 1985. The South Korean age system can be particularly disconcerting for the parents of children born late in the year. Kim Sun-mi, whose daughter was born on 30 December last year, said she preferred to give her child\u2019s age in months while she was still very young. \u201cI think I\u2019ll start using her Korean age when she grows up a bit,\u201d Kim said. But she believes it is \u201cabsurd\u201d that her daughter celebrated her second birthday only two days after she was born. \u201cThe Korean age system poses many disadvantages for babies that are born later in the year,\u201d she said. \u201cI even saw some online posts about how some people plan their pregnancies so their babies won\u2019t be born later in the year. Some people even \u2018cheat\u2019 by waiting to register their babies\u2019 birth in January. I really hope the bill will pass.\u201d Not all South Koreans agree that the traditional calculation is anachronistic, arguing that it reflects the importance east Asian societies place on the lunar calendar, as opposed to the solar calendar observed in the west. \u201cUnifying the age calculation so it falls in line with the international age system would mean breaking with traditional ideas of time based on the lunar calendar,\u201d said Jang Yoo-seung, a senior researcher at Dankook University\u2019s Oriental Studies Research Centre. \u201cSome people say that it\u2019s weird for babies born in December to turn two after just a few days, but it\u2019s the same for international ages. A baby born today, and another who was born last year and is due to celebrate his or her birthday tomorrow, have birth dates that are almost 12 months apart, but they\u2019re both \u2018zero\u2019 years old. \u201cWhy can\u2019t the Korean age and the international age system coexist, in the same way that the traditional lunar new year holiday and Christmas coexist?\u201d Seoul resident Kim Yun-soo, whose Korean age is 32, agrees that the change should not be enforced in a misguided attempt to imitate the west. \u201cThe Korean age system originates from recognising the time babies spend in their mother\u2019s womb, which is part of Korea\u2019s traditional culture,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not completely opposed to using the international age system, but I wonder if it\u2019s necessary to impose it on people.\u201d Kyungmi Choi in Seoul and Associated Press contributed to this report",

The International Air Transport Association, the 290 members of which account for 82% of scheduled air traffic, cut its forecast for earnings across the industry this year by more than a fifth on Sunday. Profits in 2019 are now expected to reach $28bn (\u00a322.2bn), Iata said, having forecast $35.5bn in December. That would also represent a decline on the 2018 figure, which Iata estimates reached $30bn, and would be the lowest since 2014. Airline executives who have gathered in the South Korean capital, Seoul, are faced with a markedly worse outlook than at last year\u2019s meeting in Sydney. Donald Trump\u2019s White House has escalated its trade dispute with China, while the continuing worldwide grounding of the US manufacturer Boeing\u2019s 737 Max fleet has added to costs \u2013 although Iata did not make explicit reference to that in its forecasts. The 737 Max has been grounded by regulators since March after concerns were raised about the functioning of safety features in two fatal crashes. Iata\u2019s director general, Alexandre de Juniac, last week said he did not expect the plane to return to the skies until August. Iata called for regulators across the world to work together to implement software fixes to the planes, after different countries banned the 737 Max from flying at different times, creating confusion among passengers. De Juniac told reporters in Seoul that \u201cany rift between regulators is not in anyone\u2019s interest\u201d. Despite stiff competition between airlines and rising costs \u2013 with oil prices this year expected to be 27.5% higher than in 2017 \u2013 the industry is still expected to record its 10th consecutive year of profits since the financial crisis. North America will be the most profitable region, with post-tax earnings expected to increase by $500m to $15bn for 2019, Iata said. Profits are expected to fall in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, with the latter particularly exposed to weaker trade. De Juniac said the industry had broken the cycle of \u201cboom and bust\u201d that previously left it more vulnerable to deteriorating conditions, but nevertheless said \u201cnormal levels of profitability\u201d were in danger. The continued trade dispute between the US and China represents a major risk for the industry, Iata said. The industry body heavily criticised \u201cthe proliferation of protectionist measures and the escalation of trade wars\u201d, driven mainly by the US. Last month, Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports worth $200bn, adding to previous levies. The US president then added further to tensions last week with the shock announcement of tariffs on Mexican imports \u201cuntil the illegal immigration problem is remedied\u201d. Iata expects the impact of tariffs to stifle any growth in demand for cargo transport during this year, adding to the difficulties of an \u201calready beleaguered\u201d sector. The negative effect on demand could also spill over into passenger volumes if worsening trade relations affect confidence, De Juniac warned. However, passenger numbers are still expected to rise by 5% year-on-year to 4.6 billion, albeit more slowly than the 7.4% growth rate seen last year. With the relentless rise in demand for air travel, the industry has been forced to address its role in global heating. Iata members passed a resolution calling on governments to implement a scheme that would cap net carbon dioxide emissions from the airline industry at 2020 levels. The airline industry is pushing for the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation to be the sole international mechanism for carbon pricing, rather than having multiple regimes in different regions. However, the scheme has been criticised by environmental campaigners for its focus on offsetting greenhouse gas emissions rather than reducing them in absolute terms. Transport &amp; Environment, a non-governmental organisation based in Brussels, has previously warned Corsia is less ambitious than current EU emissions reduction goals.",

      "bodyText": "Mohamed Salah believes he was fated to score in Liverpool\u2019s sixth European Cup triumph, having used a picture of last season\u2019s misery in Kyiv to inspire his redemption in the Champions League final. Moments before leaving the changing room to face Tottenham, the striker looked at a photograph of his despair from 12 months ago when forced out of the final against Real Madrid after 30 minutes by Sergio Ramos. Within two minutes of the kick-off in Madrid, Salah had converted his 29th goal of the season from the penalty spot to send Liverpool on their way to the first trophy of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s reign. The striker claimed he and Liverpool were destined to emerge victorious at Estadio Metropolitano. \u201cI looked at the picture from last year before the game,\u201d Salah said. \u201cWe were disappointed after the final and now we are back and have won it again, the sixth time for Liverpool.

For a start there\u2019s the fact that they dispense funny advice and useful self-care tips alongside descriptions of the details of notorious murders. If that mixture of true crime and practical advice sounds surprising then you\u2019ve clearly never listened to Kilgariff and Hardstark\u2019s hit podcast, <a href=\"https://www.myfavoritemurder.com/\" title=\"\">My Favorite Murder</a>, in which the two women start off each week by discussing an infamous crime before inevitably getting side-tracked into talking about past experiences and current obsessions.</p> <p>Hugely popular \u2013 it pulls in more than 19 million listeners a week and has seen the women sell out venues not only across their native US but also in Australia, Ireland and the UK, where another tour is planned for later this year \u2013 My Favorite Murder<em> </em>stands out in an endless sea of true-crime podcasts, largely because of the easy camaraderie between its two hosts, Kilgariff, 49, a writer and former stand-up comedian, and Hardstark, 38, a host on the Cooking Channel and contributor to the popular comedy show <em>Drunk History</em>.</p> <p>Listening to them shoot the breeze about whatever has caught their fancy that week, from where to go on holiday to what to do if you suddenly find yourself caught up in a cult, is like hanging out at a crowded party with the coolest people in the room, the kind of women who will make you scream with laughter largely by saying something so dark and yet so funny that you can\u2019t quite help yourself.</p> <p>\u201cI think the appeal is that we are in no way pretending to be or thinking that we are perfect,\u201d says Kilgariff on the phone from Los Angeles. \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is that the best thing to do is have a good, happy fulfilling life and if you fuck up then you fuck up and that\u2019s OK.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8b1174f9bc09916934f3a0ddb175f9fcc1c2f91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8b1174f9bc09916934f3a0ddb175f9fcc1c2f91/0_136_3349_2009/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The write stuff: onstage at a literary festival in Beverly Hills, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The write stuff: onstage at a literary festival in Beverly Hills, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charley Gallay/Getty Images for Pen America</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hardstark agrees: \u201cWe\u2019re living in a period where women are sick of competing against each other and what people like about the podcast is that it\u2019s all about building people up, not tearing each other down.\u201d</p> <p>My Favorite Murder was born out of a late-night conversation at a Halloween party when both women realised that they shared a similar obsession with lurid true-crime stories. It has proved so successful that they have performed in front of thousands of rapt fans, launched a membership scheme called Fan Cult with an annual cost of $39.99 (\u00a331.50) and now have a website selling a range of merch. This week sees the UK publication of their spin-off memoir, <em>Stay Sexy &amp; Don\u2019t Get Murdered</em>. \u201cYeah, we really never expected it to get this big,\u201d Kilgariff says. \u201cIt\u2019s out of control,\u201d agrees Hardstark.</p> <p>Yet it\u2019s easy to see just why they have such a huge following. <em>Stay Sexy</em>, an empathetic, insightful and crucially very funny look over the key moments of both women\u2019s lives, covers everything from how to deal with a much-loved parent\u2019s slow slide into dementia to what to do when the life you have turns out not to be the one you imagined, and does so with wit and a weary but hopeful compassion at the state of the world.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was a kid we\u2019d go and visit my grandmother, and my dad is one of eight so they\u2019d all be sitting there updating everyone on the good things but also on the fact that so and so had cancer or had lost their job, and people would make jokes,\u201d says Kilgariff. \u201cI think sometimes it\u2019s only by talking about what\u2019s really going on that you can make it less scary. We all feel anxious at times and acknowledging that only helps.\u201d</p> <p>As in the podcast, those serious moments nestle up against more light-hearted diversions. Kilgariff explains what life was like as a latchkey kid in the 70s (one step up from trying to survive <em>The Hunger Games</em>). Hardstark delves into what to do if your brother suddenly disappears on a camping holiday (don\u2019t start imagining that he\u2019s been brutally murdered, however much you want to). Both women offer very funny advice on how to party and what to do when your body is telling you the party\u2019s over.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8ee543ca923c0be2897160daf05bca144d3508a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ee543ca923c0be2897160daf05bca144d3508a8/0_0_1974_3000/658.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The listeners are so clever and funny and weird and cool\u2019: Kilgariff and Hardstark.\" width=\"658\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The listeners are so clever and funny and weird and cool\u2019: Kilgariff and Hardstark.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn a lot of ways it\u2019s as much a cry for help as a self-help book,\u201d says Kilgariff, laughing. \u201cFor a long time we were languishing in the fantasy that we were going to write a coffee-table book with big writing, funny jokes and minimal effort, but then our editor told us we had to write something more personal and by then we were in too deep to get out.\u201d</p> <p>From the start they decided that no punches would be pulled either in language or tone, with both hosts prepared to speak honestly about their own issues. Hardstark, who has ADHD and anxiety, had a difficult childhood involving spells in rehab; Kilgariff has had issues with alcohol, drugs and diet pills. Both women are \u201ccollege drop-outs\u201d who understand what it feels like to struggle to pay the rent.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t really have the ability to bullshit, so from the start all we could do was talk honestly about our own experiences,\u201d Kilgariff says. \u201cEveryone\u2019s done shit in the past that they\u2019ve regretted, or had moments they wish they\u2019d approached differently. For us, saying that out loud wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne of the hardest things in the world is when you can\u2019t connect, or think that no one is listening to you,\u201d Hardstark adds. \u201cI think what works is that we\u2019re not ashamed of saying when things have gone wrong.\u201d</p> <p>The podcast\u2019s most devoted fans, who describe themselves as \u201cMurderinos\u201d, have credited Kilgariff and Hardstark with helping them deal with their own issues. The duo are very careful to focus on mental health awareness and try their best to ensure that amid the bleak recounting of brutal crimes there is always hope.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we started we thought that people would want to talk about the murders, but actually it\u2019s the other stuff they want to talk about,\u201d Hardstark says. \u201cThey come up to us and say: \u2018I had this stuff happen in my life, too,\u2019 or: \u2018You made me more aware of this.\u2019 We have people talk to us about how the podcast has helped them feel better.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the responses, she says, have blown them away. \u201cIt can range from the really heavy to the amazing. We have people who come up and say that listening to the podcast has given them the push they needed to change their studies, and people who say that it\u2019s led to them talking to their mother again \u2013 and both those things are equally monumental. It\u2019s incredible that making some jokes and talking about our lives can inspire people in that way.\u201d</p> <p>Not that the \u201ccult\u201d (as Hardstark and Kilgariff jokingly describe it) is all about self-care and good advice. Murderinos fully embrace both the macabre and the sharp sense of humour, turning up to the arena events with dresses adorned with murder weapons and wearing T-shirts saying: \u201cToxic Masculinity Ruins the Party Once Again,\u201d a phrase which can also be found emblazoned on greeting cards. \u201cWe get some great gifts,\u201d says Kilgariff. \u201cTrophies, very funny things, one woman even made a diorama of us sitting recording the podcast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was wild,\u201d says Hardstark. \u201cSo much of the stuff we get makes us laugh out loud. The listeners are so clever and funny and weird and cool.\u201d</p> <p>Kilgariff starts laughing. \u201cThe best was one lady who told us we could quit any time\u2026 She meant it in a lovely way. She just grabbed both of us and said: \u2018You don\u2019t have to do this, you can stop at any time.\u2019\u201d Given that it\u2019s been two years from podcast to bestselling book, the whole thing must feel like being on a rollercoaster. Hardstark laughs: \u201cWe know it can\u2019t last, so it\u2019s all about having as much fun as we can while it does. It\u2019s been a life-changing experience, but we know how fortunate we are so we\u2019re just enjoying the ride and getting high off it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think we should just keep doing it until we burn out completely,\u201d Kilgariff says with perfect deadpan delivery. \u201cAlthough, really, we have no choice but to do a musical. We don\u2019t want to and it\u2019s not a good idea, but we\u2019re almost certainly going to have to. It is what it is.\u201d</p> <p><em>Stay Sexy &amp; Don\u2019t Get Murdered by Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark </em><em>(Orion Books</em><em>, \u00a314.99) is available from <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/stay-sexy-and-don-t-get-murdered-9781409177968.html\" title=\"\">guardianbookshop.com</a> </em><em>for \u00a313.19</em></p>",

Both women are \u201ccollege drop-outs\u201d who understand what it feels like to struggle to pay the rent. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have the ability to bullshit, so from the start all we could do was talk honestly about our own experiences,\u201d Kilgariff says. \u201cEveryone\u2019s done shit in the past that they\u2019ve regretted, or had moments they wish they\u2019d approached differently. For us, saying that out loud wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d \u201cOne of the hardest things in the world is when you can\u2019t connect, or think that no one is listening to you,\u201d Hardstark adds. \u201cI think what works is that we\u2019re not ashamed of saying when things have gone wrong.\u201d The podcast\u2019s most devoted fans, who describe themselves as \u201cMurderinos\u201d, have credited Kilgariff and Hardstark with helping them deal with their own issues. The duo are very careful to focus on mental health awareness and try their best to ensure that amid the bleak recounting of brutal crimes there is always hope. \u201cWhen we started we thought that people would want to talk about the murders, but actually it\u2019s the other stuff they want to talk about,\u201d Hardstark says. \u201cThey come up to us and say: \u2018I had this stuff happen in my life, too,\u2019 or: \u2018You made me more aware of this.\u2019 We have people talk to us about how the podcast has helped them feel better.\u201d Some of the responses, she says, have blown them away. \u201cIt can range from the really heavy to the amazing. We have people who come up and say that listening to the podcast has given them the push they needed to change their studies, and people who say that it\u2019s led to them talking to their mother again \u2013 and both those things are equally monumental. It\u2019s incredible that making some jokes and talking about our lives can inspire people in that way.\u201d Not that the \u201ccult\u201d (as Hardstark and Kilgariff jokingly describe it) is all about self-care and good advice. Murderinos fully embrace both the macabre and the sharp sense of humour, turning up to the arena events with dresses adorned with murder weapons and wearing T-shirts saying: \u201cToxic Masculinity Ruins the Party Once Again,\u201d a phrase which can also be found emblazoned on greeting cards. \u201cWe get some great gifts,\u201d says Kilgariff. \u201cTrophies, very funny things, one woman even made a diorama of us sitting recording the podcast.\u201d \u201cThat was wild,\u201d says Hardstark. \u201cSo much of the stuff we get makes us laugh out loud. The listeners are so clever and funny and weird and cool.\u201d Kilgariff starts laughing. \u201cThe best was one lady who told us we could quit any time\u2026 She meant it in a lovely way. She just grabbed both of us and said: \u2018You don\u2019t have to do this, you can stop at any time.\u2019\u201d Given that it\u2019s been two years from podcast to bestselling book, the whole thing must feel like being on a rollercoaster. Hardstark laughs: \u201cWe know it can\u2019t last, so it\u2019s all about having as much fun as we can while it does. It\u2019s been a life-changing experience, but we know how fortunate we are so we\u2019re just enjoying the ride and getting high off it.\u201d \u201cI think we should just keep doing it until we burn out completely,\u201d Kilgariff says with perfect deadpan delivery. \u201cAlthough, really, we have no choice but to do a musical. We don\u2019t want to and it\u2019s not a good idea, but we\u2019re almost certainly going to have to. It is what it is.\u201d Stay Sexy &amp; Don\u2019t Get Murdered by Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark (Orion Books, \u00a314.99) is available from guardianbookshop.com for \u00a313.19",

      "body": "<p>Diego Maradona didn\u2019t know it would be his last match for Barcelona. It was the final of the Spanish Cup against Athletic Bilbao in May 1984, but from the start, it went badly: he was relentlessly hacked at by the opposition, including a man not long christened \u201cthe Butcher of Bilbao\u201d for a tackle on Maradona that almost ended his career, and racially abused by the crowd. On the final whistle, Bar\u00e7a had lost 1-0 and he received more taunts, this time from the Bilbao players. Now he cracked. He launched an extravagant kung-fu kick at one of them and knocked another out cold with his knee. The brawl escalated and became one of the most infamous in football history. Eric Cantona\u2019s 1995 lunge into the crowd looks tame in comparison. King Juan Carlos and more than half of Spain watched as Maradona, his shirt in tatters, was dragged off the pitch.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t the first problem Maradona, then 23, had encountered at Barcelona, either. The club chastised him for going out too much. He replied that it was none of their business. He took cocaine for the first time in a nightclub there. \u201cOne hit,\u201d he remembers in Asif Kapadia\u2019s engrossing new feature-length documentary <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/20/diego-maradona-review-asif-kapadia-documentary-cannes-film-festival\" title=\"\">Diego Maradona</a></em>, \u201cand I felt like Superman.\u201d The Argentine was brilliant, no question, but he had to go. The question was: who would have him?</p> <p>The answer was SSC Napoli. Back then, Napoli were not one of the world\u2019s great teams \u2013 they had never even won a league title. The club entered each season more content to dodge relegation than chase honours. \u201cIt was the equivalent of [Lionel] Messi going to Nottingham Forest,\u201d says Kapadia, whose previous films <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/05/ayrton-senna-alain-prost\" title=\"\">Senna</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/05/amy-winehouse-documentary-asif-kapadia-review\" title=\"\">Amy</a></em> won three Baftas and an Oscar and revolutionised feature documentaries. \u201cBut Nottingham Forest have won something. Let\u2019s say Plymouth. It\u2019s that thing where if you wrote it down, no one would believe it, because it will never happen again.\u201d</p> <p>Maradona didn\u2019t have any choice: Napoli were the only club willing to pay his fee of \u00a36.9m, then a record. On the flight to Italy, he told reporters of his hope for a fresh start in Naples. \u201cI expect peace,\u201d he said, \u201cthe peace I didn\u2019t have in Barcelona. But, above all, respect.\u201d</p> <p>Looking around Naples today, searching out some of Maradona\u2019s old haunts with Fiammetta Luino, a translator and archivist on Kapadia\u2019s film, the city has a lot going for it. In the 17th and 18th centuries, it was renowned as the place to study opera. Naples has long been home to some of the world\u2019s most skilled tailors. It is one of the great food destinations: a city that maybe didn\u2019t invent pizza but perfected it and one that certainly pioneered the delicacy that is fried pizza. It is poorer and, yes, dirtier than Italian cities in the north, but also wilder: more primal, less buttoned-up. Its dialect is theatrical and full of passion. Children bomb down dark alleys on scooters, eschewing helmets as a point of pride. People you\u2019ve just met buy you coffee. Under your feet are tunnels used by gangsters to avoid detection. Maradona might be the first person in history who came to Naples searching for \u201cpeace\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8f5a17b08976d636a9077ba08ab6a897a67c9012\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f5a17b08976d636a9077ba08ab6a897a67c9012/0_67_3543_2127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maradona during a Serie A match between Napoli and Juventus in 1985.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maradona during a Serie A match between Napoli and Juventus in 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefano Montesi/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was especially true in 1984 when he arrived. Four years earlier, the Irpinia earthquake had killed about 2,500 people and left 250,000 homeless in the region. In the aftermath, the local Camorra crime syndicate had become more powerful than ever: they hogged the funds set aside for rebuilding the area and tightened their grip on the construction industry. A turf war started that ran throughout the 1980s. \u201cEvery day in those years, there was a murder in Naples,\u201d Simone Di Meo, an investigative journalist who specialises in the Camorra, tells me over a bicerin in the very grand Galleria Umberto I in central Naples, a location picked because it is open and very public, something a man with powerful enemies has to keep in mind. \u201cSo that gives you an idea of the scale of the fighting.\u201d</p> <p>In those years, Di Meo says, \u201cNaples was a city that lived waiting for Sunday\u201d \u2013 that is, match day. Opposition fans would wave bags of rubbish in their direction; those were the nice ones. The nasty ones sang songs with lyrics such as: \u201cSick with cholera. Victims of the earthquake. You never washed with soap. You are the shame of the whole of Italy!\u201d</p> <p>Luino says: \u201cIn Naples, there is a strong belief in the idea of a saviour who comes from outside the city and redeems the people who live there. It all started with San Gennaro, the patron saint, who saved the city when Vesuvius was erupting by changing the direction of the wind.\u201d</p> <p>Kapadia agrees. \u201cDiego and Naples are perfect for one another,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like he is Neapolitan and he found his home. So he has this awful time in Barcelona and he left there, he\u2019s rock bottom and he goes to Naples and suddenly there\u2019s all this love. And he\u2019s like, \u2018Perfect!\u2019 The problem is that you can\u2019t switch it off: the touchy-feeliness, the intensity of the place, the absolute obsession with football.\u201d</p> <p>A troubled, charismatic man lands in a troubled, charismatic city. Maradona would spend seven years in Naples, the longest and most fecund period of his career: he won two league titles, various cups, including the 1986 World Cup with Argentina, and proved definitively that he was the great player of his era. But it was also disastrous for him personally: he became mixed up with the Camorra, had chaotic personal relationships, multiple infidelities and developed a full-blown addiction to cocaine.</p> <p>\u201cIt does go wrong there,\u201d Kapadia goes on. \u201cDiego already had that tendency of excess: when he goes out dancing, he\u2019s going to keep going dancing. If he\u2019s going to go partying, he\u2019s going to party. If he\u2019s going to do something, he\u2019s going to keep doing it. He does everything to the max.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"959b39750740ce4ec9e423b6ef5473481dfe6c38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/959b39750740ce4ec9e423b6ef5473481dfe6c38/0_113_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enduring love: Napoli fans with a banner of Maradona in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enduring love: Napoli fans with a banner of Maradona in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cesare Abbate/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kapadia was approached about making a film about Maradona in 2012. A producer, Paul Martin, had unearthed hundreds of hours of candid footage shot on U-matic video between 1981 and 1987. Jorge Cyterszpiler, Maradona\u2019s agent, imagined they would make a film of it, but he was fired before he could realise the project. Kapadia liked the idea of finishing the job Cyterszpiler started, but he\u2019d not long completed <em>Senna</em>, his documentary on the Brazilian F1 driver <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/apr/30/ayrton-senna-death-formula-one-20-years\" title=\"\">Ayrton Senna</a>, and he felt it was too soon to return to sport and South American tragi-heroes. He made <em>Amy</em>, about Amy Winehouse, instead.</p> <p>In 2015, with an Oscar and Bafta for <em>Amy</em>, to add to the two Baftas <em>Senna </em>won \u2013 and also with the commercial heft of having made the two highest-grossing British documentaries ever \u2013 Kapadia returned to Diego Maradona. By this stage, his signature style was well-established (and widely emulated). He made immersive, densely researched films that eschewed talking heads in favour of archive footage and previously unseen home videos. Action is slowed, sound effects heightened. He describes his films as \u201cmosaics\u201d and compares them to pop art; this approach to documentaries, Kapadia says, owes more to the fact that his early films were art projects made at the Royal College of Art than a radical desire to subvert the genre.</p> <p>Kapadia, who is 47 and from north London, calls <em>Diego Maradona</em> the final instalment of a trilogy. Personally, it was the hardest of the three films to make, both practically and emotionally. \u201cHe\u2019s a really hard one to pin down, Diego,\u201d says Kapadia. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of trying to nail jelly on the wall, because the minute you think you\u2019ve got something, he\u2019ll do something else. So it\u2019s been a really challenging project to try to get the essence of this man. In a way, Senna was consistently charismatic and incredible, amazing and eloquent. I just fell in love with Ayrton Senna and people who see the film fall in love with him.</p> <p>\u201cAmy is like the inverse,\u201d he continues, \u201cbecause she was amazing, but the whole thing around her was a mess. And she was lost. And she needed love and she needed attention and sadly everyone that she went to, or who went to her, seemed to be not great for her. And Diego is a bit of both. Wherever he goes, he also creates trouble. If there isn\u2019t trouble, he\u2019ll make it or he\u2019ll search it out. But I like him\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I ever fell in love with him, the same way I did with Amy and Ayrton Senna, because he\u2019s not easy to love. But I do feel for him.\u201d</p> <p>Early on, Kapadia realised he had enough original material \u2013 and a compelling-enough protagonist \u2013 to make a long film for television, similar in scope to <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/04/oj-made-in-america-ezra-edelman\" title=\"\">OJ: Made in America</a></em>, which ran for seven hours 47 minutes and won the Oscar for best documentary in 2017. A story that would follow Maradona from his upbringing in one of the poorest, most miserable slums of Buenos Aires and tell how a player with no physical advantages became the best in the world, through his relentless controversies to the present day. But, ultimately, Kapadia decided against working with a TV channel or streaming platform and <em>Diego Maradona</em> is a tight two hours 10 minutes and will be released first in cinemas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cd05a5c69ebc29c227b499620906338bdc85cb33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd05a5c69ebc29c227b499620906338bdc85cb33/0_94_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mural depicting the infamous \u201cHand of God\u201dgoal scored by Maradona against England at the World Cup finals in 1986.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mural depicting the infamous \u201cHand of God\u201d goal scored by Maradona against England at the World Cup finals in 1986.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe honest truth is: I\u2019m old-fashioned, I\u2019m a movie guy,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cI love going to the cinema. I love being engrossed in a dark space with a group of people and experiencing something collective. I know also that I\u2019m not the best person at watching 10 hours on TV. I fall asleep, I check my email, I\u2019m on Twitter. I\u2019ll suddenly have an urge for chocolate or a biscuit or something. I\u2019m human, I\u2019m not able to do it. I don\u2019t have the time to watch 10 hours on every subject. I never get to the ending of most of them. For me, it\u2019s that Mark Twain line: \u2018I didn\u2019t have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Besides, Kapadia had started to notice a pattern in Maradona\u2019s behaviour: \u201cdeath and resurrection\u201d, as the Argentinian\u2019s biographer Daniel Arcucci calls it. It happens at every club he played for, in every job he\u2019s had since he retired. \u201cHis life is a series of cycles,\u201d says Kapadia. \u201cHe goes somewhere. He\u2019s a great hero. He does something brilliant. They love him! It all goes a little bit wrong. Someone tries to control him. He says, \u2018Don\u2019t tell me what to do!\u2019 It ends in disaster. He leaves. He\u2019s rock bottom. His career\u2019s over. He goes somewhere else, starts again. He\u2019s a great hero\u2026</p> <p>\u201cI spend a lot of time with my brilliant team making these films. Because we\u2019ve done all the work for you. I\u2019m not gonna expect you to watch 10 hours of it. I want you to watch the essence of it. And his time in Naples was the greatest cycle of Diego Maradona\u2019s life.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty-eight years after he left Naples, Diego Maradona still looms large in the city. He features on two giant murals that cover the sides of buildings: one was completed in the 1980s and is given regular touch-ups; the other was done in 2017 by the street artist Jorit Agoch. Maradona\u2019s face appears everywhere on scarves and posters; in Bar Nilo, in the old town, there are a couple of strands of his hair behind glass like a holy relic. The owner tells me that he flew to Milan to watch Napoli play and happened to be on the same flight home as the team. As he walked past Maradona\u2019s seat, he scooped up the hair and popped it in a cigarette packet.</p> <p>\u201cNaples is full of votives for saints and I played on that idea,\u201d he says. \u201cThough, for sure, he\u2019s not a saint to you English people.\u201d</p> <p>The bar owner is, naturally, talking about the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/dec/10/diego-maradona-hand-of-god-referees-feud\" title=\"\">Hand of God</a>\u201d incident: the quarter-final of the 1986 World Cup that Argentina won 2-1 against England, with Maradona contributing both the most sneaky and sublime of goals. For Maradona, scoring with his fist was never a particularly big deal \u2013 he\u2019d done it ever since he was a kid, in fact \u2013 but the 1986 World Cup did represent a significant moment for him: it was his chance, he felt, to prove that he was the best player in the world. Some felt he arrived in Mexico in the shadow of France\u2019s Michel Platini and Brazil\u2019s Zico, but after leading a mediocre Argentina to victory, the debate was settled.</p> <p>\u201cWe tend to think he\u2019s always been the best player, but he wasn\u2019t,\u201d says Arcucci, who has interviewed Maradona since the 1980s. \u201cHe <em>became</em> the best player in Mexico in \u201986. And if you want to summarise the whole Maradona myth, you can do it through this game against England. At the time, he said it was nothing but a football game, but that was a lie. Ten years after, he confessed that it was a revenge, that he was taking revenge for the soldiers who\u2019d died in the Falklands war.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"79743a423db7366ec90a2a2dc0906b9c20835f0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79743a423db7366ec90a2a2dc0906b9c20835f0b/0_0_2894_1737/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Footage from the film showing the young Maradona at home in Argentina, 1980.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Footage from the film showing the young Maradona at home in Argentina, 1980.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cannes Film Festival</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At this year\u2019s Cannes film festival, where <em>Diego Maradona</em> had its premiere, footage of his second goal, where he ties the England team in one giant knot, received a spontaneous ovation. \u201cEveryone started clapping,\u201d recalls Kapadia, before musing, tongue in cheek: \u201cI wonder if that happens a lot in England? We\u2019ll see.\u201d</p> <p>Once Maradona had left Napoli in 1991, after ignominiously failing a drugs test, neither the player nor club returned to the same heights. \u201cYou have to bear in mind that Naples is a city that eats up \u2013 devours! \u2013 its own heroes, its legends,\u201d explains Di Meo. Not long after Maradona\u2019s departure, Napoli were relegated and then declared bankrupt. Maradona, meanwhile, moved into management after retiring, with reliably mixed results. He is currently the boss of a second-division Mexican team, Dorados de Sinaloa, who he led to the brink of promotion this year before losing a second-leg, winner-takes-all match in extra time. \u201cDorados is my home,\u201d he said recently, echoing comments he\u2019s made regularly throughout his career. \u201cDorados is pure life.\u201d</p> <p>Even now, Maradona remains reliable tabloid material. A couple of weeks ago, he was reportedly detained at Buenos Aires airport, returning from Mexico, and presented with a charge to appear in court: his ex-girlfriend Rocio Oliva claims that he owes her \u00a35m. In March, he finally acknowledged the paternity of three children born in Cuba, where he went to treat his cocaine addiction between 2000 and 2005; the 58-year-old is now the father of eight.</p> <p>For Kapadia, it\u2019s all another round of \u201cdeath and resurrection\u201d. \u201cIf you understand where he\u2019s from, then you will look at him differently,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if you\u2019re the most ardent, hardcore England fan who was in the stadium in Mexico in 1986, who felt ripped off. You look at him and think, \u2018Man, how can you survive that experience? How can anyone come out the other end?\u2019 And what I\u2019ll give him: he\u2019s a street fighter because he\u2019s still going. The number of times he\u2019s been knocked down, the number of times he\u2019s literally died!

      "bodyText": "Diego Maradona didn\u2019t know it would be his last match for Barcelona. It was the final of the Spanish Cup against Athletic Bilbao in May 1984, but from the start, it went badly: he was relentlessly hacked at by the opposition, including a man not long christened \u201cthe Butcher of Bilbao\u201d for a tackle on Maradona that almost ended his career, and racially abused by the crowd. On the final whistle, Bar\u00e7a had lost 1-0 and he received more taunts, this time from the Bilbao players. Now he cracked. He launched an extravagant kung-fu kick at one of them and knocked another out cold with his knee. The brawl escalated and became one of the most infamous in football history. Eric Cantona\u2019s 1995 lunge into the crowd looks tame in comparison. King Juan Carlos and more than half of Spain watched as Maradona, his shirt in tatters, was dragged off the pitch. It wasn\u2019t the first problem Maradona, then 23, had encountered at Barcelona, either. The club chastised him for going out too much. He replied that it was none of their business. He took cocaine for the first time in a nightclub there. \u201cOne hit,\u201d he remembers in Asif Kapadia\u2019s engrossing new feature-length documentary Diego Maradona, \u201cand I felt like Superman.\u201d The Argentine was brilliant, no question, but he had to go. The question was: who would have him? The answer was SSC Napoli. Back then, Napoli were not one of the world\u2019s great teams \u2013 they had never even won a league title. The club entered each season more content to dodge relegation than chase honours. \u201cIt was the equivalent of [Lionel] Messi going to Nottingham Forest,\u201d says Kapadia, whose previous films Senna and Amy won three Baftas and an Oscar and revolutionised feature documentaries. \u201cBut Nottingham Forest have won something. Let\u2019s say Plymouth. It\u2019s that thing where if you wrote it down, no one would believe it, because it will never happen again.\u201d Maradona didn\u2019t have any choice: Napoli were the only club willing to pay his fee of \u00a36.9m, then a record. On the flight to Italy, he told reporters of his hope for a fresh start in Naples. \u201cI expect peace,\u201d he said, \u201cthe peace I didn\u2019t have in Barcelona. But, above all, respect.\u201d Looking around Naples today, searching out some of Maradona\u2019s old haunts with Fiammetta Luino, a translator and archivist on Kapadia\u2019s film, the city has a lot going for it. In the 17th and 18th centuries, it was renowned as the place to study opera. Naples has long been home to some of the world\u2019s most skilled tailors. It is one of the great food destinations: a city that maybe didn\u2019t invent pizza but perfected it and one that certainly pioneered the delicacy that is fried pizza. It is poorer and, yes, dirtier than Italian cities in the north, but also wilder: more primal, less buttoned-up. Its dialect is theatrical and full of passion. Children bomb down dark alleys on scooters, eschewing helmets as a point of pride. People you\u2019ve just met buy you coffee. Under your feet are tunnels used by gangsters to avoid detection. Maradona might be the first person in history who came to Naples searching for \u201cpeace\u201d. This was especially true in 1984 when he arrived. Four years earlier, the Irpinia earthquake had killed about 2,500 people and left 250,000 homeless in the region. In the aftermath, the local Camorra crime syndicate had become more powerful than ever: they hogged the funds set aside for rebuilding the area and tightened their grip on the construction industry. A turf war started that ran throughout the 1980s. \u201cEvery day in those years, there was a murder in Naples,\u201d Simone Di Meo, an investigative journalist who specialises in the Camorra, tells me over a bicerin in the very grand Galleria Umberto I in central Naples, a location picked because it is open and very public, something a man with powerful enemies has to keep in mind. \u201cSo that gives you an idea of the scale of the fighting.\u201d In those years, Di Meo says, \u201cNaples was a city that lived waiting for Sunday\u201d \u2013 that is, match day. Opposition fans would wave bags of rubbish in their direction; those were the nice ones. The nasty ones sang songs with lyrics such as: \u201cSick with cholera. Victims of the earthquake. You never washed with soap. You are the shame of the whole of Italy!\u201d Luino says: \u201cIn Naples, there is a strong belief in the idea of a saviour who comes from outside the city and redeems the people who live there. It all started with San Gennaro, the patron saint, who saved the city when Vesuvius was erupting by changing the direction of the wind.\u201d Kapadia agrees. \u201cDiego and Naples are perfect for one another,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like he is Neapolitan and he found his home. So he has this awful time in Barcelona and he left there, he\u2019s rock bottom and he goes to Naples and suddenly there\u2019s all this love. And he\u2019s like, \u2018Perfect!\u2019 The problem is that you can\u2019t switch it off: the touchy-feeliness, the intensity of the place, the absolute obsession with football.\u201d A troubled, charismatic man lands in a troubled, charismatic city. Maradona would spend seven years in Naples, the longest and most fecund period of his career: he won two league titles, various cups, including the 1986 World Cup with Argentina, and proved definitively that he was the great player of his era. But it was also disastrous for him personally: he became mixed up with the Camorra, had chaotic personal relationships, multiple infidelities and developed a full-blown addiction to cocaine. \u201cIt does go wrong there,\u201d Kapadia goes on. \u201cDiego already had that tendency of excess: when he goes out dancing, he\u2019s going to keep going dancing. If he\u2019s going to go partying, he\u2019s going to party. If he\u2019s going to do something, he\u2019s going to keep doing it. He does everything to the max.\u201d Kapadia was approached about making a film about Maradona in 2012. A producer, Paul Martin, had unearthed hundreds of hours of candid footage shot on U-matic video between 1981 and 1987. Jorge Cyterszpiler, Maradona\u2019s agent, imagined they would make a film of it, but he was fired before he could realise the project. Kapadia liked the idea of finishing the job Cyterszpiler started, but he\u2019d not long completed Senna, his documentary on the Brazilian F1 driver Ayrton Senna, and he felt it was too soon to return to sport and South American tragi-heroes. He made Amy, about Amy Winehouse, instead. In 2015, with an Oscar and Bafta for Amy, to add to the two Baftas Senna won \u2013 and also with the commercial heft of having made the two highest-grossing British documentaries ever \u2013 Kapadia returned to Diego Maradona. By this stage, his signature style was well-established (and widely emulated). He made immersive, densely researched films that eschewed talking heads in favour of archive footage and previously unseen home videos. Action is slowed, sound effects heightened. He describes his films as \u201cmosaics\u201d and compares them to pop art; this approach to documentaries, Kapadia says, owes more to the fact that his early films were art projects made at the Royal College of Art than a radical desire to subvert the genre. Kapadia, who is 47 and from north London, calls Diego Maradona the final instalment of a trilogy. Personally, it was the hardest of the three films to make, both practically and emotionally. \u201cHe\u2019s a really hard one to pin down, Diego,\u201d says Kapadia. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of trying to nail jelly on the wall, because the minute you think you\u2019ve got something, he\u2019ll do something else. So it\u2019s been a really challenging project to try to get the essence of this man. In a way, Senna was consistently charismatic and incredible, amazing and eloquent. I just fell in love with Ayrton Senna and people who see the film fall in love with him. \u201cAmy is like the inverse,\u201d he continues, \u201cbecause she was amazing, but the whole thing around her was a mess. And she was lost. And she needed love and she needed attention and sadly everyone that she went to, or who went to her, seemed to be not great for her. And Diego is a bit of both. Wherever he goes, he also creates trouble. If there isn\u2019t trouble, he\u2019ll make it or he\u2019ll search it out. But I like him\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I ever fell in love with him, the same way I did with Amy and Ayrton Senna, because he\u2019s not easy to love. But I do feel for him.\u201d Early on, Kapadia realised he had enough original material \u2013 and a compelling-enough protagonist \u2013 to make a long film for television, similar in scope to OJ: Made in America, which ran for seven hours 47 minutes and won the Oscar for best documentary in 2017. A story that would follow Maradona from his upbringing in one of the poorest, most miserable slums of Buenos Aires and tell how a player with no physical advantages became the best in the world, through his relentless controversies to the present day. But, ultimately, Kapadia decided against working with a TV channel or streaming platform and Diego Maradona is a tight two hours 10 minutes and will be released first in cinemas. \u201cThe honest truth is: I\u2019m old-fashioned, I\u2019m a movie guy,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cI love going to the cinema. I love being engrossed in a dark space with a group of people and experiencing something collective. I know also that I\u2019m not the best person at watching 10 hours on TV. I fall asleep, I check my email, I\u2019m on Twitter. I\u2019ll suddenly have an urge for chocolate or a biscuit or something. I\u2019m human, I\u2019m not able to do it. I don\u2019t have the time to watch 10 hours on every subject. I never get to the ending of most of them. For me, it\u2019s that Mark Twain line: \u2018I didn\u2019t have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.\u2019\u201d Besides, Kapadia had started to notice a pattern in Maradona\u2019s behaviour: \u201cdeath and resurrection\u201d, as the Argentinian\u2019s biographer Daniel Arcucci calls it. It happens at every club he played for, in every job he\u2019s had since he retired. \u201cHis life is a series of cycles,\u201d says Kapadia. \u201cHe goes somewhere. He\u2019s a great hero. He does something brilliant. They love him! It all goes a little bit wrong. Someone tries to control him. He says, \u2018Don\u2019t tell me what to do!\u2019 It ends in disaster. He leaves. He\u2019s rock bottom. His career\u2019s over. He goes somewhere else, starts again. He\u2019s a great hero\u2026 \u201cI spend a lot of time with my brilliant team making these films. Because we\u2019ve done all the work for you. I\u2019m not gonna expect you to watch 10 hours of it. I want you to watch the essence of it. And his time in Naples was the greatest cycle of Diego Maradona\u2019s life.\u201d Twenty-eight years after he left Naples, Diego Maradona still looms large in the city. He features on two giant murals that cover the sides of buildings: one was completed in the 1980s and is given regular touch-ups; the other was done in 2017 by the street artist Jorit Agoch. Maradona\u2019s face appears everywhere on scarves and posters; in Bar Nilo, in the old town, there are a couple of strands of his hair behind glass like a holy relic. The owner tells me that he flew to Milan to watch Napoli play and happened to be on the same flight home as the team. As he walked past Maradona\u2019s seat, he scooped up the hair and popped it in a cigarette packet. \u201cNaples is full of votives for saints and I played on that idea,\u201d he says. \u201cThough, for sure, he\u2019s not a saint to you English people.\u201d The bar owner is, naturally, talking about the \u201cHand of God\u201d incident: the quarter-final of the 1986 World Cup that Argentina won 2-1 against England, with Maradona contributing both the most sneaky and sublime of goals. For Maradona, scoring with his fist was never a particularly big deal \u2013 he\u2019d done it ever since he was a kid, in fact \u2013 but the 1986 World Cup did represent a significant moment for him: it was his chance, he felt, to prove that he was the best player in the world. Some felt he arrived in Mexico in the shadow of France\u2019s Michel Platini and Brazil\u2019s Zico, but after leading a mediocre Argentina to victory, the debate was settled. \u201cWe tend to think he\u2019s always been the best player, but he wasn\u2019t,\u201d says Arcucci, who has interviewed Maradona since the 1980s. \u201cHe became the best player in Mexico in \u201986. And if you want to summarise the whole Maradona myth, you can do it through this game against England. At the time, he said it was nothing but a football game, but that was a lie. Ten years after, he confessed that it was a revenge, that he was taking revenge for the soldiers who\u2019d died in the Falklands war.\u201d At this year\u2019s Cannes film festival, where Diego Maradona had its premiere, footage of his second goal, where he ties the England team in one giant knot, received a spontaneous ovation. \u201cEveryone started clapping,\u201d recalls Kapadia, before musing, tongue in cheek: \u201cI wonder if that happens a lot in England? We\u2019ll see.\u201d Once Maradona had left Napoli in 1991, after ignominiously failing a drugs test, neither the player nor club returned to the same heights. \u201cYou have to bear in mind that Naples is a city that eats up \u2013 devours! \u2013 its own heroes, its legends,\u201d explains Di Meo. Not long after Maradona\u2019s departure, Napoli were relegated and then declared bankrupt. Maradona, meanwhile, moved into management after retiring, with reliably mixed results. He is currently the boss of a second-division Mexican team, Dorados de Sinaloa, who he led to the brink of promotion this year before losing a second-leg, winner-takes-all match in extra time. \u201cDorados is my home,\u201d he said recently, echoing comments he\u2019s made regularly throughout his career. \u201cDorados is pure life.\u201d Even now, Maradona remains reliable tabloid material. A couple of weeks ago, he was reportedly detained at Buenos Aires airport, returning from Mexico, and presented with a charge to appear in court: his ex-girlfriend Rocio Oliva claims that he owes her \u00a35m. In March, he finally acknowledged the paternity of three children born in Cuba, where he went to treat his cocaine addiction between 2000 and 2005; the 58-year-old is now the father of eight. For Kapadia, it\u2019s all another round of \u201cdeath and resurrection\u201d. \u201cIf you understand where he\u2019s from, then you will look at him differently,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if you\u2019re the most ardent, hardcore England fan who was in the stadium in Mexico in 1986, who felt ripped off. You look at him and think, \u2018Man, how can you survive that experience? How can anyone come out the other end?\u2019 And what I\u2019ll give him: he\u2019s a street fighter because he\u2019s still going. The number of times he\u2019s been knocked down, the number of times he\u2019s literally died! And he comes back again. \u201cWhile we were in Cannes someone said, \u2018He\u2019s come back more times than Jesus!\u2019 But Jesus has got nothing on him: this guy dies and comes back, dies and comes back every few years. He\u2019s amazing.\u201d Diego Maradona is released on 14 June",

Humanists UK\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Copson, said they had been startled by the increase in humanist weddings. \u201cWe knew from the huge popularity of our funerals that there was enormous public appetite for humanist ceremonies but the scale of the demand for weddings, especially in the last 15 years, has blown us away. \u201cIn a way it is a demonstration of what we know about today\u2019s society \u2013 many people are humanist in their approach to life without knowing the word. They\u2019re not religious but they want a ceremony at one of the most important moments in their lives that reflects the positive beliefs and values they hold.\u201d The veteran broadcaster and atheist campaigner Joan Bakewell backed Humanists UK\u2019s demand for the Department of Justice to allow couples\u2019 own wedding ceremonies to be legalised. \u201cIt is high time such marriages were given full recognition by the state \u2026 so that couples are not obliged to go through a civil registrar marriage as well, which are not only devoid of meaning for them, but take up unnecessary time and money,\u201d she said. Francis and Hicks said that while they were not religious, they wanted a special occasion that \u201ccelebrated the story of us, of our relationship and of our lives\u201d. Their ceremony at Patrick\u2019s Barn in Chiddinglye, West Sussex, amid hay bales and rows of Californian Redwood trees, will involve readings and lyrics from their favourite songs, including Wendy Cope\u2019s poem A Vow. As for their wedding rings, Francis said: \u201cWe want everyone gathered to pass our rings around, touch them, warm them, say words of love over them before they are passed back to us for that moment when we put them back on our fingers.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 June 2019. An earlier version implied that the figures for humanist weddings were recorded by the ONS. In fact they were compiled by Humanists UK.",

The new state ban is <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/ajc-poll-strong-support-for-roe-opinion-closer-heartbeat-bill/jWr5L1S5kooo7akOCkfzGM/\">opposed</a> by 48% of Georgians and supported by only 43%. So why would the legislature enact such an extreme measure?</p> <p>For that matter, why would Ohio, Alabama, Missouri and other states establish similar \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d laws that are far more restrictive than their constituents support?</p> <p>One important answer is gerrymandering: redistricting voting districts to give the party in power an edge \u2013 making it almost impossible for the other side to win a majority of seats, even with a majority of votes. Sophisticated geo-mapping software and voluminous voter data turned this ancient art into a hi-tech science when the US redistricted after the 2010 census.</p> <p>Republicans recognized the opportunity. Democrats snoozed. Nine years later, they\u2019re still paying the price, particularly in swing state legislatures. A little-known group called the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC) launched a devastatingly effective strategy called <a href=\"http://www.redistrictingmajorityproject.com/\">Redmap</a> \u2013 short for the Redistricting Majority Project. It <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/04/gops-house-seats-are-safe-heres-why.html\">dropped</a> $30m of dark money into sleepy local races, flipped legislative chambers blue to red, and gave Republicans control over drawing the vast majority of local legislative and US House seats \u2013 and with it, the power to remake the political playing field for the next decade.</p> <p>Republicans took such advantage that they have controlled state legislative supermajorities in otherwise competitive states even when voters prefer Democratic candidates by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/07/opinion/midterm-elections-2018-republican-gerrymandering.html\">hundreds of thousands of votes</a>. This nullifies elections and insulates lawmakers from a majority that seeks to vote them out of office.</p> <p>Despite lacking any mandate for an extreme agenda in a closely divided nation, Republican lawmakers<strong> </strong>have pushed through <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/29/the-smoking-gun-proving-north-carolina-republicans-tried-to-disenfranchise-black-voters/?utm_term=.36b0fa65da17\">new voting restrictions</a>, anti-labor laws, the <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/opinion/2019/05/02/author-what-partisan-gerrymandering-has-cost-michigan/3630232002/\">emergency manager bill</a> that led to poisoned water in Flint, Michigan, and now, these strict abortion bans. Electorally, there\u2019s little that Democrats can do to stop it.</p> <p>Just take a look at Georgia, where the ultra-competitive contest between Kemp and Abrams made national headlines and propelled the highest midterm voter turnout in the state\u2019s modern history. But while that race was decided by just a handful of votes, it was a completely different story in the down-ballot elections for the state\u2019s house and senate. Those districts were drawn to be so non-competitive that <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Georgia_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2018\">112 of the state\u2019s 180 house districts</a> \u2013 and <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Georgia_State_Senate_elections,_2018\">33 of the 56 state senate elections</a> \u2013 featured no major-party challenger. Voters literally had no choice at all.</p> <p>Or travel to Ohio, the longtime midwestern bellwether. There\u2019s also zero evidence that voters here have extreme opinions on abortion. Polls show that more voters are against the new \u201cheartbeat\u201d bill than for it, and Ohioans are clearly comfortable splitting their ballots in statewide races. In 2018, the state re-elected a pro-choice Democratic senator and an anti-abortion Republican governor. They divided their vote for the state\u2019s house and senate about as equally as possible: Republicans won <a href=\"https://expo.cleveland.com/news/erry-2018/11/0f32e762411182/ohio-democrats-outpolled-repub.html\">50.3%</a><a href=\"https://expo.cleveland.com/news/erry-2018/11/0f32e762411182/ohio-democrats-outpolled-repub.html\"> statewide</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the latest US opinion pieces every weekday\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4162\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for the Guardian US opinion email\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email of the latest opinion articles each evening\" data-form-campaign-code=\"US_opinion\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"We will send you the latest opinion articles every weekday evening\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive the latest US opinion pieces every weekday</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But thanks to what a University of Chicago study <a href=\"https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5857&amp;context=uclrev\">called</a> an \u201cuncommonly severe gerrymander\u201d, barely half the votes provided Republicans more than 63% of the seats. Once again, there\u2019s little that Democrats can do, simply because the maps were surgically designed to create so few competitive seats. In 2018, only <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Ohio_elections#General_Assembly\">six of 99 house elections</a> finished within five percentage points. Democrats could have won them all and still finished far short of control.</p> <p>In Alabama, meanwhile, a determined racial gerrymander packed black Democrats into as few seats as possible and diluted the African American vote. That legislature, seated after a sleazy money-laundering effort <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/republican-state-leadership-committee-memo-109680\">uncovered</a> by the RSLC\u2019s own attorneys, has passed the strictest abortion ban in the nation, one that polls show is too conservative <em>even for Alabama</em>. A recent survey found that only 31% of Alabama<strong> </strong>voters <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/18/18630562/alabama-abortion-ban-voters-exemption-for-rape-incest\">backed</a> abortion limits like this one, which provides no exception for rape or incest.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Voters are silenced at the ballot box, and then can be safely ignored by their legislatures</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is what happens when so many races are non-competitive. It means that the only action takes place in party primaries. They tend to be low-turnout elections that favor the most passionate partisans. That has three key effects: it sends more extreme members of both parties to state capitals, incentivizes them to fear compromise or anything that might earn a primary challenge, and it insulates them from voters almost no matter what they do.

      "bodyText": "Fifty-four thousand votes out of nearly 4 million. That\u2019s what separated Stacey Abrams from Brian Kemp in Georgia\u2019s 2018 gubernatorial election, a sign of how closely contested this once reliably red, southern state has become. Earlier this month, however, Georgia\u2019s legislature responded to the state\u2019s closely divided political climate not with thoughtful compromise but by passing one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the United States. An April poll by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that 70% of Georgians support the landmark Roe v Wade decision that legalized abortion. The new state ban is opposed by 48% of Georgians and supported by only 43%. So why would the legislature enact such an extreme measure? For that matter, why would Ohio, Alabama, Missouri and other states establish similar \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d laws that are far more restrictive than their constituents support? One important answer is gerrymandering: redistricting voting districts to give the party in power an edge \u2013 making it almost impossible for the other side to win a majority of seats, even with a majority of votes. Sophisticated geo-mapping software and voluminous voter data turned this ancient art into a hi-tech science when the US redistricted after the 2010 census. Republicans recognized the opportunity. Democrats snoozed. Nine years later, they\u2019re still paying the price, particularly in swing state legislatures. A little-known group called the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC) launched a devastatingly effective strategy called Redmap \u2013 short for the Redistricting Majority Project. It dropped $30m of dark money into sleepy local races, flipped legislative chambers blue to red, and gave Republicans control over drawing the vast majority of local legislative and US House seats \u2013 and with it, the power to remake the political playing field for the next decade. Republicans took such advantage that they have controlled state legislative supermajorities in otherwise competitive states even when voters prefer Democratic candidates by hundreds of thousands of votes. This nullifies elections and insulates lawmakers from a majority that seeks to vote them out of office. Despite lacking any mandate for an extreme agenda in a closely divided nation, Republican lawmakers have pushed through new voting restrictions, anti-labor laws, the emergency manager bill that led to poisoned water in Flint, Michigan, and now, these strict abortion bans. Electorally, there\u2019s little that Democrats can do to stop it. Just take a look at Georgia, where the ultra-competitive contest between Kemp and Abrams made national headlines and propelled the highest midterm voter turnout in the state\u2019s modern history. But while that race was decided by just a handful of votes, it was a completely different story in the down-ballot elections for the state\u2019s house and senate. Those districts were drawn to be so non-competitive that 112 of the state\u2019s 180 house districts \u2013 and 33 of the 56 state senate elections \u2013 featured no major-party challenger. Voters literally had no choice at all. Or travel to Ohio, the longtime midwestern bellwether. There\u2019s also zero evidence that voters here have extreme opinions on abortion. Polls show that more voters are against the new \u201cheartbeat\u201d bill than for it, and Ohioans are clearly comfortable splitting their ballots in statewide races. In 2018, the state re-elected a pro-choice Democratic senator and an anti-abortion Republican governor. They divided their vote for the state\u2019s house and senate about as equally as possible: Republicans won 50.3% statewide. But thanks to what a University of Chicago study called an \u201cuncommonly severe gerrymander\u201d, barely half the votes provided Republicans more than 63% of the seats. Once again, there\u2019s little that Democrats can do, simply because the maps were surgically designed to create so few competitive seats. In 2018, only six of 99 house elections finished within five percentage points. Democrats could have won them all and still finished far short of control. In Alabama, meanwhile, a determined racial gerrymander packed black Democrats into as few seats as possible and diluted the African American vote. That legislature, seated after a sleazy money-laundering effort uncovered by the RSLC\u2019s own attorneys, has passed the strictest abortion ban in the nation, one that polls show is too conservative even for Alabama. A recent survey found that only 31% of Alabama voters backed abortion limits like this one, which provides no exception for rape or incest. This is what happens when so many races are non-competitive. It means that the only action takes place in party primaries. They tend to be low-turnout elections that favor the most passionate partisans. That has three key effects: it sends more extreme members of both parties to state capitals, incentivizes them to fear compromise or anything that might earn a primary challenge, and it insulates them from voters almost no matter what they do. Voters are silenced at the ballot box, and then can be safely ignored by their legislatures. What, if anything, can voters do? It won\u2019t be easy. Last November, citizens in four states \u2013 including Missouri, home to yet another radical new abortion ban \u2013 passed ballot initiatives or constitutional amendments that shifted mapmaking powers away from self-interested partisans and toward independent commissions. In Missouri and Michigan, however, despite more than 60% of voters demanding an end to politicians choosing their own voters, these gerrymandered legislatures have taken steps to undermine the new initiatives. Several other states this year have made it significantly harder to put initiatives on the ballot. Four federal courts, meanwhile, have overturned entire statewide maps as unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders. The US supreme court, long reluctant to get involved in this political thicket, is expected to issue rulings in cases from Maryland and North Carolina in June. Whether or not the court takes action, it could take a generation to wash away the anti-majoritarian toxins that this decade\u2019s partisan gerrymanders intentionally injected into our hijacked politics.

This from AAP:</p> <p>A steeled Ashleigh Barty is sure she\u2019s ready to handle the occasion as she enters the second week of the French Open as a genuine contender in a wide open field.<br></p> <p>The Australian\u2019s path to a grand slam title on the Paris clay was turned on its head during a dramatic Saturday at Roland Garros, when both Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka fell.<br></p> <p>Eighth seed Barty was calm among the chaos, comfortably booking a maiden fourth-round appearance with a 6-3 6-1 defeat of former world No.9 Andrea Petkovic.<br></p> <p>Up next stop is a Monday tussle with Sofia Kenin, who blasted Williams off the court to the 10th seed\u2019s hunt for a record-equalling 24th major title.<br></p> <p>World No.1 Osaka had won the last two majors but her defeat means defending champion Simona Halep (third seed) is now the only higher-ranked woman between Barty and a Roland Garros final.<br></p> <p>She has now reached the final 16 of her last three grand slams, while an unbeaten run to the Fed Cup final and a title in Miami have corresponded with a steady rise into the world\u2019s top 10.<br></p> <p>\u201cI think overall, me being able to handle different occasions is getting better and better,\u201d Barty said.<br></p> <p>\u201cRegardless of whether it\u2019s a slam, a big tournament, Fed Cup, all of these different occasions I\u2019ve been thrown into, I feel like we\u2019ve been able to deal with it really well and, in a way, bring it back to the way I want to play and just simplify it.\u201d<br></p> <p>Barty is vying to become the first Australian champion in Paris since Margaret Court in 1973 but the level-headed 23-year-old isn\u2019t thinking beyond Monday.<br></p> <p>\u201c(Kenin) is an incredible competitor, she really is,\u201d Barty, who is now poised to enter the world\u2019s top five, said of the 20-year-old.<br></p> <p>\u201cI got a little bit of a taste of that at Fed Cup earlier this year.<br></p> <p>\u201cShe certainly respects every opponent but doesn\u2019t play their reputation.<br></p> <p>\u201cShe plays them just on the other side of the net and that\u2019s one of her best attributes.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an extremely tough match come Monday.\u201d<br></p> <p>First she will return to the courts on Sunday, due to partner Victoria Azarenka in the second round of women\u2019s doubles, having teamed with the former world No.1 to win in Rome last month.<br></p> <p>A current top-10 doubles player, Barty reached the final in Paris with compatriot Casey

      "bodyText": "AFL: it\u2019s all over in Perth, and the home side have given the visitors from Melbourne an absolute shellacking. Final score, West Coast 21.7 (133)-10.12 (72) Western Bulldogs. And that\u2019s all from me, too. Thank you for your company and comments today. Tennis: the French Open is continuing at Roland Garros and our liveblog there is in the hands of Daniel Harris. Cricket: if you\u2019re looking for the liveblog of the Bangladesh v South Africa game at the World Cup, Rob Smyth has got you covered. AFL: it\u2019s three-quarter time in Perth, and what was a tight game up to half-time, is no more. The homeboys have almost twice the score of the visitors from Melbourne. It\u2019s West Coast 16.5 (101)-7.10 (52) Western Bulldogs. Football: Andy Hunter has analysed J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s transformative effect at Liverpool over the past four years. \u201cEvery campaign under the 51-year-old has yielded progress.\u201d Cricket: Tanya Aldred has written a lovely piece about the joys of the Cricket World Cup. AFL: it\u2019s half-time in Perth in a tight game, and it\u2019s West Coast 7.3 (45)-4.10 (34) Western Bulldogs. NRL: it\u2019s all over in the Queensland derby. Final score, Gold Coast 4-6 North Queensland. From AAP: Brave Cowboys grind NRL win over Titans A last-gasp tackle in the corner by Kyle Feldt has secured an undermanned North Queensland a hard-fought NRL win over Gold Coast. The winger flung himself at Brian Kelly as the Titans\u2019 centre dived for the left corner on the fulltime siren, denying him the try and ensuring a 6-4 win for the Cowboys on Sunday at Cbus Super Stadium. Already going into the match without State of Origin players Michael Morgan and Josh McGuire, as well as injured pair Justin O\u2019Neill and Matt Scott, the Cowboys played the second half with just two fit players on the bench after Gideon Gela-Mosby (shoulder) and Corey Jensen (concussion) succumbed to injury. The loss is heartbreaking for the Titans, who had missed penalty goal shots through Ash Taylor and Tyrone Roberts to level at 6-6 and failed to register a point in the second half against their 15-man opponents. Dale Copley opened the scoring midway through the first half to set up a 4-0 halftime lead for the hosts, before Jason Taumalolo\u2019s burrowing effort in the second term put the Cowboys in front. The Titans kept coming at their flagging opponents, and had their first chance to tie up the scores when Feldt was penalised for blocking Copley when he was attempting to get under a high ball. Taylor shanked his kick well wide. With six minutes to go, the Titans believed they\u2019d broken the Cowboys\u2019 resistance when Kevin Proctor gathered a Roberts kick but the try was disallowed for a knock-on. Despite the four-pointer being ruled out, the Titans were given a penalty for Kurt Baptiste attacking the legs of Roberts, with the Cowboys\u2019 utility being placed on report. Taylor passed up the opportunity to take the resulting penalty goal, with Roberts steering his kick just wide. There was still time for one last Titans\u2019 charge with Tyrone Peachey\u2019s grubber and regather allowing him to fling the ball wide to Kelly with the tryline beckoning. Just as the home fans rose to their feet, however, Feldt came across to knock Kelly into touch and seal the Cowboys\u2019 third win in a row. The defeat leaves the Titans second last on the competition ladder with six points, while North Queensland move up to one of five teams around the top eight with 12 points. AFL: the second quarter has just started in the third game of the day. It\u2019s West Coast 19-19 Western Bulldogs. AFL: it\u2019s all over at the MCG. Final score, Essendon 11.8 (74)-4.9 (33) Carlton. From AAP: Bombers thump dire Blues in AFL slugfest A depleted Essendon have consigned AFL rivals Carlton to more misery, thumping the Blues by 41 points in a wet-weather grind at the MCG. Sunday\u2019s 11.8 (74) to 4.9 (33) defeat leaves the Blues with four wins from their past 43 games and fourth-year coach Brendon Bolton under growing pressure. Save for two Charlie Curnow majors in the third quarter, the Blues were held goalless after quarter-time in another dire showing. Bombers skipper Dyson Heppell (36 disposals, seven clearances) starred in the midfield, Anthony McDonald-Tipungwuti booted three majors and Michael Hurley and Cale Hooker\u2019s intercept marking was enormous down back. Second-gamer Dylan Clarke was given the task of tagging Patrick Cripps and performed admirably, restricting Cripps to just 11 touches and gathering 23 of his own. Ed Curnow\u2019s tagging job on Zach Merrett (22 disposals) was similarly effective but Heppell, Darcy Parish and Matt Guelfi continued to find the footy. Missing star quartet Dylan Shiel, Jake Stringer, Joe Daniher and Orazio Fantasia to injuries, the inconsistent Bombers looked ripe for the picking for a bottom-place Blues side desperate to bank their second win of the season. But the tone was set in the opening minutes when Nic Newman\u2019s kick-in went straight to Heppell to gift Essendon their first goal. The Bombers led narrowly at quarter-time, kicked three goals to none in the second term and did enough from there to deny Carlton momentum. By halftime, Carlton had 30 inside-50s but a score of just 2.4 as intercept-marking specialists Hurley and Hooker feasted on the Blues\u2019 dismal kicking. The Essendon duo had a combined 10 marks and 30 disposals by halftime. In a season of close finishes, the fact Carlton scored 0.1 in the fourth quarter when the margin was just 21 points at three-quarter time will only add to the many criticisms of the club and Bolton\u2019s coaching methods. With veteran Dale Thomas exiled to the VFL for an off-field incident and Mitch McGovern and Kade Simpson unavailable, the Blues recalled forgotten recruits Darcy Lang and Alex Fasolo. Lang finished with eight disposals and Fasolo six. Bottom-placed Carlton host Brisbane next Saturday then face the Western Bulldogs in their final game before their mid-season bye. NRL: there are 16 minutes left to go in the Queensland derby, but the game so far has not caused too much stress for whoever\u2019s doing the scoreboard. It\u2019s Gold Coast 4-6 North Queensland. AFL: it\u2019s early in the fourth quarter at the MCG and the Bombers are leading. Essendon 53-32 Carlton. AFL: it\u2019s all over in Shanghai in what was a very one-sided contest. Final score: St Kilda 9.15 (69)-22.7 (139) Port Adelaide. From AAP: Geary hurt again, Power shine in China AFL St Kilda captain Jarryn Geary has suffered another serious leg injury, with Port Adelaide mauling his team by 70 points at Jiangwan Stadium in China. Plagued by ill health before their first Shanghai match, the Saints\u2019 China crisis was capped on Sunday with the 22.7 (139) to 9.15 (69) belting. Geary returned in this match from surgery that left a gruesome scar on his right upper leg. He has a suspected fracture and has been taken to hospital for x-rays. He went down in the last quarter and could not put any weight on his right leg as two trainers helped him from the field. The fact that one of the AFL\u2019s toughest players was in agony was a bad sign. While the hospitality marquees at the ground were pumping in the warm and muggy weather, the grandstands were less than half full after a sellout crowd had been spruiked. Power Midfielder Travis Boak shone with 33 disposals and two goals. It is Port\u2019s highest score since round six in 2017 and their first 100 point-plus score this season gives them a 6-5 record heading into the bye. Port\u2019s China campaign is working beautifully on the field, with three convincing wins. The Saints had been playing with plenty of spirit before their first Shanghai trip, but this was a return to the worst of last year\u2019s struggles. They are 5-6 and have much to work on during their week off, especially in attack. They missed too many easy shots on goal and, eventually, the dam wall broke. The Saints only trailed by 15 points, 11 minutes into the second term, when Ben Long kicked a goal. Port then went on a nine-goal run. The Power also had struggled in attack before this game and the move of Dougal Howard into their forward line paid immediate dividends when he kicked the opening goal. Half-back Riley Bonner, Robbie Gray and St Kilda\u2019s Jade Gresham kicked three goals apiece. Bonner\u2019s recall freed Dan Houston for a move into the midfield and that also worked. Gray and Saints defender Josh Battle will come under review for a scuffle on the wing that also had drawn the attention of the emergency umpire. The last goal of the first half summed up the game - St Kilda could not stop a chain of handballs and Bonner snapped brilliantly on his non-preferred side. It was the sort of opportunist goal that St Kilda did not look like kicking. The bout of illness that hit St Kilda over the past couple of days forced two late changes. Defenders Dan McKenzie and Jonathon Marsh went out and Nick Coffield and Darragh Joyce took their spots. Ben Paton and Nick Hind arrived after a last-minute overnight flight in case other players didn\u2019t recover in time. Blake Acres also was ruled out on Friday because of a virus that he already had when the team arrived in Shanghai. Super Netball: it\u2019s all over in Sydney and the women from Western Sydney have prevailed. Final score: Giants 65-54 Thunderbirds. From AAP: Giants surge into Super Netball top four Australian pair Caitlin Bassett and Jamie-Lee Price have shown why they\u2019ll be major Diamonds assets in this year\u2019s World Cup, dominating as Giants Netball picked up a 65-54 win over the Adelaide Thunderbirds in Sydney. Bassett scored 31 points while national teammate Price was sensational in midcourt in a victory that inserts them back into the Super Netball top four. It was close for the majority of the opening half-hour, with both sides unwilling to give the other an inch, but the Giants took a slim advantage into the break after costly Thunderbirds errors and duly romped home. Jo Harten scored her 1000th Super Netball goal in the first quarter and put her side on the front foot for the entire hour, finishing with 32 points. The hosts extended their lead to eight points heading into three-quarter time as their stars up front delivered sublime shooting performances, while their urgency in defence continued to thwart Thunderbirds opportunities. It was not so pretty for the South Australians, meanwhile, with both Maria Folau and Sasha Glasgow struggling in front of goal. Both sides will be hungry for a win next weekend when they take on the West Coast Fever and Sunshine Coast Lightning respectively. Super Netball: the third quarter has just ended in Sydney and the women from Western Sydney have again widened their lead. It\u2019s Giants 49-41 Thunderbirds. AFL: back in Terra Australis, it\u2019s half-time and the score is not quite so dramatic. Essendon 5.4 (34)-2.4 (16) Carlton. AFL: it\u2019s three-quarter time in China and St Kilda are being shanghaied. It\u2019s St Kilda 7.10 (52)-18.3 (111) Port Adelaide. Super Netball: it\u2019s half-time in Sydney and the women from Western Sydney have widened their lead. It\u2019s Giants 32-27 Thunderbirds. AFL: the first quarter has just ended at the MCG and it\u2019s Essendon 2.3 (15)-2.2 (14) Carlton. Super Netball: it\u2019s quarter-time in the second netball game of the day and it\u2019s Giants 15-14 Thunderbirds. AFL: it\u2019s half-time in Shanghai and playing in China seems to suit the South Australian visitors. It\u2019s St Kilda 5.8 (38)-12.3 (75) Port Adelaide. Football: Andy Hunter reports that J\u00fcrgen Klopp was \u2018relieved and emotional\u2019 after Liverpool\u2019s Champions League win. Well, he would be, wouldn\u2019t he? AFL: it is quarter-time in Shanghai and it\u2019s the South Australians with the lead. St Kilda 3.4 (22)-5.3 (31) Port Adelaide. Super Netball: we have our first final score of the day, and it\u2019s a home win. Swifts 68-52 Magpies. From AAP: Super Sam takes Swifts to top of ladder Sam Wallace has continued her stellar Super Netball run of form, scoring 54 points as the NSW Swifts picked up a convincing 68-52 win over the Collingwood Magpies. The Trinidad and Tobago superstar was at her scintillating best at Qudos Bank Arena on Sunday and continues to grow in confidence, while her skipper Maddy Proud finished with a game-high 28 assists. The Swifts were able to jump out of the gates strongly in the first two quarters and got themselves out to an 11-point lead at one stage during the second quarter against a Magpies outfit struggling to make their mark. Wallace was responsible for the majority of the shooting for the hosts after a few uncharacteristic misses early on from Helen Housby. However the England national star was providing plenty of energy and finished the game with 16 assists. The visitors made three substitutions during the second quarter after a poor start across the court but Shimona Nelson was not letting any of that phase her as she reached 22 points by the break despite her side trailing heavily on the scoreboard. The Swifts took their lead to 11 points by the end of the third quarter and were in complete control of their opposition for most of the 60 minutes. It was a dominant win for the Swifts against a Magpies side sitting inside the competition\u2019s top four and the likes of Wallace and Proud will no doubt put the rest of the league on notice with their performances. Football: J\u00fcrgen Klopp and Liverpool are rightly praised by Barney Ronay at the Estadio Metropolitano. Tennis: Ashleigh Barty is emerging as a serious contender in France after overnight results. This from AAP: A steeled Ashleigh Barty is sure she\u2019s ready to handle the occasion as she enters the second week of the French Open as a genuine contender in a wide open field. The Australian\u2019s path to a grand slam title on the Paris clay was turned on its head during a dramatic Saturday at Roland Garros, when both Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka fell. Eighth seed Barty was calm among the chaos, comfortably booking a maiden fourth-round appearance with a 6-3 6-1 defeat of former world No.9 Andrea Petkovic. Up next stop is a Monday tussle with Sofia Kenin, who blasted Williams off the court to the 10th seed\u2019s hunt for a record-equalling 24th major title. World No.1 Osaka had won the last two majors but her defeat means defending champion Simona Halep (third seed) is now the only higher-ranked woman between Barty and a Roland Garros final. She has now reached the final 16 of her last three grand slams, while an unbeaten run to the Fed Cup final and a title in Miami have corresponded with a steady rise into the world\u2019s top 10. \u201cI think overall, me being able to handle different occasions is getting better and better,\u201d Barty said. \u201cRegardless of whether it\u2019s a slam, a big tournament, Fed Cup, all of these different occasions I\u2019ve been thrown into, I feel like we\u2019ve been able to deal with it really well and, in a way, bring it back to the way I want to play and just simplify it.\u201d Barty is vying to become the first Australian champion in Paris since Margaret Court in 1973 but the level-headed 23-year-old isn\u2019t thinking beyond Monday. \u201c(Kenin) is an incredible competitor, she really is,\u201d Barty, who is now poised to enter the world\u2019s top five, said of the 20-year-old. \u201cI got a little bit of a taste of that at Fed Cup earlier this year. \u201cShe certainly respects every opponent but doesn\u2019t play their reputation. \u201cShe plays them just on the other side of the net and that\u2019s one of her best attributes. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an extremely tough match come Monday.\u201d First she will return to the courts on Sunday, due to partner Victoria Azarenka in the second round of women\u2019s doubles, having teamed with the former world No.1 to win in Rome last month. A current top-10 doubles player, Barty reached the final in Paris with compatriot Casey Dellacqua two years ago. Super Netball: back to the netball, where it\u2019s three-quarter time and the home side has the advantage. Swifts 49-38 Magpies. Cricket: Australia\u2019s cricketers were in little hurry to get to the finish line against Afghanistan, but they got there eventually. Football: it was not a good night in Eindhoven for the Matildas, as our man Richard Parkin reports: Football: I\u2019m sure you are all aware by now that Liverpool beat Tottenham Hotspur in the European Champions League final, but you may not have yet read the Guardian\u2019s report. Something you can rectify right now. Boxing: and let us not forget that the female boxing world is also very exciting. My countrywoman Katie Taylor is now the undisputed champion. Boxing: in case you\u2019ve somehow missed it, we\u2019ve already had one shock in the world of sport today. Andy Ruiz Jr showed Anthony Joshua who\u2019s really the boss. Super Netball: in our first port of call today, at half-time it\u2019s: Swifts 36-22 Magpies. Good afternoon (or good morning, depending on where you\u2019re reading this), and welcome to another busy day of Australian sport. We will be tracking Swifts v Magpies and Giants v Thunderbirds in netball, St Kilda v Port, Essendon v Carlton and West Coast v Bulldogs in AFL, Titans v Cowboys in the NRL and, later in a separate liveblog, the Cricket World Cup match between South Africa and Bangladesh.",

      "body": "<p>Sharing my tiny, central London flat with 500 houseplants, some pouring from living walls, others nestled among mosses on indoor fountains and as part of living furniture, I think it is fair to say that I am obsessed with the great indoors. It\u2019s super exciting that, at long last, a whole new generation is waking up to the wonders of indoor gardening, fuelled in part by the communicative power of Instagram.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many of the ideas you will see online will almost certainly set you up for failure</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, amid all the gloss and polish of the #instaperfect feeds, horticultural novices may not recognise that many of the ideas out there will (sadly) almost certainly set you up for failure. So, from someone who has tried and failed hundreds of times, here are my top tips for the Instagram houseplant ideas not to follow.</p> <p>First \u2013 and I have a bit of a bee in my bonnet about this \u2013 if you want to kill a cactus or succulent really quickly there is one simple thing to do to it: put it in a terrarium.

      "bodyText": "Sharing my tiny, central London flat with 500 houseplants, some pouring from living walls, others nestled among mosses on indoor fountains and as part of living furniture, I think it is fair to say that I am obsessed with the great indoors. It\u2019s super exciting that, at long last, a whole new generation is waking up to the wonders of indoor gardening, fuelled in part by the communicative power of Instagram. However, amid all the gloss and polish of the #instaperfect feeds, horticultural novices may not recognise that many of the ideas out there will (sadly) almost certainly set you up for failure. So, from someone who has tried and failed hundreds of times, here are my top tips for the Instagram houseplant ideas not to follow. First \u2013 and I have a bit of a bee in my bonnet about this \u2013 if you want to kill a cactus or succulent really quickly there is one simple thing to do to it: put it in a terrarium.

      "body": "<p>When Mustapha Merzoughi, a French citizen of Tunisian origin, left France for Syria in 2015, he hoped to start afresh in the so-called Islamic State and leave behind a life plagued with what he called social and financial problems.</p> <p>But as he faced a judge in Iraq\u2019s capital Baghdad last week, he wished nothing more than to return to France.</p> <p>\u201cAll I want is to go back home,\u201d he implored the court with a shaky voice. \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone from the French embassy here, I\u2019m asking you to take care of my case and bring me back to France.\u201d</p> <p>Merzoughi was captured by the US-backed Syrian opposition forces during the final push to defeat Isis in eastern Syria. After France refused to take him back, he and 11 other Isis suspects of French origin were handed over to Iraqi authorities and charged under Iraq\u2019s sweeping counter-terrorism laws.</p> <p>Wearing yellow jumpsuits and plastic slippers, eight of the Frenchmen appeared in a Baghdad court last week. In the presence of journalists, French diplomats and UN observers, they listened to the accusations levied against them: joining Isis and taking part in military operations. Videos set to dramatic music charted out their journey to Syria and their role in the terror group.</p> <p>\u201cI made a mistake. I joined a terror organisation,\u201d Merzoughi admitted. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t kill anyone.\u201d</p> <p>A court-appointed lawyer who had only met his client a few minutes before the trial drafted an impromptu defence. In the end, Merzoughi and six others were sentenced to death.</p> <p>On Sunday the same court sentenced two more French citizens to death: Fadhil Aouidate, 33, and Vianney Jamal Abdelqader, 29.</p> <p>The sentences are subject to appeal, a process that could take years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/26/iraq-sentences-three-french-citizens-to-death-for-joining-isis\">Iraq sentences three French citizens to death for joining Isis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Iraq\u2019s authorities are holding hundreds of foreign Isis members captured on its soil. But the transfers of the twelve Frenchmen could set a precedent for about 2,000 foreign fighters lingering in camps in eastern Syria with no clear path to repatriation or justice. Iraq has previously expressed its willingness to try them, reportedly in return for monetary compensation.</p> <p>The trials highlight the moral predicament of allowing extradition of European citizens to a country that ranks among the <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/global-executions-fell-nearly-third-last-year-new-report\">world\u2019s top executioners</a>.</p> <p>Human rights groups have criticised Iraq\u2019s courts for handing down death penalties based on confessions rather than material evidence, a worrying practice in a country where force is frequently used during investigations.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch has condemned what it calls France\u2019s \u201coutsourcing\u201d of Isis suspects\u2019 trials to Iraq.</p> <p>\u201cFrance and other countries should not be outsourcing management of their terrorism suspects to abusive justice systems,\u201d said HRW\u2019s acting Middle East director, Lama Fakih, on Friday.</p> <p>\u201cThese countries should not be sitting idly by while their citizens are transferred to a country where their right to a fair trial and protection from torture are undermined.\u201d</p> <p>One of the French suspects who was sentenced to death on Sunday, Fadhil Aouidate, has claimed that he incurred a beating and fractured rib during his interrogation. He lifted his shirt to reveal marks on his upper body. The judge adjourned the case to allow for an examination by a forensic medic, who later ruled that his allegations of torture were unsubstaniated.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of the nature of the trials in Iraq \u2013 which we\u2019ve seen do not provide fair trials to Isis suspects and where detainees being transferred are at real risk of torture \u2013 no group can under international law be transferring detainees into that context,\u201d said Belkis Wille, senior Iraq researcher for Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>The French foreign ministry <a href=\"https://basedoc.diplomatie.gouv.fr/vues/Kiosque/FranceDiplomatie/kiosque.php?type=baen\">said</a> on Monday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/27/france-opposes-iraq-death-penalty-against-three-french-isis-members\">it opposed the death penalty</a> but it also reiterated its respect for the sovereignty of Iraq\u2019s institutions, implying it would not intervene in judicial proceedings. An official familiar with the French position told the Guardian: \u201cThere\u2019s a consensus that the best option is to have them tried in Iraq.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9751884e0c93bad9a9bcd92e6b7a736acaf97cc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9751884e0c93bad9a9bcd92e6b7a736acaf97cc8/0_51_1520_1899/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mustapha Merzoughi was sentenced to death by the Iraqi court.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mustapha Merzoughi was sentenced to death by the Iraqi court.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of the French suspects on trial this week denied ever having set foot inside Iraq, but Iraqi officials claim that the terror group\u2019s full name (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) and the devastating impact on Iraq are sufficient basis for jurisdiction, regardless of whether the accused individuals committed crimes on Iraqi soil.</p> <p>In France, joining a terror organisation is <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/law/help/foreign-fighters/country-surveys.php#France\">punishable</a> by up to 20 years in prison for those in leadership positions, in addition to a fine. But obtaining evidence on whether suspects committed violent crimes is difficult, which means they could walk free or get away with a lenient sentence, a politically explosive matter and security hazard European governments appear determined to avoid.</p> <p>Baghdad\u2019s court referred to intelligence reports detailing the Frenchmen\u2019s activities, but didn\u2019t present them during the public hearings.</p> <p>The suspects, in turn, tried to paint a benign picture of their role in the so-called caliphate. They denied ever having pledged allegiance to Isis, describing their mounting disillusionment with injustice, chaos, and empty promises.</p> <p>Although they admitted to having worked for Isis as medics, trainers, stars in propaganda videos and members of the religious police, they said they did so under threat of imprisonment. Like Merzoughi, most denied taking part in military operations.</p> <p>\u201cYou confessed to the investigative judge that you participated in military operations against Iraqi security force in Mosul and Anbar,\u201d Iraqi court judge Ahmed Al Hurdaithytold Merzoughi during the questioning.</p> <p>\u201cNo it\u2019s not true,\u201d Merzoughi answered, speaking through an interpreter provided by the French embassy.</p> <p>\u201cYou said all of this in front of the investigative judge, a lawyer and a prosecutor, you signed the report and you even finger-printed it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t read the report. I don\u2019t read Arabic very well.\u201d</p> <p>The Iraqi court judge took note of the denial, as well as Merzoughi\u2019s regrets and apologies. But after a short recess, he sentenced him to death anyway.</p> <p>\u201cThe court finds that the evidence obtained against you is sufficient to prove that you joined an armed terror organisation. The court sentences you to death by hanging.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Enas Ibrahim</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "When Mustapha Merzoughi, a French citizen of Tunisian origin, left France for Syria in 2015, he hoped to start afresh in the so-called Islamic State and leave behind a life plagued with what he called social and financial problems. But as he faced a judge in Iraq\u2019s capital Baghdad last week, he wished nothing more than to return to France. \u201cAll I want is to go back home,\u201d he implored the court with a shaky voice. \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone from the French embassy here, I\u2019m asking you to take care of my case and bring me back to France.\u201d Merzoughi was captured by the US-backed Syrian opposition forces during the final push to defeat Isis in eastern Syria. After France refused to take him back, he and 11 other Isis suspects of French origin were handed over to Iraqi authorities and charged under Iraq\u2019s sweeping counter-terrorism laws. Wearing yellow jumpsuits and plastic slippers, eight of the Frenchmen appeared in a Baghdad court last week. In the presence of journalists, French diplomats and UN observers, they listened to the accusations levied against them: joining Isis and taking part in military operations. Videos set to dramatic music charted out their journey to Syria and their role in the terror group. \u201cI made a mistake. I joined a terror organisation,\u201d Merzoughi admitted. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t kill anyone.\u201d A court-appointed lawyer who had only met his client a few minutes before the trial drafted an impromptu defence. In the end, Merzoughi and six others were sentenced to death. On Sunday the same court sentenced two more French citizens to death: Fadhil Aouidate, 33, and Vianney Jamal Abdelqader, 29. The sentences are subject to appeal, a process that could take years. Iraq\u2019s authorities are holding hundreds of foreign Isis members captured on its soil. But the transfers of the twelve Frenchmen could set a precedent for about 2,000 foreign fighters lingering in camps in eastern Syria with no clear path to repatriation or justice. Iraq has previously expressed its willingness to try them, reportedly in return for monetary compensation. The trials highlight the moral predicament of allowing extradition of European citizens to a country that ranks among the world\u2019s top executioners. Human rights groups have criticised Iraq\u2019s courts for handing down death penalties based on confessions rather than material evidence, a worrying practice in a country where force is frequently used during investigations. Human Rights Watch has condemned what it calls France\u2019s \u201coutsourcing\u201d of Isis suspects\u2019 trials to Iraq. \u201cFrance and other countries should not be outsourcing management of their terrorism suspects to abusive justice systems,\u201d said HRW\u2019s acting Middle East director, Lama Fakih, on Friday. \u201cThese countries should not be sitting idly by while their citizens are transferred to a country where their right to a fair trial and protection from torture are undermined.\u201d One of the French suspects who was sentenced to death on Sunday, Fadhil Aouidate, has claimed that he incurred a beating and fractured rib during his interrogation. He lifted his shirt to reveal marks on his upper body. The judge adjourned the case to allow for an examination by a forensic medic, who later ruled that his allegations of torture were unsubstaniated. \u201cBecause of the nature of the trials in Iraq \u2013 which we\u2019ve seen do not provide fair trials to Isis suspects and where detainees being transferred are at real risk of torture \u2013 no group can under international law be transferring detainees into that context,\u201d said Belkis Wille, senior Iraq researcher for Human Rights Watch. The French foreign ministry said on Monday that it opposed the death penalty but it also reiterated its respect for the sovereignty of Iraq\u2019s institutions, implying it would not intervene in judicial proceedings. An official familiar with the French position told the Guardian: \u201cThere\u2019s a consensus that the best option is to have them tried in Iraq.\u201d Most of the French suspects on trial this week denied ever having set foot inside Iraq, but Iraqi officials claim that the terror group\u2019s full name (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) and the devastating impact on Iraq are sufficient basis for jurisdiction, regardless of whether the accused individuals committed crimes on Iraqi soil. In France, joining a terror organisation is punishable by up to 20 years in prison for those in leadership positions, in addition to a fine. But obtaining evidence on whether suspects committed violent crimes is difficult, which means they could walk free or get away with a lenient sentence, a politically explosive matter and security hazard European governments appear determined to avoid. Baghdad\u2019s court referred to intelligence reports detailing the Frenchmen\u2019s activities, but didn\u2019t present them during the public hearings. The suspects, in turn, tried to paint a benign picture of their role in the so-called caliphate. They denied ever having pledged allegiance to Isis, describing their mounting disillusionment with injustice, chaos, and empty promises. Although they admitted to having worked for Isis as medics, trainers, stars in propaganda videos and members of the religious police, they said they did so under threat of imprisonment. Like Merzoughi, most denied taking part in military operations. \u201cYou confessed to the investigative judge that you participated in military operations against Iraqi security force in Mosul and Anbar,\u201d Iraqi court judge Ahmed Al Hurdaithytold Merzoughi during the questioning. \u201cNo it\u2019s not true,\u201d Merzoughi answered, speaking through an interpreter provided by the French embassy. \u201cYou said all of this in front of the investigative judge, a lawyer and a prosecutor, you signed the report and you even finger-printed it.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t read the report. I don\u2019t read Arabic very well.\u201d The Iraqi court judge took note of the denial, as well as Merzoughi\u2019s regrets and apologies. But after a short recess, he sentenced him to death anyway. \u201cThe court finds that the evidence obtained against you is sufficient to prove that you joined an armed terror organisation. The court sentences you to death by hanging.\u201d Additional reporting by Enas Ibrahim",

      "body": "<p>A few years ago my girlfriend Natalya and I moved house, from near the centre of London to the suburbs. Natalya was pregnant with our first child, and we were tired of the grotty house-shares and precariously rented flats we\u2019d spent the last decade living in together. We were looking for stability and space, and eventually we found somewhere that felt as if it could become a home.</p> <p>Our daughter Dora was born a few months after we moved. It was a difficult birth. She was readmitted to hospital and we spent weeks worrying about her weight and the fact that she wouldn\u2019t feed. When we got her back home we tried to learn how to be a family together, but the idyll we\u2019d been expecting, or hoping for, took a long time to arrive. We thought we were prepared for domesticity \u2013 we had done our research, read the right books \u2013 but we didn\u2019t fully realise then that homes are ideas as much as they are places: psychological as well as physical structures.</p> <p>Leyton, the area to which we had moved, was unfamiliar territory, a land of muscle gyms, chicken shops and scruffy parks nestling on the edge of London. Sometimes it felt as though we had moved to a different, wilder city. To the west lay the River Lea and the marshes which ran along its banks; to the east, the green span of Epping Forest. Natalya and I spent the summer after Dora\u2019s birth pushing her around in a pram, exploring. We watched birds together: the kestrels that shivered over the marshes; the cormorants and herons that flew high overhead on their way to the reservoirs in the north. In the evenings, salvos of brilliant green parakeets would flit over our house. As night fell a flock of feral pigeons would fly in to roost on the roof and sing us to sleep with their liquid, gurgling coos.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cde344d42e62ccdf5783b1c2fdf3293ae0a78d32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cde344d42e62ccdf5783b1c2fdf3293ae0a78d32/0_1622_11608_6966/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pigeons navigate partly by using an \u2018olfactory map\u2019: Kevin, showing off his white coat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pigeons navigate partly by using an \u2018olfactory map\u2019: Kevin, showing off his white coat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Burn-Forti</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a boy I had been fascinated by pigeons. Much to my parents\u2019 dismay, I used to rescue injured birds from the streets of London and try to nurse them back to health. I kept them in an old rabbit hutch in my garden and rigged up crude splints to fix their broken wings. I loved pigeons because of their overlooked beauty and because they represented an intrusion of the natural world into my otherwise deeply urban childhood. I loved the way they managed to thrive in a human landscape, making their homes under rotting railway bridges and the wind-buffeted ledges of high-rise blocks. Not quite wild, they were not quite tame either. I had read about the pigeon\u2019s homing instinct in Arthur Ransome\u2019s <em>Pigeon Post</em>, and I hoped the birds I rescued would stick around after they\u2019d recovered from their injuries, but none of them ever did.</p> <p>Feral pigeons, and the hundreds of fancy breeds that now exist, are all genetic descendants of <em>Columba livia</em> \u2013 the rock dove \u2013 a species which originated on the cliffs of the Mediterranean and north Africa. They were first domesticated by the Sumerians 5,000 to 10,000 years before the birth of Christ, and since then they have flown through history. They flew out from Noah\u2019s ark in search of land, and they flew through ancient Egypt to announce the deaths of kings. They flew over the Roman Empire and the battlefields of the First World War, and during the Second they flew across the sea bearing news from occupied Europe.</p> <p>Since their domestication they have been revered as symbols of peace and domesticity, and reviled as dirty and diseased \u201crats with wings\u201d. Pigeons have been used as a source of food, and their droppings have been valuable as fertiliser (and, later, as a key ingredient in gunpowder).

I returned from the <a href=\"https://www.rpra.org/show-of-the-year/\" title=\"\">British Homing World Show of the Year</a> \u2013 an annual <em>Columbidae</em> jamboree known as the \u201cCrufts of the pigeon world\u201d \u2013 carrying a cardboard box inside which a pair of pedigree racing homers shuffled nervously. The pigeons, named Eggy and Orange by Dora over breakfast the next morning, were beautiful. Their feathers were blue and grey, with a texture like velvet. Their feet were pink and reptilian, and their eyes the colour of burnt orange. Their necks had a rainbow sheen, like an oil-slicked rain puddle.</p> <p>I had nowhere to keep Eggy and Orange at first, so for the next few days they lived in a lean-to by the kitchen, where they flitted between the sink and the drying rack, and shat all over the floor, while I built them a loft in my garden. It was heart-stopping to let them fly free for the first time. When I opened the door of the loft they immediately took to the air and disappeared over the rooftops. I didn\u2019t see them again all day and I was sure they had gone for good, like the pigeons I had tried to tame as a child. But as dusk fell, hours later, two birds fluttered out of the darkening sky and landed gently on the roof, before hopping down into the loft. Eggy and Orange had returned.</p> <p>I let them out every day after that, and quickly came to love watching them fly. On still days they would climb high into the sky until I could barely see them. When the wind was gusty they would stay close to the house, rolling over each other with staccato feints and dodges, like dolphins playing on the surface of the sea. Sometimes I\u2019d invite friends around to watch them fly, but they were, on the whole, left curiously unmoved.</p> <p>Homing pigeons imprint on their home loft when they are around six weeks old. From then on they will return to it for the rest of their lives, even if they are taken far away and released from places they have never visited before. Pigeons can fly up to 700 miles in a single day, but are capable of flying far further if their journeys are broken up. The love \u2013 if that is the right word \u2013 they feel for their homes is so acute that they will sometimes die for it. In 1845 a pigeon owned by the Duke of Wellington was released from Ichaboe Island off the coast of Namibia. It was found dead in a gutter one mile from its loft in Nine Elms, south London, having taken 55 days to fly the 5,400 miles home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"26db90a003bcdeecd505b0620b16d3a1e5eb064f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26db90a003bcdeecd505b0620b16d3a1e5eb064f/1618_1586_7090_10022/707.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cThey always returned in the end\u2019: Jon Day with Paul in his London garden.\" width=\"707\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cThey always returned in the end\u2019: Jon Day with Paul in his London garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Burn-Forti</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Within what biologists call their \u201cfamiliar zone\u201d \u2013 the area 30 miles or so around their lofts \u2013 pigeons navigate by pilotage: using visual cues and landmarks to orient themselves. During the first few months of their lives they will begin \u201cranging\u201d \u2013 embarking on long exploratory flights, which allow them to build up the visual maps that will orient them for the rest of their lives. As Eggy and Orange matured they began to fly further away. Sometimes I wouldn\u2019t see them all day, and would worry that they had got lost, or been taken by a hawk while exploring. But they always returned in the end.</p> <p>Though the mechanism by which pigeons navigate around their homes is well understood, quite how they are able to find their way from unfamiliar places is still much contested. Charles Darwin, himself a keen pigeon fancier, thought they navigated by \u201cdead reckoning\u201d \u2013 keeping track of the route of their outward journeys and using a kind of instinctive trigonometry to calculate the bearing for home. But this theory was disproved when it was found that birds placed in darkened revolving drums before being taken away from their lofts were perfectly able to home successfully. Now most biologists believe that they use a variety of different systems to navigate, including, most extraordinarily, an \u201colfactory map\u201d produced by tracking the changing intensities of wind-borne odours.</p> <p>After they\u2019d been ranging for a few months I began to train my pigeons to home from further afield. Whenever I could I took them out in a basket strapped to my bicycle, cycling a few miles in each compass direction around the loft before releasing them. Sometimes Dora would join me on these expeditions, and over time we came to learn our own familiar zone alongside the birds. We flew them from distant parks and from clearings deep in Epping Forest. We cycled up the River Lea and flew them from open fields on the edge of the M25. Once or twice I took the birds to work and released them out of my office window but I soon stopped, as I was worried my colleagues would notice what I was up to and object.</p> <p>I wanted to know what it might be like to see the world from a pigeon\u2019s perspective. Once, inspired by the experiments of a German apothecary named Julius Neubronner, who in 1908 patented his \u201cmethod of and means for taking photographs of landscapes from above\u201d, a system which used tiny cameras strapped to a flock of homing pigeons, I attached a tiny video camera to one of my birds and filmed its flight.</p> <p>The summer after I got Eggy and Orange I joined a local pigeon- racing club. I was the youngest member by quite a margin, but the other fanciers \u2013 quiet, reticent men who were obsessed with the mysteries of pigeon navigation \u2013 were welcoming. They bred me some new birds, and soon I had 30 or so pigeons in my flock. I was fascinated by this strange community, and by the rituals of pigeon racing. Each Friday evening, during the season, the flyers would bring their chosen pigeons to the club to \u201cmark them\u201d for the race. Rubber rings stamped with a unique number were attached to each bird\u2019s leg, after which they were placed gently into crates and loaded on to a lorry. They would then be driven overnight to the \u201cliberation point\u201d, from which they would be released the following morning to fly home. When they arrived back at their lofts their race rings would be removed and placed inside a special tamper-proof clock which recorded their time of arrival. As each bird flew a different distance, the winner was calculated by average velocity flown rather than total time taken.</p> <p>A few months before I joined the club, Natalya and I found out we were going to have another baby, and our son was born, at home, the night before my first pigeon race. The next day I sat in the garden with him in the sunshine, waiting for the birds to come in from Peterborough. I watched the skies until I caught sight of a line of black dots on the horizon. As they got closer two of the birds broke from the flock to fly down and land on the roof of my loft.</p> <p>I rarely left home that summer. I went to work and to the pigeon club, but apart from that the four of us nested. Home became small: our needs local and immediate. Dora was growing up and taking more interest in the pigeons. We\u2019d watch them fly around the house each morning, and wait in the garden for them to come home from races. I felt liberated by the smallness of our new lives. I\u2019d learned that one of the pleasures of home is the pleasure of staying put.</p> <p>I have been a pigeon racer for a couple of years now. I haven\u2019t had much success: I\u2019m a solid mid-table performer. My birds have flown far on my behalf, from Newark-on-Trent, from Wetherby, from Berwick-upon-Tweed. Orange has flown home from Thurso, in the far north of Scotland, over most of the length of Britain. It took him three days to cover the 504 miles. I still wonder what route he took, and the things he must have seen.</p> <p><em>Homing: on Pigeons, Dwellings and Why We Return by Jon Day is published by John Murray on 13 June, priced \u00a316.99.

      "bodyText": "A few years ago my girlfriend Natalya and I moved house, from near the centre of London to the suburbs. Natalya was pregnant with our first child, and we were tired of the grotty house-shares and precariously rented flats we\u2019d spent the last decade living in together. We were looking for stability and space, and eventually we found somewhere that felt as if it could become a home. Our daughter Dora was born a few months after we moved. It was a difficult birth. She was readmitted to hospital and we spent weeks worrying about her weight and the fact that she wouldn\u2019t feed. When we got her back home we tried to learn how to be a family together, but the idyll we\u2019d been expecting, or hoping for, took a long time to arrive. We thought we were prepared for domesticity \u2013 we had done our research, read the right books \u2013 but we didn\u2019t fully realise then that homes are ideas as much as they are places: psychological as well as physical structures. Leyton, the area to which we had moved, was unfamiliar territory, a land of muscle gyms, chicken shops and scruffy parks nestling on the edge of London. Sometimes it felt as though we had moved to a different, wilder city. To the west lay the River Lea and the marshes which ran along its banks; to the east, the green span of Epping Forest. Natalya and I spent the summer after Dora\u2019s birth pushing her around in a pram, exploring. We watched birds together: the kestrels that shivered over the marshes; the cormorants and herons that flew high overhead on their way to the reservoirs in the north. In the evenings, salvos of brilliant green parakeets would flit over our house. As night fell a flock of feral pigeons would fly in to roost on the roof and sing us to sleep with their liquid, gurgling coos. As a boy I had been fascinated by pigeons. Much to my parents\u2019 dismay, I used to rescue injured birds from the streets of London and try to nurse them back to health. I kept them in an old rabbit hutch in my garden and rigged up crude splints to fix their broken wings. I loved pigeons because of their overlooked beauty and because they represented an intrusion of the natural world into my otherwise deeply urban childhood. I loved the way they managed to thrive in a human landscape, making their homes under rotting railway bridges and the wind-buffeted ledges of high-rise blocks. Not quite wild, they were not quite tame either. I had read about the pigeon\u2019s homing instinct in Arthur Ransome\u2019s Pigeon Post, and I hoped the birds I rescued would stick around after they\u2019d recovered from their injuries, but none of them ever did. Feral pigeons, and the hundreds of fancy breeds that now exist, are all genetic descendants of Columba livia \u2013 the rock dove \u2013 a species which originated on the cliffs of the Mediterranean and north Africa. They were first domesticated by the Sumerians 5,000 to 10,000 years before the birth of Christ, and since then they have flown through history. They flew out from Noah\u2019s ark in search of land, and they flew through ancient Egypt to announce the deaths of kings. They flew over the Roman Empire and the battlefields of the First World War, and during the Second they flew across the sea bearing news from occupied Europe. Since their domestication they have been revered as symbols of peace and domesticity, and reviled as dirty and diseased \u201crats with wings\u201d. Pigeons have been used as a source of food, and their droppings have been valuable as fertiliser (and, later, as a key ingredient in gunpowder). But they are most famous as messengers, and over the years one variety \u2013 the racing homer \u2013 has been bred to have an unrivalled ability to find its way home. A year or so after Natalya and I moved to Leyton I decided to revisit my childhood obsession. I now had space to build a proper pigeon loft (as fanciers call the sheds in which they keep their birds) and the time to care for a flock. I thought that keeping pigeons might teach me something about what home meant, and that by training them I would discover the new landscape we now inhabited alongside them.

He is best known for developing polyvagal theory, which describes how visceral experiences affect the nervous system and our resulting behaviour. On Monday 10 June, he will be giving a talk at <a href=\"https://www.stephenporges.com/speaking-calendar/2019/6/10/body-amp-soul-charity-a-symposium-the-frontiers-of-healing-childhood-trauma\" title=\"\">Love vs Trauma</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.bodyandsoulcharity.org/\" title=\"\">Body &amp; Soul charity\u2019s</a> day-long symposium in London, which aims to tackle issues surrounding childhood adversity and trauma. Other participants include Peter Fonagy and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/may/02/i-was-dehumanised-lemn-sissay-on-hearing-his-harrowing-abuse-report-live-on-stage\" title=\"\">Lemn Sissay</a>.</p> <p><strong>Can you explain </strong><strong>polyvagal theory</strong><strong> in layperson\u2019s terms? </strong><br>Polyvagal theory articulates three different branches of the autonomic nervous system that evolved from very primitive vertebrates to mammals. And it\u2019s quite interesting how the sequence evolved. First, you have a system that is really an ancient one, which is death feigning or immobilisation. Then it has a fight or flight system, a mobilisation system. Then finally, with mammals, you have what I call a social engagement system, which can detect features of safety and actually communicate them to another. When you trigger feelings of safety, the autonomic nervous system can help health restoration. In terms of dealing with a life threat, you most likely go into this feigning death, dissociative state.</p> <p><strong>We hear a lot about </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jul/09/fight-or-flight-how-our-brain-decides-our-response-to-danger\" title=\"\"><strong>fight or flight</strong></a><strong> instincts but less about immobilisation. But is that in fact the most common response to traumatic experiences? </strong><br>Yes, immobilisation is the critical point of the experience of life-threat trauma events. It used to be assumed by trauma therapists that stress was a fight-flight reaction. But that\u2019s not what the survivors of trauma described. They were describing this inability to move, the numbness of the body and functionally disappearing. And that\u2019s what polyvagal theory described. So when I started giving talks in the trauma world, the theory had tremendous traction because the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/12/extreme-trauma-leaves-a-legacy-of-pain-for-victims-and-their-children\" title=\"\">survivors of trauma</a> said: \u201cThis is what I experienced.\u201d And they had been confronted with a world that said: \u201cThat\u2019s not what you experienced; why didn\u2019t you fight?\u201d</p> <p><strong>Society praises fight, accepts flight, but tends to attach shame to immobilisation. Is that fair to say? </strong><br>The most important word there is \u201cshame\u201d. Survivors are shamed and blamed because they didn\u2019t mobilise, fight and make an effort. That\u2019s a misunderstanding. It\u2019s a poorly informed explanation because the body goes into that state and they can\u2019t move. The theory had traction because it gave survivors feelings of validation. Survival was really an expression of the heroic nature of our body in trying to save us. Sometimes it goes into a state in which we can\u2019t move, but the objective is to raise our pain thresholds and to make us appear to be less viable to the predator.

      "bodyText": "Stephen Porges is professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina and \u201cDistinguished University Scientist\u201d at Indiana University, where he has created the Traumatic Stress Research Consortium. He is best known for developing polyvagal theory, which describes how visceral experiences affect the nervous system and our resulting behaviour. On Monday 10 June, he will be giving a talk at Love vs Trauma, the Body &amp; Soul charity\u2019s day-long symposium in London, which aims to tackle issues surrounding childhood adversity and trauma. Other participants include Peter Fonagy and Lemn Sissay. Can you explain polyvagal theory in layperson\u2019s terms? Polyvagal theory articulates three different branches of the autonomic nervous system that evolved from very primitive vertebrates to mammals. And it\u2019s quite interesting how the sequence evolved. First, you have a system that is really an ancient one, which is death feigning or immobilisation. Then it has a fight or flight system, a mobilisation system. Then finally, with mammals, you have what I call a social engagement system, which can detect features of safety and actually communicate them to another. When you trigger feelings of safety, the autonomic nervous system can help health restoration. In terms of dealing with a life threat, you most likely go into this feigning death, dissociative state. We hear a lot about fight or flight instincts but less about immobilisation. But is that in fact the most common response to traumatic experiences? Yes, immobilisation is the critical point of the experience of life-threat trauma events. It used to be assumed by trauma therapists that stress was a fight-flight reaction. But that\u2019s not what the survivors of trauma described. They were describing this inability to move, the numbness of the body and functionally disappearing. And that\u2019s what polyvagal theory described. So when I started giving talks in the trauma world, the theory had tremendous traction because the survivors of trauma said: \u201cThis is what I experienced.\u201d And they had been confronted with a world that said: \u201cThat\u2019s not what you experienced; why didn\u2019t you fight?\u201d Society praises fight, accepts flight, but tends to attach shame to immobilisation. Is that fair to say? The most important word there is \u201cshame\u201d. Survivors are shamed and blamed because they didn\u2019t mobilise, fight and make an effort. That\u2019s a misunderstanding. It\u2019s a poorly informed explanation because the body goes into that state and they can\u2019t move. The theory had traction because it gave survivors feelings of validation. Survival was really an expression of the heroic nature of our body in trying to save us. Sometimes it goes into a state in which we can\u2019t move, but the objective is to raise our pain thresholds and to make us appear to be less viable to the predator. Within the legal system, there\u2019s been a lot of issues when a person hasn\u2019t fought off a predator. And I think this is being poorly informed about how bodies respond. What is the long-term impact of adverse childhood experiences (Aces)? Aces is a scale that accumulates exposure to adverse experiences, such as abuse, neglect and family dysfunction. The Aces scale was derived from Dr Vincent Felitti\u2019s observations as a physician in the United States. As he learned more about his patients\u2019 early life experiences, he started to see relationships between early experiences of abuse and long-term health. Research confirmed that higher Ace scores (exposure to a greater number of adverse experiences) were related to longevity and virtually every major medical disorder including heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer\u2019s, cancer and diabetes.

Much of our society defines trauma by the event when the real critical issue is the individual\u2019s reaction.

Interesting that he sees political suicide as a viable option for his party \u2013 it would certainly get my vote. But more troubling was the fact that his unenthusiastic view of a no-deal outcome caused him to start haemorrhaging the support of moderate Conservative MPs \u2013 the ones desperate to find some alternative to either Boris Johnson or, for those who like a less charismatic and intelligent maniac, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/29/dominic-raab-more-rightwing-on-education-than-thatcher-tory-private-sector-state-schools-profit\" title=\"\">Dominic Raab</a>.</p> <p>Suddenly, in the context of deciding who is to be the country\u2019s next prime minister, ruling out no-deal is on the extreme left of the available options \u2013 only Rory Stewart, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/28/tory-leadership-contender-rory-stewart-principle-power\" title=\"\">who hasn\u2019t got a chance</a>, has done that. In reality the nation is divided, not between hard and soft Brexiters, but between Leave and Remain. Until 2016 that was also what divided the Conservative party. Now, in Tory circles, remaining is beyond the pale and leaving in any sort of ordered way is crypto-socialist scare-mongering.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s like he wants to live in an Amish community and expend all his energy trying to persuade them to get a steam plough</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nigel Farage is the key to all this, though not entirely in the way he would like. The Tories\u2019 humbling by the Brexit party in the European elections is not necessarily as bad news for them as it looks. Pretty much all those Brexit votes \u2013 that 31% of the turnout \u2013 could easily go to the Tories in a vote that actually matters. People are always keener to vote Farage when it doesn\u2019t matter, which is why his entire professional political career has been spent in the European parliament, not a proper one. How perverse that he\u2019s dedicated his life to destroying the only institution that will admit him.</p> <p>This time, though, the Farage vote could revert to the Tories even more comprehensively than usual if, as appears likely, they choose a leader as crazily pro-Brexit as he is. Someone who thrills to the idea of no-deal and remembers to say things like \u201cfuck business\u201d rather than \u201cpraise the further enrichment of the sinister interest groups that support me behind the scenes\u201d.</p> <p>What Farage has done, basically, is helpfully parcel up a section of the electorate and leave it on a window ledge like a warm pie, all ready for the Tories to steal. The very simplicity of the Brexit party\u2019s message makes it so easy. The Tories know exactly what those voters want \u2013 Brexit at all costs \u2013 so that\u2019s all they have to promise to steal them from Farage. And that\u2019s precisely what all the viable Tory leadership candidates are currently doing.</p> <p>Under the British electoral system, the Brexit party\u2019s 31% plus the 9% who voted Tory even in the European election (and who would therefore, I think it\u2019s fair to say, vote Conservative under absolutely any circumstances whatsoever) is enough to win a comfortable majority in the House of Commons. It\u2019s hard to be sure of the percentages, because turnout in EU elections is low, but there\u2019s no reason to think it skewed either pro- or anti-Brexit. And if those numbers do hold up in a larger turnout, the new no-deal-embracing Tory prime minister is home and dry. Cameron won a safe majority in 2015 with 37% of the vote; Blair got a larger one a decade earlier with 35%.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know what percentage would currently vote Remain, but polls suggest it\u2019s higher than the 48% who did so in the referendum and probably higher than 50%. But, the way things stand, even if it\u2019s as high as 60% of the vote, a general election would probably return a government committed to an extreme interpretation of the contrary view. The Remain vote is fatally split between the Lib Dems, the Greens and Labour and, primarily as a result of the Labour leadership\u2019s vacillation on the subject of a second referendum, cannot realistically be united. Without such unity, under the first-past-the-post system, the parliamentary representatives of Remain will be even more impotent and outnumbered than they are now.</p> <p>This is how poorly Jeremy Corbyn, despite his enthusiasm for general elections, has prepared for one. Labour is the only party other than the Tories that can ever cobble together the 35-40% of voters required to make a movement matter under our current shit system. But Corbyn\u2019s disdain of compromise, his confusing and equivocal view of the EU, and his truculent and inadequate response to accusations of institutional racism \u2013 in fact, his whole atavistic and tribal political approach \u2013 mean that, under his leadership, it has no chance of doing so.</p>",

Someone who thrills to the idea of no-deal and remembers to say things like \u201cfuck business\u201d rather than \u201cpraise the further enrichment of the sinister interest groups that support me behind the scenes\u201d. What Farage has done, basically, is helpfully parcel up a section of the electorate and leave it on a window ledge like a warm pie, all ready for the Tories to steal. The very simplicity of the Brexit party\u2019s message makes it so easy. The Tories know exactly what those voters want \u2013 Brexit at all costs \u2013 so that\u2019s all they have to promise to steal them from Farage. And that\u2019s precisely what all the viable Tory leadership candidates are currently doing. Under the British electoral system, the Brexit party\u2019s 31% plus the 9% who voted Tory even in the European election (and who would therefore, I think it\u2019s fair to say, vote Conservative under absolutely any circumstances whatsoever) is enough to win a comfortable majority in the House of Commons. It\u2019s hard to be sure of the percentages, because turnout in EU elections is low, but there\u2019s no reason to think it skewed either pro- or anti-Brexit. And if those numbers do hold up in a larger turnout, the new no-deal-embracing Tory prime minister is home and dry. Cameron won a safe majority in 2015 with 37% of the vote; Blair got a larger one a decade earlier with 35%. I don\u2019t know what percentage would currently vote Remain, but polls suggest it\u2019s higher than the 48% who did so in the referendum and probably higher than 50%. But, the way things stand, even if it\u2019s as high as 60% of the vote, a general election would probably return a government committed to an extreme interpretation of the contrary view. The Remain vote is fatally split between the Lib Dems, the Greens and Labour and, primarily as a result of the Labour leadership\u2019s vacillation on the subject of a second referendum, cannot realistically be united. Without such unity, under the first-past-the-post system, the parliamentary representatives of Remain will be even more impotent and outnumbered than they are now. This is how poorly Jeremy Corbyn, despite his enthusiasm for general elections, has prepared for one. Labour is the only party other than the Tories that can ever cobble together the 35-40% of voters required to make a movement matter under our current shit system. But Corbyn\u2019s disdain of compromise, his confusing and equivocal view of the EU, and his truculent and inadequate response to accusations of institutional racism \u2013 in fact, his whole atavistic and tribal political approach \u2013 mean that, under his leadership, it has no chance of doing so.",

At dinner, everyone gathers around communal tables to swap stories over Stavroula\u2019s wonderful Greek cooking. The whole place can also be rented as one, for up to 25 people. \u2022 Family weeks from \u20ac65 per adult, \u20ac40 per child (under 13) per night half-board and including snacks and drinks. Children under four stay free Getting there Two hours\u2019 drive from Athens Zagori, Epirus Want to let your kids run amok in the wilderness? Zagori is just the ticket. This mainland region of soaring peaks, craggy gorges and rippling streams is gradually getting the attention it deserves thanks to lovely lodges like Astra Inn. Open year round, it\u2019s in Megalo Papingo, one of 50-odd villages camouflaged in the hills. There are six wood and stone cottages and the cosy restaurant serves Greek comfort food (river trout, nettle pie, stuffed courgette blossoms) using ingredients reared, grown, or sourced locally by Kostas and Spyros Tsoumanis, brothers who will take you truffle or mushroom hunting in season. Tweens and teens can go wild swimming in rock pools, canyoning, rafting or hit the hills on ebikes. \u2022 From \u20ac100-\u20ac120 a night all summer, \u20ac15 per child, including breakfast Getting there Daily flights (45 minutes) from Athens to Ioannina, then one hour by car to Megalo Papigo Laconia, Peloponnese Surrounded by more than a thousand olive trees, Eumelia, a biodynamic farm, is sustainably minded and beautifully designed. The five guest cottages have dusky pink and ochre walls painted with natural pigments, beamed ceilings and geothermal heating. Activities change with the seasons: grape pressing, olive harvesting or cooking lessons using organic produce from the farm. Kids can help the owners, Frangiskos and Marilena, to feed the animals, plant vegetables and forage for the herbs that find their way into the wild asparagus omelette, lavender biscuits and fig and prickly-pear preserve served for breakfast. There are free mountain bikes if you want to explore Laconia\u2019s towering mountains or serene coastline. \u2022 \u20ac160 a night for a family of four (kids under 12), including breakfast Getting there The closest airport is Kalamata (1\u00be hours). It\u2019s a 3\u00bd-hour drive from Athens Chania, Crete Ammos is the gift that keeps on giving for frazzled parents of babies and toddlers. Every year, the owner, Nikos Tsepetis, adds more designer \u2013 or as they put it \u201cmuseum grade\u201d \u2013 chairs (yes, every year they add a few new ones) and contemporary art to the all-white sunny living/dining room, more kid-friendly treats to the extravagant breakfast spread, more toys to the playroom and heated pool. After upgrading the rooms, this year he\u2019s redesigned the lobby in undulating white marble. The jackpot: four hours of free childcare from Monday to Friday, leaving parents free to loll on the sandy beach below or have a massage. \u2022 From \u20ac125 a night in low season and \u20ac190 in high season (10% of the room rate for kids from two to 15; 5% for under-twos). Breakfast is \u20ac11 for adults and \u20ac7 for children aged two to 10 Getting there British Airways, easyJet, Ryanair and Norwegian operate direct flights to Chania (four hours); flights from Athens (55 minutes) with Aegean and Olympic airlines and Sky Express. Ammos is a 30-minute drive from Chania Kardamyli, Peloponnese Wedged between the Taygetos mountains and the Gulf of Messinia, the little seaside town of Kardamyli is where Patrick Leigh Fermor hung up his walking boots and laid down roots. Giorgos and Maria (who also run Fermor\u2019s favourite taverna, Lela\u2019s) have created the Notos Hotel, a cluster of stone apartments and studios tumbling down the hillside above the town. Open all year, the plain but spotless houses make a handy base for exploring the medieval castles, limestone gorges and shingle coves of the outer Mani. You\u2019ll need to make (or pre-order, for an extra charge) your own breakfast and there\u2019s no full-time staff on site. But Giorgos and Maria will point you in the direction of all the best local secrets. \u2022 From \u20ac100 a night (from \u20ac160 high season) for an apartment sleeping four, not including breakfast Getting there Thomas Cook, easyJet, BA and Aegean fly to Kalamata, an hour\u2019s drive away. Car hire recommended Syros, Cyclades For Nick and Elspeth Geronimos, the Good Life is all about the humble pleasures that drew tourists to Greece before package holidays and fancy resorts. They have restored a smattering of 200-year-old cottages on Syros, an island with a lively year-round population and cultural scene. Surrounded by olive groves and vineyards, the self-catering houses are off-grid but brim with thoughtful features for families: washing machines, barbecues, filtered drinking water, baby equipment and kids\u2019 bikes. You can help yourself to eggs, vegetables and fruit from the garden. It\u2019s a five-minute stroll to peaceful Voulgari beach \u2013 ideal for toddlers. Older children can learn to sail or go pony riding. \u2022 From \u20ac90 a night for a villa that sleeps 4 (from \u20ac210 in high season), not including breakfast Getting there Ferries depart from Piraeus, Lavrio and Rafina to Syros (3 to 3\u00bd hours); daily flights from Athens (35 minutes) Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Here's who is in the family entourage:</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Ivanka Trump</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Ivanka is Trump\u2019s oldest daughter and works in the White House (unpaid) as an adviser to the president. Trump has relied on her often for overseas diplomacy, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/08/politics/ivanka-sits-in-president-g20/index.html\">sitting in</a> for him briefly at a G20 summit, and he said he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/12/ivanka-trump-world-bank-pick-father-confirms-consideration\">considered</a> naming her to head the World Bank. She has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/16/hypocrisy-without-borders-ivanka-trump-trip-africa-ethiopia-ivory-coast\">visited</a> Ethiopia and the Ivory Coast on behalf of the administration to promote women\u2019s rights. Before her father\u2019s presidency, Trump ran her own fashion line.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Jared Kushner</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Trump\u2019s son-in-law is a White House senior adviser and the administration\u2019s envoy to the Middle East (also unpaid). With his wife Ivanka he has also been the subject of a host of controversies \u2013 with a whistleblower <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-clearances/whistleblower-says-ivanka-jared-got-security-clearance-over-experts-advice-idUSKCN1RD2HU\">alleging</a>&nbsp;they were granted sensitive security clearances over the objections of career security experts. He has also been <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/jared-kushners-conflicts-of-interest-reach-a-crisis-point\">accused</a> of conflicts of interest over his family\u2019s sprawling real-estate empire. Kushner wears many hats in Washington. He is supposed to come up with a Middle East peace plan, as well as US immigration policy.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Donald Trump Jr</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Trump\u2019s eldest son and his brother, Eric, run their father\u2019s business empire while he is in the White House. <a href=\"https://www.trump.com/leadership/donald-trump-jr-biography\">Officially</a>, Trump Jr is executive vice-president of the Trump Organization. It was Trump Jr who met a Russian lawyer in an infamous Trump Tower meeting in New York in 2016, after the Russian offered him election \u2018dirt\u2019 on the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Kushner also attended. Although accepting campaign help from foreign nationals is illegal, the special counsel Robert Mueller said after investigating that there was not enough evidence to prove meeting participants knew they were breaking the law. Trump Jr&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dcvisit-kjb3z6zv6\">may be accompanied</a>&nbsp;by his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Fox News host.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Eric Trump</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Eric Trump is the co-leader of the Trump Organization during his father\u2019s presidency. He has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/17/eric-trump-donald-racism-my-father-sees-one-color-green\">defended</a> his father from accusations of racism, and <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-eric-trump-calls-father-s-critics-not-1496849988-htmlstory.html\">called</a> the president\u2019s critics \u201cnot even people\u201d. He is parodied on the weekly US satirical comedy TV show Saturday Night Live and elsewhere as the not-so-sharp Trump brother, though supporters <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/saturday-night-live-thinks-its-figured-out-the-trump-brothers-does-it-get-them-right/2018/03/14/8a7f311e-255b-11e8-b79d-f3d931db7f68_story.html?utm_term=.684bddd9e7cb\">call</a>&nbsp;this portrayal inaccurate.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s state visit this week to the UK is being promoted as a celebration of a close alliance tempered through war. It could be more accurately described as a personal lap of victory for the US president, performed largely at the expense of his hosts. Trump arrives in London having survived Robert Mueller\u2019s last blow, a verbal recap of the special counsel\u2019s finding that the president could neither be charged with crimes nor exonerated. The president is now on the counter-attack and may well use his visit to repeat his claim \u2013 called \u201cutterly ridiculous\u201d by GCHQ \u2013 that UK intelligence helped spy on his election campaign. The rich pageantry that the British monarchy supplies will not only distract from the lingering clouds of suspicion, but send a bright red, white and blue message of reassurance to the Trump faithful that, while his domestic enemies might yap at his heels, he is still treated like royalty in foreign capitals. \u201cWhat he wants is the adulation,\u201d said Thomas Wright, the director of the centre on the US and Europe at the Brookings Institution. \u201cHe wants the protocol and the grandeur and to be at the centre of it all. It is how he sees global diplomacy. It\u2019s going from palace to chancellery, meeting leaders and looking the part.\u201d For that purpose, the UK visit could not be more perfect. On Monday, the Queen will greet Trump ceremonially in the gardens of Buckingham Palace. He will inspect a guard of honour and there will be royal gun salutes fired from Green Park and the Tower of London. There will be afternoon tea and banquets and then, in Portsmouth, the martial grandeur of the Royal Navy. Trump is bringing his extended family, including the heirs to his fortune and political power, Donald Jr, Eric and Ivanka. The most powerful of them, Ivanka, will attend a \u201cbusiness leaders\u201d breakfast on Tuesday with her father in the company of Theresa May and the Duke of York. The scenes will eventually be marketed by his business empire and his re-election machine in the same way: the House of Trump and the House of Windsor, the top luxury brands of their respective nations, sitting down to make deals in the most sumptuous settings. In effect, the British royals will be serving as co-stars and extras in stock footage for Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election ads. The only royal with experience of acting for a living, Meghan, the American-born Duchess of Sussex, is thought to be staying away. She is on maternity leave after having baby Archie, but she has called Trump \u201cdivisive\u201d and \u201cmisogynistic\u201d in the past. In return, he declared her \u201cnasty\u201d in a pre-departure Sun interview. Trump\u2019s progress will be triumphal in other ways. May \u2013 who told him off for sharing far-right videos in 2017, and whom he has taunted mercilessly ever since for failing to deliver Brexit \u2013 will be in her last days as prime minister. The former Conservative foreign secretary Boris Johnson, whom Trump has consistently backed over May, and who he has said would do \u201can excellent job\u201d, is tipped as most likely to succeed her. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, another Trump favourite, emerged victorious from the European elections, while the hardest of all Brexits remains a likelihood. The US president is winning all his bets in the UK, and it would be out of character if he did not remind the hapless outgoing prime minister of that fact. Johnson and Farage were expected to attend a banquet thrown at the US ambassador\u2019s London residence, Winfield House, on Tuesday night, though Farage claims he has been banned from meeting the president by the May government. Trump was coy on whether he would meet them but gave them a resounding shout-out last Thursday as \u201ctwo very good guys, very interesting people\u201d. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Trump called on Britain to leave the European Union without a deal if Brussels refuses to meet its demands, and urged the government to send Farage into the negotiations. The state visit is an opportunity for Trump to double down on his bet on Brexit, with the ultimate aim of striking his own bilateral trade deal with an amputated and weakened Britain. \u201cThis is not about seeing where the UK is vulnerable in a post-EU environment and buttressing it; I think this is using US trade leverage to get as many gains as possible,\u201d said Heather Conley, director of the Europe programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. That leverage will be used to peel the UK away from EU regulations to fall in line with US standards on food, healthcare and banking. The US president will be coming to press home his advantage. \u201cTrump is pursuing a predatory approach to Brexit,\u201d Wright said. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunist strategy to take advantage of Britain\u2019s vulnerability.\u201d",

So expect Woodstock 50 to be a blip in history,\u201d said Lesfetz</p> <p>Efforts to revive Woodstock at 50 have also been hit by the broader failure of the music industry to create bands that can headline multi-act festivals while established acts have burned their audiences by playing the circuit too often.</p> <p>Several festivals, including the Tennessee-based Bonnaroo, are said to be struggling.

      "bodyText": "It was billed as the musical event of the summer, a chance to remember a defining moment of the counterculture movement that took place in a field in upstate New York half a century ago. But just three months away from Woodstock 50, at which Jay-Z, The Killers and Miley Cyrus are supposed to be performing, plans are in disarray as event organisers battle their financial backers in a extensive series of court challenges. The event, which is due to be held 150 miles from the original site for three days in the middle of August, has been in jeopardy ever since the Japanese advertising and marketing giant Dentsu Aegis pulled the plug on $30m of backing in April. A series of subsequent court orders first found that Dentsu Aegis did not have the right to cancel the event, and subsequently that festival organisers could not stop their former financial backer from being involved in the planning the event. If nothing else, the legal dramas played out in court are in the spirit of Woodstock\u2019s previous incarnations in 1969, 1994 and 1999, marked respectively by love, mud and violence. But Marc Kasowitz, lawyer for Woodstock 50\u2019s organiser Michael Lang, told the Poughkeepsie Journal last week: \u201cWoodstock will prevail.\u201d There\u2019s little certainty it will, however, despite new financing, and tickets have yet to go on sale. Meanwhile, after a series of organisational changes and conceptual rethinks, a small-scale festival to be held at the original site of the 1969 Woodstock Music and Art Fair in Bethel, New York, appears to be going ahead, with Ringo Starr, Santana and John Fogerty headlining. But as each event battles to rekindle the spirit of 69, the tribulations of both have become something of a standing joke in the music industry. \u201cThe original Woodstock was an envelope-pushing revolution that captured a national zeitgeist the major media had missed. Woodstock 50 is just a me-too event,\u201d wrote the music industry blogger Bob Lefsetz. Lefsetz goes on to describe Woodstock 50 as \u201cthe Fyre Festival in reverse\u201d, referring to the ill-fated concert event in the Bahamas that collapsed, stranding ticket holders, and ultimately saw organiser Billy Macfarland jailed for fraud. Lefsetz went further, describing the concept of Woodstock 50 as \u201clike coming up with a new gas-guzzling sedan in not only the age of SUVs, but electric cars.\u201d Organisers would have been better off, he said, promoting the original acts, from Mountain to Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young to Arlo Guthrie, and have contemporary figures such as Gary Clark Jr standing in for Jimi Hendrix. \u201cIf you expect peace and love to reign in a field at Watkins Glen [site of the venue] you\u2019re delusional. So expect Woodstock 50 to be a blip in history,\u201d said Lesfetz Efforts to revive Woodstock at 50 have also been hit by the broader failure of the music industry to create bands that can headline multi-act festivals while established acts have burned their audiences by playing the circuit too often. Several festivals, including the Tennessee-based Bonnaroo, are said to be struggling. But Woodstock remains a case in point, attracting widespread criticism for cynically mining hippie-era, feelgood sentiments that would have been better left unexploited. Older concertgoers don\u2019t want to camp, and don\u2019t want to subsist on hot dogs and french fries. \u201cWho wants to camp to see Jay-Z?\u201d says rock manager Andy Gershon, who recently staged a sold-out, seven-night run of Morrissey shows on Broadway in New York. \u201cCoachella is this generation\u2019s Woodstock, and nobody cares about Woodstock 50 among the festival crowd in 2019.\u201d But Lang, who promoted the original Woodstock, remains unbowed. He told the New York Times last month, the chaos \u201ckind of fits the legacy of Woodstock in a way\u201d. \u201cIn 1969, we got kicked out of [the town of] Wallkill a month before the festival was to happen. One of the miracles was that we found a site the next day.\u201d Lang said there was no other solution besides commitment. \u201cWe were committed then, and we\u2019re not stopping now.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 4 June 2019 to clarify the description of Dentsu Aegis.",

The group said it had trekked into the heart of the Nanda Devi sanctuary \u201cwith the ambition of summiting a virgin peak\u201d. The trip was expected to take about 24 days. According to an update on 22 May, the group had reached their second base camp at 4,870 metres and were due to make a summit attempt on an unclimbed peak at 6,477 metres. However, by last Saturday \u2013 25 May \u2013 the expedition\u2019s British deputy leader, Mark Thomas, had returned to the second base camp with three others. He was in radio contact with the group of eight that pushed higher but when Thomas did not hear from the group by last Sunday he went up to look for them. He reportedly found a single unoccupied tent. There was evidence of a large avalanche beyond that. It was unclear if the climbers went missing during their ascent or descent, while the cause of their disappearance remains unknown. The British-based mountain guide Martin Moran, who owns the trekking company Moran Mountain, was leading the group, which was also believed to have included a 47-year-old Australian woman, Ruth McCance. Mark Charlton, the president of the British Association of Mountain Guides (BMG), said in a post on the organisation\u2019s Facebook page that Moran had been leading six clients and an Indian national. \u201cThe BMG is assisting where possible and is in contact with the Indian authorities,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment this is all the information we have as communication is very difficult.\u201d A post on the Moran Mountain Facebook page said the company was working with authorities and the BMG to gather information about the expedition team. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: \u201cWe are in contact with the Indian authorities following reports that a number of British nationals are missing in the Indian Himalayas. We will do all we can to assist any British people who need our help.\u201d A spokesperson from Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was \u201cproviding consular assistance to the family of an Australian that may be among a group of trekkers missing in the Nanda Devi area of India\u201d. The news follows a number of deaths in the Himalayas this year, with at least 11 people \u2013 including a British man and an Irish man \u2013 reported to have died on Everest in the past two weeks amid overcrowding and poor weather. There have reportedly been a record 381 permits issued to scale Everest for this climbing season, and there have been calls for tighter vetting of people\u2019s mountaineering experience.",

      "body": "<p>I never wanted to run an ultra marathon. I\u2019ve always loved running, the freedom of it, the childish abandon, but I was a 10K and half-marathon runner, a \u201creal\u201d runner (in my eyes), someone who pushed the pace and gunned for fast times. Ultrarunning, with all its backpacks, poles and food, was not really running. It was running with all the joy bludgeoned out of it. </p> <p>So when a magazine editor asked me to run the 165km <a href=\"http://www.marathonoman.com/\" title=\"\">Oman Desert Marathon</a> to write an article about it, I said no: 100 miles across sand, in the heat of Oman. It sounded like hell.</p> <p>But as the days went by, and I thought about it again, I began to wonder why people did these races. Ultra races are anything longer than a marathon, starting at about 30 miles, and going all the way up to the world\u2019s longest race, a 3,100-mile jaunt around a single city block in New York.</p> <p>Despite the almost incomprehensible distances, the sport of ultrarunning has been growing at an incredible rate, with around a 1,000% increase in participants globally in the past 10 years. What was going on? Why were people doing it? Was it simply to impress their friends \u2013 a symptom of our show-off, selfie-obsessed modern culture? I found that even just talking about doing one had people shaking their heads in wonder. The pictures of me slogging across the desert would certainly be a hit on Instagram. But surely there was more to it than that\u2026</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019d tumble into anger, frustration \u2013 get mad at the race organisers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The more I thought about it, the more I began to see it not as a running race, but as an adventure. To traverse the desert on foot for five days, carrying everything I needed on my back, running at night under the stars, would surely be an amazing life experience. And who knew what I might discover about myself along the way?</p> <p>So I got back to the editor and said yes. \u201cI know it\u2019s a bit bonkers,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly do the first day if you want.\u201d</p> <p>But no, I now wanted the full experience. The idea had gripped me and was slowly dragging me in. I wanted to know what it was like to take on such a challenge and make it out the other side.</p> <p>In the end, my experience in the Oman desert ebbed and flowed. At times I felt strong, powerful, racing like a supercharged hero across the sand. At other times I was a wreck, whimpering and on the verge of giving up. But somehow I made it to the end, to the finish on the beach, where I ran straight into the sea and, bobbing in the waves, swore I\u2019d never do anything so stupid again.</p> <p><em><strong>But it wouldn\u2019t</strong></em> leave me alone, this urge to push myself further, to test myself, and to come through to the other side. I started entering more and more ultra marathons. I ran 100 miles through the Pyrenees, hallucinating about cocktail parties on the side of a mountain midway through a second consecutive night without sleep. I ran for 24 hours around a running track in south London. In the end I ran 10 ultra marathons in two years. The training wasn\u2019t too extreme. Occasionally, I would get up at 4am and head to the coast path near my home in Devon and run for four hours. But mostly the training wasn\u2019t much more exhausting or time-consuming than before, when I was a \u201cserious\u201d road runner. The races themselves were when the big effort happened. My runs became longer, but slower and, in that sense, more enjoyable. I went off-road and took in the scenery. I brought snacks and sat down to eat them. The speed was no longer important.</p> <p>At first, what motivated me, and kept me moving in races, was the outcome. I wanted to reach the finish line and to bask in all the relief and the warm satisfaction that came with conquering these races. The process, however, kept breaking me. In every single race, I reached a moment of crisis, where I sat down on the side of the trail and wanted to give up, where I asked myself why I was in this stupid race. The answer was always elusive and I came close to quitting many times.</p> <p>I noticed that the people who did well in these races were often those with a calm, steely focus; people who seemed to be able to maintain an even emotional state throughout. I, on the other hand, more emotional than I had realised, was as up and down and as out of control as a child on a bouncy castle. I would get surges of energy where I felt I could win the entire race, skipping down mountain sides like a character in a CGI movie. And then, bam, I\u2019d crash and tumble into dejection, anger, frustration. I would get mad at the race organisers for sending me up such steep hills. I would get mad at the hills themselves.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If we dig deep enough, the tiredness and pain melts away</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Seasoned ultrarunners call these moments of crisis \u2013 when you\u2019re struggling to find the will to go on \u2013 the pain cave. And they talk about how they relish going there, how they love digging in the pain cave. But whenever I got even a few steps inside, all I could think was: \u201cThey\u2019re all mad.\u201d The pain cave was horrible, it ate you up, it tore you apart. Why would anyone want to experience this level of tiredness, this aching of every limb, seasoned with the thought you still had 50 miles to go?</p> <p>Actually, it was often this thought that was the worst thing. The moment you looked at your watch and started to calculate how far you still had to go, the distance was usually so overwhelming that just the thought of it hit you like a punch to the stomach. Ultrarunners repeatedly told me that the key was to stay in the moment, to run the mile you\u2019re in and forget about the rest. That sounded easy, but it wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>I read about a US runner who had lost some short-term memory function in an operation to cure her of epilepsy. As a result, when she ran, she never knew how far through a race she was, or how far she had to go. So she had no choice but to exist in the moment and just keep moving. It caused her no end of difficulties in her day-to-day life, but it made her a formidable ultrarunner. But how could I emulate her powers in my own ultrarunning? One trick was to ditch my watch, which helped a little. But I still longed for the outcome.</p> <p>One runner told me his big problem was that he always thought about the finish too early. At first, I didn\u2019t see why that was a problem. Surely that sweet feeling of conquering the race, of making it to the end, was a positive driving force. But the thought could break you, because the end was usually so far away, and because just thinking about it took you out of the present moment.</p> <p>As the Japanese marathon monks of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/31/japanese-monks-mount-hiei-1000-marathons-1000-days\" title=\"\">Mount Hiei</a> once told me about their challenge to complete 1,000 marathons in 1,000 days, it was a meditation in movement. Ultrarunning, done well, was all about the process, not the outcome. And, like a meditation, that meant staying in the moment.</p> <p>Eventually, I realised the secret was to embrace the struggle, as they\u2019d told me all along. To stand in the midst of the storm, facing the oblivion, and to say to yourself: this is why I\u2019m here. This is what I came for. A friend who ran two of my 100-mile races with me said an ultra marathon doesn\u2019t begin until 50 miles in. \u201cAt the start,\u201d she said, \u201cI have too much energy, but when I get tired, everything melts away and it\u2019s just me and the running.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, in the oblivion, deep in the pain cave, if we dig deep enough, if we push on through, we come to a place where it is strangely peaceful, where everything else melts away, even, amazingly, the pain in our legs, the tiredness that had seemed so debilitating, it all clears. And there, out in the mountains, or even on a city running track, we find ourselves fully present in the moment.</p> <p>It\u2019s rare, in our modern lives, to come this close to our stripped-back, primal selves. In the end, I found that in depths of an ultra marathon lies a stillness, an awareness of existence, that makes it all worthwhile. </p> <p>It was strange, but despite initially longing for that feeling of arriving at the finish as the all-conquering hero, glowing with the satisfaction of achieving my goal, in reality the end, when it came, was often an anti-climax. I know it sounds a bit bonkers, but sometimes, despite all my struggles, I\u2019d get to a point after 100 miles of running, where I didn\u2019t even want to stop.</p> <p><em>The Rise of the Ultrarunners: a Journey to the Edge of Human Endurance by Adharanand Finn </em><em>is published by Guardian Faber</em><em> at \u00a314.99.

But somehow I made it to the end, to the finish on the beach, where I ran straight into the sea and, bobbing in the waves, swore I\u2019d never do anything so stupid again. But it wouldn\u2019t leave me alone, this urge to push myself further, to test myself, and to come through to the other side. I started entering more and more ultra marathons. I ran 100 miles through the Pyrenees, hallucinating about cocktail parties on the side of a mountain midway through a second consecutive night without sleep. I ran for 24 hours around a running track in south London. In the end I ran 10 ultra marathons in two years. The training wasn\u2019t too extreme. Occasionally, I would get up at 4am and head to the coast path near my home in Devon and run for four hours. But mostly the training wasn\u2019t much more exhausting or time-consuming than before, when I was a \u201cserious\u201d road runner. The races themselves were when the big effort happened. My runs became longer, but slower and, in that sense, more enjoyable. I went off-road and took in the scenery. I brought snacks and sat down to eat them. The speed was no longer important. At first, what motivated me, and kept me moving in races, was the outcome. I wanted to reach the finish line and to bask in all the relief and the warm satisfaction that came with conquering these races. The process, however, kept breaking me. In every single race, I reached a moment of crisis, where I sat down on the side of the trail and wanted to give up, where I asked myself why I was in this stupid race. The answer was always elusive and I came close to quitting many times. I noticed that the people who did well in these races were often those with a calm, steely focus; people who seemed to be able to maintain an even emotional state throughout. I, on the other hand, more emotional than I had realised, was as up and down and as out of control as a child on a bouncy castle. I would get surges of energy where I felt I could win the entire race, skipping down mountain sides like a character in a CGI movie. And then, bam, I\u2019d crash and tumble into dejection, anger, frustration. I would get mad at the race organisers for sending me up such steep hills. I would get mad at the hills themselves. Seasoned ultrarunners call these moments of crisis \u2013 when you\u2019re struggling to find the will to go on \u2013 the pain cave. And they talk about how they relish going there, how they love digging in the pain cave. But whenever I got even a few steps inside, all I could think was: \u201cThey\u2019re all mad.\u201d The pain cave was horrible, it ate you up, it tore you apart. Why would anyone want to experience this level of tiredness, this aching of every limb, seasoned with the thought you still had 50 miles to go? Actually, it was often this thought that was the worst thing. The moment you looked at your watch and started to calculate how far you still had to go, the distance was usually so overwhelming that just the thought of it hit you like a punch to the stomach. Ultrarunners repeatedly told me that the key was to stay in the moment, to run the mile you\u2019re in and forget about the rest. That sounded easy, but it wasn\u2019t. I read about a US runner who had lost some short-term memory function in an operation to cure her of epilepsy. As a result, when she ran, she never knew how far through a race she was, or how far she had to go. So she had no choice but to exist in the moment and just keep moving. It caused her no end of difficulties in her day-to-day life, but it made her a formidable ultrarunner. But how could I emulate her powers in my own ultrarunning? One trick was to ditch my watch, which helped a little. But I still longed for the outcome. One runner told me his big problem was that he always thought about the finish too early. At first, I didn\u2019t see why that was a problem. Surely that sweet feeling of conquering the race, of making it to the end, was a positive driving force. But the thought could break you, because the end was usually so far away, and because just thinking about it took you out of the present moment. As the Japanese marathon monks of Mount Hiei once told me about their challenge to complete 1,000 marathons in 1,000 days, it was a meditation in movement. Ultrarunning, done well, was all about the process, not the outcome. And, like a meditation, that meant staying in the moment. Eventually, I realised the secret was to embrace the struggle, as they\u2019d told me all along. To stand in the midst of the storm, facing the oblivion, and to say to yourself: this is why I\u2019m here. This is what I came for. A friend who ran two of my 100-mile races with me said an ultra marathon doesn\u2019t begin until 50 miles in. \u201cAt the start,\u201d she said, \u201cI have too much energy, but when I get tired, everything melts away and it\u2019s just me and the running.\u201d Yes, in the oblivion, deep in the pain cave, if we dig deep enough, if we push on through, we come to a place where it is strangely peaceful, where everything else melts away, even, amazingly, the pain in our legs, the tiredness that had seemed so debilitating, it all clears. And there, out in the mountains, or even on a city running track, we find ourselves fully present in the moment. It\u2019s rare, in our modern lives, to come this close to our stripped-back, primal selves. In the end, I found that in depths of an ultra marathon lies a stillness, an awareness of existence, that makes it all worthwhile. It was strange, but despite initially longing for that feeling of arriving at the finish as the all-conquering hero, glowing with the satisfaction of achieving my goal, in reality the end, when it came, was often an anti-climax. I know it sounds a bit bonkers, but sometimes, despite all my struggles, I\u2019d get to a point after 100 miles of running, where I didn\u2019t even want to stop.

It found that 72% of nurses, 70% of scientific, therapeutic and technical staff and 36% of ambulance staff earn less than the required \u00a335,800 threshold for indefinite leave to remain. It said that while occupations with shortages are exempt from the thresholds, such exemptions are temporary. Its analysis of the new rules warns: \u201cThe NHS is in a state of chronic staff shortage due to poor planning and insufficient training numbers over many years. There are 100,000 vacant posts in English trusts alone, although many will be filled by agency workers. The problem is concentrated in nursing and general practice.\u201d Mark Dayan, policy analyst at the Nuffield Trust thinktank, said: \u201cEven if you take all the actions that we could identify in terms of boosting nurses in training, preventing them from leaving at the same rate, the nursing gap is not going to shrink at all in the next five years without international recruitment. \u201cWe calculated that international recruitment of 5,000 nurses a year would be what it would take to halve the nursing gap, not even eliminate it, by 2023-24. If that doesn\u2019t happen, the sort of shortages we have now will continue. That\u2019s a patient safety issue and the ability of the NHS to move forward and get out of this crisis situation.\u201d Ditching the figure will place even more pressure on the need to train up British nurses. Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: \u201cWhile it\u2019s beneficial in the short-term, reliance on overseas nurses to plug gaps in England is clearly unsustainable.\u201d NHS Improvement said: \u201cNHS Improvement and the Department of Health and Social Care are finalising the interim [workforce] plan which should be published shortly.\u201d",

It is this group, which includes the party chairman Ian Lavery, that has steadfastly resisted backing a second public vote on Brexit, believing the result of the referendum should be honoured and that many Brexit-backing Labour supporters would never forgive the party if it allowed Britain to stay in the EU.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d30ced841e0906317d7fad2c49a34ec0d513e4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d30ced841e0906317d7fad2c49a34ec0d513e4c/0_164_3192_1915/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Watson was accused of trying to turn the party against its leader.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One after another, senior Labour figures went public, echoing Watson and demanding that the party stop sitting on the fence on Brexit.

Corbyn supporters on the left were joining in, too, including his closest political ally John McDonnell. Before the final results were in, the shadow chancellor said the previous approach of pushing for a general election was not going to work. \u201cOf course we want a general election,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cBut realistically after last night there aren\u2019t many Tory MPs that are going to vote for a general election.

      "bodyText": "Even before the first European election results were made public last Sunday there was talk at the top of the Labour party of a coup against Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cTom Watson\u2019s already out, surprise surprise, trying to take on the role of Prince Machiavelli,\u201d said Watson\u2019s former friend turned arch-enemy Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union and close ally of Corbyn. \u201cIf he\u2019s trying to turn Labour members against Corbyn and in his favour, then he\u2019s going to lose disastrously.\u201d McCluskey was reacting to an article Watson had written in the Observer that day saying that Labour would suffer a repeat of what he predicted would be terrible European election results at the next general election unless it ended its \u201cmealy-mouthed\u201d approach to Brexit. McCluskey, who seems to hate the idea of a second referendum on Brexit almost as much as he dislikes Watson, wanted to paint the deputy leader as a rogue plotter, interested more in his own pursuit of the leadership than the good of the Labour movement and the country. Within a few hours, however, as the disastrous results showed Labour had lost 11% of its vote share and half its seats in the European parliament, leaving it with none at all in Scotland, it was not Watson who seemed out on a limb but McCluskey and the small Corbyn inner circle of which he is part. It is this group, which includes the party chairman Ian Lavery, that has steadfastly resisted backing a second public vote on Brexit, believing the result of the referendum should be honoured and that many Brexit-backing Labour supporters would never forgive the party if it allowed Britain to stay in the EU. One after another, senior Labour figures went public, echoing Watson and demanding that the party stop sitting on the fence on Brexit. The evidence was clear, they said, that Labour\u2019s Remain backers had deserted the party in huge numbers, moving to the Lib Dems and Greens, outnumbering the Leavers who had gone to Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. First out of the blocks was Emily Thornberry, shadow foreign secretary, who demanded that Labour act immediately to change policy because a new Tory leader could soon back a no-deal Brexit and ruin the country. \u201cNo deal would be a disaster,\u201d she said. \u201cThere should be a referendum and we should be campaigning to Remain.\u201d But it was not only moderates like Thornberry. Corbyn supporters on the left were joining in, too, including his closest political ally John McDonnell. Before the final results were in, the shadow chancellor said the previous approach of pushing for a general election was not going to work. \u201cOf course we want a general election,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cBut realistically after last night there aren\u2019t many Tory MPs that are going to vote for a general election. It would be like turkeys voting for Christmas. \u201cSo our best way of doing that, I think, is going back to the people in a referendum, and I think that\u2019s what our members want.\u201d Then the Corbyn-supporting journalist Paul Mason wrote an excoriating article in the Guardian under the headline \u201cCorbynism is now in crisis: the only way forward is to oppose Brexit.\u201d Mason stuck the knife into Corbyn and his close-knit team of advisers, naming Seumas Milne, his director of strategy, and Karie Murphy, his chief of staff, who is a close friend of McCluskey. \u201cSince December, Corbyn and his advisers have got the Brexit strategy badly wrong \u2026 The campaign execution was dire from the top down,\u201d said Mason, adding that \u201cthe officials who designed this fiasco and ignored all evidence that it would lead to disaster must be removed from positions of influence\u201d. What McCluskey had tried to pass off as a doomed coup attempt led by the lonely figure of Watson seemed to be becoming the consensus view across much of the party. The past week has arguably been the worst for Corbyn since he saw off a genuine coup attempt by his own MPs in 2016. And it has all gone wrong at a time when the Tories\u2019 epic civil war over Europe, leading to the fall of Theresa May, should have seen Labour consolidating its bid for power. Losses in the European election not only reopened arguments over Labour\u2019s Brexit policy but unleashed vicious personal spats that climaxed with the decision on 28 May to expel Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s former spin doctor, from the party for having voted \u2013 like many, many other Labour members \u2013 for the Liberal Democrats. The party will not say which official took the decision but fingers have been pointed at Murphy and Milne. Senior figures from all the wings of the party were appalled at what they saw as a wildly provocative and unnecessarily divisive move. An #expelmetoo backlash took off on social media. Betty Boothroyd, the former Commons Speaker and ex-Labour MP, said: \u201cThe Labour party seems incapable of making positive leadership decisions of late. Fence-sitting seems to be in vogue. But the decision to expel Alastair Campbell from the party is the daftest, most insensitive decision of all. \u201cFor the first time in my long life I didn\u2019t vote Labour at the European elections, and there are no prizes for guessing where my vote went.\u201d Several senior members of the shadow cabinet have made known their dismay to the leader\u2019s office and will demand that the decision be overturned when MPs return to the Commons this week. Watson has already described the move as \u201cspiteful\u201d and said he wants it reviewed. Some Labour MPs believe the Campbell decision was taken deliberately in the hope of rallying Corbynites and distracting attention from an announcement (that broke on the same day) by the Equality and Human Rights Commission that it was launching an official inquiry into Labour\u2019s handling of antisemitism complaints under section 20 of the Equality Act 2006. The commission said it would seek to determine whether the party and its employees had committed unlawful acts of discrimination or failed to respond to complaints of unlawful acts in an efficient and effective manner. As it turned out, the equality commission\u2019s move and the Campbell row combined into one toxic mix. Wes Streeting, the Labour MP for Ilford North, was one of many who drew attention to the \u201cstark contrast between the ruthless speed of the Alastair Campbell expulsion and the constant foot-dragging over antisemitism cases\u201d, both of which, he said, revealed much about decision-making in the leader\u2019s office. To cap it all, on 31 May the party suspended Pete Willsman, a member of its national executive committee, after he was recorded saying that an Israeli agent had infiltrated the party and that the Jewish state had stirred up much of the row over antisemitism. It was the second time in 10 months that Willsman had been suspended over alleged antisemitism \u2013 but unlike Campbell he was not expelled. Over the past month Labour has gone backwards in two sets of elections at a time when the Conservatives have all but lost the ability to run the country. On Saturday the latest Opinium/Observer poll put Labour down seven points from a fortnight ago, on 22%. Incredibly, it is behind Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party, which is now the most popular force in the country on 26%. The Tories are on 17% (down five points) and the Liberal Democrats on 16% (up five points). There is much concern within the shadow cabinet over whether the lost votes will return. \u201cThe worry is that once people break the habit of voting Labour, that is that, they don\u2019t come back,\u201d said one shadow cabinet member. Increasingly, senior figures are demanding an end to fence-sitting on Brexit, and there are signs that the leadership is listening. Immediately after the European elections, Corbyn appeared to be warming to the idea of a second referendum but then on 30 May suggested he still backed a soft Brexit and said another public vote was still \u201csome way off\u201d. Today, writing in the Observer, the former Labour home secretary David Blunkett says there is no question of a coup against Corbyn himself, but says a way must be found to get him to change the personnel around him. \u201cIn my view, there are two forces within the Labour movement \u2013 the unions and Momentum \u2013 who must now act to get rid of those key advisers who are a block on policy changes and who are responsible for the incompetence we are seeing,\u201d Blunkett says. David Martin, Labour\u2019s longest-serving MEP, who lost his seat representing Scotland, went further, saying that if Labour did not change into an unequivocally Remain party it would be \u201cwiped out in Scotland and in other parts of the country\u201d. He added: \u201cIf Jeremy Corbyn is not prepared to make this change, he should his consider his position.

      "body": "<p>Flicking through the rails at high street store Monki, teenager Hanaa Maqbool swiftly picks out two looks she is considering wearing for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/eid-al-fitr\" title=\"\">Eid</a>; one is a floral jumpsuit with wide sleeves and even wider legs that she wants to match with a palm-print headscarf. The other is an oversize lemon print dress that she\u2019ll wear with cropped white jeans.</p> <p>\u201cMy sister is nine years older than me and she always says she never had the choices I do when she was growing up because covering up wasn\u2019t as easy then,\u201d she laughs. \u201cMum would always get her really nasty, bland Eid clothes \u2013 old-lady clothes \u2013 but the high street has cottoned on to fashionable Muslims. We\u2019re in now.\u201d</p> <p>Maqbool says she doesn\u2019t mind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/feb/22/generation-m-how-young-muslim-women-are-driving-a-modest-fashion-revolution\" title=\"\">modest fashion</a> being a trend; she is simply grateful for the choice. This is a look that embraces clavicles over cleavages and hemlines that hang low rather than hike high. \u201cIt\u2019s not about it just catering for Muslim girls,\u201d says Maqbool. \u201cLots of girls dress this way because it just looks cool.\u201d</p> <p>Maqbool\u2019s analysis is a fair summary for anyone with an eye on fashion; the prevailing silhouette of the decade has been voluminous sleeves and cocooned silhouettes \u2013 loose, comfortable, chic looks that brands like Arket, Cos and Weekday have used to build a significant fanbase. It\u2019s a style that has trickled down to the high street from high fashion and, crucially, from powerful female designers running influential labels.</p> <p>Jil Sander and Margaret Howell may have long favoured simple lines and boxier fits but arguably it is Phoebe Philo, the designer\u2019s designer, who has had the most significant impact. Her work \u2013 first at Stella McCartney, later when running Chlo\u00e9, and most significantly at C\u00e9line \u2013 favoured practical, functional pieces designed for getting things done. The proliferation of polo necks, white trainers and straight-cut trousers in our wardrobes are pure Philo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8bb1ef1777998f1c690cc28b4e0f5f183f5c5180\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bb1ef1777998f1c690cc28b4e0f5f183f5c5180/604_134_3331_4165/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ghizlan Guenez, left, and supermodel Erin O\u2019Connor.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ghizlan Guenez, left, and supermodel Erin O\u2019Connor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Gerrish/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so, when Victoria Beckham set up her fashion house over a decade ago, few could have predicted that the pioneer of Wag culture, trademarked as it then was by bouncy hair and bodycon, would follow suit and become an enduring influence on modest fashion. But next month, Beckham \u2013 alongside Valentino and Burberry \u2013 will be selling on The Modist, a luxury retailer that has become the Middle East\u2019s answer to Net-A-Porter: a high-fashion edit of runway looks tweaked and styled for modest dressers.</p> <p>Its founder, Ghizlan Guenez, launched her company on International Women\u2019s Day two years ago, under the tagline Modest Fashion, Modern Thinking. She has been working with western designers wanting to tap into the market since the very beginning. \u201cLots of designers are catering for the Middle East now: it\u2019s a significant area of growth,\u201d she says. \u201cBut where modest dressing might be a mood for the moment, the desire for women dressing this way all the time won\u2019t diminish.\u201d</p> <p>While Muslim women are assumed to be her biggest customers, she says the highest demand actually comes from clients in Texas. \u201cIt\u2019s not about religion or faith necessarily,\u201d she says. \u201cSo many women want, say, their dresses with sleeves, or to be more comfortable without compromising on looking stylish.\u201d</p> <p>Even Tom Ford, who made his name pushing the notion that \u201csex sells\u201d to its limit in the 1990s, has caught on. At New York fashion week in February, he debuted a collection of high necklines and layered knits. \u201cFashion is supposed to be, and should be, a fashion designer\u2019s perception of where we are culturally, and now is not the time for super-sexy clothes,\u201d said the man who, while at Gucci, ran an advert in which the brand\u2019s logo was shaved into a model\u2019s pubic hair.</p> <p>Headscarves and hijabs have also been <em>de rigueur</em> at the shows. Gucci, Max Mara, Molly Goddard, Versace, Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs and Chanel have all sent models in \u201cMuslim-ish\u201d headpieces down the runway. The argument that the industry is offensively fetishising religious wear, turning something deeply meaningful into a throwaway trend, has been made several times. On the other hand, by seeming to be more inclusive, is this progress?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BxqX9e9nXEU/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "Flicking through the rails at high street store Monki, teenager Hanaa Maqbool swiftly picks out two looks she is considering wearing for Eid; one is a floral jumpsuit with wide sleeves and even wider legs that she wants to match with a palm-print headscarf. The other is an oversize lemon print dress that she\u2019ll wear with cropped white jeans. \u201cMy sister is nine years older than me and she always says she never had the choices I do when she was growing up because covering up wasn\u2019t as easy then,\u201d she laughs. \u201cMum would always get her really nasty, bland Eid clothes \u2013 old-lady clothes \u2013 but the high street has cottoned on to fashionable Muslims. We\u2019re in now.\u201d Maqbool says she doesn\u2019t mind modest fashion being a trend; she is simply grateful for the choice. This is a look that embraces clavicles over cleavages and hemlines that hang low rather than hike high. \u201cIt\u2019s not about it just catering for Muslim girls,\u201d says Maqbool. \u201cLots of girls dress this way because it just looks cool.\u201d Maqbool\u2019s analysis is a fair summary for anyone with an eye on fashion; the prevailing silhouette of the decade has been voluminous sleeves and cocooned silhouettes \u2013 loose, comfortable, chic looks that brands like Arket, Cos and Weekday have used to build a significant fanbase. It\u2019s a style that has trickled down to the high street from high fashion and, crucially, from powerful female designers running influential labels. Jil Sander and Margaret Howell may have long favoured simple lines and boxier fits but arguably it is Phoebe Philo, the designer\u2019s designer, who has had the most significant impact. Her work \u2013 first at Stella McCartney, later when running Chlo\u00e9, and most significantly at C\u00e9line \u2013 favoured practical, functional pieces designed for getting things done. The proliferation of polo necks, white trainers and straight-cut trousers in our wardrobes are pure Philo. And so, when Victoria Beckham set up her fashion house over a decade ago, few could have predicted that the pioneer of Wag culture, trademarked as it then was by bouncy hair and bodycon, would follow suit and become an enduring influence on modest fashion. But next month, Beckham \u2013 alongside Valentino and Burberry \u2013 will be selling on The Modist, a luxury retailer that has become the Middle East\u2019s answer to Net-A-Porter: a high-fashion edit of runway looks tweaked and styled for modest dressers. Its founder, Ghizlan Guenez, launched her company on International Women\u2019s Day two years ago, under the tagline Modest Fashion, Modern Thinking. She has been working with western designers wanting to tap into the market since the very beginning. \u201cLots of designers are catering for the Middle East now: it\u2019s a significant area of growth,\u201d she says. \u201cBut where modest dressing might be a mood for the moment, the desire for women dressing this way all the time won\u2019t diminish.\u201d While Muslim women are assumed to be her biggest customers, she says the highest demand actually comes from clients in Texas. \u201cIt\u2019s not about religion or faith necessarily,\u201d she says. \u201cSo many women want, say, their dresses with sleeves, or to be more comfortable without compromising on looking stylish.\u201d Even Tom Ford, who made his name pushing the notion that \u201csex sells\u201d to its limit in the 1990s, has caught on. At New York fashion week in February, he debuted a collection of high necklines and layered knits. \u201cFashion is supposed to be, and should be, a fashion designer\u2019s perception of where we are culturally, and now is not the time for super-sexy clothes,\u201d said the man who, while at Gucci, ran an advert in which the brand\u2019s logo was shaved into a model\u2019s pubic hair. Headscarves and hijabs have also been de rigueur at the shows. Gucci, Max Mara, Molly Goddard, Versace, Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs and Chanel have all sent models in \u201cMuslim-ish\u201d headpieces down the runway. The argument that the industry is offensively fetishising religious wear, turning something deeply meaningful into a throwaway trend, has been made several times. On the other hand, by seeming to be more inclusive, is this progress? Author and influencer Yassmin Abdel-Magied is circumspect: \u201cI think modest being fashionable right now isn\u2019t really about modesty: it\u2019s about trends.

      "body": "<p>In the spring of 1989, Zhou Guocong had just finished school and taken a job at a pipe factory to help his family \u2013 farmers living on the outskirts of Chengdu. At the age of 17 and the youngest of four, he was still a child in many ways. He played with his nieces and nephews and enjoyed cartoons. He was known for being introverted, but loving.</p> \n<p>On 6 June, Zhou went out, telling his mother he was heading \u201cto play\u201d, and never came home. For the past three decades, Zhou\u2019s mother, Tang Deying, 83, has been seeking redress for the death of her son, one of dozens believed killed in Chengdu as police moved to put down student protests, after Chinese troops did the same a thousand miles away in the capital.</p> \n<p>Between April and early June 1989, the south-western Chinese city had been overtaken by students protesting in solidarity with their peers in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. In the early hours of 4 June, those students were shot or crushed by tanks as the military cleared the square. In Chengdu, enraged students and citizens poured on to the streets, demanding \u201cblood for blood\u201d. Following Beijing\u2019s lead, the city\u2019s security forces were deployed.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/02/tiananmen-square-30-years-on-china-brutal-events-jonathan-mirsky\">Tiananmen Square 30 years on: \u2018At 3am, I feared I might be killed\u2019</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Amid the chaos, Tang went looking for her son, talking to his former classmates and their relatives. After a few days, the family learned he had been detained by police. After two months, they received confirmation he had died. Zhou\u2019s sister, Guoyun, who was 20 at the time, remembers her parents sobbing in the next room. \u201cIt was a sleepless night,\u201d she told the <em>Observer</em>. As she recalls it, her father\u2019s hair turned white overnight.</p> \n<p>The police never explained how Zhou died in their custody. After 11 years of constant trips to the police and the local court, Tang was given a photo by police of her son\u2019s body, his face bruised and his nose covered in blood.</p> \n<p>Tang is emphatic that her son, whom the police accused of being a \u201ccounter-revolutionary\u201d, an imprisonable offence at the time, had nothing to do with the protests. He never expressed interest in the issues the students were demonstrating over \u2013 government corruption, democratic reforms, or freedoms.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe just wanted to see the crowds,\u201d said Tang, who has for years been placed under heavy surveillance for her efforts. \u201cMy son died at the age of 17.

Two days after his death, on 17 April, several hundred students marched to Tiananmen Square and laid a wreath to him. They called for greater freedom of speech, economic freedoms and curbs on corruption. The demonstrations spread to hundreds of cities.</p>\n    <p>On 26 April, an editorial in the Communist Party\u2019s People\u2019s Daily denounced the student demonstrations as a \u2018premeditated and organised conspiracy and turmoil\u2019. The next day, tens of thousands of students in Beijing staged a demonstration to protest against the editorial. On 13 May, just two days before the arrival of Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev for a state visit, hundreds of students began a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square. The protests forced the cancellation of the welcoming ceremony. On 20 May, martial law was declared in parts of Beijing. Troops moved in, but were blocked by the civilians and demonstrations continued.</p>\n    <p>In the early hours of 4 June, Chinese troops launched a two-pronged attack with orders to put down the protests. Armoured cars and tanks smashed through the citizens\u2019 barricades. Some forty workers who went to plead with the soldiers were shot. On 5 June, an unidentified young man stood in front of a tank convoy leaving Tiananmen Square, in a final act of defiance. The actual number of deaths from the crackdown remains unknown, but it is believed the Chinese army killed at least 10,000 people, according to a secret diplomatic cable from the British ambassador to Beijing.</p>\n    <p>Thirty years on, the Chinese authorities continue to view the Tiananmen protests as one of the most sensitive and taboo subjects. \u2018June 4\u2019, as the movement is commonly known as in China, remains largely scrubbed from official history and is censored from school text books and online. The authorities punish those who try to commemorate the event, and relatives of the victims who died during the massacre are barred from openly mourning their loved ones.<br></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/verna-yu\"><b>Verna Yu</b></a>&nbsp;<i>in Hong Kong</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Perhaps at even greater risk of being forgotten are the pro-democracy protests that took place in more than 300 Chinese cities at the time. These lesser-known student movements contributed to the government\u2019s ultimate decision to crack down in Tiananmen Square. Their legacy remains today, as authorities go to lengths to ensure such demonstrations don\u2019t happen again.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was nationwide. It wasn\u2019t just one large protest. That\u2019s what made it much more frightening to the government and one reason why it needed to have a show of force,\u201d said Jonathan Unger, a sociologist at Australian National University, who edited the 1991 book <em>The Pro-Democracy Protests in China: Reports from the Provinces</em>.</p> \n<p>Protests were reported in 341 Chinese cities between April and June 1989, according to <em>The Tiananmen Papers</em>, a collection of leaked government documents. Between 5 and 8 June, as news of the violence in Beijing spread, the government received reports of demonstrations in 181 cities, including all provincial capitals, major cities and economic zones. By 9 June, most had petered out or were shut down by police.</p> \n<p>What remains today is an incomplete history of these protests, pieced together by witness accounts and scant details in government reports. The authorities launched a media blackout after the clampdown. Most Chinese who remember the demonstrations in their cities, including Zhou\u2019s sister Guoyun, will not \u201ctalk about politics\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24b5bfa942fcd80299703b60bb8251131978fea6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24b5bfa942fcd80299703b60bb8251131978fea6/0_158_2998_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators march in Shanghai, 19 May 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators march in Shanghai, 19 May 1989.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Avery/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt was a national event, yet we know so little,\u201d said Zhou Fengsuo, a student leader in Beijing, who was later jailed with many other student activists. \u201cThey weren\u2019t noticed, many of them we only knew of later, in recent years. We realised pretty much in every county there were protests. Anecdotally, we heard so many reports. Sometimes even just high school students.\u201d</p> \n<p>When Chen Pokong, a student activist, moved to Guangzhou in 1987, friends told him to forget about bringing political change to the fast-growing trade hub.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople told me Guangzhou was a completely commercial city. People here only care about money. If you want to spread democracy here, no way will anyone listen to you,\u201d said Chen, at the time a young assistant professor of economics.</p> \n<p>Soon Chen and his students were posting articles by liberal thinkers on campus bulletin boards and holding weekly salons to reflect on the country\u2019s history and future. By late May of 1989, they were organising protests, drawing tens of thousands of people.</p> \n<p>Historians often attribute the 1989 protests to a paradox of China\u2019s \u201creform and opening up\u201d of the 1980s. Modernising the lagging economy meant opening the country to new ideas and reforms, but conservative top officials would only go so far.</p> \n<p>Students, while free to debate and explore new ideas, were subjected to myriad rules dictated by their universities \u2013 a remnant of the planned economy where the <em>danwei</em>, or work unit, determined most aspects of one\u2019s personal life.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn one sense it was this enormous opening up and yet you had the party with its instinct to control. The party was doing one thing with the left hand and another with the right hand,\u201d said Unger.</p> \n<p>In Changsha, in southern China, students were not allowed to date until their third year and, when they were, all romantic relationships had to be registered. Students had a bedtime, as well as designated times to listen to music or sit on their beds, according to an account by Andrea Worden, an English teacher at Hunan Medical College when the protests broke out.</p> \n<p>When the protests started, students demanded not just political reform, but more personal freedom.

      "bodyText": "In the spring of 1989, Zhou Guocong had just finished school and taken a job at a pipe factory to help his family \u2013 farmers living on the outskirts of Chengdu. At the age of 17 and the youngest of four, he was still a child in many ways. He played with his nieces and nephews and enjoyed cartoons. He was known for being introverted, but loving. On 6 June, Zhou went out, telling his mother he was heading \u201cto play\u201d, and never came home. For the past three decades, Zhou\u2019s mother, Tang Deying, 83, has been seeking redress for the death of her son, one of dozens believed killed in Chengdu as police moved to put down student protests, after Chinese troops did the same a thousand miles away in the capital. Between April and early June 1989, the south-western Chinese city had been overtaken by students protesting in solidarity with their peers in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. In the early hours of 4 June, those students were shot or crushed by tanks as the military cleared the square. In Chengdu, enraged students and citizens poured on to the streets, demanding \u201cblood for blood\u201d. Following Beijing\u2019s lead, the city\u2019s security forces were deployed. Amid the chaos, Tang went looking for her son, talking to his former classmates and their relatives. After a few days, the family learned he had been detained by police. After two months, they received confirmation he had died. Zhou\u2019s sister, Guoyun, who was 20 at the time, remembers her parents sobbing in the next room. \u201cIt was a sleepless night,\u201d she told the Observer. As she recalls it, her father\u2019s hair turned white overnight. The police never explained how Zhou died in their custody. After 11 years of constant trips to the police and the local court, Tang was given a photo by police of her son\u2019s body, his face bruised and his nose covered in blood. Tang is emphatic that her son, whom the police accused of being a \u201ccounter-revolutionary\u201d, an imprisonable offence at the time, had nothing to do with the protests. He never expressed interest in the issues the students were demonstrating over \u2013 government corruption, democratic reforms, or freedoms. \u201cHe just wanted to see the crowds,\u201d said Tang, who has for years been placed under heavy surveillance for her efforts. \u201cMy son died at the age of 17. Even if he made a mistake, he didn\u2019t deserve death.\u201d Tuesday marks 30 years since the Chinese military cleared student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, killing hundreds \u2013 possibly thousands \u2013 of unarmed protesters, as well as bystanders, local workers and residents trying to protect the students. The Chinese leadership has worked to erase this chapter from the collective memory, omitting it from history books, censoring all mentions of \u201c6/4\u201d online, jailing those who were involved, as well as detaining any who attempt to memorialise it. Perhaps at even greater risk of being forgotten are the pro-democracy protests that took place in more than 300 Chinese cities at the time. These lesser-known student movements contributed to the government\u2019s ultimate decision to crack down in Tiananmen Square. Their legacy remains today, as authorities go to lengths to ensure such demonstrations don\u2019t happen again. \u201cIt was nationwide. It wasn\u2019t just one large protest. That\u2019s what made it much more frightening to the government and one reason why it needed to have a show of force,\u201d said Jonathan Unger, a sociologist at Australian National University, who edited the 1991 book The Pro-Democracy Protests in China: Reports from the Provinces. Protests were reported in 341 Chinese cities between April and June 1989, according to The Tiananmen Papers, a collection of leaked government documents. Between 5 and 8 June, as news of the violence in Beijing spread, the government received reports of demonstrations in 181 cities, including all provincial capitals, major cities and economic zones. By 9 June, most had petered out or were shut down by police. What remains today is an incomplete history of these protests, pieced together by witness accounts and scant details in government reports. The authorities launched a media blackout after the clampdown. Most Chinese who remember the demonstrations in their cities, including Zhou\u2019s sister Guoyun, will not \u201ctalk about politics\u201d. \u201cIt was a national event, yet we know so little,\u201d said Zhou Fengsuo, a student leader in Beijing, who was later jailed with many other student activists. \u201cThey weren\u2019t noticed, many of them we only knew of later, in recent years. We realised pretty much in every county there were protests. Anecdotally, we heard so many reports. Sometimes even just high school students.\u201d When Chen Pokong, a student activist, moved to Guangzhou in 1987, friends told him to forget about bringing political change to the fast-growing trade hub. \u201cPeople told me Guangzhou was a completely commercial city. People here only care about money. If you want to spread democracy here, no way will anyone listen to you,\u201d said Chen, at the time a young assistant professor of economics. Soon Chen and his students were posting articles by liberal thinkers on campus bulletin boards and holding weekly salons to reflect on the country\u2019s history and future. By late May of 1989, they were organising protests, drawing tens of thousands of people. Historians often attribute the 1989 protests to a paradox of China\u2019s \u201creform and opening up\u201d of the 1980s. Modernising the lagging economy meant opening the country to new ideas and reforms, but conservative top officials would only go so far. Students, while free to debate and explore new ideas, were subjected to myriad rules dictated by their universities \u2013 a remnant of the planned economy where the danwei, or work unit, determined most aspects of one\u2019s personal life. \u201cIn one sense it was this enormous opening up and yet you had the party with its instinct to control. The party was doing one thing with the left hand and another with the right hand,\u201d said Unger. In Changsha, in southern China, students were not allowed to date until their third year and, when they were, all romantic relationships had to be registered. Students had a bedtime, as well as designated times to listen to music or sit on their beds, according to an account by Andrea Worden, an English teacher at Hunan Medical College when the protests broke out. When the protests started, students demanded not just political reform, but more personal freedom. By mid-May, students at Worden\u2019s university were skipping classes, plastering poems on the walls and marching in their white medical coats. \u201cThe city came alive. The school came alive. People were finally able to express themselves,\u201d Worden said. Protests mirrored those in Beijing, beginning in April, after the death of former leader Hu Yaobang, a reformist beloved by students. \u201cWhen Beijing students took to the streets, other cities also took to the streets,\u201d said Shao Jiang, one of the student leaders in Beijing. But the influence went both ways. Students travelled between cities, bringing leaflets and magazines to share what was happening on campuses. News was transmitted via fax machines, while others wrote letters or sent telegrams. In Lanzhou, in China\u2019s northern Gansu province, students had a direct line to demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. Student teams were responsible for communication between schools, and workers also used the student networks to spread information, Shao said. By 4 June, communication was cut as tanks moved in on Tiananmen Square. Students across the country who had previously taken their cues from Beijing were suddenly on their own. In Lanzhou, the students were better prepared. Thanks to their hotline to Beijing, news of the crackdown reached the activists quickly. By daylight on the morning of 4 June, more than a thousand students had taken over the city, blocking roads, train tracks and a major bridge. \u201cAll of the students came out. By dawn, all of Lanzhou was ruled by students,\u201d said a former organiser, still living in China, who asked not to be named for security reasons. He and other students blocked a main bridge, asking bus drivers to leave their vehicles on the bridge with the air let out of the tyres. Residents brought the students water, bread, zongzi (stuffed rice wrapped in a leaf) and salted duck eggs. Protests had sprung up in almost 200 cities in response to the Tiananmen massacre, as students mourned their peers in Beijing. But by 8 June, most of these were over. Lanzhou was one of the last to give up. \u201cEveryone decided to leave, to retreat and be done. There was no more hope. All the students went home,\u201d said the protest organiser. While the highest number of deaths were in Beijing \u2013 most estimates range between several hundred and 3,000 \u2013 the reprisals and repression against protesters in the provinces, far from international scrutiny, were in some cases worse. Many political prisoners in jail today were active in 1989 in cities other than Beijing. Xie Changfa, involved in the pro-democracy movement in Hunan province, spent two years in a \u201cre-education through labour\u201d camp and is currently serving a 13-year sentence. Li Bifeng, a poet jailed for five years for \u201ccounter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement\u201d in Chengdu, is serving an additional 10-year sentence. Jiang Fuzhen, now living overseas, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for helping protesters in Qingdao. One little-known episode of violent clashes with police in Xi\u2019an, in central China, early on in the movement, has been documented by a handful of witnesses and government papers. Thousands of protesters had gathered outside the provincial government office on 22 April 1989 to demand a meeting with the governor.

He was not best pleased when Liverpool substitutes took off their tracksuit tops before the final whistle in readiness to run on to the pitch either.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/01/tottenham-liverpool-champions-league-final-match-report\">Liverpool win Champions League after Salah and Origi sink Tottenham</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>When it sounded he was in the arms of Mauricio Pochettino, embracing in the beaten manager a pain he had felt twice before but could now let go. Then he blew a kiss to his family in the stands. The immediate reaction may have been muted but how Klopp and Liverpool needed this. He will not be asked about losing finals or an unlucky career again.</p> \n<p>The season demanded a crowning glory, not another near-miss to join the list of Champions League, Premier League, Europa League and League Cup that Klopp has endured in his 44 months at Anfield. A weight of disappointment that predated him with the title slip in 2014, and which fuelled the nearly-men tag that always riled Brendan Rodgers, was swept away with this gruelling defeat of Spurs.</p> \n<p>Over the line at last thanks to an obstinate backline in which Jo\u00ebl Matip excelled and Alisson repelled everything that Pochettino\u2019s team created; and a telling substitution that allowed Origi to reprise his role as unlikely Champions League hero. How much Liverpool needed this and how far they have come.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7954817a-e919-4942-a437-8d18bf680763\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HAKCT7vPrhg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Four years ago their season ended in a 6-1 defeat at Stoke, the club\u2019s heaviest loss since 1963. Klopp\u2019s reconstruction of a European heavyweight has not been without setbacks on the final match-day but he will consider each and every one worthwhile for the elation that arrived in the Spanish capital.</p> \n<p>His first Champions League final victory has arrived at the third attempt, just like his efforts to win promotion to the Bundesliga with Mainz when starting a career that has now attained legendary status at Anfield. Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan, Rafael Ben\u00edtez and J\u00fcrgen Norbert Klopp; the men who have brought more European Cups to Liverpool than to the rest of the Premier League combined. Only Real Madrid and Milan have gathered more. The football romantic in Klopp will savour that accolade, though maybe privately.</p> \n<p>Liverpool were far from their best in a forgettable final but completed the job they were here to do. Winning was all that mattered after Kiev and being pipped to the Premier League title by Manchester City. The penalty awarded after 22 seconds and converted by Mohamed Salah settled a degree of anxiety, for there was an expectation on Liverpool that was absent in previous finals under Klopp.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jun/01/liverpools-win-is-brilliant-culmination-of-klopps-inclusive-project\">Liverpool\u2019s win is brilliant culmination of Klopp\u2019s inclusive project</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It stemmed from the mantle of favourites, of possessing more European knowhow than Spurs, of finishing 26 points above them in the Premier League and having a fitter, deeper squad for the day of reckoning. It was a role reversal, in many respects, from last season\u2019s final against Madrid. But there was much more resting on Klopp\u2019s players as the pre-final circus packed up and they kicked off. The pressure on Liverpool in the buildup to this match was connected to the past, namely in the need to banish the pain of Kiev and their manager\u2019s record of six consecutive cup final defeats, a sequence he joked rendered him the \u201cworld record-holder in winning semi-finals\u201d. But it also concerned the future.</p> \n<p>Every campaign under the 51-year-old has yielded progress. To have entered next season on the back of winning 97 points but not as Premier League champions, plus a second successive Champions League final but not as European champions, would have left Klopp with a considerable test of even his galvanising powers to maintain momentum given the demoralising impact. The narrative that great memories compensate for trophies, one that Klopp himself fuelled after the Barcelona comeback, would be dismissed as a convenient diversion. Those memories cannot be brushed aside now they have silverware to sustain them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d6a6cb33-21d6-43cb-8b4d-c6c0d3da46a4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SlXwIMr1PBY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As Jordan Henderson followed his predecessors as Liverpool captain in lifting the European Cup \u2013 Emlyn Hughes, Phil Thompson, Graeme Souness and Steven Gerrard \u2013 Klopp stood at the back of the throng absorbing the moment. He will party now, even more secure in the knowledge that he and Liverpool were always the perfect fit.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy missus always asks when is the last game of the season because there is a chance if there is a final I will be involved,\u201d Klopp said on Friday. For the benefit of Ulla Sandrock it is 30 May next year. At the Ataturk Stadium in Istanbul. Liverpool have a glorious story about that place. And Rome, and London, and Paris, and Rome again, and now from a sweltering but historic night in Madrid.</p>",

      "bodyText": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp predicted one title within four years on his first full day as Liverpool manager in October 2015. He never promised it would be pretty but he has delivered on schedule. Just. From doubters to believers, nearly-men to champions of Europe; his transformation is complete. The architect of Liverpool\u2019s sixth European Cup triumph was the only member of his technical area not to cavort in celebration when Divock Origi sealed Tottenham\u2019s fate in the 87th minute and confirmed Old Big Ears was heading back to Anfield. He was not best pleased when Liverpool substitutes took off their tracksuit tops before the final whistle in readiness to run on to the pitch either. When it sounded he was in the arms of Mauricio Pochettino, embracing in the beaten manager a pain he had felt twice before but could now let go. Then he blew a kiss to his family in the stands. The immediate reaction may have been muted but how Klopp and Liverpool needed this. He will not be asked about losing finals or an unlucky career again. The season demanded a crowning glory, not another near-miss to join the list of Champions League, Premier League, Europa League and League Cup that Klopp has endured in his 44 months at Anfield. A weight of disappointment that predated him with the title slip in 2014, and which fuelled the nearly-men tag that always riled Brendan Rodgers, was swept away with this gruelling defeat of Spurs. Over the line at last thanks to an obstinate backline in which Jo\u00ebl Matip excelled and Alisson repelled everything that Pochettino\u2019s team created; and a telling substitution that allowed Origi to reprise his role as unlikely Champions League hero. How much Liverpool needed this and how far they have come. Four years ago their season ended in a 6-1 defeat at Stoke, the club\u2019s heaviest loss since 1963. Klopp\u2019s reconstruction of a European heavyweight has not been without setbacks on the final match-day but he will consider each and every one worthwhile for the elation that arrived in the Spanish capital. His first Champions League final victory has arrived at the third attempt, just like his efforts to win promotion to the Bundesliga with Mainz when starting a career that has now attained legendary status at Anfield. Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan, Rafael Ben\u00edtez and J\u00fcrgen Norbert Klopp; the men who have brought more European Cups to Liverpool than to the rest of the Premier League combined. Only Real Madrid and Milan have gathered more. The football romantic in Klopp will savour that accolade, though maybe privately. Liverpool were far from their best in a forgettable final but completed the job they were here to do. Winning was all that mattered after Kiev and being pipped to the Premier League title by Manchester City. The penalty awarded after 22 seconds and converted by Mohamed Salah settled a degree of anxiety, for there was an expectation on Liverpool that was absent in previous finals under Klopp. It stemmed from the mantle of favourites, of possessing more European knowhow than Spurs, of finishing 26 points above them in the Premier League and having a fitter, deeper squad for the day of reckoning. It was a role reversal, in many respects, from last season\u2019s final against Madrid. But there was much more resting on Klopp\u2019s players as the pre-final circus packed up and they kicked off. The pressure on Liverpool in the buildup to this match was connected to the past, namely in the need to banish the pain of Kiev and their manager\u2019s record of six consecutive cup final defeats, a sequence he joked rendered him the \u201cworld record-holder in winning semi-finals\u201d. But it also concerned the future. Every campaign under the 51-year-old has yielded progress. To have entered next season on the back of winning 97 points but not as Premier League champions, plus a second successive Champions League final but not as European champions, would have left Klopp with a considerable test of even his galvanising powers to maintain momentum given the demoralising impact. The narrative that great memories compensate for trophies, one that Klopp himself fuelled after the Barcelona comeback, would be dismissed as a convenient diversion. Those memories cannot be brushed aside now they have silverware to sustain them. As Jordan Henderson followed his predecessors as Liverpool captain in lifting the European Cup \u2013 Emlyn Hughes, Phil Thompson, Graeme Souness and Steven Gerrard \u2013 Klopp stood at the back of the throng absorbing the moment. He will party now, even more secure in the knowledge that he and Liverpool were always the perfect fit. \u201cMy missus always asks when is the last game of the season because there is a chance if there is a final I will be involved,\u201d Klopp said on Friday. For the benefit of Ulla Sandrock it is 30 May next year. At the Ataturk Stadium in Istanbul. Liverpool have a glorious story about that place. And Rome, and London, and Paris, and Rome again, and now from a sweltering but historic night in Madrid.",

      "bodyText": "After an unprecedented week for English football, when four of the nation\u2019s teams contested two European cup finals, the domestic game appears to be in rude health. But the chances of another European final in which homegrown stars such as Tottenham\u2019s Harry Kane and Liverpool\u2019s Trent Alexander-Arnold do battle is becoming more remote. Britain\u2019s football pitches are in decline, something that experts say jeopardises the country\u2019s ability to develop the next generation of stars.

Two days after his death, on 17 April, several hundred students marched to Tiananmen Square and laid a wreath to him. They called for greater freedom of speech, economic freedoms and curbs on corruption. The demonstrations spread to hundreds of cities.</p>\n    <p>On 26 April, an editorial in the Communist Party\u2019s People\u2019s Daily denounced the student demonstrations as a \u2018premeditated and organised conspiracy and turmoil\u2019. The next day, tens of thousands of students in Beijing staged a demonstration to protest against the editorial. On 13 May, just two days before the arrival of Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev for a state visit, hundreds of students began a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square. The protests forced the cancellation of the welcoming ceremony. On 20 May, martial law was declared in parts of Beijing. Troops moved in, but were blocked by the civilians and demonstrations continued.</p>\n    <p>In the early hours of 4 June, Chinese troops launched a two-pronged attack with orders to put down the protests. Armoured cars and tanks smashed through the citizens\u2019 barricades. Some forty workers who went to plead with the soldiers were shot. On 5 June, an unidentified young man stood in front of a tank convoy leaving Tiananmen Square, in a final act of defiance. The actual number of deaths from the crackdown remains unknown, but it is believed the Chinese army killed at least 10,000 people, according to a secret diplomatic cable from the British ambassador to Beijing.</p>\n    <p>Thirty years on, the Chinese authorities continue to view the Tiananmen protests as one of the most sensitive and taboo subjects. \u2018June 4\u2019, as the movement is commonly known as in China, remains largely scrubbed from official history and is censored from school text books and online. The authorities punish those who try to commemorate the event, and relatives of the victims who died during the massacre are barred from openly mourning their loved ones.<br></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/verna-yu\"><b>Verna Yu</b></a>&nbsp;<i>in Hong Kong</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As they began beating me with their rubber truncheons, the officer shot fallen demonstrators.

Makumbi made the same journey from Uganda to Manchester that so many of her characters struggle with in this collection, which spans work from 2012 to the present day. Yet it never feels repetitive. Rather, <em>Manchester Happened</em> explores the emotional nuance of the immigrant experience, particularly so in the Commonwealth short story prize-winning Let\u2019s Tell This Story Properly.

A student inhabited by male and female spirits which become different parts of her psyche, Ada starts the book as a \u201cshe\u201d and ends up a \u201cthey\u201d, navigating rape, self-harm, alcohol and eating disorders on the journey to some kind of peace. Emezi has said <em>Freshwater</em> is a \u201cbreath away from being a memoir\u201d but the real achievement is that it works as a strange, phantasmagoric fairytale that asks us to think deeply about who we are.</p> <h2>Zonal Marking: The Making of Modern European Football</h2> <p>Michael Cox<br><em>HarperCollins, \u00a316.99, pp448</em><br></p> <p>As Michael Cox suggests in this intricate study of football tactics, Manchester City\u2019s success and the European dominance of English clubs this season didn\u2019t come from nowhere. They came from Johan Cruyff and Louis Van Gaal\u2019s Dutch mastery in the 1990s; Spain\u2019s <em>tiki-taka</em> triumphs from 2008-2012; and, more recently, the rapid pressing game of the Germans. accessible writing masking some diligent research; this is a fascinating assessment of football in 2019.</p> <p>\u2022 To order <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/manchester-happened-9781786075895.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Manchester Happened</em></a>, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/freshwater-9780571345403.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Freshwater</em></a> or <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/zonal-marking-9780008291167.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Zonal Marking: The Making of Modern European Football</em></a> go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

      "bodyText": "Manchester Happened Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi Oneworld, \u00a314.99, pp320 A surprise winner of the Windham Campbell prize for fiction last year, Makumbi\u2019s collection of short stories reveals a thoughtful writer who quietly, engagingly, pierces the reality of relocating to Britain. Makumbi made the same journey from Uganda to Manchester that so many of her characters struggle with in this collection, which spans work from 2012 to the present day. Yet it never feels repetitive. Rather, Manchester Happened explores the emotional nuance of the immigrant experience, particularly so in the Commonwealth short story prize-winning Let\u2019s Tell This Story Properly. An apt title: Makumbi definitely does. Freshwater Akwaeke Emezi Faber, \u00a310, pp240 Akwaeke Emezi is the first gender-fluid writer to be longlisted for the Women\u2019s prize, and, via the mythic coming-of-age story of Ada, Freshwater certainly channels this remarkable Nigerian author\u2019s interests in identity. A student inhabited by male and female spirits which become different parts of her psyche, Ada starts the book as a \u201cshe\u201d and ends up a \u201cthey\u201d, navigating rape, self-harm, alcohol and eating disorders on the journey to some kind of peace. Emezi has said Freshwater is a \u201cbreath away from being a memoir\u201d but the real achievement is that it works as a strange, phantasmagoric fairytale that asks us to think deeply about who we are. Zonal Marking: The Making of Modern European Football Michael Cox HarperCollins, \u00a316.99, pp448 As Michael Cox suggests in this intricate study of football tactics, Manchester City\u2019s success and the European dominance of English clubs this season didn\u2019t come from nowhere. They came from Johan Cruyff and Louis Van Gaal\u2019s Dutch mastery in the 1990s; Spain\u2019s tiki-taka triumphs from 2008-2012; and, more recently, the rapid pressing game of the Germans. accessible writing masking some diligent research; this is a fascinating assessment of football in 2019. \u2022 To order Manchester Happened, Freshwater or Zonal Marking: The Making of Modern European Football go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

In a series of 10 plays he set out to chart the inner and outer experience of 20th-century African Americans decade by decade, plaiting together documentary and dream life. The result is vaulting, inspiring and uneven. There are duff stretches but also scenes as electric as anything in the theatre of the last 100 years.</p> <p>Nadia Fall\u2019s strongly cast production of <strong><a href=\"http://stratfordeast.com/whats-on/all-shows/king-hedley-ii\" title=\"\">King Hedley II</a></strong> makes this richly apparent. Lenny Henry scissors his way across the stage as a conman, lethally vivid in a white suit. Aaron Pierre is magnetic as the young man struggling to make a life after jail: with a gun in his pocket and a slashed face, he muscles his way against the air as if it were another enemy. Martina Laird sings of red sails in the sunset as if they were stitched with her blood. These characters are always near to losing everything.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/may/20/august-wilson-playwright-black-america-constanza-romero-interview-king-hedley-ii\">Pittsburgh state of mind: how August Wilson's flame burns on</a> </p> </aside>  <p>London in 2019 does not seem far removed from Wilson\u2019s plot of knives and guns and desperation set in 1980s Pittsburgh. Yet the success of his play reaches beyond contemporary echoes. History is at every character\u2019s elbow. A death described early in <em>King Hedley II</em> is of Ester, a former slave and the main character in Wilson\u2019s <em>Gem of the Ocean</em>.</p> <p>Ester was more than 300 years old. Wilson\u2019s dramatic cycle includes more than realism. Between scenes lightning sizzles as if to presage apocalypse. A Bible-basher circles the action roaring prophecy. Oh God, I felt, am I going to have to hold my breathe in awe? False alarm. His speech is also street: \u201cGod\u2019s a bad motherfucker.\u201d The great roll of the play allows for buoyancy, comic display \u2013 and arresting lines. \u201cI might,\u201d says Pierre, recounting a wild, improbable night-haunting, \u201chave dreamt it because it\u2019s true.\u201d</p> <p>Domestic drama is often accused of lacking ambition (as if width rather than depth were a measure), and plays by women have more readily been thought of as merely domestic. <strong><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/rutherford-and-son\" title=\"\">Rutherford and Son</a></strong>, Githa Sowerby\u2019s glowering, penetrating study of patriarchal capitalism, was acclaimed when first performed in 1912 (with the writer\u2019s sex disguised as \u201cKG Sowerby\u201d), then for years undervalued. Not any more. Productions are no longer rare: more <em>\u00e0 point</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff4ceaf58550b7613b3521a9faa23d7a383df1f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff4ceaf58550b7613b3521a9faa23d7a383df1f1/0_170_4677_2806/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roger Allam and Justine Mitchell in Rutherford and Son.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roger Allam and Justine Mitchell in Rutherford and Son.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Persson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Polly Findlay\u2019s staging is meticulous but overemphatic. The power of the play is in its combination of dramatic action \u2013 a secret affair, theft, people being turned from their homes \u2013 and understatement: \u201cSuch doings,\u201d mumbles one grim old biddy. Roger Allam catches this perfectly as the all-dominating Dad. It would be so easy simply to monsterise Rutherford, as he barks at his daughter to take off his shoes. Allam convinces more subtly: he crushes by self-absorbed indifference while also suggesting a mighty male dedication to work. Seeming hardly to exert himself (he closes off a conversation by putting on his specs), he treats his family as if they were faulty bits of machinery: \u201cNo good for my purpose,\u201d he says of one of his sons.</p> <p>Justine Mitchell plays the down-beaten (that\u2019s to say unmarried) daughter, who has a secret life, with a steady frankness; sulkiness flashing into passion. She makes you feel that she has been seized up by circumstances. Both seem part of Lizzie Clachan\u2019s clever design, which is a tumult of naturalism, an impressive display of smothering by acquisition.

      "bodyText": "August Wilson had a mighty project as a playwright. In a series of 10 plays he set out to chart the inner and outer experience of 20th-century African Americans decade by decade, plaiting together documentary and dream life. The result is vaulting, inspiring and uneven. There are duff stretches but also scenes as electric as anything in the theatre of the last 100 years. Nadia Fall\u2019s strongly cast production of King Hedley II makes this richly apparent. Lenny Henry scissors his way across the stage as a conman, lethally vivid in a white suit. Aaron Pierre is magnetic as the young man struggling to make a life after jail: with a gun in his pocket and a slashed face, he muscles his way against the air as if it were another enemy. Martina Laird sings of red sails in the sunset as if they were stitched with her blood. These characters are always near to losing everything. London in 2019 does not seem far removed from Wilson\u2019s plot of knives and guns and desperation set in 1980s Pittsburgh. Yet the success of his play reaches beyond contemporary echoes. History is at every character\u2019s elbow. A death described early in King Hedley II is of Ester, a former slave and the main character in Wilson\u2019s Gem of the Ocean. Ester was more than 300 years old. Wilson\u2019s dramatic cycle includes more than realism. Between scenes lightning sizzles as if to presage apocalypse. A Bible-basher circles the action roaring prophecy. Oh God, I felt, am I going to have to hold my breathe in awe? False alarm. His speech is also street: \u201cGod\u2019s a bad motherfucker.\u201d The great roll of the play allows for buoyancy, comic display \u2013 and arresting lines. \u201cI might,\u201d says Pierre, recounting a wild, improbable night-haunting, \u201chave dreamt it because it\u2019s true.\u201d Domestic drama is often accused of lacking ambition (as if width rather than depth were a measure), and plays by women have more readily been thought of as merely domestic. Rutherford and Son, Githa Sowerby\u2019s glowering, penetrating study of patriarchal capitalism, was acclaimed when first performed in 1912 (with the writer\u2019s sex disguised as \u201cKG Sowerby\u201d), then for years undervalued. Not any more. Productions are no longer rare: more \u00e0 point. Polly Findlay\u2019s staging is meticulous but overemphatic. The power of the play is in its combination of dramatic action \u2013 a secret affair, theft, people being turned from their homes \u2013 and understatement: \u201cSuch doings,\u201d mumbles one grim old biddy. Roger Allam catches this perfectly as the all-dominating Dad. It would be so easy simply to monsterise Rutherford, as he barks at his daughter to take off his shoes. Allam convinces more subtly: he crushes by self-absorbed indifference while also suggesting a mighty male dedication to work. Seeming hardly to exert himself (he closes off a conversation by putting on his specs), he treats his family as if they were faulty bits of machinery: \u201cNo good for my purpose,\u201d he says of one of his sons. Justine Mitchell plays the down-beaten (that\u2019s to say unmarried) daughter, who has a secret life, with a steady frankness; sulkiness flashing into passion. She makes you feel that she has been seized up by circumstances. Both seem part of Lizzie Clachan\u2019s clever design, which is a tumult of naturalism, an impressive display of smothering by acquisition. Newel post, grandfather clock, carpet-style tablecloth, dark wood, autumn shades and \u2013 a reminder of the factory that supports all this \u2013 a tall panel of glass made up of lime and yellow squares. Yet Findlay doesn\u2019t leave the play sufficiently to unfold. There are curtains of wuthering rain and long intervals of keening song. No mistaking that we are in the north. No mistaking that things are tough. It is a necessarily sober evening \u2013 but unnecessarily short on dynamism. I did not think The Starry Messenger could recover from the lassitude of its early scenes.

There is, as an automatic figure of fun, a middle-aged, unfashionable woman who can\u2019t follow the basic rules of science. There is a wincing double entendre setting up a love affair.

      "body": "<p><em>A Plague Tale: Innocence</em> opens on a scene of idyllic playfulness: a teenage girl, Amicia, walking her dog through an autumnal forest in 12th-century France, bumping apples from tall trees using pebbles hurled from a homemade slingshot. If this is the \u201cinnocence\u201d of the game\u2019s title, it plays but a fleeting cameo role in the drama. Before the day is out, Amicia\u2019s dog is dead \u2013 ripped apart by a thrashing mass of rabid vermin \u2013 along with her former life of privilege as a French noble, ripped apart by soldiers of the inquisition, thugs acting on behalf of an equally corrupt church.</p> <p>Amicia and her younger brother Hugo, a boy who suffers from a blood disease and has spent his days in jaundiced confinement, escape the family estate and begin to pick their way through a countryside turned hostile. This is, then, a story of innocence versus experience, of children versus the ruined world of adults, with all its plagues, both physical and ideological.</p> <p>Every duo has its teacher and its student, its noble and its serf, and in this partnership Amicia is the voice of wisdom and responsibility. Hugo, as a coddled attic child, is bereft of experience, and so in the realm of adventure enjoys low status. The child trips and wanders, oblivious to the scale of the danger the pair face as they creep from bush to bush while attempting to circumnavigate danger.</p> <p>His naivety infuriates Amicia, who scolds her brother for every misstep. But this is also the glue that binds the relationship: Hugo\u2019s unworldliness agitates in Amicia a duty of care, and this in turn stirs an affection in the young boy for his sisterly guardian. In each chapter there is a flower that, when found, Hugo will pick and fasten in Amicia\u2019s hair, an act of tender love that punctuates this world of excrement and disease.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjjbrmD1Rg4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EjjbrmD1Rg4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjjbrmD1Rg4\">Watch the trailer for A Plague Tale.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The embodiment of that disease takes a while to show itself. To begin with, the soldiers pose the primary risk to the children, who must cringe behind carts and in reeds, occasionally hurling a stone into a pile of armour in order to distract the guards for a few seconds and enable safe passage. Materials can be scavenged and, when you reach a workbench, you can upgrade your equipment to enable Amicia to carry more ammunition, for example, or to tread more quietly.</p> <p>This kind of plodding design is wearied and overfamiliar, but made somehow palatable by the game\u2019s beguiling atmospherics (the sunsets! the haybales!), the convincing voice acting and a medieval context that precludes the use of gadgets that usually fussy up this kind of stealth play.</p> <p>Then the plague arrives, in all its Old Testament spectacle. Geysers of rats erupt from the earth, a broiling mass of vermin that consume flesh in seconds. The game\u2019s designers spin puzzles from the horde\u2019s sole weakness, a petrifying fear of light. This enables the pair to pick their way forward, just so long as they have a torch or some other light source to hand. It\u2019s a simple solution to a brutish problem, and yet the game\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.asobostudio.com/\" title=\"\">French developer, Asobo</a>, fashions memorable moments with these basic tools. In one of the game\u2019s most striking scenes you must navigate a field by setting light to a windmill\u2019s two remaining sails, making your dash past 10,000 snipping jaws in time with the blazing sweeps of light.</p> <p>Much of what makes <em>A Plague Tale: Innocence</em> a success is the admirable way in which the developer spins magic from the routine. The game\u2019s substance borders on cliched, and rarely do its environmental puzzles enjoy more than one solution. Your time, then, is spent tracing the guidelines laid by the designers, without much in the way of meaningful agency. Still, submit yourself to the spell that\u2019s being cast and <em>A Plague Tale: Innocence </em>succeeds in sketching an affecting story of the child\u2019s indefatigable spirit in the face of rats and men.</p> <h2>Also recommended</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDqy0aSmu8E\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QDqy0aSmu8E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDqy0aSmu8E&amp;has_verified=1\">Watch the trailer for Observation.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><br><strong>Observation</strong><br><em>(No Code; Devolver Digital; PC, PS4)</em></p> <p><em>Observation</em>\u2019s pitch \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/15/2001-a-space-odyssey-film-haunts-dream-space\" title=\"\">Stanley Kubrick\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/15/2001-a-space-odyssey-film-haunts-dream-space\" title=\"\">2001</a></em> from the perspective of the film\u2019s politely malevolent artificial intelligence, Hal \u2013 is beguiling and straightforward. It\u2019s a vision to which the game\u2019s Scottish developer, No Code, mostly cleaves. You assume the role of SAM, a sentient AI tasked with running a space station, who, at the game\u2019s opening, must help the crew\u2019s doctor after an accident that neither of you can remember.</p> <p>Playing as the computer on which a human makes incessant, impatient demands is an undeniable novelty, and the texture of the interactions soon shifts from routine busywork (identifying areas of structural damage, opening airlocked hatches) to more disquieting activities.</p> <p>Style elevates the substance: the game\u2019s CRT aesthetic, all bursts of static and screen-shake, calls to mind the triumphant <em>Alien: Isolation</em>, a game on which members of this team also worked, while the synth-rasping soundtrack adds an incessant note of tension. Yet for all its sci-fi influences, <em>Observation</em> draws a unique identity from the familiar.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A Plague Tale: Innocence opens on a scene of idyllic playfulness: a teenage girl, Amicia, walking her dog through an autumnal forest in 12th-century France, bumping apples from tall trees using pebbles hurled from a homemade slingshot. If this is the \u201cinnocence\u201d of the game\u2019s title, it plays but a fleeting cameo role in the drama. Before the day is out, Amicia\u2019s dog is dead \u2013 ripped apart by a thrashing mass of rabid vermin \u2013 along with her former life of privilege as a French noble, ripped apart by soldiers of the inquisition, thugs acting on behalf of an equally corrupt church. Amicia and her younger brother Hugo, a boy who suffers from a blood disease and has spent his days in jaundiced confinement, escape the family estate and begin to pick their way through a countryside turned hostile. This is, then, a story of innocence versus experience, of children versus the ruined world of adults, with all its plagues, both physical and ideological. Every duo has its teacher and its student, its noble and its serf, and in this partnership Amicia is the voice of wisdom and responsibility. Hugo, as a coddled attic child, is bereft of experience, and so in the realm of adventure enjoys low status. The child trips and wanders, oblivious to the scale of the danger the pair face as they creep from bush to bush while attempting to circumnavigate danger. His naivety infuriates Amicia, who scolds her brother for every misstep. But this is also the glue that binds the relationship: Hugo\u2019s unworldliness agitates in Amicia a duty of care, and this in turn stirs an affection in the young boy for his sisterly guardian. In each chapter there is a flower that, when found, Hugo will pick and fasten in Amicia\u2019s hair, an act of tender love that punctuates this world of excrement and disease. The embodiment of that disease takes a while to show itself. To begin with, the soldiers pose the primary risk to the children, who must cringe behind carts and in reeds, occasionally hurling a stone into a pile of armour in order to distract the guards for a few seconds and enable safe passage. Materials can be scavenged and, when you reach a workbench, you can upgrade your equipment to enable Amicia to carry more ammunition, for example, or to tread more quietly. This kind of plodding design is wearied and overfamiliar, but made somehow palatable by the game\u2019s beguiling atmospherics (the sunsets! the haybales!), the convincing voice acting and a medieval context that precludes the use of gadgets that usually fussy up this kind of stealth play. Then the plague arrives, in all its Old Testament spectacle. Geysers of rats erupt from the earth, a broiling mass of vermin that consume flesh in seconds. The game\u2019s designers spin puzzles from the horde\u2019s sole weakness, a petrifying fear of light. This enables the pair to pick their way forward, just so long as they have a torch or some other light source to hand. It\u2019s a simple solution to a brutish problem, and yet the game\u2019s French developer, Asobo, fashions memorable moments with these basic tools. In one of the game\u2019s most striking scenes you must navigate a field by setting light to a windmill\u2019s two remaining sails, making your dash past 10,000 snipping jaws in time with the blazing sweeps of light. Much of what makes A Plague Tale: Innocence a success is the admirable way in which the developer spins magic from the routine. The game\u2019s substance borders on cliched, and rarely do its environmental puzzles enjoy more than one solution. Your time, then, is spent tracing the guidelines laid by the designers, without much in the way of meaningful agency. Still, submit yourself to the spell that\u2019s being cast and A Plague Tale: Innocence succeeds in sketching an affecting story of the child\u2019s indefatigable spirit in the face of rats and men. Also recommended Observation (No Code; Devolver Digital; PC, PS4) Observation\u2019s pitch \u2013 Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001 from the perspective of the film\u2019s politely malevolent artificial intelligence, Hal \u2013 is beguiling and straightforward. It\u2019s a vision to which the game\u2019s Scottish developer, No Code, mostly cleaves. You assume the role of SAM, a sentient AI tasked with running a space station, who, at the game\u2019s opening, must help the crew\u2019s doctor after an accident that neither of you can remember. Playing as the computer on which a human makes incessant, impatient demands is an undeniable novelty, and the texture of the interactions soon shifts from routine busywork (identifying areas of structural damage, opening airlocked hatches) to more disquieting activities. Style elevates the substance: the game\u2019s CRT aesthetic, all bursts of static and screen-shake, calls to mind the triumphant Alien: Isolation, a game on which members of this team also worked, while the synth-rasping soundtrack adds an incessant note of tension. Yet for all its sci-fi influences, Observation draws a unique identity from the familiar.",

Perhaps it was inevitable growing up in a bohemian west London household with his father, Horace, a Trinidad-born artist who arrived in the UK in 1960 and became a key figure in British film, TV and photography. Horace was the first black British film-maker to direct a feature-length film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-JqA1zg0Uw\" title=\"\">(</a><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-JqA1zg0Uw\" title=\"\">Pressure</a></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-JqA1zg0Uw\" title=\"\">, 1976)</a>. It was through his films and photographic work chronicling black British life that he forged bonds with influential cultural figures such as the US writer and activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesbaldwin\" title=\"\">James Baldwin</a>, photographer Armet Francis and textile designer Althea McNish, who were like an extended family for the young Ov\u00e9. They were, he says, guiding lights to an \u201cartistic life and black consciousness\u201d.</p> <p>But he\u2019s quick to point out that \u201cwithin Horace\u2019s group, it wasn\u2019t just a black thing\u201d. Social consciousness more widely drove their activism. Ov\u00e9\u2019s white Irish mother was a diehard socialist, and at dinner with their fists raised high his parents would proclaim: \u201cPower to the people.\u201d Political beliefs were woven into the fabric of the Ov\u00e9 home, which was adorned with African art and artefacts, and Ov\u00e9 and his sister, Indra, were regularly exposed to their father\u2019s working practice, at his \u201cscene\u201d \u2013 \u201cbe it at a shebeen in Ladbroke Grove, Sunday afternoon jazz or accompanying him to an edit suite\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0000df4fcc1452f7ec7556c9fe525773e087223\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0000df4fcc1452f7ec7556c9fe525773e087223/0_0_5816_3810/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paddington Station, 1967, Horace Ov\u00e9.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Paddington Station, 1967, Horace Ov\u00e9.</strong>\u2018Michael X, the leading British Black Power activist, was on his way to Reading to give a speech at a Black Power meeting.

      "bodyText": "\u201cAs a child, my superheroes were artists,\u201d says Zak Ov\u00e9. Perhaps it was inevitable growing up in a bohemian west London household with his father, Horace, a Trinidad-born artist who arrived in the UK in 1960 and became a key figure in British film, TV and photography. Horace was the first black British film-maker to direct a feature-length film (Pressure, 1976). It was through his films and photographic work chronicling black British life that he forged bonds with influential cultural figures such as the US writer and activist James Baldwin, photographer Armet Francis and textile designer Althea McNish, who were like an extended family for the young Ov\u00e9. They were, he says, guiding lights to an \u201cartistic life and black consciousness\u201d. But he\u2019s quick to point out that \u201cwithin Horace\u2019s group, it wasn\u2019t just a black thing\u201d. Social consciousness more widely drove their activism. Ov\u00e9\u2019s white Irish mother was a diehard socialist, and at dinner with their fists raised high his parents would proclaim: \u201cPower to the people.\u201d Political beliefs were woven into the fabric of the Ov\u00e9 home, which was adorned with African art and artefacts, and Ov\u00e9 and his sister, Indra, were regularly exposed to their father\u2019s working practice, at his \u201cscene\u201d \u2013 \u201cbe it at a shebeen in Ladbroke Grove, Sunday afternoon jazz or accompanying him to an edit suite\u201d. Paddington Station, 1967, Horace Ov\u00e9. \u2018Michael X, the leading British Black Power activist, was on his way to Reading to give a speech at a Black Power meeting. My father, Horace, got a tip-off and rushed to Paddington station to capture him surrounded by fellow revolutionaries and bodyguards. Horace didn\u2019t agree with Michael X\u2019s politics but was impressed by his revolutionary confidence. \u201cThey walked in like they were taking over the station,\u201d he\u2019s said about this photo. My father was best known for his film-making but had an instinctive feel for photographic reportage.\u2019 Today Ov\u00e9, a multi-disciplinary artist whose focus on sculpture reflects a passion for the traditions of African mask-making and masquerade, brings the influence of these childhood experiences to curating Get Up, Stand Up Now at Somerset House in London. The show, which opens later this month, celebrates the effect of black creativity on British life over the past 50 years. With echoes of the Wailers\u2019 socially conscious reggae lyrics, it\u2019s a direct response to the Windrush scandal, which saw West Indians who had long resided in Britain wrongly classified as illegal immigrants and deported \u201cback home\u201d. Housing the exhibition at Somerset House, which served at the height of empire as the Royal Navy\u2019s administrative centre, lends it an extra charge. Untitled, 2018, Deborah Roberts. American artist Deborah Roberts makes collages using photographs, magazine clippings and images from the internet to evoke black womanhood. Confronting forcefully the hyper-sexualisation of women, and the media\u2019s privileging of whiteness and youth, her figures often take the form of African girls whom she presents with strength and power. Her work punches with pride. I\u2019m impressed by her use of what look like old photographs to create new-found characters of this moment.\u2019 More than 100 artists will feature \u2013 from visual artists and designers to musicians, sound artists, film-makers and writers. Significant historic artworks such as Sonia Boyce\u2019s luminous love song to London, the collage-painting Talking Presence (1987), and a rare sculpture, Remember Me, from the artist and Oscar-winning director Steve McQueen, will sit alongside work by some of the most dynamic younger artists working today, including the fashion designer Mowalola Ogunlesi, whose African high-life inspired designs have led her to the brink of stardom. Ov\u00e9 has also discovered jewels in the archives, including a film of Blackblast, the first play performed at the ICA written by a black writer, Lindsay Barrett, staged by a black director, Horace Ov\u00e9, and featuring an all-black cast. That performance of experimental theatre and African dance marked the moment when black art moved from the margins to the centre of British culture. Filmed by the BBC, it has rarely been seen since its first broadcast in 1973. \u2018Self Portrait (after Warhol) 6, 2013, Yinka Shonibare. \u2018What I see in this beautiful picture of Yinka\u2019s face is a black British identity. Even though it\u2019s red, blue and green, it\u2019s redolent of the union jack. I love the exuberance of his locks up in the air, the strength of it, the fact that he bears himself. He\u2019s saying: look this is me and I\u2019m here to stay. The suggestion of kente cloth is interesting too. With this and the union jack, it\u2019s emblematic of his dual identity as a British Nigerian.\u2019 More than 40 years on, Horace now has Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and Ov\u00e9 is determined to show in the exhibition how the evolution of black British art was partly inspired by his father\u2019s creative hub, which connected artists over several generations. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to identify as many works as I feel are important from him that speak about our values as a community in this country.\u201d These include the satirical film Black Safari, in which Horace Ov\u00e9 and fellow explorers embark on an \u201cexpedition from Africa to the centre of Britain, marked vaguely on an old map\u201d. They sail to Wigan, renaming British fauna and flora after great African kings and queens and taking a few slaves along the way. Alexis Peskine, Aljana Moons II. \u2018The Parisian artist Peskine is known for his large-scale mixed media portraits made by painstakingly hammering nails into treated wooden planks but in Aljana Moons, a series of four photographs and a short film, he\u2019s developed a modern aesthetic, looking at iconic African artwork and figuring out ways to use new materials to move it forward. The boys\u2019 space suits are made from tin cans and rice bags, and the cart symbolises them on a journey to outer space.\u2019 The 80s was a golden period for the black British artists who followed in Horace\u2019s footsteps \u2013 people such as Eddie Chambers, Lubaina Himid and Keith Piper from the BLK Art Group, whose campaign for greater representation of black art in Britain culminated in the landmark exhibition The Other Story at the Hayward Gallery in 1989. The art world is fickle and especially prone to short-term trends, and interest in their work was patchy thereafter. It was always a struggle to maintain a career, so it was heartening that Himid went on to win the Turner prize in 2017. \u201cBack in the 90s there wasn\u2019t a platform for black artists,\u201d says Ov\u00e9. \u201cSo even though you were elevated for a while it was difficult to keep going; for instance there was a barren period of several years when Horace couldn\u2019t get a film made.\u201d Ov\u00e9 believes that the dynamic changed with Chris Ofili\u2019s retrospective at Tate Britain in 2010. Thousands attended that exhibition drawn by the gorgeous, opulent and sometimes poignant paintings such as No Woman, No Cry depicting Doreen Lawrence, the mother of the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence. \u201cSuddenly institutions woke up,\u201d says Ov\u00e9, \u201cand thought to themselves, \u2018if we get this right there\u2019s a massive market here that want to see themselves.\u2019\u201d Umbilical Progenitor, 2018, Zak Ov\u00e9. \u2018This figure is assembled from an astronaut\u2019s fibreglass model that would have been positioned outside a theme park. I bought it on eBay; it was busted and I continued to break it and embellish it with a Mende helmet mask and hand-made glass beads from Nigeria to give this space traveller a strong African hybridisation, mixing his traditional tribal attire with new space gear. Umbilical Progenitor is a talismanic figure representing the first male of the tribe on an outward-bound journey through time.\u2019 Major exhibitions followed, by Yinka Shonibare, whose Nelson\u2019s Ship in a Bottle appeared on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square in 2010, and John Akomfrah with his show Purple at the Barbican in 2017. That same year, the first Diaspora Pavilion opened at the Venice Biennale. Aiming to tackle the under-representation of black and minority artists and themes in the art world, it boosted many lesser-known figures, such as Khadija Saye (who died in the Grenfell Tower fire) and Hew Locke. Bodybuilder in Bra, 1990, Ajamu. \u2018Ajamu is a London-based, Yorkshire-born photographic artist and activist. This beautiful image, the athletic, muscular back shoulders with a broken bra strap, forces us to question the sitter\u2019s identity. I like the softness of the fabric; there\u2019s something delicate about it. The wear and tear of the garment is reminiscent of a worn vest, an identifying uniform of the black working class, but it\u2019s not pushing it into the fetish world. It contrasts with Robert Mapplethorpe\u2019s work. It\u2019s way more visceral and intimate.\u2019 Visitors to the Somerset House show may be surprised to find work by contemporary African American artists such as Sanford Biggers and Hank Willis Thomas. Isn\u2019t Ov\u00e9 risking complaints from British artists who haven\u2019t made the cut? He thinks not. \u201cThose brothers and sisters in the US are ahead of us a lot of the time in terms of the spaces they\u2019ve had to develop in. To ignore them would be bizarre, especially when we\u2019re exploring similar values and histories. Essentially we\u2019re fighting the same struggle.\u201d Crimson and Black, 2019, LR Vandy. \u2018Irish-Nigerian artist LR Vandy is a rising star on the British art scene. This is made from a model boat from the 70s (the sort you might find in a park lake) and fishing floats reminiscent of voodoo needles. It\u2019s decorative but has the darkness of witchcraft. It\u2019s open to many ways of seeing but I still see the values of traditional mask-making; I like this fresh interpretation using new, found objects that speak about an Africanism from a distance. It looks quite sexual. Vandy is developing a language in sculpture that speaks about black womanhood.\u2019 The exhibition will cover 17 rooms with different themes.

Talking Presence, 1987, Sonia Boyce. \u2018A very beautiful image of London from Sonia Boyce, who gained prominence with Black Women Artists in the 1980s,\u2019 says Zak Ov\u00e9. \u2018It\u2019s a painted collage with two nude black figures enjoying a surrealist view.

I thought, oh good, because I know if I\u2019m upset and someone says, are you OK, I\u2019m like\u2026\u201d She does a comedy wail. \u201cIt kicks me off even more.\u201d</p> \n<p>At the Baftas, she dedicated her award to her Nana Frances, who died when Comer was filming the first season of <em>Killing Eve</em>. \u201cShe used to say, \u2018You get it off me, you know,\u2019\u201d she said, movingly, in her Bafta speech. The next day, her dad showed her a story about it in a tabloid. \u201cMy grandad moved house when my nan passed away, and they went to their old address, spoke to a neighbour, found out where the funeral was.\u201d Comer was stunned. \u201cI know I spoke of her, but that is such a deeply personal\u2026 That is a little bit\u2026 That jars with me.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3c4f619584220e3c87c18e8664c92dcac6c2cb5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3c4f619584220e3c87c18e8664c92dcac6c2cb5/0_0_3616_2683/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leading lights: (from left) Fiona Shaw, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Jodie Comer with their Baftas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"742\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leading lights: (from left) Fiona Shaw, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Jodie Comer with their Baftas.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Fisher/Bafta/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Part of Comer\u2019s charm is her down-to-earthness. She comes across as the kind of person you could natter to all day, who\u2019d, yes, stop you in the street if you were crying and ask if you were OK, but with that comes a certain sensible reserve. Unlike most famous people of her age, she keeps a healthy amount back for herself. Her social media is largely work-only.</p> \n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d she says, half-apologetically. \u201cI\u2019ve seen comments where people say, all you do is post work stuff. And it\u2019s so hard, because I understand that it\u2019s about balance and engaging with the people who support you, but I also have to be protective of my own world, you know?\u201d</p> \n<p>She still has the same group of girlfriends she\u2019s had since school. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a group chat that doesn\u2019t stop pinging,\u201d she says, \u201cso we\u2019re all caught up with each other.\u201d She\u2019s not one for falling out of clubs under stuttering camera flashes. She slumps forward, hair dangling around her face. \u201cI want to work. I don\u2019t want to be <em>seen</em>. I guess I just don\u2019t feel the need to, really,\u201d she says. \u201cAlso! If I\u2019m going out, I want it to be with my closest mates in a flat, with my hair tied up, doing something really embarrassing. I want that to be in a private world.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"316a86d3e56606d12edb1b15af143df5eee9f047\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/316a86d3e56606d12edb1b15af143df5eee9f047/39_147_4292_2575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Back to death: Cromer as Villanelle in season two of Killing Eve.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Death watch: Cromer as Villanelle in season two of Killing Eve.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBCAmerica</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>While she\u2019s been acting since she was young, the rest of it is all completely new to her. \u201cIt\u2019s an adjustment. Doing gorgeous glamorous magazine shoots and all the rest of it, that is a part of this world that you don\u2019t know about until it happens.\u201d It\u2019s not that she minds talking about her life, but she\u2019s good at simply saying what she wants to say, and nothing more. \u201cIt\u2019s such a fine line, because I want to be honest. I\u2019m aware that probably the majority of the people who support me are female, and in their late teens, and whether you like it or not, there is a responsibility there to...\u201d She doesn\u2019t quite know what that responsibility is, exactly. She shrugs. \u201cI feel like all you can do is be yourself.\u201d</p> \n<p>In her acceptance speech, Comer also thanked fellow Liverpudlian actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/stephen-graham\" title=\"\">Stephen Graham</a>, saying she owed him a pint. Did she get him one? \u201cThe bar was free!\u201d she hoots. \u201cThat would be really cheap of me if I did it then. But I did catch up with him afterwards.\u201d Graham was the one who recommended her to his agent, after he\u2019d seen her in a play when she was 15. Comer was already working with a local agency. Her dad said it was fine to switch, but she would have to make the call herself. \u201cI was like, this is such an adult conversation to be having, surely you should be doing this?\u201d She says she\u2019s always trusted her gut. It\u2019s easy to see where she gets it from.</p> \n<p>Her first big role came not long after she made the move, when she played Chloe, the best friend/enemy in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/aug/27/my-fat-mad-diary-sharon-rooney-box-set-review\" title=\"\">My Mad Fat Diary</a></em>. \u201cI look back on that, and it\u2019s so iconic,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember getting off the phone, going, oh my God, I\u2019m doing a whole six episodes! <em>This is so cool.</em> Filming in London.

She was quite pleased to have made an impression. \u201cI love riling an audience up. I love seeing the impact a person can have on an audience.

I realised I was rooting for the assassin to get back on her feet and start brutally killing people again. Is there something wrong with me? She smiles kindly. Clearly this is not the first time she has counselled someone through this crisis. \u201cWe can sometimes see ourselves in her everyday personality and the ways she has about her,\u201d she says, soothingly and patiently, before adding, \u201cNot in all the murder stuff.\u201d</p> \n<p>Eve and Villanelle\u2019s hard-to-define relationship is the black beating heart of the show, but it is usually couched in vague terms by the actors whenever they address it. The <em>New Yorker\u2019s</em> television critic Emily Nussbaum called the series \u201chomoerotic candy\u201d. Is it fair for an audience to be teased about the attraction between them if they\u2019re never quite going to get there? \u201cI mean, I know from my perspective, Villanelle is sexually attracted to Eve. I can\u2019t speak for Sandra and Eve, but I think it seems impossible, and it probably is,\u201d she sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard, because you know what the audience wants, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve tried to explore more in this second series.\u201d</p> \n<p>This is a theme that Comer loves in Waller-Bridge\u2019s writing, whether on <em>Killing Eve</em> or <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/20/fleabag-posh-girl-television\" title=\"\">Fleabag</a></em>. \u201cThat obsession we can have with other women, and not quite know what it is,\u201d she says. She lights up when she talks about her. Comer auditioned for <em>Killing Eve</em> after the first Baftas she attended, where the two first met. \u201cI was like, oh my God, I was <em>soooo</em> drunk. Like, what did I do? Have I ruined it? And she rang me just before I went in for my recall, and went, \u2018Maaate!\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I know!\u201d She said, \u2018We\u2019re both in the same boat, so don\u2019t worry.\u2019 I was obsessed with <em>Fleabag</em>. When I saw her name attached to this, I thought, I\u2019ve got to do it.\u201d (Waller-Bridge has not written the second season, but she is credited as an executive producer.)</p> \n<p>Comer has always trusted her instincts, and this was a good one. \u201cI feel like your gut never lies to you. You\u2019ve got to listen to yourself.\u201d She\u2019s looking forward to living in Boston for the summer, and then she\u2019ll be back in London to film the third season of <em>Killing Eve</em>. After that, she\u2019ll take a holiday with her family. She wants to go to a beach, \u201cwhere there is nothing but a bar\u201d, she says, dreamily, already imagining the cocktail menu. \u201cBut that\u2019s a while away,\u201d she shrugs. Hollywood is calling, after all.</p> \n<p><em>Killing Eve returns to BBC One and BBC iPlayer on 8 June</em></p>",

I keep saying\u201d \u2013 she adopts a crisp, RP accent, and fans of Killing Eve will know she is an expert at accents \u2013 \u201c\u2018I\u2019m relatively new to the business.\u2019 But I\u2019m like, mmmm?\u201d She acted at school, partly because she finds emotions so fascinating, and has always found it easy to bring up her own. She remembers a local drama competition where she performed a monologue about a girl whose father had died in the Hillsborough disaster. \u201cBefore I\u2019d even said my name, I was crying. I was like, \u2018My name is Jodie Comer\u2019 [she pretends to do it, a big, cartoonish sob] and everybody was like, oh my God, is this real?\u201d She\u2019s always been very in touch with her emotional side. \u201cI\u2019m a Pisces, so personally, I\u2019m up here,\u201d she says, moving her hand towards the ceiling, \u201cor I\u2019m the opposite. There\u2019s no in-between with me. But I love a good chat about feelings. I\u2019m like, come on girl, let\u2019s get it all out, let\u2019s have a cup of tea.\u201d She saw a woman crying in the corner at Euston station recently, and saw everyone walking past, pretending it wasn\u2019t happening. \u201cNo one knows what to do. It just fascinates me.\u201d What did you do? \u201cI went over! She said she was fine. I thought, oh good, because I know if I\u2019m upset and someone says, are you OK, I\u2019m like\u2026\u201d She does a comedy wail. \u201cIt kicks me off even more.\u201d At the Baftas, she dedicated her award to her Nana Frances, who died when Comer was filming the first season of Killing Eve. \u201cShe used to say, \u2018You get it off me, you know,\u2019\u201d she said, movingly, in her Bafta speech. The next day, her dad showed her a story about it in a tabloid. \u201cMy grandad moved house when my nan passed away, and they went to their old address, spoke to a neighbour, found out where the funeral was.\u201d Comer was stunned. \u201cI know I spoke of her, but that is such a deeply personal\u2026 That is a little bit\u2026 That jars with me.\u201d Part of Comer\u2019s charm is her down-to-earthness. She comes across as the kind of person you could natter to all day, who\u2019d, yes, stop you in the street if you were crying and ask if you were OK, but with that comes a certain sensible reserve. Unlike most famous people of her age, she keeps a healthy amount back for herself. Her social media is largely work-only. \u201cI know,\u201d she says, half-apologetically. \u201cI\u2019ve seen comments where people say, all you do is post work stuff. And it\u2019s so hard, because I understand that it\u2019s about balance and engaging with the people who support you, but I also have to be protective of my own world, you know?\u201d She still has the same group of girlfriends she\u2019s had since school. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a group chat that doesn\u2019t stop pinging,\u201d she says, \u201cso we\u2019re all caught up with each other.\u201d She\u2019s not one for falling out of clubs under stuttering camera flashes. She slumps forward, hair dangling around her face. \u201cI want to work. I don\u2019t want to be seen. I guess I just don\u2019t feel the need to, really,\u201d she says. \u201cAlso! If I\u2019m going out, I want it to be with my closest mates in a flat, with my hair tied up, doing something really embarrassing. I want that to be in a private world.\u201d While she\u2019s been acting since she was young, the rest of it is all completely new to her. \u201cIt\u2019s an adjustment. Doing gorgeous glamorous magazine shoots and all the rest of it, that is a part of this world that you don\u2019t know about until it happens.\u201d It\u2019s not that she minds talking about her life, but she\u2019s good at simply saying what she wants to say, and nothing more. \u201cIt\u2019s such a fine line, because I want to be honest. I\u2019m aware that probably the majority of the people who support me are female, and in their late teens, and whether you like it or not, there is a responsibility there to...\u201d She doesn\u2019t quite know what that responsibility is, exactly. She shrugs. \u201cI feel like all you can do is be yourself.\u201d In her acceptance speech, Comer also thanked fellow Liverpudlian actor Stephen Graham, saying she owed him a pint. Did she get him one? \u201cThe bar was free!\u201d she hoots. \u201cThat would be really cheap of me if I did it then. But I did catch up with him afterwards.\u201d Graham was the one who recommended her to his agent, after he\u2019d seen her in a play when she was 15. Comer was already working with a local agency. Her dad said it was fine to switch, but she would have to make the call herself. \u201cI was like, this is such an adult conversation to be having, surely you should be doing this?\u201d She says she\u2019s always trusted her gut. It\u2019s easy to see where she gets it from. Her first big role came not long after she made the move, when she played Chloe, the best friend/enemy in My Mad Fat Diary. \u201cI look back on that, and it\u2019s so iconic,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember getting off the phone, going, oh my God, I\u2019m doing a whole six episodes! This is so cool. Filming in London. Whooaaa.\u201d In 2014, she had another up-a-gear moment, when she played Kate, the other woman, in the smash-hit revenge drama Doctor Foster. \u201cJodie is sharp and funny, 100% professional and totally authentic,\u201d Doctor Foster herself, Suranne Jones, told me, over email. \u201cI adore her.\u201d Kate, on the other hand, was not so well regarded. \u201cI mean, everyone hated her,\u201d says Comer, eyes wide. \u201cEveryone hated her!\u201d She remembers two girls coming up to her in the toilets of a bar. \u201cThey were like, \u2018Are you that girl off Doctor Foster?\u2019 I said, \u2018Oh yeah.\u2019 And they said, \u2018Oh, I hated you.\u2019\u201d She tried to persuade them that it was the cheating husband Simon who was the real villain, but they insisted it didn\u2019t make a difference. \u201cFair enough,\u201d she shrugs, gamely. She was quite pleased to have made an impression. \u201cI love riling an audience up. I love seeing the impact a person can have on an audience. I\u2019m like, well, at least I made you feel something. I\u2019ve got you sat on the couch swearing at the TV.\u201d At the beginning of Killing Eve, season two, Villanelle is bruised, bleeding and down on her luck. I realised I was rooting for the assassin to get back on her feet and start brutally killing people again. Is there something wrong with me? She smiles kindly. Clearly this is not the first time she has counselled someone through this crisis. \u201cWe can sometimes see ourselves in her everyday personality and the ways she has about her,\u201d she says, soothingly and patiently, before adding, \u201cNot in all the murder stuff.\u201d Eve and Villanelle\u2019s hard-to-define relationship is the black beating heart of the show, but it is usually couched in vague terms by the actors whenever they address it. The New Yorker\u2019s television critic Emily Nussbaum called the series \u201chomoerotic candy\u201d. Is it fair for an audience to be teased about the attraction between them if they\u2019re never quite going to get there? \u201cI mean, I know from my perspective, Villanelle is sexually attracted to Eve. I can\u2019t speak for Sandra and Eve, but I think it seems impossible, and it probably is,\u201d she sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard, because you know what the audience wants, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve tried to explore more in this second series.\u201d This is a theme that Comer loves in Waller-Bridge\u2019s writing, whether on Killing Eve or Fleabag. \u201cThat obsession we can have with other women, and not quite know what it is,\u201d she says. She lights up when she talks about her. Comer auditioned for Killing Eve after the first Baftas she attended, where the two first met. \u201cI was like, oh my God, I was soooo drunk. Like, what did I do? Have I ruined it? And she rang me just before I went in for my recall, and went, \u2018Maaate!\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I know!\u201d She said, \u2018We\u2019re both in the same boat, so don\u2019t worry.\u2019 I was obsessed with Fleabag. When I saw her name attached to this, I thought, I\u2019ve got to do it.\u201d (Waller-Bridge has not written the second season, but she is credited as an executive producer.) Comer has always trusted her instincts, and this was a good one. \u201cI feel like your gut never lies to you. You\u2019ve got to listen to yourself.\u201d She\u2019s looking forward to living in Boston for the summer, and then she\u2019ll be back in London to film the third season of Killing Eve. After that, she\u2019ll take a holiday with her family. She wants to go to a beach, \u201cwhere there is nothing but a bar\u201d, she says, dreamily, already imagining the cocktail menu. \u201cBut that\u2019s a while away,\u201d she shrugs. Hollywood is calling, after all. Killing Eve returns to BBC One and BBC iPlayer on 8 June",

His masterpiece, the Glasgow School of Art, lies in ruins, doubly destroyed by two catastrophic fires, first in 2014 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/16/firefighters-tackle-blaze-at-glasgow-school-of-art\" title=\"\">latterly last year.</a> \u201cOne may be regarded a misfortune; two looks like carelessness\u201d, to paraphrase Oscar Wilde, an equally iconoclastic and equally doomed fin-de-siecle contemporary.</p> <p>Like Wilde, Mackintosh endured extreme reversals of fortune. In 1900, during a trip to Vienna, \u201cToshie\u201d and his wife, the gifted artist Margaret Macdonald, were feted as Caledonian heroes by the secessionist movement and cheered through the streets in a flower-decked cart. From these intoxicating heights there ensued a slow descent into poverty and obscurity, exacerbated by the first world war, which severed connections with Europe and robbed Mackintosh of the sustaining influence and acclaim of his co-conspirators.</p> <p>Prodigiously talented and famously temperamental, he died in 1928 aged only 60, of mouth cancer induced by excessive smoking and drinking, rendered mute in his final months by the disease and its treatment.</p> <p>Now recast and sanitised as a stalwart of museum gift shops, his signature style being a gift to commodity fetishism, it\u2019s perhaps hard to imagine just how radical and unsettling Mackintosh was in his day. Synthesising aspects of art nouveau, Japonism and symbolism, and capable of turning his hand to everything from buildings to candlesticks, his suggestive, sybaritic oeuvre simultaneously beguiled and horrified critics, clients and the public. Kicking against the era\u2019s stultifying Victorian pricks, Mackintosh relished the shock of the new. \u201cHow absurd it is to see modern buildings made in imitation of Greek temples!\u201d he fulminated in 1893. \u201cWe must clothe modern ideas in modern dress.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>From the outset, the Blackies\u2019 domestic staff were discreetly positioning buckets around Hill House to catch drips</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Private houses proved an especially receptive milieu. For a new breed of ambitious patron, Mackintosh was in his element, choreographing space, light and materials on an astonishingly detailed and intimate scale. Following his coup with the Glasgow School of Art, he was commissioned to design a family home in Helensburgh for Walter Blackie, scion of the eponymous Glasgwegian publishing house. Completed in 1904, <a href=\"https://www.nts.org.uk/visit/places/the-hill-house\" title=\"\">Hill House</a> is \u201ca signpost on the road to modernism\u201d, as Simon Skinner, chief executive of the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), puts it.</p> <p>Designed \u201cfrom the inside out\u201d, Hill House reframes elements of Scottish vernacular architecture and undercuts them with a new conception of genteel suburban domesticity. Each of its spaces is based on a precisely controlled underlying geometry, animated by explicit polarities of light and dark, feminine and masculine. Glacially white rooms of ethereal and erotic delicacy are linked by ebony panelled hallways, while changes of scale conspire to thrill and surprise. At every turn, surfaces are subtly ornamented with sinuous, organic motifs. Like all Mackintosh buildings, it\u2019s a gorgeous <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesamtkunstwerk\" title=\"\">Gesamtkunstwerk</a></em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesamtkunstwerk\" title=\"\">,</a> a total and unique work of art.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ca509a7bb2a8b005d67a847735d12c856902406\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ca509a7bb2a8b005d67a847735d12c856902406/0_0_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hill House interior.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Genteel suburban domesticity\u2019: inside Hill House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Trust for Scotland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s also \u201ca 115-year-old sandstone sponge\u201d, according to Andy Groarke of architects Carmody Groarke, charged with delivering a solution to rescue Hill House from its current chronic deterioration, here precipitated by water, rather than fire.

      "bodyText": "Fate has not been kind to the buildings of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Scotland\u2019s most iconoclastic modern architect. His masterpiece, the Glasgow School of Art, lies in ruins, doubly destroyed by two catastrophic fires, first in 2014 and latterly last year. \u201cOne may be regarded a misfortune; two looks like carelessness\u201d, to paraphrase Oscar Wilde, an equally iconoclastic and equally doomed fin-de-siecle contemporary. Like Wilde, Mackintosh endured extreme reversals of fortune. In 1900, during a trip to Vienna, \u201cToshie\u201d and his wife, the gifted artist Margaret Macdonald, were feted as Caledonian heroes by the secessionist movement and cheered through the streets in a flower-decked cart. From these intoxicating heights there ensued a slow descent into poverty and obscurity, exacerbated by the first world war, which severed connections with Europe and robbed Mackintosh of the sustaining influence and acclaim of his co-conspirators. Prodigiously talented and famously temperamental, he died in 1928 aged only 60, of mouth cancer induced by excessive smoking and drinking, rendered mute in his final months by the disease and its treatment. Now recast and sanitised as a stalwart of museum gift shops, his signature style being a gift to commodity fetishism, it\u2019s perhaps hard to imagine just how radical and unsettling Mackintosh was in his day. Synthesising aspects of art nouveau, Japonism and symbolism, and capable of turning his hand to everything from buildings to candlesticks, his suggestive, sybaritic oeuvre simultaneously beguiled and horrified critics, clients and the public. Kicking against the era\u2019s stultifying Victorian pricks, Mackintosh relished the shock of the new. \u201cHow absurd it is to see modern buildings made in imitation of Greek temples!\u201d he fulminated in 1893. \u201cWe must clothe modern ideas in modern dress.\u201d Private houses proved an especially receptive milieu. For a new breed of ambitious patron, Mackintosh was in his element, choreographing space, light and materials on an astonishingly detailed and intimate scale. Following his coup with the Glasgow School of Art, he was commissioned to design a family home in Helensburgh for Walter Blackie, scion of the eponymous Glasgwegian publishing house. Completed in 1904, Hill House is \u201ca signpost on the road to modernism\u201d, as Simon Skinner, chief executive of the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), puts it. Designed \u201cfrom the inside out\u201d, Hill House reframes elements of Scottish vernacular architecture and undercuts them with a new conception of genteel suburban domesticity. Each of its spaces is based on a precisely controlled underlying geometry, animated by explicit polarities of light and dark, feminine and masculine. Glacially white rooms of ethereal and erotic delicacy are linked by ebony panelled hallways, while changes of scale conspire to thrill and surprise. At every turn, surfaces are subtly ornamented with sinuous, organic motifs. Like all Mackintosh buildings, it\u2019s a gorgeous Gesamtkunstwerk, a total and unique work of art. It\u2019s also \u201ca 115-year-old sandstone sponge\u201d, according to Andy Groarke of architects Carmody Groarke, charged with delivering a solution to rescue Hill House from its current chronic deterioration, here precipitated by water, rather than fire. Pursuing an aesthetic of abstraction and progressive to a fault, Mackintosh employed the then new technology of cement render to give the stone dwelling a smooth white finish \u2013 \u201clike frosting on a fairytale castle\u201d, says Skinner. The problem with cement is that, unlike traditional lime mortar, it has no elasticity or porosity: it freezes, it cracks and water seeps in, saturating the stonework underneath. From the outset, the Blackies\u2019 domestic staff were discreetly positioning buckets around Hill House to catch drips. Now it has reached the point where the building\u2019s integrity is threatened and it urgently needs to be shielded from the elements while it dries out and a long-term restoration plan is put in place. Usually this would mean closing the house and shrouding it in scaffolding, effectively withdrawing it from public view, a familiar response to the challenge of tottering heritage. But the NTS opted to keep Hill House open and to stop the rot by enveloping it in a protective structure. Carmody Groarke describe it as a \u00a34.5m \u201cfield hospital\u201d, designed to buy an ailing patient some time, yet also a distinctive object in its own right. It is architecture as triage, agile and responsive. The lightweight, temporary structure takes its formal and functional cues from pylon construction, with a simple frame of bolted steel members (welding was ruled out because of the fire risk) draped in a gossamer-light skin of chainmail. As a kind of benevolent parasite, it recalls an earlier Carmody Groarke project involving a restaurant made of scavenged scaffolding that perched on the roof of Westfield shopping centre for the duration of the London Olympics. Fabricated by a German company whose core business is producing butcher\u2019s gloves, the chainmail membrane deflects driving rain while letting in air to assist the drying-out process. Glass was briefly considered, but was more costly and impermeable and would have isolated the house like a specimen in a giant vitrine. Lengths of the finely woven mesh were sewn together on site to form a vast shimmering veil that repels birds but admits bees to pollinate the garden landscape. Within this sheltering armature, visitors are at liberty to promenade around an Escheresque labyrinth of walkways and staircases, savouring vertiginous views of the house and its setting. It\u2019s like yomping around an upmarket oil rig and on a clear day you can see to Arran. Involving the public in this way, who can peer into chimney pots and see the damage for themselves, heightens awareness of Hill House\u2019s complicated past and gives a sense of its possible future. \u201cIt draws attention to the fact that conservation is not just a physical problem\u201d, says Groarke. \u201cIt\u2019s also a philosophical problem, of how and why we should conserve our built heritage. And how we involve people in that debate.\u201d In any event, the practicalities cannot be rushed. Drying out may take up to three years, followed by a restoration programme that could extend to seven years. The NTS, in charge of Hill House since 1982, is considering its options. But it is confident that visitor numbers, standing at 35,000 per year, will increase and that it will attract a broader demographic, lured by this newly activated version of Mackintosh\u2019s architecture. Counterpointing the solidity of the original building, the new chainmail box forms a house for a house: \u201ca modern idea in modern dress\u201d. And though it has been conceived in response to a particular exigency, the combination of medieval chainmail and industrial modernity seems somehow appropriate for Mackintosh, who took such obvious pleasure in the richness of materials and the aptness of form. \u201cWe think he might have liked it,\u201d says Groarke.",

Supermarkets sell ice-cream.\u201d And the business is changing in other ways, too. \u201cEverybody used to be illegal street traders. In the old days it used to be ice-cream barrows and there used to be trouble with people arguing over pitches. Now we\u2019ve got ISO 9001 [quality control systems], we\u2019ve got \u00a310m public liability insurance. Everybody\u2019s evolved and gone legitimate. \u201cNow we have pitches, and we do big shows and corporate work. You need to diversify the business and change with the times, otherwise you become a dinosaur and go extinct.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>There has to be an imperative for returning to an all-time popular opera in its umpteenth revival, in this case the Royal Opera\u2019s 2006 <strong><a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/productions/tosca-by-jonathan-kent\" title=\"\">Tosca</a></strong>, back for the ninth time. In fact no reason is needed. Every encounter with Puccini\u2019s work offers a masterclass in the art of opera. If we\u2019re interested in the form, as newcomer or veteran, we should submit to its inexhaustible qualities as often as possible: its economy and detail, its fearless conjunctions of political and personal, grand set piece and intimate drama, all bound into a score of cumulative potency.</p> <p>The lessons of <em>Tosca</em>, and above all its intensity and passion (which is why we go; forget self-improvement), burn bright even if the performance itself doesn\u2019t hit the mark. For this summer run, Jonathan Kent\u2019s staging, with Paul Brown\u2019s heavy, magnificent sets, has a star lineup, with Bryn Terfel chilling and unmissable as Scarpia, the corrupt chief of police. The Welsh bass-baritone dominates the stage with imposing, pulsating villainy, moving as if in a tight corset, upright, rigid with barely contained lust and anger, ready to devour his latest prey \u2013 the diva Tosca \u2013 before spitting her out in quest of the next new thing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Grigolo's curtain call, complete with deep genuflection and hands-together, hands-apart routine, deserves its own review</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Terfel created this role when the production was new, overcoming the physical constraints of the staging, especially in Act 1 where a double staircase means performers are forced to go up, then down. Then up, then down. He treasures every note and gesture, remaining vocally nuanced even when soaring above an orchestra at full whack. He can make a pianissimo \u201cWell?\u201d, whispered offensively close into Tosca\u2019s ear \u2013 don\u2019t you hate a man who does that? \u2013 sound as crude and erotic as language gets.</p> <p>Scarpia\u2019s rival Cavaradossi is sung with clarion panache by the Italian tenor <a href=\"https://www.vittoriogrigolo.com/\" title=\"\">Vittorio Grigolo</a>. Where Terfel stands rock-like, Grigolo is agile and fidgety. It\u2019s not a subtle performance, but he certainly delivers, in both volume and high notes. His curtain call, complete with deep genuflection and hands-together, hands-apart routine, deserves its own review. What of Tosca herself? The Latvian soprano <a href=\"https://kristineopolais.com/\" title=\"\">Kristine Opolais</a> (she shares the role with Angela Gheorghiu) sounded out of sorts, assured in the moments of high passion, as in Scarpia\u2019s study in Act 2, but uneven and brittle elsewhere. This most famous of roles, flickering emotionally from jealousy to joy, love to destructive horror, can seem one of the least sympathetic unless the performer can intimate shadow and depth. <a href=\"https://www.michaelmofidian.com/\" title=\"\">Michael Mofidian</a>, a valiant Angelotti, and <a href=\"https://www.askonasholt.com/artists/jonathan-lemalu/\" title=\"\">Jonathan Lemalu</a> as the bumbling Sacristan added lustre. The ROH orchestra, especially the principal clarinet \u2013 at the start of E lucevan le stelle and throughout \u2013 gave Puccini\u2019s rich score rampant life under the efficient baton of Alexander Joel.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O-KGQ9vWpc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_O-KGQ9vWpc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O-KGQ9vWpc\">Watch a trailer for the Royal Opera\u2019s Tosca.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Antonio Pappano was the original conductor of this production. The music director of the Royal Opera House spends much of his non-ROH life in the city at the centre of Puccini\u2019s opera: Rome. As music director, since 2005, of Rome\u2019s <strong><a href=\"http://www.santacecilia.it/en/chi_siamo/orchestra_e_coro/orchestra.html\" title=\"\">Orchestra dell\u2019Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia</a></strong>, Pappano has developed the international profile of Italy\u2019s first symphony orchestra (independent of an opera house).

      "bodyText": "There has to be an imperative for returning to an all-time popular opera in its umpteenth revival, in this case the Royal Opera\u2019s 2006 Tosca, back for the ninth time. In fact no reason is needed. Every encounter with Puccini\u2019s work offers a masterclass in the art of opera. If we\u2019re interested in the form, as newcomer or veteran, we should submit to its inexhaustible qualities as often as possible: its economy and detail, its fearless conjunctions of political and personal, grand set piece and intimate drama, all bound into a score of cumulative potency. The lessons of Tosca, and above all its intensity and passion (which is why we go; forget self-improvement), burn bright even if the performance itself doesn\u2019t hit the mark. For this summer run, Jonathan Kent\u2019s staging, with Paul Brown\u2019s heavy, magnificent sets, has a star lineup, with Bryn Terfel chilling and unmissable as Scarpia, the corrupt chief of police. The Welsh bass-baritone dominates the stage with imposing, pulsating villainy, moving as if in a tight corset, upright, rigid with barely contained lust and anger, ready to devour his latest prey \u2013 the diva Tosca \u2013 before spitting her out in quest of the next new thing. Terfel created this role when the production was new, overcoming the physical constraints of the staging, especially in Act 1 where a double staircase means performers are forced to go up, then down. Then up, then down. He treasures every note and gesture, remaining vocally nuanced even when soaring above an orchestra at full whack. He can make a pianissimo \u201cWell?\u201d, whispered offensively close into Tosca\u2019s ear \u2013 don\u2019t you hate a man who does that? \u2013 sound as crude and erotic as language gets. Scarpia\u2019s rival Cavaradossi is sung with clarion panache by the Italian tenor Vittorio Grigolo. Where Terfel stands rock-like, Grigolo is agile and fidgety. It\u2019s not a subtle performance, but he certainly delivers, in both volume and high notes. His curtain call, complete with deep genuflection and hands-together, hands-apart routine, deserves its own review. What of Tosca herself? The Latvian soprano Kristine Opolais (she shares the role with Angela Gheorghiu) sounded out of sorts, assured in the moments of high passion, as in Scarpia\u2019s study in Act 2, but uneven and brittle elsewhere. This most famous of roles, flickering emotionally from jealousy to joy, love to destructive horror, can seem one of the least sympathetic unless the performer can intimate shadow and depth. Michael Mofidian, a valiant Angelotti, and Jonathan Lemalu as the bumbling Sacristan added lustre. The ROH orchestra, especially the principal clarinet \u2013 at the start of E lucevan le stelle and throughout \u2013 gave Puccini\u2019s rich score rampant life under the efficient baton of Alexander Joel. Antonio Pappano was the original conductor of this production. The music director of the Royal Opera House spends much of his non-ROH life in the city at the centre of Puccini\u2019s opera: Rome. As music director, since 2005, of Rome\u2019s Orchestra dell\u2019Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, Pappano has developed the international profile of Italy\u2019s first symphony orchestra (independent of an opera house). Not that it was without style. Leonard Bernstein loved this exuberant and glamorous orchestra. Every big name has conducted it, including Richard Strauss and, late in his life, Gustav Mahler. Arriving at London\u2019s Barbican at the end of a European tour, the Santa Cecilia musicians performed Mahler\u2019s Symphony No 6, with robust conviction, to a capacity audience. Without ado, the army of double basses launched into the snarling march that ignites this work, strings and oboes joining in with ferocious urgency, the entire enlarged orchestra soon unfurling with demonic zeal, complete with a craze of cowbells, sweet celesta, and two almighty, test-your-strength hammer blows. Pappano favours the Scherzo-Andante order of the central movements. Mahler\u2019s original thought, Andante-Scherzo, is now generally preferred, but don\u2019t get me started.

Anyway, Pappano made a strong case. When the warm melody of the Andante at last arrives, it sounds all the more ecstatic and radiant. The rapport between conductor and orchestra was ever evident in this sprawling, terrifying depiction of cataclysm: Mahler at his darkest. The concept of \u201cbest\u201d in live musical performance is elusive and unquantifiable. Hear Mitsuko Uchida perform Schubert one day, Andr\u00e1s Schiff the next and both might appear supreme. Each musician has conveyed the music in a way that speaks immediately and convincingly. Given their long careers, that impression grows with time. Then someone new comes along, and you find they too are \u201cbest\u201d. Igor Levit, now in his early 30s, is one. He delights in the colossal. This was clear when in 2015, in one set, he recorded Bach\u2019s Goldberg Variations, Beethoven\u2019s Diabelli Variations and Frederic Rzewski\u2019s The People United Will Never Be Defeated. The Russian-born, Berlin-based pianist, across two evenings, brought all three works to Wigmore Hall, applying wit, technical wizardry and incisive musical and intellectual command to each. (In a third concert in this marathon, he played Ronald Stevenson\u2019s Passacaglia on DSCH.) Levit has long been a champion of the American Rzewski (b1938), whose variations on a Chilean revolutionary song skates winningly, and expansively, from avant garde to smoky jazz. As the catchy title tune came back, the words kept rearranging themselves in my head: the people defeated will never be united. There\u2019s a message there somewhere.

This was a bit better than the more catastrophic result for the Tories, but emotionally it has been more of a shock to Labour because at least the Conservatives had warning that they were going to be obliterated. In its former stronghold of Scotland, Labour came in fifth with a vote share in single figures. In Wales, another historic bastion, it was third. Even in London, the spiritual heart of Corbynism, the party was drubbed into second place by the Lib Dems.</p> <p>The immediate effect has been to move the balance of argument in favour of those who are pressing for Labour to become a party unequivocally opposed to Brexit. If there were any doubt before, there can be no question now that trying to face two ways on the most important issue facing Britain has alienated millions of voters on both sides of the great and defining question. It is true that Labour, which has MPs representing some of the most pro-Remain and some of the most pro-Leave areas of the country, has always faced a genuine strategic dilemma. It is also clear that equivocation is not a solution to that dilemma when voters are rewarding parties with a clear position and punishing those that try to hide in a thicket of obfuscation. \u201cConstructive ambiguity\u201d has become destructive of Labour\u2019s chances of forming the next government.</p> <p>Yet Mr Corbyn has responded to this dramatic challenge not by coming off the fence but by wobbling about on it. Since the Euros, he has sometimes sounded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/jeremy-corbyn-signals-more-support-for-second-referendum-after-voter-exodus\" title=\"\">a bit warmer</a> towards another referendum, remarking at one point that \u201cwe are ready to support a public vote on any deal\u201d. Then, in the way that we have come to expect from him, he followed zig with zag and said any decision \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/30/soft-brexit-corbyn-labour-second-referendum-some-way-off-backs\" title=\"\">is some way off</a>\u201d. He is still refusing to move to the position that Remainers in his own party and beyond are demanding. He is not making a definite promise of a fresh referendum, no ifs, no buts, no hesitations, deviations, equivocations and qualifications, and no sending out Barry Gardiner to baffle everyone comatose. The Labour leader will still not commit to campaigning to stay within the EU, the position the vast majority of the party\u2019s members want him to adopt. Polling suggests that more than 40% of those members voted for a different party at the Euros and another tenth went on strike by <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/05/30/if-everyone-revealed-how-they-voted-last-week-labo?utm_source=twitter\" title=\"\">staying at home</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec8e3cbf3b26d6cd2d3b1f0a5149118ee488a264\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec8e3cbf3b26d6cd2d3b1f0a5149118ee488a264/0_118_1455_873/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Thornberry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily Thornberry: a loyalist who was one of the first to respond to the Euro elections by blaming the cataclysm on the party\u2019s lack of clarity on Brexit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophie Hogan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead of reflecting on what this says about them and their broken strategy, the response of Team Corbyn was to expel one of those mutinous members, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/31/alastair-campbell-labour-expulsion-discrimination-appeal\" title=\"\">Mr Alastair Campbell</a>, for revealing that he had voted Lib Dem for the first time in his life. It is still not entirely clear exactly who decided to boot out Tony Blair\u2019s former director of communications, a man who has put in many more years as a Labour member than some of Mr Corbyn\u2019s closest advisers. It is implausible that this could have happened without the assent of the Labour leader and his coterie, and highly likely that it was done at their instigation. Perhaps they calculated that throwing out Mr Campbell would distract the media and be popular with the party\u2019s grassroots. The Corbynista base would surely cheer the eviction of a prominent player in the New Labour years who is closely associated with the Iraq war. They instead achieved the unexpected feat of making Mr Campbell a martyr to a popular cause. A variety of other Labour names, including the former home secretary <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/labour-party/jeremy-corbyn/news/104206/labour-grandees-dare-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">Charles Clarke</a> and the former Speaker Betty Boothroyd, reacted by making \u201cI am Spartacus\u201d-style declarations that they also voted for other parties in the Euros. A lot of Labour members have taken to social media to do likewise and dare Mr Corbyn to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/expelmetoo?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag\" title=\"\">#ExpelMeToo</a>.</p> <p>The expulsion coincided with confirmation from the Equality and Human Rights Commission that it was launching a formal inquiry into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/equality-body-launches-investigation-of-labour-antisemitism-claims\" title=\"\">anti-Jewish racism</a> within the Labour party. This invited everyone to contrast the alacrity with which Mr Corbyn\u2019s thought police purged Mr Campbell with the sluggish response to cases of antisemitic abuse.</p> <p>The former New Labour spinmeister could never be confused with a Corbynite. And other critics are also old foes who have been emboldened by his current weakness. More unnerving for the Labour leader is the behaviour of people he previously counted as allies. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-48416883/emily-thornberry-labour-should-campaign-to-remain-in-eu\" title=\"\">Emily Thornberry</a> has been a loyalist, and often a combative one, since he made her shadow foreign secretary, but she was one of the first to respond to the Euro elections by blaming the cataclysm on the party\u2019s lack of clarity on Brexit.</p> <p>Her mind will have been concentrated by the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Lib Dems topping the poll in Islington</a>, the north London borough that both she and Mr Corbyn represent in parliament. She is also interested in having his job when he decides to spend more time with his marrows. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, is the Labour leader\u2019s oldest friend in the shadow cabinet. Even she has been aligning with his critics, tweeting: \u201cWhen we come in third after the Brexit party, that is a clue <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HackneyAbbott/status/1132918892739874818\" title=\"\">something is wrong</a> with our strategy. We need to listen to our members and take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/diane-abbott-second-brexit-referendum-democratic\" title=\"\">a clearer line on a public vote</a>.\u201d</p> <p>I may have remarked before that the Labour leader\u2019s endless weaving and swerving over Brexit has done deep damage to his core brand by revealing him as just another of the cynical, unprincipled, fork-tongued, opportunistic hack politicians that he has always professed to despise. It is some achievement to have a personal approval rating worse than that of Theresa May, a prime minister who has just been forced to quit. Erstwhile worshippers at the shrine of Saint Jeremy are losing their religion. \u201cI despair,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/05/jeremy-corbyn-must-resign-labour-leader-party-loses-all-hope\" title=\"\">one wrote</a> last week.</p> <p>Disillusionment is eating into the very heart of his internal support.

When he and Mr Corbyn captured Labour\u2019s commanding heights four years ago, the shadow chancellor took the view that they needed to stick closely together and never display any differences when they had so many hostile forces arrayed against them. Even between them there is now <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnmcdonnellMP/status/1132911401750679552\" title=\"\">visible daylight</a>. Mr Corbyn\u2019s circle have always regarded the People\u2019s Vote campaign, in which Alastair Campbell plays an influential role, with deep suspicion. Mr McDonnell, by contrast, has had cordial dealings with those pressing for another referendum. I doubt that the shadow chancellor feels that passionately one way or another about Brexit. But he is extremely interested in power.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t amount to an incipient \u201ccoup\u201d against the leader; that is a product of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/26/len-mccluskey-accuses-labour-tom-watson-anti-corbyn-plot\" title=\"\">paranoid imaginations</a>. Labour MPs have not forgotten that the attempt to dislodge him in 2016 was a hopeless failure that only made him stronger. Fury is instead being targeted at his inner circle. Since the king himself cannot be openly accused of wickedness, the blame must fall on his senior courtiers. David Blunkett, the former Labour home secretary, tells us today that Seumas Milne, the director of strategy, and Karie Murphy, the leader\u2019s chief of staff, \u201cmust surely be held to account\u201d. He is speaking for the members of the shadow cabinet who believe Mr Corbyn is \u201cthe prisoner\u201d of his two most senior aides and that removing them is the key to moving him on Brexit.</p> <p>That\u2019s easier demanded than done. They aren\u2019t going to gladly purge themselves and he won\u2019t want to do it. Surrendering their scalps would be popular with many of the shadow cabinet, but it would also be read as a sign of extreme vulnerability. It is also moot whether Mr Corbyn could personally function deprived of Mr Milne and Ms Murphy. When enemies are growing bolder and erstwhile allies are deserting, the instinct of the besieged leader is to clutch tight to the few he still counts as friends.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

This was a bit better than the more catastrophic result for the Tories, but emotionally it has been more of a shock to Labour because at least the Conservatives had warning that they were going to be obliterated. In its former stronghold of Scotland, Labour came in fifth with a vote share in single figures. In Wales, another historic bastion, it was third. Even in London, the spiritual heart of Corbynism, the party was drubbed into second place by the Lib Dems. The immediate effect has been to move the balance of argument in favour of those who are pressing for Labour to become a party unequivocally opposed to Brexit. If there were any doubt before, there can be no question now that trying to face two ways on the most important issue facing Britain has alienated millions of voters on both sides of the great and defining question. It is true that Labour, which has MPs representing some of the most pro-Remain and some of the most pro-Leave areas of the country, has always faced a genuine strategic dilemma. It is also clear that equivocation is not a solution to that dilemma when voters are rewarding parties with a clear position and punishing those that try to hide in a thicket of obfuscation. \u201cConstructive ambiguity\u201d has become destructive of Labour\u2019s chances of forming the next government. Yet Mr Corbyn has responded to this dramatic challenge not by coming off the fence but by wobbling about on it. Since the Euros, he has sometimes sounded a bit warmer towards another referendum, remarking at one point that \u201cwe are ready to support a public vote on any deal\u201d. Then, in the way that we have come to expect from him, he followed zig with zag and said any decision \u201cis some way off\u201d. He is still refusing to move to the position that Remainers in his own party and beyond are demanding. He is not making a definite promise of a fresh referendum, no ifs, no buts, no hesitations, deviations, equivocations and qualifications, and no sending out Barry Gardiner to baffle everyone comatose. The Labour leader will still not commit to campaigning to stay within the EU, the position the vast majority of the party\u2019s members want him to adopt. Polling suggests that more than 40% of those members voted for a different party at the Euros and another tenth went on strike by staying at home. Instead of reflecting on what this says about them and their broken strategy, the response of Team Corbyn was to expel one of those mutinous members, a Mr Alastair Campbell, for revealing that he had voted Lib Dem for the first time in his life. It is still not entirely clear exactly who decided to boot out Tony Blair\u2019s former director of communications, a man who has put in many more years as a Labour member than some of Mr Corbyn\u2019s closest advisers. It is implausible that this could have happened without the assent of the Labour leader and his coterie, and highly likely that it was done at their instigation. Perhaps they calculated that throwing out Mr Campbell would distract the media and be popular with the party\u2019s grassroots. The Corbynista base would surely cheer the eviction of a prominent player in the New Labour years who is closely associated with the Iraq war. They instead achieved the unexpected feat of making Mr Campbell a martyr to a popular cause. A variety of other Labour names, including the former home secretary Charles Clarke and the former Speaker Betty Boothroyd, reacted by making \u201cI am Spartacus\u201d-style declarations that they also voted for other parties in the Euros. A lot of Labour members have taken to social media to do likewise and dare Mr Corbyn to #ExpelMeToo. The expulsion coincided with confirmation from the Equality and Human Rights Commission that it was launching a formal inquiry into anti-Jewish racism within the Labour party. This invited everyone to contrast the alacrity with which Mr Corbyn\u2019s thought police purged Mr Campbell with the sluggish response to cases of antisemitic abuse. The former New Labour spinmeister could never be confused with a Corbynite. And other critics are also old foes who have been emboldened by his current weakness. More unnerving for the Labour leader is the behaviour of people he previously counted as allies. Emily Thornberry has been a loyalist, and often a combative one, since he made her shadow foreign secretary, but she was one of the first to respond to the Euro elections by blaming the cataclysm on the party\u2019s lack of clarity on Brexit. Her mind will have been concentrated by the Lib Dems topping the poll in Islington, the north London borough that both she and Mr Corbyn represent in parliament. She is also interested in having his job when he decides to spend more time with his marrows. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, is the Labour leader\u2019s oldest friend in the shadow cabinet. Even she has been aligning with his critics, tweeting: \u201cWhen we come in third after the Brexit party, that is a clue something is wrong with our strategy. We need to listen to our members and take a clearer line on a public vote.\u201d I may have remarked before that the Labour leader\u2019s endless weaving and swerving over Brexit has done deep damage to his core brand by revealing him as just another of the cynical, unprincipled, fork-tongued, opportunistic hack politicians that he has always professed to despise. It is some achievement to have a personal approval rating worse than that of Theresa May, a prime minister who has just been forced to quit. Erstwhile worshippers at the shrine of Saint Jeremy are losing their religion. \u201cI despair,\u201d one wrote last week. Disillusionment is eating into the very heart of his internal support. Laura Parker, a leading light of Momentum and one of Labour\u2019s disappointed candidates in the Euro elections, voiced her discontent: \u201cWe can\u2019t fudge our way out of the Brexit mess\u201d. The most intriguing figure in this struggle is John McDonnell. When he and Mr Corbyn captured Labour\u2019s commanding heights four years ago, the shadow chancellor took the view that they needed to stick closely together and never display any differences when they had so many hostile forces arrayed against them. Even between them there is now visible daylight. Mr Corbyn\u2019s circle have always regarded the People\u2019s Vote campaign, in which Alastair Campbell plays an influential role, with deep suspicion. Mr McDonnell, by contrast, has had cordial dealings with those pressing for another referendum. I doubt that the shadow chancellor feels that passionately one way or another about Brexit. But he is extremely interested in power. This doesn\u2019t amount to an incipient \u201ccoup\u201d against the leader; that is a product of paranoid imaginations. Labour MPs have not forgotten that the attempt to dislodge him in 2016 was a hopeless failure that only made him stronger. Fury is instead being targeted at his inner circle. Since the king himself cannot be openly accused of wickedness, the blame must fall on his senior courtiers. David Blunkett, the former Labour home secretary, tells us today that Seumas Milne, the director of strategy, and Karie Murphy, the leader\u2019s chief of staff, \u201cmust surely be held to account\u201d. He is speaking for the members of the shadow cabinet who believe Mr Corbyn is \u201cthe prisoner\u201d of his two most senior aides and that removing them is the key to moving him on Brexit. That\u2019s easier demanded than done. They aren\u2019t going to gladly purge themselves and he won\u2019t want to do it. Surrendering their scalps would be popular with many of the shadow cabinet, but it would also be read as a sign of extreme vulnerability. It is also moot whether Mr Corbyn could personally function deprived of Mr Milne and Ms Murphy. When enemies are growing bolder and erstwhile allies are deserting, the instinct of the besieged leader is to clutch tight to the few he still counts as friends. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

A certain Donald Trump featured in the drama in real-life news bulletins \u2013 younger, but still with a face like mashed potato stabbed with a pencil; still dressed like a faulty Ken doll trying and failing to hide a pot belly. Showing the \u201cstinking-rich blowhard\u201d form that would become his political signature, Trump stirred up public anger against the accused, paying for ads calling for the death penalty (the boys were 14 to 16 years old). However, as demonstrated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/29/ava-duvernay-interview-netflix-central-park-five\" title=\"\">Ava DuVernay</a>\u2019s elegantly hard-hitting, four-part series craven lies and structural racism were already crushing the teenagers and their powerless, impoverished families.</p> <p>This was tough viewing, as we witnessed the tearful, dazed teenagers, illegally interviewed alone, bullied, beaten and tricked into \u201cconfessing\u201d on videotape to group rape, then sentenced to between five and 15 years \u2013 with 16-year-old Korey Wise (played by Jharrel Jerome) sent to suffer particularly horrendous abuse in adult prison. Eventually the real culprit confessed, but even scenes of the Central Park Five\u2019s release (ultimately, they were jointly recompensed $41m) were shot through with pathos.</p> <p><em>When They See Us</em> wasn\u2019t perfect \u2013 it was light on the suffering of Meili (who was unable to remember what happened). However, in a case that remains controversial to this day, the drama succeeded in giving the wronged teenagers their voice. With overall pitch-perfect performances, special mention should go to the actors playing the accused as teenagers (Caleel Harris, Asante Blackk, Ethan Herisse, Marquis Rodriguez \u2013 with Jerome superb as both young and old versions of Wise). Felicity Huffman (who recently pleaded guilty in her own trial, regarding the college admissions scheme scandal) also convinced as the hard-bitten prosecutor, as did Michael K Williams, Niecy Nash and John Leguizamo as the devastated parents trapped in a legal-racial hornets\u2019 nest. Sometimes there was a crackle of period detail (Walkmans, Fight the Power, shoulder pads) but it wasn\u2019t overplayed. This was a dignified production about justice subverted to suit murky agendas. Has Trump ever apologised \u2013 even for his calls for the death penalty for children? Take a wild guess.</p> <p>Professor Brian Cox retained his singular presenting style (think hipster-Dementor) for his new series, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07922lr\" title=\"\">The Planets</a></strong>. The opening episode dealt with the four rocky planets closest to the sun (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars), with intriguing visuals \u2013 who\u2019d have thought that the surface of Mercury would resemble my skin at 14? Cox explained that the other \u201crockies\u201d once had Earth-like conditions, and Earth\u2019s \u201cmoment\u201d would also be over once the sun turns into a red giant and cools \u2013 though that\u2019s in several billion years, so don\u2019t panic and start stockpiling tins of Big Soup for your underground bunker just yet. Cox could tone down the intergalactic am-dram just a tad (Venus was \u201ca vision of hell where no life can survive\u201d), but there was much to amaze \u2013 just the bit about ocean worlds of liquid methane was more visual and stirring than the entire last series of <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b869cbfe76e33676861ba9135a10d6246bcdd90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b869cbfe76e33676861ba9135a10d6246bcdd90/0_202_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kayan Novak as Nandor in What We Do in the Shadows.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Sheer daftness\u2019: Kayan Novak as Nandor in What We Do in the Shadows.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/FX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0005bky\" title=\"\">What We Do in the Shadows</a></strong> is the hilarious TV spin-off from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/23/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-review\" title=\"\">cult 2014 film</a> from Jemaine Clement (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/18/flight-of-the-conchords-were-retired-sex-symbols\" title=\"\">Flight of the Conchords</a>) and Taika Waititi (<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/29/thor-ragnarok-review-humour-lightens-marvel-chris-hemsworth\" title=\"\">Thor: Ragnarok</a></em>), with both men still involved.

      "bodyText": "When They See Us Netflix The Planets (BBC Two) | iPlayer What We Do in the Shadows (BBC Two) | iPlayer Chernobyl Sky Atlantic Confessions of a Serial Killer (Channel 4) | All 4 The US drama When They See Us dealt with the horrific case of the Harlem teenagers (four African American, one Hispanic) who were intimidated by police into fake-confessing to the appalling Central Park rape of a jogger, Trisha Meili, in 1989. A certain Donald Trump featured in the drama in real-life news bulletins \u2013 younger, but still with a face like mashed potato stabbed with a pencil; still dressed like a faulty Ken doll trying and failing to hide a pot belly. Showing the \u201cstinking-rich blowhard\u201d form that would become his political signature, Trump stirred up public anger against the accused, paying for ads calling for the death penalty (the boys were 14 to 16 years old). However, as demonstrated by Ava DuVernay\u2019s elegantly hard-hitting, four-part series craven lies and structural racism were already crushing the teenagers and their powerless, impoverished families. This was tough viewing, as we witnessed the tearful, dazed teenagers, illegally interviewed alone, bullied, beaten and tricked into \u201cconfessing\u201d on videotape to group rape, then sentenced to between five and 15 years \u2013 with 16-year-old Korey Wise (played by Jharrel Jerome) sent to suffer particularly horrendous abuse in adult prison. Eventually the real culprit confessed, but even scenes of the Central Park Five\u2019s release (ultimately, they were jointly recompensed $41m) were shot through with pathos. When They See Us wasn\u2019t perfect \u2013 it was light on the suffering of Meili (who was unable to remember what happened). However, in a case that remains controversial to this day, the drama succeeded in giving the wronged teenagers their voice. With overall pitch-perfect performances, special mention should go to the actors playing the accused as teenagers (Caleel Harris, Asante Blackk, Ethan Herisse, Marquis Rodriguez \u2013 with Jerome superb as both young and old versions of Wise). Felicity Huffman (who recently pleaded guilty in her own trial, regarding the college admissions scheme scandal) also convinced as the hard-bitten prosecutor, as did Michael K Williams, Niecy Nash and John Leguizamo as the devastated parents trapped in a legal-racial hornets\u2019 nest. Sometimes there was a crackle of period detail (Walkmans, Fight the Power, shoulder pads) but it wasn\u2019t overplayed. This was a dignified production about justice subverted to suit murky agendas. Has Trump ever apologised \u2013 even for his calls for the death penalty for children? Take a wild guess. Professor Brian Cox retained his singular presenting style (think hipster-Dementor) for his new series, The Planets. The opening episode dealt with the four rocky planets closest to the sun (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars), with intriguing visuals \u2013 who\u2019d have thought that the surface of Mercury would resemble my skin at 14? Cox explained that the other \u201crockies\u201d once had Earth-like conditions, and Earth\u2019s \u201cmoment\u201d would also be over once the sun turns into a red giant and cools \u2013 though that\u2019s in several billion years, so don\u2019t panic and start stockpiling tins of Big Soup for your underground bunker just yet. Cox could tone down the intergalactic am-dram just a tad (Venus was \u201ca vision of hell where no life can survive\u201d), but there was much to amaze \u2013 just the bit about ocean worlds of liquid methane was more visual and stirring than the entire last series of Game of Thrones. What We Do in the Shadows is the hilarious TV spin-off from the cult 2014 film from Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) and Taika Waititi (Thor: Ragnarok), with both men still involved. Instead of tortured, pouting True Blood-style vampires, this lot are like the dork-undead that Nosferatu might have met on holiday, and then regretted exchanging numbers with. Shot in documentary fashion and set on Staten Island, it boasts an amazing cast, including Kayvan Novak as Nandor the Relentless, Matt Berry as foppish braggart Laszlo and Natasia Demetriou as bloodsucking-Kate Bush-alike Nadja. There\u2019s also Harvey Guill\u00e9n as Nandor\u2019s plaintive familiar Guillermo, and \u201cenergy vampire\u201d Colin Robinson (Mark Proksch), who drains people and vampires alike with his excruciating dullness: \u201cWe\u2019re the most common kind of vampire.\u201d Highlights this time (there are two weekly episodes) included Colin\u2019s office romance with Vanessa Bayer\u2019s \u201cemotional vampire\u201d Evie (E-V, geddit?), which had to be called off, Colin parting with the words: \u201cI wish you nothing but continued success feeding on the addled-brained cattle that waste their lives around us.\u201d The vampires also met the king of the Manhattan vampires at his trendy niterie (\u201cEveryone looks like Billy Idol\u201d).

In its penultimate episode, Chernobyl, Craig Mazin\u2019s miniseries about the 1986 nuclear disaster, continued to exude stark, brutal magnificence, with lethal shards of the shattered reactor core having to be cleared from rooftops, babies born dead, and household pets shot.

You need a car to lug your stuff, which means you can only go so far afield. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that campervan-hire companies are proliferating in popular European destinations and bookings from families in peak season are on the rise. A campervan trip is, of course, much more expensive than camping (van hire is roughly the same per day as a mid-range hotel or self-catering option), but comes in slightly cheaper than a fly-drive holiday as you save the car hire. It\u2019s also a good sustainable option: taking the train to your campervan destination is greener than flying, and more climate-friendly than driving a diesel van long distances from home.</p> <p>To get off the beaten track my husband and I and our two boys (aged six and nine) choose north-east Portugal, away from the crush of the Med and the busy Algarve.

I am so grateful for non-topical podcasts in these days of post-poll triumphalism and social media screeching. Who cares what\u2019s going on in the world when you can put your earphones in and go for a walk with the dog (not a euphemism)?</p> <p>Speaking of euphemisms, and acronyms, and slang, it\u2019s a big happy birthday to <a href=\"https://www.theallusionist.org/\" title=\"\"><strong>The Allusionist</strong></a>, a podcast about language: what it means, how it develops, how it affects us, where its tendrils reach. <em>The Allusionist</em> hit 100 episodes last week, and the show\u2019s wonderful presenter/researcher/producer/promoter Helen Zaltzman announced this fact by admitting that making the shows has nearly killed her. She also put out a <a href=\"https://www.theallusionist.org/allusionist/hundredth\" title=\"\">special 100th episode</a>, made up of 100 interesting facts from all those past episodes. And yes, the facts are interesting, nerdy wordy fans\u2026 Did you know that the word woman does not have its stem in the word man? Or that <a href=\"https://www.theallusionist.org/allusionist/swear-pill\" title=\"\">swearing has been proved to make you feel good</a>? Or that literally doesn\u2019t mean literally any more? Or that if you have a small vocabulary, you think differently?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every show is the correct length (meaning, just a bit shorter than you want)</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The 100th episode is fun, and an antidote to those facts-as-entertainment shows such as <a href=\"https://qi.com/\" title=\"\"><em>QI</em></a> that do their jobs well, but patronisingly. <em>The Allusionist </em>never talks down. However, if you\u2019re not yet a regular Allusioneer, I wouldn\u2019t start with that episode. Scroll one back, to <a href=\"https://www.theallusionist.org/allusionist/polari\" title=\"\">99, about the secret gay language Polari</a>, or to <a href=\"https://www.theallusionist.org/allusionist/verisimilitude\" title=\"\">95</a>, where David J Peterson explains how he invented the <em>Games of Thrones</em> languages, Dothraki and Valyrian. (Apparently, we\u2019ve all been pronouncing Khaleesi wrong and it\u2019s doing his head in.) Or go to 58, which tells the tale of <a href=\"https://www.theallusionist.org/allusionist/eclipse\" title=\"\">Lauren Marks</a>, who has a brain aneurysm and has to find her vocabulary all over again.</p> <p>Yes, you learn things from this podcast, but more importantly, you do so in a delightful, human way. Zaltzman\u2019s interviewing is great, her voice gorgeous, but it\u2019s her editing that makes this show. Not a second is wasted. Every show is the correct length (meaning, just a bit shorter than you want). It should be prescribed listening for all BBC \u201cprestigious podcast\u201d producers. When Zaltzman pitched this show, she said she wanted to make <a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/\" title=\"\"><em>99% Invisible</em></a>, but for language. Personally, I would never have thought that language had so many episodes in it, but every week Zaltzman finds something new and utterly fascinating. What\u2019s more, though, she seems to have been on a world tour of the<a href=\"https://www.theallusionist.org/events\" title=\"\"> live <em>Allusionist</em> show, <em>No Title</em></a>, for the past two years (currently in Australia). She has stalwartly provided a podcast every week.

      "bodyText": "The Allusionist (theallusionist.org) Imaginary Advice (imaginaryadvice.com) The Body Genius: The Truth (thetruthpodcast.com) Yet another week when the news has seemed overwhelmingly awful. I am so grateful for non-topical podcasts in these days of post-poll triumphalism and social media screeching. Who cares what\u2019s going on in the world when you can put your earphones in and go for a walk with the dog (not a euphemism)? Speaking of euphemisms, and acronyms, and slang, it\u2019s a big happy birthday to The Allusionist, a podcast about language: what it means, how it develops, how it affects us, where its tendrils reach. The Allusionist hit 100 episodes last week, and the show\u2019s wonderful presenter/researcher/producer/promoter Helen Zaltzman announced this fact by admitting that making the shows has nearly killed her. She also put out a special 100th episode, made up of 100 interesting facts from all those past episodes. And yes, the facts are interesting, nerdy wordy fans\u2026 Did you know that the word woman does not have its stem in the word man? Or that swearing has been proved to make you feel good? Or that literally doesn\u2019t mean literally any more? Or that if you have a small vocabulary, you think differently? The 100th episode is fun, and an antidote to those facts-as-entertainment shows such as QI that do their jobs well, but patronisingly. The Allusionist never talks down. However, if you\u2019re not yet a regular Allusioneer, I wouldn\u2019t start with that episode. Scroll one back, to 99, about the secret gay language Polari, or to 95, where David J Peterson explains how he invented the Games of Thrones languages, Dothraki and Valyrian. (Apparently, we\u2019ve all been pronouncing Khaleesi wrong and it\u2019s doing his head in.) Or go to 58, which tells the tale of Lauren Marks, who has a brain aneurysm and has to find her vocabulary all over again. Yes, you learn things from this podcast, but more importantly, you do so in a delightful, human way. Zaltzman\u2019s interviewing is great, her voice gorgeous, but it\u2019s her editing that makes this show. Not a second is wasted. Every show is the correct length (meaning, just a bit shorter than you want). It should be prescribed listening for all BBC \u201cprestigious podcast\u201d producers. When Zaltzman pitched this show, she said she wanted to make 99% Invisible, but for language. Personally, I would never have thought that language had so many episodes in it, but every week Zaltzman finds something new and utterly fascinating. What\u2019s more, though, she seems to have been on a world tour of the live Allusionist show, No Title, for the past two years (currently in Australia). She has stalwartly provided a podcast every week. She even put one out when she was in hospital. For that episode her voice was done in, so she teed up and played her favourite recent episode of someone else\u2019s show. S.E.I.N.F.E.L.D. was the episode, Imaginary Advice the show. S.E.I.N.F.E.L.D concerned a robot who was trying to be a standup comedian, and it was brilliant. Imaginary Advice won Best Fiction Podcast at the 2018 British Podcast awards, but back then, I was in my audio fiction-refusnik mode and so didn\u2019t bother. I was wrong. The show is experimental, funny, very varied, with great production. Presented by the wry writer (wryter?)

The world is better \u2013 weirder, funnier, kinder, more interesting \u2013 than the news would have us think. Three good Radio 2 half-term stand-ins Ore Oduba (in for Vanessa Feltz) Oduba is known, primarily, for being the greatest ever winner of Strictly Come Dancing (I brook no argument on this). Which doesn\u2019t automatically qualify him to cover for Radio 2\u2019s most gifted and outre presenter, Vanessa Feltz, but he was doing sterling work last week in Feltz\u2019s 5am to 6.30am slot.

Nice and easy on the ear. Fearne Cotton (in for Zo\u00eb Ball) Cotton gets a lot of grief in certain circles, for some reason, though I have always thought her to be a fine presenter. Her Happy Place podcast is immensely popular and she has improved as she has got older and decided to open up about her mental health problems. She\u2019s also a good listener, as her interview with Harry Hill on Tuesday proved. Though not quite as bubbly as Zo\u00eb Ball, Cotton can do upbeat with the best of them and her in-show chat has been friendly and on the money. A safe pair of hands for the biggest radio show in the UK. OJ Borg (in for Steve Wright) Steve Wright hardly ever takes any time off, so Borg only got one sit-in show last week, on Tuesday, following his shift last Friday. I\u2019m not that familiar with Borg\u2019s presenting (he does the late-night Radio 2 slot plus a lot of cycling stuff), but he was engaging, quick-witted and, thank God, not too old school Radio 2 (this may have upset Wrighty\u2019s fans).

WarnerMedia\u2019s <em>Friends</em> is Netflix\u2019s most popular show and it <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/12/4/18126596/friends-netflix-warnermedia-att-hulu-apple-deal\" title=\"\">has had to triple its payment to $100m</a> to hold on to it for just one more year.</p> <p>Netflix\u2019s strategy of increasing prices \u2013 the last rises in the US and UK came in 2017 \u2013 has so far had no impact on customer loyalty and the growth rate of new subscribers. However, as the next stage of Netflix\u2019s growth is set to come from vast markets, such as India, with lower average incomes, its pricing will have to be very low to be competitive.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Almost three-quarters of  Hulu's 28 million customers are on a $5.99-a-month plan that includes exposure to advertising</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Given Netflix\u2019s global scale, the company could consider the careful introduction of advertising in some markets. Founder Reed Hastings has always been against the idea, but last year <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/netflix-begins-testing-ads-for-its-own-series-between-binge-season-episodes/\" title=\"\">Netflix tested ads</a>, or rather trailers for films and shows, in the countdown gaps between episodes when viewers were binge-watching. Sir Martin Sorrell, the former head of the world\u2019s biggest marketing group, WPP, has said Netflix would have to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/apr/28/netflix-advertising-sir-martin-sorrell\" title=\"\">consider advertising \u201cas an alternative revenue generation opportunity\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Netflix\u2019s booming popularity will see it become the equivalent of the third most-watched TV channel in the UK this year, behind only BBC1 and ITV \u2013 making it a hugely attractive proposition for advertisers.</p> <p>Any advertising strategy would need to be handled carefully, as full TV-style ad breaks could result in a customer exodus. Analysts at Ampere estimate that if introducing ads resulted in 5% more customers leaving, it would make the strategy uneconomical.</p> <p>However, the introduction of advertising has been shown to work. US streaming service Hulu, which airs shows such as <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em> and is now <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/14/media/disney-buys-comcast-hulu-ownership/index.html\" title=\"\">controlled by Disney</a>, has said that almost three-quarters of its 28 million customers are on a $5.99-a-month plan that includes exposure to advertising. Ampere believes Hulu actually makes more money per subscriber from that subscription-plus-ads combination than it does from its $11.99 ad-free option.</p> <p>Despite surveys of Netflix customers suggesting they are set against ads, the Hulu experience seems to indicate that stated intentions do not match real-life actions. In the first quarter this year, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/01/hulu-gained-twice-as-many-subscribers-as-netflix-in-us.html\" title=\"\">Hulu added twice as many subscribers as Netflix</a> in the US.</p> <p>Netflix is not yet at a point where ad revenue is crucial to its viability, and with a $150bn market valuation, the world\u2019s biggest streaming service appears to be retaining the faith of its investors. But having upended the traditional TV viewing model, it may yet do the same to the television advertising market.</p> <h2>What business fears most is a Tory meltdown<br></h2> <p>Business leaders are anxious about the fate of the Tory party. That was clear last week when the head of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn, urged Conservative party members to vote for candidates that are ruling out a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>Fairbairn didn\u2019t say this directly. She was careful to make clear that business lobby groups, including her own, never comment on party politics and especially the internal working of an individual party.</p> <p>But her comments were not just a repetition of the business mantra that leaving the EU without a deal would hit employment, profits and growth. It also appeared to be an expression of bosses\u2019 deep-seated fear that a no-deal Brexit would ruin the Tory party\u2019s election prospects and usher in a Labour administration with Jeremy Corbyn as leader.</p> <p>Business is becoming increasingly concerned that grassroots Tories have developed a reckless streak. A poll putting the Liberal Democrats at 24%, ahead of Labour and the Tories tied at 19%, confirms that the Tories\u2019 EU election fiasco, when the party of low taxes and business-friendly regulation came fifth with 9.1% of the vote, could be repeated.</p> <p>Without the Tories at the helm, business would be faced with the prospect of a higher minimum wage, greater environmental controls and improved workers\u2019 rights. There would be moves to nationalise the utilities and the railways, while taxes on the better-off would rise.</p> <p>For some in the Labour leadership, nudging the Tories towards a no-deal Brexit indirectly offers the chance of the ultimate prize: a Labour government. </p> <p>But that would be a disastrous price to pay. Labour needs to win on its own terms. Corbyn should put an end to this high-stakes, no-deal game and back a second referendum. Only then can the parties really pitch their policies against each other for the electorate to choose.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5deaf11f3bd34c519105a158b8dd40d329d186b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5deaf11f3bd34c519105a158b8dd40d329d186b6/0_323_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chelsea fans in Baku\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uefa\u2019s decision to hold the Europa Cup final in Baku wasn\u2019t the most environmentally friendly decision ever made \u2013 and forced fans to make a long journey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chelsea Football Club/Chelsea FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Even if the Blues are in Baku, aviation must go green</h2> <p>The real cost of air travel is rarely felt by those who use it: while motorists\u2019 petrol is taxed, jet fuel has escaped it, due to the complexities of international enforcement.</p> <p>But whatever the environmental lunacy of staging two European football finals between English teams in Spain and Azerbaijan, the fans who paid thousands to fly out were at least desperate to travel. More often, cheap fares lure consumers into journeys they might not have contemplated: according to Ryanair, its average fare now is just \u00a333, lower even than in 2004.</p> <p>Meanwhile, extreme wealth inequality has created a booming market in even more carbon-costly private jets, whose growing ranks helped make last week the busiest ever for flights in and out of British airspace.</p> <p>Alarm over climate change can be seen in the committed no-flyers, and Extinction Rebellion plans to shut down Heathrow with drones later this month. Yet the sentiment remains comparatively niche: remarkably, a social attitudes study just published by the government shows that an ever-increasing proportion of British adults believe flying should be untrammelled, regardless of the environment.</p> <p>Nonetheless, as 1,000 executives gather at the International Air Transport Association\u2019s annual meeting in Seoul this weekend, sustainability is creeping ever higher up the agenda. Airlines have agreed, in principle, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/16/how-airlines-can-fly-around-new-carbon-rules\" title=\"\">Corsia offsetting scheme</a>, a financial incentive to curb the overall growth in emissions. It is a plan that may get aviation off the hook in terms of climate commitments, but won\u2019t stop the spew from jet engines, any more than tobacco firms funding cancer research will clean up smokers\u2019 lungs.</p> <p>Offsetting cannot be the only answer \u2013 and in future the industry is liable to be held more accountable. The more far-sighted are pursuing projects for electric planes or greener fuels, however unviable many currently appear. Aviation must, somehow, clean up its act.</p>",

US streaming service Hulu, which airs shows such as The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and is now controlled by Disney, has said that almost three-quarters of its 28 million customers are on a $5.99-a-month plan that includes exposure to advertising. Ampere believes Hulu actually makes more money per subscriber from that subscription-plus-ads combination than it does from its $11.99 ad-free option. Despite surveys of Netflix customers suggesting they are set against ads, the Hulu experience seems to indicate that stated intentions do not match real-life actions. In the first quarter this year, Hulu added twice as many subscribers as Netflix in the US. Netflix is not yet at a point where ad revenue is crucial to its viability, and with a $150bn market valuation, the world\u2019s biggest streaming service appears to be retaining the faith of its investors. But having upended the traditional TV viewing model, it may yet do the same to the television advertising market. What business fears most is a Tory meltdown Business leaders are anxious about the fate of the Tory party. That was clear last week when the head of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn, urged Conservative party members to vote for candidates that are ruling out a no-deal Brexit. Fairbairn didn\u2019t say this directly. She was careful to make clear that business lobby groups, including her own, never comment on party politics and especially the internal working of an individual party. But her comments were not just a repetition of the business mantra that leaving the EU without a deal would hit employment, profits and growth. It also appeared to be an expression of bosses\u2019 deep-seated fear that a no-deal Brexit would ruin the Tory party\u2019s election prospects and usher in a Labour administration with Jeremy Corbyn as leader. Business is becoming increasingly concerned that grassroots Tories have developed a reckless streak. A poll putting the Liberal Democrats at 24%, ahead of Labour and the Tories tied at 19%, confirms that the Tories\u2019 EU election fiasco, when the party of low taxes and business-friendly regulation came fifth with 9.1% of the vote, could be repeated. Without the Tories at the helm, business would be faced with the prospect of a higher minimum wage, greater environmental controls and improved workers\u2019 rights. There would be moves to nationalise the utilities and the railways, while taxes on the better-off would rise. For some in the Labour leadership, nudging the Tories towards a no-deal Brexit indirectly offers the chance of the ultimate prize: a Labour government. But that would be a disastrous price to pay. Labour needs to win on its own terms. Corbyn should put an end to this high-stakes, no-deal game and back a second referendum. Only then can the parties really pitch their policies against each other for the electorate to choose. Even if the Blues are in Baku, aviation must go green The real cost of air travel is rarely felt by those who use it: while motorists\u2019 petrol is taxed, jet fuel has escaped it, due to the complexities of international enforcement. But whatever the environmental lunacy of staging two European football finals between English teams in Spain and Azerbaijan, the fans who paid thousands to fly out were at least desperate to travel. More often, cheap fares lure consumers into journeys they might not have contemplated: according to Ryanair, its average fare now is just \u00a333, lower even than in 2004. Meanwhile, extreme wealth inequality has created a booming market in even more carbon-costly private jets, whose growing ranks helped make last week the busiest ever for flights in and out of British airspace. Alarm over climate change can be seen in the committed no-flyers, and Extinction Rebellion plans to shut down Heathrow with drones later this month. Yet the sentiment remains comparatively niche: remarkably, a social attitudes study just published by the government shows that an ever-increasing proportion of British adults believe flying should be untrammelled, regardless of the environment. Nonetheless, as 1,000 executives gather at the International Air Transport Association\u2019s annual meeting in Seoul this weekend, sustainability is creeping ever higher up the agenda. Airlines have agreed, in principle, the Corsia offsetting scheme, a financial incentive to curb the overall growth in emissions. It is a plan that may get aviation off the hook in terms of climate commitments, but won\u2019t stop the spew from jet engines, any more than tobacco firms funding cancer research will clean up smokers\u2019 lungs. Offsetting cannot be the only answer \u2013 and in future the industry is liable to be held more accountable. The more far-sighted are pursuing projects for electric planes or greener fuels, however unviable many currently appear. Aviation must, somehow, clean up its act.",

      "body": "<p>Though he died in 1990, in many ways Keith Haring is still alive. His art is everywhere. There are Haring T-shirts, Haring shoes, Haring chairs. You can buy Haring baseball hats and badges and baby-carriers and playing cards and stickers and keyrings.</p> <p>Keith Haring\u2019s work pops up all over the place \u2013 his radiant baby, the barking dog, the dancer, the three-eyed smiling face. Simple, cheerful, upbeat, instantly recognisable. They make you smile and they work like graffiti tags, small signifiers that say \u201cKeith woz here\u201d. But Haring did much more than provide cute cartoons. He was publicly minded. His art faced outwards. He wanted to inform, to start a conversation, to question authority and convention, to represent the oppressed. Those cute figures are political.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough his imagery is ubiquitous, he\u2019s actually an artist that has been overlooked,\u201d says Darren Pih, co-curator of this month\u2019s major <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/keith-haring\" title=\"\">Keith Haring exhibition at Tate Liverpool</a>. \u201cPeople forget that back in the 1980s, he was talking about socially important issues: apartheid, Aids, environmentalism, how capitalism increases inequality \u2013 and he was using very accessible language.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes that language was direct, as in his <em><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/keith-haring-crack-is-wack-mural_b_5651871\" title=\"\">Crack Is Wack</a></em> mural (on 128th Street in New York), or the hundreds of specially designed posters he gave out at anti-nuclear and anti-apartheid rallies. Sometimes it was subtler: some of his later works, when he knew he was dying, featured broken birds, daggers, nails, nooses, blood. Always, it was attractive, with an exuberance and joy that spoke to people of all ages, all backgrounds. That universal quality draws us to Haring\u2019s work \u2013 but can lead some to think that his art is superficial, and easy to achieve. It isn\u2019t.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f74b123b32ac736b6f2910f850e0b4e8d47a83be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f74b123b32ac736b6f2910f850e0b4e8d47a83be/0_203_5013_3009/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Haring\u2019s Crack Is Wack mural, painted in 1986 in Harlem River Park, New York, during restoration.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Haring\u2019s Crack Is Wack mural, painted in 1986 in Harlem River Park, New York, during restoration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Levine/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHis line was astonishing,\u201d says artist <a href=\"https://kennyscharf.com/\" title=\"\">Kenny Scharf</a>, Haring\u2019s contemporary and friend, of the way Haring drew. \u201cKeith was totally confident, that\u2019s one of the reasons why his art is so strong: the confidence in his line, the conviction, everything about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was unique,\u201d says Mare169, real name Carlos Rodriguez, a graffiti artist who worked with Haring in the 1980s. \u201cThe vernacular of his art was so appealing, with a quality of entertainment. But it was also a tremendous, beautiful response to the activism of the time\u2026 the really unusual thing about Keith is that he felt he could be of service.\u201d</p> <p>Haring lived and worked in New York from 1978 until his death, aged 31, from an Aids-related illness. In his final few years, he was invited all over the world to make work, and if you want to see some real-life Keith Haring art, you still can. There is <a href=\"https://www.visittuscany.com/en/attractions/keith-haring-mural/\" title=\"\">a mural in Pisa</a>, on the side of the church of Sant\u2019Antonio, which he made in the last year of his life. There is one at <a href=\"http://www.haring.com/!/art-work/242#.XO1HChPdtmA\" title=\"\">the Carmine public swimming pool</a> on Clarkson Street in Greenwich Village, New York, painted by Haring in one day in 1987. There is public work by Haring in Philadelphia, San Francisco, Antwerp, Berlin, Paris, Melbourne; on hospitals, at schools (often made with children), in an LGBT community services centre.</p> <p>Up until 2005, there was his Pop Shop on Lafayette Street in downtown New York. I went there in the 1990s, and it was an all-encompassing experience. The shop was tiny, with white walls and floor covered in Haring\u2019s art. There was music playing and T-shirts hung up. It was playful and fun, with a club vibe. I bought two badges.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44172802ae4e0d72a7cb2acb4f680f1a53096ce2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44172802ae4e0d72a7cb2acb4f680f1a53096ce2/0_0_3397_3600/944.jpg\" alt=\"A poster from 1987.\" width=\"944\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poster from 1987.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Collection Noirmontartproduction, Paris.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His work is timeless, but it is rooted in its time. The Reaganite 1980s have parallels with today, with an anti-immigration, anti-union, pro-guns, anti-abortion, go-USA \u201centertainer\u201d president in the White House. Back then, young artists reacted, shaking up the art establishment. A new post-Warhol crew that included Haring, Scharf and Jean-Michel Basquiat suddenly emerged, making work that referenced what was around them: clubbing, rap, street art, television, high and low culture. They grabbed attention, shows and sales.</p> <p>But art institutions, especially museums, didn\u2019t know how to react to these upstarts and their work. Neither did critics: some were supportive, many were snide (<em>Time</em>\u2019s Robert Hughes caricatured Haring as \u201cKeith Boring\u201d). There was a sense among the stuffy that these young artists were not to be taken seriously, and Haring\u2019s likable painting style meant that his art, though loved by the public, was not \u201chigh\u201d enough for the elite. Plus, he collaborated with others too often; he was too commercial; he would keep banging on about politics and safe sex.</p> <p>Today, though, Haring paintings sell for millions. In 2016, Sotheby\u2019s sold four Haring canvases, including the wonderful <em><a href=\"http://www.haring.com/!/art-work/29#.XO1KV6ZJlmA\" title=\"\">The Last Rainforest</a></em>, which he painted in 1989 when he knew he was dying. The sale price was over \u00a34m.</p> <p>And there\u2019s a renewed interest in the artistic era in which Haring operated \u2013 that collaborative time in New York where pop and rap and art met and mixed, a time that started in the mid-to-late 70s and ended, in essence, with a trio of deaths: first Warhol in 1987, then Basquiat in 1988 and finally, Haring, in February 1990. Last year, the Beastie Boys, native New Yorkers, used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/21/beastie-boys-book-memoir-interview\" title=\"\">their vastly entertaining memoir</a> to paint a seductive picture of growing up during that era. In 2017, there was a huge and highly successful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/24/jean-michel-basquiat-boom-for-real-barbican-review\" title=\"\">Basquiat exhibition</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/24/jean-michel-basquiat-boom-for-real-barbican-review\" title=\"\">, in London</a>; around the same time, MoMA in New York put on a show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/22/club-57-new-york-optimistic-goofy-photograph\" title=\"\">based around Club 57</a>, a small nightclub where artists and musicians and performers would hang out in the late 70s and early 80s. The time in which these artists lived and worked seems so near, and yet so far away. New York was still New York, but grubby, dangerous, abandoned, cheap. Fertile, angry, full of possibilities.</p> <p>Keith Haring was born in May 1958. He grew up in a conventional family, led by a respectable man, in Kutztown, Pennsylvania. His dad, Allen, was a church-going, Nixon-supporting Republican, who drew cartoons in his spare time and encouraged his son to do the same. The Harings were loving, but Keith had a strong sense that he was different. In his teenage years, he turned first to church, becoming what he would later call a \u201cJesus freak\u201d, and then, an acid-dropping (Grateful) Deadhead and occasional runaway (he went to Jersey Shore for a summer when he was 17, against his parents\u2019 wishes).</p> <p>After graduating from high school, he enrolled in a Pittsburgh college for illustrators, but found it too limiting. He dropped out and hitchhiked across America with his girlfriend, funding the trip by selling his drawings. Soon after their return, his girlfriend said she was pregnant. Haring had just started sleeping with men. He knew he had to leave. \u201cNew York was the only place to go,\u201d he said later. He applied and got into the School of Visual Arts, on East 23rd Street. Other students included Samantha McEwen and Kenny Scharf.</p> <p>At their very first lesson, a drawing class, remembers McEwen, Haring \u201cdragged his chair all the way across the room\u201d to sit opposite her, so that he could draw her, and her him. She thinks it was because she looked different to the other class members, because she was English, with mad curly hair, dressed in secondhand clothes. They had an instant rapport, she recalls. \u201cHe was so charming and engaged. He really listened.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25fd06418960ae4c391d23c68edeecd92d5b7a91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25fd06418960ae4c391d23c68edeecd92d5b7a91/0_0_3000_2608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 1987.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"869\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 1987.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Hirose/NGV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unlike most 20-year-olds, Haring was clearheaded and motivated; he knew what he wanted to do and he used his time well. \u201cHe would move into whatever space that was available,\u201d says McEwen.</p> <p>Scharf recalls that Haring \u201calways took the initiative, he located any avenues that were available in a smart way. He really had it together.\u201d</p> <p>When he spotted an unused room in SVA, Haring found some three-metre wide paper, put it on the floor of the room, where it fitted exactly, and started painting in there. He brought in his tape player and painted to Devo, timing the brush-strokes to the music, stopping when the track stopped. Scharf met him for the first time here, as Haring was literally <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqBwq-eYbsc\" title=\"\">painting himself into a corner</a>.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of other artists were jealous, like: \u2018Oh, you get to do this room just for yourself, how come you get to do that?\u2019\u201d remembers Scharf. \u201cAnd it was like: \u2018Well, you didn\u2019t ask!\u2019\u201d The outgoing, charismatic Scharf was already known for dragging in debris off the streets into SVA to glue together and paint. He and Haring became instant friends.</p> <p>Haring was warm and open, but focused \u2013 \u201calways learning\u201d says McEwen \u2013 and more opinionated than most of his contemporaries. A compulsive diarist \u2013 he believed recording his work was part of his practice \u2013 Haring wrote later that he came to SVA \u201cprepared to aggressively get things from the school, instead of expecting the school to give them to me\u201d. He hung the Devo paintings on the college walls without permission, and from that, got himself an exhibition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"66b1c50dc3fa9dbbf708d76d7ef20893cddc7ef3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66b1c50dc3fa9dbbf708d76d7ef20893cddc7ef3/0_0_2834_4200/675.jpg\" alt=\"Keith Haring at work in his New York studio in October 1982.\" width=\"675\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keith Haring at work in his New York studio in October 1982.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allan Tannenbaum/Polaris/eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though Haring was confident in his drawing, he was also interested in words, and experimented a lot with poems, as well as new technology like Xerox and video cameras. Some of his first New York works were cut-ups of tabloid covers (\u201cRonald Reagan Accused of TV Star Death\u201d), and when, at a Canal Street sign shop, he found a bag of 13 letters, he used them to make a sort of restricted poetry: \u201cart art boys sin as if no if no art lick fat boys\u201d. He used them as the basis of videos, created Xeroxed, Warhol-esque posters and would read the \u201cart boys\u201d poems at Club 57. For a while, in 1979, he wore a black beret and called himself a terrorist poet.</p> <p>The then new Club 57 was in a Polish church at 57 St Mark\u2019s Place. Haring, Scharf and another SVA student called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sex\" title=\"\">John Sex</a> stumbled across it by mistake; they liked the jukebox and put a track on. Ann Magnuson, who ran the club, came out from behind the bar and started go-go dancing with them. Magnuson got her new friends to do one-night art shows at the club, \u201cand it kept tumbling like that\u201d, says Scharf. \u201cEvery night, performances, art shows, happenings.\u201d Unlike the well-established punk venue CBGB, or the <a href=\"https://www.crfashionbook.com/culture/a24889980/a-historical-look-at-the-mudd-club/\" title=\"\">Mudd Club</a>, both of which were cool (\u201cheroin-y\u201d), or the high-end celeb-station that was Studio 54, Club 57 was small, silly \u2013 \u201cuncool,\u201d says McEwen \u2013 and very sexually free. Everyone was sleeping with everyone else. The chosen drugs were booze and hallucinogens. Haring loved Club 57\u2019s attitude, which was less nightclub and more playroom: he staged spontaneous art shows, read his poems, joined in with big Twister parties. He did performances with a TV on his head, speaking through the screen.</p> <p>Haring was interested in art that talked to people. After just one month at SVA, he wrote a manifesto-cum-self-definition that included the words: \u201cThe public has a right to art/The public is being ignored by most contemporary artists/Art is for everybody.\u201d As far as Haring was concerned, it was the viewer that created the meaning and reality of the artwork. So he wanted to gain as many viewers as possible. (\u201cAs graffiti artists say,\u201d says Rodriguez, \u201che wanted eyeballs.\u201d)</p> <p>McEwen remembers him painting abstract images on the ground in the loading bay of SVA. Lots of passersby stopped to talk, to tell him what they thought. \u201cOne would say it reminded them of fighting in world war two, another said they could see animals in there,\u201d she says. \u201cHe thrived on that interaction and I think it pushed him to take his art out on to the streets.\u201d</p> <p>She also recalls Haring\u2019s show at an abandoned school turned DIY art venue, PS122, in 1980. He had turned from poetry back to art, and at the show, he debuted the style that became his signature. He drew pictures of flying saucers shooting out light-rays, of penises being worshipped by crowds of people, of a baby that shone like a star. \u201cIt was so arresting,\u201d she said. \u201cImmediate.\u201d</p> <p>Street art was flourishing in New York. Tagging and graffiti art was part of the emerging hip-hop scene, which was mostly based uptown, in Harlem and the Bronx, but moved to the Lower East Side once rappers and taggers like Fab Five Freddy started mingling with downtown artists. Jean-Michel Basquiat, whose own SAMO tag began as a sort of on-wall manifesto poetry, wasn\u2019t a student at SVA, but would visit the college, invited by Scharf.</p> <p>Though Haring, Basquiat and Scharf were very different artists, all three were interested in making work outside galleries. Haring started tagging \u2013 he drew his tag, the radiant baby, next to existing graffiti, never over the top \u2013 and Basquiat was already doing so. All three were also interested in the risk and magic of making work without preparatory drawings, and Haring was the king of this. Lenore and Herb Schorr, collectors of both Basquiat and Haring, recall his ability to fill whatever space he needed to.</p> <p>\u201cHe was a phenomenon,\u201d says Lenore. \u201cHe would just get up in front of a wall and right from his head, no drawing, he would start working. It was unreal, his understanding. He saw the space and he filled it and it was beautiful and it was balanced, it had a rhythm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was more than that,\u201d says Tony Shafrazi, who became Haring\u2019s dealer. Being out and about drawing on walls led Haring to look at the streets differently. He noticed the small advertising spaces at subway stations. Whenever an old advert was removed, but before the new one was put up, the space was covered in black paper. Haring decided to draw on these blank canvases in chalk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"819e4183ec6e85176974dbdc076a3234ea009181\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/819e4183ec6e85176974dbdc076a3234ea009181/0_0_5315_2980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ignorance = Fear, 1989.

He would go up one line, come back down; he went all over Manhattan like that, covering the place.\u201d</p> <p>An SVA friend, the photographer <a href=\"http://www.tsengkwongchi.com/portfolios/keith-haring-archive/\" title=\"\">Tseng Kwong Chi</a>, would come by a few hours later and take pictures of the chalk drawings before they were covered over or stolen. Haring was arrested a few times for this, but it just added to the street glamour (CBS\u2019s <em>Sunday Morning</em> did <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Nscsx9NldA\" title=\"\">a piece on him</a>, complete with convenient cop handcuffing him). People would stop and chat to him while he drew, and he made badges and handed them out. Robin Williams had one. So did Diane Keaton.</p> <p>At that time, Scharf and Haring shared an apartment, a huge two-storey loft near Bryant Park, filled with both of their work. But it quickly became tricky for Scharf, because Keith\u2019s work was becoming popular. Collectors came up to their apartment to buy a Haring and walked straight past Scharf\u2019s work. \u201cIt caused Kenny a lot of angst,\u201d remembers McEwen.</p> <p>\u201cWe all had ambitions of moving up, getting a bigger audience and money,\u201d says Scharf, \u201cbut when it happens, things change. It isn\u2019t so fun and simple as it was when we were each other\u2019s audience. There\u2019s other people\u2019s take on you, you\u2019re taken more seriously, then they\u2019re more critical, then there\u2019s jealousy. Before, you had a focal point of getting out there and creating, and then all of a sudden you have to deal with this machine that you wanted to be involved in, but that you didn\u2019t know anything about.\u201d Soon after, Haring decided he needed a dealer, and chose Shafrazi.</p> <p>In 1981, Haring moved in with McEwen, into her Broome Street railroad apartment, where there was no corridor, and each room led into another. At the start, McEwen\u2019s rooms were the kitchen and a bedroom, but that changed when Keith became romantically involved with a DJ called Juan Dubose, \u201cand it became clear that Juan needed access to the kitchen,\u201d says McEwen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c0a555da55751d9fdfe6c48e9c0588ba93746ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c0a555da55751d9fdfe6c48e9c0588ba93746ac/0_0_4458_5772/772.jpg\" alt=\"Crack Down! 1986.\" width=\"772\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crack Down! 1986.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Collection Noirmontartproduction, Paris.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Juan\u2019s contribution is underestimated,\u201d she says. \u201cHe did all the cooking for Keith, he sort of kept house so that Keith could work.\u201d With Dubose moving in, McEwen swapped rooms, but then she had to walk through Haring and Dubose\u2019s bedroom to get to the kitchen. So Haring bought a tent. \u201cJust a perfect-sized tent that was his and Juan\u2019s bed,\u201d says McEwen. \u201cI came back one day and there it was. With the TV right up against the door to the tent so they could watch it.\u201d</p> <p>Though neither was completely monogamous, Haring and Dubose were together for several years. They loved to dance, and became regulars at the Paradise Garage, where Larry Levan DJed. Haring adored the exhilaration and community at the club: when he became successful and had to travel around the world for his work, he would organise his schedule so that he would leave straight after a Saturday night at the Garage or return just before, \u201cso that I didn\u2019t miss any of my Garage time\u201d. Dancing was immensely important to him, as were the \u201ccute boys\u201d of the Garage, who were mostly black and Latino. Haring was attracted to non-white men. \u201cI\u2019m sure inside I\u2019m not white,\u201d he once wrote.</p> <p>In 1982, Shafrazi put on a solo Haring show. It was a huge success. Important art collectors mingled with Haring\u2019s downtown friends, plus graffiti artists and hip-hop DJs. From there, things really took off. Haring met Warhol and they became close. He went for dinner at Yoko Ono\u2019s, he hung out with David Bowie, Iggy Pop, William Burroughs, Robert Mapplethorpe. He already knew Madonna, from clubbing at Danceteria. He went to her wedding, and took Warhol as his guest.</p> <p>By 1984, Haring couldn\u2019t do the subway paintings any more, because people were stealing them as soon as they were up and putting them up for sale. Fake Harings started springing up; his style was much imitated, especially in Japan. In 1986, he set up his Pop Shop on Lafayette Street. He wanted the public to be able to access his real work, not just those with enough money to be able to buy one of his paintings. Popular culture accepted his art long before the establishment did. For Haring, the Pop Shop \u201cwas the ultimate in cutting them [the art establishment] out of the picture\u201d.</p> <p>Scharf remembers this. \u201cKeith was crucified for it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe art world likes to think: \u2018Oh, if you\u2019re doing things in a mass commercial way, you\u2019re dumbing it down for the masses.\u2019 Well, no. We\u2019re not dumbing things down, we\u2019re bringing people up. But the art world doesn\u2019t want to see people coming up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d08e8a5f30c1e39866b07c02d6882610fe4123b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d08e8a5f30c1e39866b07c02d6882610fe4123b/0_0_4683_3508/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Warhol and Keith Haring with their poster design for the 1986 Montreux jazz festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"749\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Warhol and Keith Haring with their poster design for the 1986 Montreux jazz festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone Press/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Haring often spoke eloquently about the notion of \u201cselling out\u201d. He turned down many offers of lucrative work: to license his art in Tokyo, to run a Macy\u2019s boutique, to paint a Hall &amp; Oates album cover, to advertise Kraft cheese and Dodge trucks. He accepted some, like Swatch and Absolut: those that offered a challenge. \u201cEver since there have been people waiting to buy things, I\u2019ve known that if I wanted to make things people would want, I could do it easily,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as you let that affect you, you\u2019ve lost everything.\u201d</p> <p>And he continued to work with graffiti artists, though he only went out tagging with them once; he felt stupid as the older white guy, like a chaperone. He didn\u2019t call himself a graffiti artist \u2013 in an <em>Interview</em> piece, he described what he did as drawing, rather than graffiti \u2013 but the media didn\u2019t listen. He talked to Rodriguez about it. \u201cKeith and I often discussed this,\u201d he says. \u201cI would say to him, You\u2019re not a graffiti artist. And he would say: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s the media, it\u2019s how they write it.\u2019 But we both knew that he was playing along with it, because it helped give rise to his success. The thing that people don\u2019t know is that his success also elevated us as well. There was this mutual understanding and agreement that he was really making headway for a lot of people. He was making street art acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>Dancer Bill T Jones believes that Keith tried to raise consciousness in general. \u201cEveryone knew his sexuality, he was very out, which was important,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd he would try and represent the young, underserved black and brown people of the streets, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/central-park-five-donald-trump-jogger-rape-case-new-york\" title=\"\">Central Park Five</a>. The art world claimed to not know about such things \u2013 and its passivity, its silence was political \u2013 but because of the people he associated with, Keith was pulled into these issues.\u201d</p> <p>Jones worked with Haring on a number of occasions, including in the UK in 1983. For a show at the Robert Fraser gallery, Haring decided he would paint Jones\u2019s naked body and have Tseng take photographs. The painting took four-and-a-half hours, and when he was done, the press were invited in to do interviews. Jones remembers the whole event with affection, calling it both \u201cinnocent\u201d and \u201cbrazen\u201d. \u201cThat body-painting gave me power,\u201d he says. \u201cIt made one feel transformed, into a heightened consciousness, a special status, I was a moving sculpture.\u201d After this, Haring painted Grace Jones.</p> <p>Haring\u2019s horizons were expanding. He painted on the Berlin Wall, he worked with MTV. He was immensely popular: in 1986, he was the subject of more than 100 newspaper articles. But in the mid-1980s, as he was flying high with his career, back in New York, the carefree environment began to change.</p> <p>Aids swept through New York like a fire, \u201clike world war two,\u201d recalls Jones, whose dance and life partner Arnie Zane died of Aids-related lymphoma in 1988. \u201cAn entire generation was killed, it decimated a whole class of persons, the homosexual, creative people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d19bb445ea4bd4840835a6f6cf9e20e408b4cb0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d19bb445ea4bd4840835a6f6cf9e20e408b4cb0f/0_141_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Painting a 100-metre section of the Berlin Wall in 1986.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Painting a 100-metre section of the Berlin Wall in 1986.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Klostermeie/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McEwen got pregnant around this time and was required to take an HIV test. She had to take her blood sample to an abandoned car park, to a box-like structure that was set up away from people, and post the sample through a slot. Everyone was petrified of catching this new and terrible disease; no one knew quite how it was spreading. But spreading it was, and people were dying.</p> <p>\u201cPeople got sick and they\u2019d die in two weeks,\u201d says Scharf. \u201cRecently, I went to a friend\u2019s photography show and looked at a photo of us all, and everyone is no longer here and they\u2019ve been gone 30 years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou had a kid, and you\u2019d look around for who could be godfather,\u201d says McEwen, \u201cand there was nobody left.\u201d</p> <p>Haring knew he was at risk \u2013 Dubose had been diagnosed HIV-positive. His friends were dying, including Bobby Breslau, a mentor who worked at Pop Shop. Haring was badly affected by Bobby\u2019s suffering, but was accepting of his own fate. He wrote about the possibility in his journals in March 1987.</p> <p>\u201cI am quite aware that I have or will have Aids,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe symptoms already exist\u2026 my days are numbered. Important to do as much as possible as quickly as possible. WORK IS ALL I HAVE AND ART IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN LIFE. I always knew, since I was young, that I would die young, But I thought it would be FAST (an accident), not a disease\u2026 time will tell but I am not scared. I live every day as if it were the last. I LOVE LIFE. I love babies and children and some people, most people, well maybe not most.

He set up <a href=\"http://www.haring.com\" title=\"\">the Keith Haring Foundation</a>, which still exists today, working to support underprivileged children and HIV charities. And he did <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/keith-haring-just-say-know-71847/\" title=\"\">an interview with </a><em><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/keith-haring-just-say-know-71847/\" title=\"\">Rolling Stone</a></em>.</p> <p>He said: \u201cNo matter how long you work, it\u2019s always going to end sometime. And there\u2019s always going to be things left undone\u2026 part of the reason that I\u2019m not having trouble facing the reality of death is that it\u2019s not a limitation, in a way. It could have happened any time, and it is going to happen sometime. If you live your life according to that, death is irrelevant. Everything I\u2019m doing right now is exactly what I want to do.\u201d</p> <p>Haring worked right up until two months before he died. Scharf was at his side when he was very ill. Haring was agitated, twitchy, with his eyes shut, and Scharf held him. \u201cI said: \u2018You can relax. Everything you\u2019ve done is going to keep going. You\u2019re going to continue.\u2019 And I felt him relax. I meant it. He started something really big, and I will always honour his legacy.\u201d</p> <p>Haring died on 16 February 1990. During his lifetime, he had almost 50 one-man shows. He painted 45 murals. Since his death, his foundation has supported hundreds of youth, community, art, LBGT, safe sex and planned-parenthood projects. His work is held by MoMA, the Whitney, the LA County Museum of Art, the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. And many, many people own a Keith Haring badge.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/keith-haring\" title=\"\">The Keith Haring exhibition is at Tate Liverpool, 14 June-10 November</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Though he died in 1990, in many ways Keith Haring is still alive. His art is everywhere. There are Haring T-shirts, Haring shoes, Haring chairs. You can buy Haring baseball hats and badges and baby-carriers and playing cards and stickers and keyrings. Keith Haring\u2019s work pops up all over the place \u2013 his radiant baby, the barking dog, the dancer, the three-eyed smiling face. Simple, cheerful, upbeat, instantly recognisable. They make you smile and they work like graffiti tags, small signifiers that say \u201cKeith woz here\u201d. But Haring did much more than provide cute cartoons. He was publicly minded. His art faced outwards. He wanted to inform, to start a conversation, to question authority and convention, to represent the oppressed. Those cute figures are political. \u201cAlthough his imagery is ubiquitous, he\u2019s actually an artist that has been overlooked,\u201d says Darren Pih, co-curator of this month\u2019s major Keith Haring exhibition at Tate Liverpool. \u201cPeople forget that back in the 1980s, he was talking about socially important issues: apartheid, Aids, environmentalism, how capitalism increases inequality \u2013 and he was using very accessible language.\u201d Sometimes that language was direct, as in his Crack Is Wack mural (on 128th Street in New York), or the hundreds of specially designed posters he gave out at anti-nuclear and anti-apartheid rallies. Sometimes it was subtler: some of his later works, when he knew he was dying, featured broken birds, daggers, nails, nooses, blood. Always, it was attractive, with an exuberance and joy that spoke to people of all ages, all backgrounds. That universal quality draws us to Haring\u2019s work \u2013 but can lead some to think that his art is superficial, and easy to achieve. It isn\u2019t. \u201cHis line was astonishing,\u201d says artist Kenny Scharf, Haring\u2019s contemporary and friend, of the way Haring drew. \u201cKeith was totally confident, that\u2019s one of the reasons why his art is so strong: the confidence in his line, the conviction, everything about it.\u201d \u201cHe was unique,\u201d says Mare169, real name Carlos Rodriguez, a graffiti artist who worked with Haring in the 1980s. \u201cThe vernacular of his art was so appealing, with a quality of entertainment. But it was also a tremendous, beautiful response to the activism of the time\u2026 the really unusual thing about Keith is that he felt he could be of service.\u201d Haring lived and worked in New York from 1978 until his death, aged 31, from an Aids-related illness. In his final few years, he was invited all over the world to make work, and if you want to see some real-life Keith Haring art, you still can. There is a mural in Pisa, on the side of the church of Sant\u2019Antonio, which he made in the last year of his life. There is one at the Carmine public swimming pool on Clarkson Street in Greenwich Village, New York, painted by Haring in one day in 1987. There is public work by Haring in Philadelphia, San Francisco, Antwerp, Berlin, Paris, Melbourne; on hospitals, at schools (often made with children), in an LGBT community services centre. Up until 2005, there was his Pop Shop on Lafayette Street in downtown New York. I went there in the 1990s, and it was an all-encompassing experience. The shop was tiny, with white walls and floor covered in Haring\u2019s art. There was music playing and T-shirts hung up. It was playful and fun, with a club vibe. I bought two badges. His work is timeless, but it is rooted in its time. The Reaganite 1980s have parallels with today, with an anti-immigration, anti-union, pro-guns, anti-abortion, go-USA \u201centertainer\u201d president in the White House. Back then, young artists reacted, shaking up the art establishment. A new post-Warhol crew that included Haring, Scharf and Jean-Michel Basquiat suddenly emerged, making work that referenced what was around them: clubbing, rap, street art, television, high and low culture. They grabbed attention, shows and sales. But art institutions, especially museums, didn\u2019t know how to react to these upstarts and their work. Neither did critics: some were supportive, many were snide (Time\u2019s Robert Hughes caricatured Haring as \u201cKeith Boring\u201d). There was a sense among the stuffy that these young artists were not to be taken seriously, and Haring\u2019s likable painting style meant that his art, though loved by the public, was not \u201chigh\u201d enough for the elite. Plus, he collaborated with others too often; he was too commercial; he would keep banging on about politics and safe sex. Today, though, Haring paintings sell for millions. In 2016, Sotheby\u2019s sold four Haring canvases, including the wonderful The Last Rainforest, which he painted in 1989 when he knew he was dying. The sale price was over \u00a34m. And there\u2019s a renewed interest in the artistic era in which Haring operated \u2013 that collaborative time in New York where pop and rap and art met and mixed, a time that started in the mid-to-late 70s and ended, in essence, with a trio of deaths: first Warhol in 1987, then Basquiat in 1988 and finally, Haring, in February 1990. Last year, the Beastie Boys, native New Yorkers, used their vastly entertaining memoir to paint a seductive picture of growing up during that era. In 2017, there was a huge and highly successful Basquiat exhibition, in London; around the same time, MoMA in New York put on a show based around Club 57, a small nightclub where artists and musicians and performers would hang out in the late 70s and early 80s. The time in which these artists lived and worked seems so near, and yet so far away. New York was still New York, but grubby, dangerous, abandoned, cheap. Fertile, angry, full of possibilities. Keith Haring was born in May 1958. He grew up in a conventional family, led by a respectable man, in Kutztown, Pennsylvania. His dad, Allen, was a church-going, Nixon-supporting Republican, who drew cartoons in his spare time and encouraged his son to do the same. The Harings were loving, but Keith had a strong sense that he was different. In his teenage years, he turned first to church, becoming what he would later call a \u201cJesus freak\u201d, and then, an acid-dropping (Grateful) Deadhead and occasional runaway (he went to Jersey Shore for a summer when he was 17, against his parents\u2019 wishes). After graduating from high school, he enrolled in a Pittsburgh college for illustrators, but found it too limiting. He dropped out and hitchhiked across America with his girlfriend, funding the trip by selling his drawings. Soon after their return, his girlfriend said she was pregnant. Haring had just started sleeping with men. He knew he had to leave. \u201cNew York was the only place to go,\u201d he said later. He applied and got into the School of Visual Arts, on East 23rd Street. Other students included Samantha McEwen and Kenny Scharf. At their very first lesson, a drawing class, remembers McEwen, Haring \u201cdragged his chair all the way across the room\u201d to sit opposite her, so that he could draw her, and her him. She thinks it was because she looked different to the other class members, because she was English, with mad curly hair, dressed in secondhand clothes. They had an instant rapport, she recalls. \u201cHe was so charming and engaged. He really listened.\u201d Unlike most 20-year-olds, Haring was clearheaded and motivated; he knew what he wanted to do and he used his time well. \u201cHe would move into whatever space that was available,\u201d says McEwen. Scharf recalls that Haring \u201calways took the initiative, he located any avenues that were available in a smart way. He really had it together.\u201d When he spotted an unused room in SVA, Haring found some three-metre wide paper, put it on the floor of the room, where it fitted exactly, and started painting in there. He brought in his tape player and painted to Devo, timing the brush-strokes to the music, stopping when the track stopped. Scharf met him for the first time here, as Haring was literally painting himself into a corner. \u201cA lot of other artists were jealous, like: \u2018Oh, you get to do this room just for yourself, how come you get to do that?\u2019\u201d remembers Scharf. \u201cAnd it was like: \u2018Well, you didn\u2019t ask!\u2019\u201d The outgoing, charismatic Scharf was already known for dragging in debris off the streets into SVA to glue together and paint. He and Haring became instant friends. Haring was warm and open, but focused \u2013 \u201calways learning\u201d says McEwen \u2013 and more opinionated than most of his contemporaries. A compulsive diarist \u2013 he believed recording his work was part of his practice \u2013 Haring wrote later that he came to SVA \u201cprepared to aggressively get things from the school, instead of expecting the school to give them to me\u201d. He hung the Devo paintings on the college walls without permission, and from that, got himself an exhibition. Though Haring was confident in his drawing, he was also interested in words, and experimented a lot with poems, as well as new technology like Xerox and video cameras. Some of his first New York works were cut-ups of tabloid covers (\u201cRonald Reagan Accused of TV Star Death\u201d), and when, at a Canal Street sign shop, he found a bag of 13 letters, he used them to make a sort of restricted poetry: \u201cart art boys sin as if no if no art lick fat boys\u201d. He used them as the basis of videos, created Xeroxed, Warhol-esque posters and would read the \u201cart boys\u201d poems at Club 57. For a while, in 1979, he wore a black beret and called himself a terrorist poet. The then new Club 57 was in a Polish church at 57 St Mark\u2019s Place. Haring, Scharf and another SVA student called John Sex stumbled across it by mistake; they liked the jukebox and put a track on. Ann Magnuson, who ran the club, came out from behind the bar and started go-go dancing with them. Magnuson got her new friends to do one-night art shows at the club, \u201cand it kept tumbling like that\u201d, says Scharf. \u201cEvery night, performances, art shows, happenings.\u201d Unlike the well-established punk venue CBGB, or the Mudd Club, both of which were cool (\u201cheroin-y\u201d), or the high-end celeb-station that was Studio 54, Club 57 was small, silly \u2013 \u201cuncool,\u201d says McEwen \u2013 and very sexually free. Everyone was sleeping with everyone else. The chosen drugs were booze and hallucinogens. Haring loved Club 57\u2019s attitude, which was less nightclub and more playroom: he staged spontaneous art shows, read his poems, joined in with big Twister parties. He did performances with a TV on his head, speaking through the screen. Haring was interested in art that talked to people. After just one month at SVA, he wrote a manifesto-cum-self-definition that included the words: \u201cThe public has a right to art/The public is being ignored by most contemporary artists/Art is for everybody.\u201d As far as Haring was concerned, it was the viewer that created the meaning and reality of the artwork. So he wanted to gain as many viewers as possible. (\u201cAs graffiti artists say,\u201d says Rodriguez, \u201che wanted eyeballs.\u201d) McEwen remembers him painting abstract images on the ground in the loading bay of SVA. Lots of passersby stopped to talk, to tell him what they thought. \u201cOne would say it reminded them of fighting in world war two, another said they could see animals in there,\u201d she says. \u201cHe thrived on that interaction and I think it pushed him to take his art out on to the streets.\u201d She also recalls Haring\u2019s show at an abandoned school turned DIY art venue, PS122, in 1980. He had turned from poetry back to art, and at the show, he debuted the style that became his signature. He drew pictures of flying saucers shooting out light-rays, of penises being worshipped by crowds of people, of a baby that shone like a star. \u201cIt was so arresting,\u201d she said. \u201cImmediate.\u201d Street art was flourishing in New York. Tagging and graffiti art was part of the emerging hip-hop scene, which was mostly based uptown, in Harlem and the Bronx, but moved to the Lower East Side once rappers and taggers like Fab Five Freddy started mingling with downtown artists. Jean-Michel Basquiat, whose own SAMO tag began as a sort of on-wall manifesto poetry, wasn\u2019t a student at SVA, but would visit the college, invited by Scharf. Though Haring, Basquiat and Scharf were very different artists, all three were interested in making work outside galleries. Haring started tagging \u2013 he drew his tag, the radiant baby, next to existing graffiti, never over the top \u2013 and Basquiat was already doing so. All three were also interested in the risk and magic of making work without preparatory drawings, and Haring was the king of this. Lenore and Herb Schorr, collectors of both Basquiat and Haring, recall his ability to fill whatever space he needed to. \u201cHe was a phenomenon,\u201d says Lenore. \u201cHe would just get up in front of a wall and right from his head, no drawing, he would start working. It was unreal, his understanding. He saw the space and he filled it and it was beautiful and it was balanced, it had a rhythm.\u201d \u201cIt was more than that,\u201d says Tony Shafrazi, who became Haring\u2019s dealer. Being out and about drawing on walls led Haring to look at the streets differently. He noticed the small advertising spaces at subway stations. Whenever an old advert was removed, but before the new one was put up, the space was covered in black paper. Haring decided to draw on these blank canvases in chalk. \u201cHe was unbelievably quick,\u201d says Shafrazi. \u201cI went with him on a couple of the trips and he would spot a space, dart out and it would be done in minutes. He would go up one line, come back down; he went all over Manhattan like that, covering the place.\u201d An SVA friend, the photographer Tseng Kwong Chi, would come by a few hours later and take pictures of the chalk drawings before they were covered over or stolen. Haring was arrested a few times for this, but it just added to the street glamour (CBS\u2019s Sunday Morning did a piece on him, complete with convenient cop handcuffing him). People would stop and chat to him while he drew, and he made badges and handed them out. Robin Williams had one. So did Diane Keaton. At that time, Scharf and Haring shared an apartment, a huge two-storey loft near Bryant Park, filled with both of their work. But it quickly became tricky for Scharf, because Keith\u2019s work was becoming popular. Collectors came up to their apartment to buy a Haring and walked straight past Scharf\u2019s work. \u201cIt caused Kenny a lot of angst,\u201d remembers McEwen. \u201cWe all had ambitions of moving up, getting a bigger audience and money,\u201d says Scharf, \u201cbut when it happens, things change. It isn\u2019t so fun and simple as it was when we were each other\u2019s audience. There\u2019s other people\u2019s take on you, you\u2019re taken more seriously, then they\u2019re more critical, then there\u2019s jealousy. Before, you had a focal point of getting out there and creating, and then all of a sudden you have to deal with this machine that you wanted to be involved in, but that you didn\u2019t know anything about.\u201d Soon after, Haring decided he needed a dealer, and chose Shafrazi. In 1981, Haring moved in with McEwen, into her Broome Street railroad apartment, where there was no corridor, and each room led into another. At the start, McEwen\u2019s rooms were the kitchen and a bedroom, but that changed when Keith became romantically involved with a DJ called Juan Dubose, \u201cand it became clear that Juan needed access to the kitchen,\u201d says McEwen. Juan\u2019s contribution is underestimated,\u201d she says. \u201cHe did all the cooking for Keith, he sort of kept house so that Keith could work.\u201d With Dubose moving in, McEwen swapped rooms, but then she had to walk through Haring and Dubose\u2019s bedroom to get to the kitchen. So Haring bought a tent. \u201cJust a perfect-sized tent that was his and Juan\u2019s bed,\u201d says McEwen. \u201cI came back one day and there it was. With the TV right up against the door to the tent so they could watch it.\u201d Though neither was completely monogamous, Haring and Dubose were together for several years. They loved to dance, and became regulars at the Paradise Garage, where Larry Levan DJed. Haring adored the exhilaration and community at the club: when he became successful and had to travel around the world for his work, he would organise his schedule so that he would leave straight after a Saturday night at the Garage or return just before, \u201cso that I didn\u2019t miss any of my Garage time\u201d. Dancing was immensely important to him, as were the \u201ccute boys\u201d of the Garage, who were mostly black and Latino. Haring was attracted to non-white men. \u201cI\u2019m sure inside I\u2019m not white,\u201d he once wrote. In 1982, Shafrazi put on a solo Haring show. It was a huge success. Important art collectors mingled with Haring\u2019s downtown friends, plus graffiti artists and hip-hop DJs. From there, things really took off. Haring met Warhol and they became close. He went for dinner at Yoko Ono\u2019s, he hung out with David Bowie, Iggy Pop, William Burroughs, Robert Mapplethorpe. He already knew Madonna, from clubbing at Danceteria. He went to her wedding, and took Warhol as his guest. By 1984, Haring couldn\u2019t do the subway paintings any more, because people were stealing them as soon as they were up and putting them up for sale. Fake Harings started springing up; his style was much imitated, especially in Japan. In 1986, he set up his Pop Shop on Lafayette Street. He wanted the public to be able to access his real work, not just those with enough money to be able to buy one of his paintings. Popular culture accepted his art long before the establishment did. For Haring, the Pop Shop \u201cwas the ultimate in cutting them [the art establishment] out of the picture\u201d. Scharf remembers this. \u201cKeith was crucified for it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe art world likes to think: \u2018Oh, if you\u2019re doing things in a mass commercial way, you\u2019re dumbing it down for the masses.\u2019 Well, no. We\u2019re not dumbing things down, we\u2019re bringing people up. But the art world doesn\u2019t want to see people coming up.\u201d Haring often spoke eloquently about the notion of \u201cselling out\u201d. He turned down many offers of lucrative work: to license his art in Tokyo, to run a Macy\u2019s boutique, to paint a Hall &amp; Oates album cover, to advertise Kraft cheese and Dodge trucks. He accepted some, like Swatch and Absolut: those that offered a challenge. \u201cEver since there have been people waiting to buy things, I\u2019ve known that if I wanted to make things people would want, I could do it easily,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as you let that affect you, you\u2019ve lost everything.\u201d And he continued to work with graffiti artists, though he only went out tagging with them once; he felt stupid as the older white guy, like a chaperone. He didn\u2019t call himself a graffiti artist \u2013 in an Interview piece, he described what he did as drawing, rather than graffiti \u2013 but the media didn\u2019t listen. He talked to Rodriguez about it. \u201cKeith and I often discussed this,\u201d he says. \u201cI would say to him, You\u2019re not a graffiti artist. And he would say: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s the media, it\u2019s how they write it.\u2019 But we both knew that he was playing along with it, because it helped give rise to his success. The thing that people don\u2019t know is that his success also elevated us as well. There was this mutual understanding and agreement that he was really making headway for a lot of people. He was making street art acceptable.\u201d Dancer Bill T Jones believes that Keith tried to raise consciousness in general. \u201cEveryone knew his sexuality, he was very out, which was important,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd he would try and represent the young, underserved black and brown people of the streets, like the Central Park Five. The art world claimed to not know about such things \u2013 and its passivity, its silence was political \u2013 but because of the people he associated with, Keith was pulled into these issues.\u201d Jones worked with Haring on a number of occasions, including in the UK in 1983. For a show at the Robert Fraser gallery, Haring decided he would paint Jones\u2019s naked body and have Tseng take photographs. The painting took four-and-a-half hours, and when he was done, the press were invited in to do interviews. Jones remembers the whole event with affection, calling it both \u201cinnocent\u201d and \u201cbrazen\u201d. \u201cThat body-painting gave me power,\u201d he says. \u201cIt made one feel transformed, into a heightened consciousness, a special status, I was a moving sculpture.\u201d After this, Haring painted Grace Jones. Haring\u2019s horizons were expanding. He painted on the Berlin Wall, he worked with MTV. He was immensely popular: in 1986, he was the subject of more than 100 newspaper articles. But in the mid-1980s, as he was flying high with his career, back in New York, the carefree environment began to change. Aids swept through New York like a fire, \u201clike world war two,\u201d recalls Jones, whose dance and life partner Arnie Zane died of Aids-related lymphoma in 1988. \u201cAn entire generation was killed, it decimated a whole class of persons, the homosexual, creative people.\u201d McEwen got pregnant around this time and was required to take an HIV test. She had to take her blood sample to an abandoned car park, to a box-like structure that was set up away from people, and post the sample through a slot. Everyone was petrified of catching this new and terrible disease; no one knew quite how it was spreading. But spreading it was, and people were dying. \u201cPeople got sick and they\u2019d die in two weeks,\u201d says Scharf. \u201cRecently, I went to a friend\u2019s photography show and looked at a photo of us all, and everyone is no longer here and they\u2019ve been gone 30 years.\u201d \u201cYou had a kid, and you\u2019d look around for who could be godfather,\u201d says McEwen, \u201cand there was nobody left.\u201d Haring knew he was at risk \u2013 Dubose had been diagnosed HIV-positive. His friends were dying, including Bobby Breslau, a mentor who worked at Pop Shop. Haring was badly affected by Bobby\u2019s suffering, but was accepting of his own fate. He wrote about the possibility in his journals in March 1987. \u201cI am quite aware that I have or will have Aids,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe symptoms already exist\u2026 my days are numbered. Important to do as much as possible as quickly as possible. WORK IS ALL I HAVE AND ART IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN LIFE. I always knew, since I was young, that I would die young, But I thought it would be FAST (an accident), not a disease\u2026 time will tell but I am not scared. I live every day as if it were the last. I LOVE LIFE. I love babies and children and some people, most people, well maybe not most. But a lot of people\u2026\u201d In 1989, the year before his death, Haring did four shows. He set up the Keith Haring Foundation, which still exists today, working to support underprivileged children and HIV charities. And he did an interview with Rolling Stone. He said: \u201cNo matter how long you work, it\u2019s always going to end sometime. And there\u2019s always going to be things left undone\u2026 part of the reason that I\u2019m not having trouble facing the reality of death is that it\u2019s not a limitation, in a way. It could have happened any time, and it is going to happen sometime. If you live your life according to that, death is irrelevant. Everything I\u2019m doing right now is exactly what I want to do.\u201d Haring worked right up until two months before he died. Scharf was at his side when he was very ill. Haring was agitated, twitchy, with his eyes shut, and Scharf held him. \u201cI said: \u2018You can relax. Everything you\u2019ve done is going to keep going. You\u2019re going to continue.\u2019 And I felt him relax. I meant it. He started something really big, and I will always honour his legacy.\u201d Haring died on 16 February 1990. During his lifetime, he had almost 50 one-man shows. He painted 45 murals. Since his death, his foundation has supported hundreds of youth, community, art, LBGT, safe sex and planned-parenthood projects. His work is held by MoMA, the Whitney, the LA County Museum of Art, the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. And many, many people own a Keith Haring badge. The Keith Haring exhibition is at Tate Liverpool, 14 June-10 November",

He was the last gasp of a certain sort of liberal sense of community, before identity politics took over.</p> <p>We were very different. I\u2019m African American, I have 11 siblings, I\u2019m from a lower-income family. With Arnie Zane, I had my dance company, and James Carroll, who was a very progressive art teacher in Kutztown, had a programme of bringing out people from New York to his students. He told me about this young man, an artist with spatial, improvisational skills. Much like Picasso, he could very quickly fill a wall in one go, never use sketches and never have to go back over the work. That was Keith.</p> <p>And then Bill Katz was an \u00e9minence grise of the downtown art world. He saw a rehearsal of a piece that Arnie and I were doing called <em>Social Intercourse</em> and there was something about the flattened, abstract shapes we were making that reminded him of Keith\u2019s work. I contacted Keith and went to his studio and asked him if he might do a poster for <em>Social Intercourse</em> and within a week, he gave me three wonderful drawings. I don\u2019t have them now, they were all stolen.</p> <p>He was in a rather modest place in Broome Street with his companion Juan Dubose, from Dominica. We became friends. Keith was younger, with an arrested, boylike quality \u2013 an overgrown child, that temperament. He was very kind and generous and mischievous. And he was living a New York dream, being a young gay man. He loved brown-skinned people. Graffiti culture was blowing up. He was very much part of club culture, of high and low, that mix, which was the 1980s. His subway drawings were like a cinematic experience: as the train moved it seemed as though they were moving. It was an exciting time and he was exciting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b8156cc5aed02c932b287b8d6e7d37da30cc6d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b8156cc5aed02c932b287b8d6e7d37da30cc6d9/0_66_2848_1710/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keith Haring at work in 1986.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keith Haring at work in 1986.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patricia Steur/Sunshine/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I am of the generation before \u2013 when I was 17, I was at the 1969 Woodstock. I did not experience disco. I moved to New York in 1978, the club scene was the Mudd Club, CBGBs. It seemed white and middle-class to me. The question is always: who is writing the narrative? Keith was an anomaly. How had he found his place among the young black and Hispanic Bronx fabulousness?</p> <p>I remember he was on five covers of art magazines at the same time: <em>Art</em><em>forum</em>, <em>Art In America</em>, <em>A</em><em>RTnews </em>and two others, and that was it: people were not happy. But he aspired to be his two heroes, Walt Disney and Andy Warhol, he wanted to become a household name, to be intergenerational.</p> <p>He painted my body for a show at the Robert Fraser gallery in London.. We were rather innocent about it. It took four-and-a-half hours to paint me. Someone said: \u201cThe press is coming!\u201d, with an hour to go. But for a brazen, extroverted person as myself, that was not a problem. I was the only black person in the room, and I was being displayed. That says a lot about that era \u2013 there was a lack of awareness. It was a wild frontier, there was a certain excitement and naivete. He did Grace Jones after me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3236a73baa35fd9c4955c25cbf3b8730fa1b29ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3236a73baa35fd9c4955c25cbf3b8730fa1b29ad/381_130_292_365/292.jpg\" alt=\"Carlos Rodrigues\" width=\"292\" height=\"365\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Carlos Rodriguez (Mare139): <em><strong>\u2018</strong></em>Keith helped us realise that you could be street, but you could also commercialise your work\u2019</h2> <p><em>Graffiti artist and friend of Haring</em></p> <p>In the beginning, many of us were very suspicious of Keith and Jean-Michel and these so-called street artists, because in a way, they were co-opting this culture. The novelty of Keith and those surrounding him was different to the novelty of black and brown kids from uptown that were painting trains. If you\u2019re a white male\u2026 not to say if you\u2019re gay it\u2019s easier, but it\u2019s different to being a kid from the hood. But there was this mutual understanding and agreement with Keith, especially with those of us who were more artistically inclined and trying to navigate the next space off the streets, which was the galleries.</p> <p>We had a different need; there\u2019s a difference between surviving and succeeding in the gallery scene. But what was interesting was that Keith helped us realise that you could still be street, but you could also commercialise your work and sell in galleries.</p> <p>His impact is about self-empowerment \u2013 economically, culturally, politically. Artistically: how to run a studio, how to amplify a message, community service and activism. The Pop Shop inspired graffiti shops to open all over the world. He understood intellectual property, and being the brand, before many of us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2ec033dee3e72e35c8d48b17554437e40a5bb4dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ec033dee3e72e35c8d48b17554437e40a5bb4dd/6_16_508_635/400.jpg\" alt=\"Sam McEwen\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Samantha McEwen: <em>\u2018</em>He was very sexy and we were all in love with him, really... he was a remarkable, special person\u2019</h2> <p><em>Artist, classmate and friend of Haring</em><br></p> <p>Keith was exactly the same with everyone: with a mailman, a celebrity, with a child. He could talk to anyone, and he would talk to anyone. Especially children. He would stop everything for children. He was very sexy and we were all in love with him, really, just because he was such fun. He was a remarkable, special person and you felt it as soon as you met him. New York was empty at that time. You could move apartments very easily because, honestly, there weren\u2019t many people there. You\u2019d walk around at two in the morning and there would be nobody else around. And it was cheap. We had a friend who worked at an art store and we would pile our arms up with supplies, paper and materials and she would ring through $3. You could eat for $2.</p> <p>Club 57 was a centre for us. It was so small! Really not big, and Drew [Straub] would be on the door, with his blue hair \u2013 he knew who to let in. There was something different on every night and none of it was cool. Carmel [Johnson Schmidt] and I, because we were from Europe, sometimes we would be at the back just thinking: \u201cWhat <em>is</em> this?\u201d I remember a lot of dressing up, like a night where you had to dress as cowboys, or nuns. A mud-wrestling night, that was hilarious. And there would be performances, bands. Keith did performances there, and at some point Kenny would get on stage, always. John Sex, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06614db6a62c80ce6196e0cdde9077008d362d7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06614db6a62c80ce6196e0cdde9077008d362d7a/0_0_3568_2517/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled 1982\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Untitled 1982</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurent Strouk gallery, Paris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Keith had a show at PS122 and that was where I first saw the baby, the radiant baby. His shining baby. It popped out at you, and I remember thinking: \u201cAh, so that\u2019s gonna be your thing, your tag? A baby? Really?\u201d But it shows something about him \u2013 there\u2019s not many men that would choose to have their signature be a baby. He was always working, looking for an artistic language that he could really communicate in. A language that talked to other people, not just something he could work in. Graffiti artists were just talking to each other really \u2013 Keith wanted to involve everyone in a language that could discuss Roland Barthes or speak directly to a child.</p> <p>The art world never changes, it\u2019s still the same today. I think money focuses attention, if work is being bought, it brings attention. But outside the art world, I think Keith has changed things. People express themselves outside the establishment far more.When I went to his funeral, I travelled back with Tony [Shafrazi, Haring\u2019s agent] and he said: \u201cIt\u2019s very rare for an artist to be fully formed at 20, and to achieve so much in just a decade.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3d18e9e17ca376bdf817179292a27ed49e26df4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d18e9e17ca376bdf817179292a27ed49e26df4b/167_7_1625_2031/800.jpg\" alt=\"Kenny Scharf\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Kenny Scharf: \u2018I think of him often, and it\u2019s the fun and the joy I choose to remember\u2019</h2> <p><em>Painter, classmate and friend of Haring</em></p> <p>Keith was very much fun as a roommate, as someone to spend time with, go down to the coffee shop, the daily things. It was pretty easy in New York back then before cellphones or even answering machines\u2026 you just walked out the door and you didn\u2019t know where your day was gonna lead. A whole different vibe. Also, in order to have a conversation, you had to go out and meet in person. You need a communal place to hang out, you\u2019re not going to hang out in your closet. You need to go to the coffee shop or the club or the stoop.</p> <p>Usually when I think about Keith, I think about the fun. Something simple like buzzing him in downstairs when I lived in the East Village, opening the door and there he would be. I was just so happy to have him around me. That\u2019s what I choose to remember. A lot of interviews want to know about when he died, and I was by his side and it\u2019s very hard for me, you relive it every time. I think of him often, and it\u2019s the fun and the joy. He was just the most wonderful friend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"80efbe425e0a23ee385f8c379ee83c7898caf5e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80efbe425e0a23ee385f8c379ee83c7898caf5e0/1219_222_1166_1457/800.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Shafrazi\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Shafrazi</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick McMullan/Patrick McMullan via Getty Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Tony Shafrazi: \u2018He was like a whirling dervish \u2013 an extremely athletic body, very elongated\u2019</h2> <p><em>Gallerist who became Haring\u2019s dealer</em></p> <p>I came to New York and opened a gallery. I ripped everything out of the apartment where I lived and turned that into a gallery. I knew all the artists and Bill Beckley, a wonderful photo-narrative artist. I was beginning to show him, and he said if I needed someone to paint the walls he could bring a student. And that\u2019s how Keith came, to paint the walls. I noticed his way of working: very disciplined and remarkable energy. And also, when he finished work, he washed all the brushes and put them in a very organised row. I was impressed. More importantly, he didn\u2019t hang around, which everybody does, to beg for a show. </p> <p>With the subway drawings, he was so fast. There was never any need for preparation. I\u2019ve never known any artist to do this. He was like a whirling dervish \u2013 an extremely athletic body, very elongated \u2013 and he was constantly driven. It was not only the ability to scale, but even knowing where the line goes with nothing \u2013 no preparatory sketch, no notation, no slide projection on to a wall of a smaller image. It was so direct, just drawing head-on, stark. They didn\u2019t know how to describe it so they called it graffiti, but it wasn\u2019t. Different images, different identities, different narratives, different symbolism applied to narrative\u2026 it was much more complex.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d09f7533369165a804a4f5ceec43b6216cb72b86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d09f7533369165a804a4f5ceec43b6216cb72b86/0_151_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Haring with his Berlin Wall mural in 1986.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Haring with his Berlin Wall mural in 1986.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elke Bruhn-Hoffmann/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He would get up early in the morning, take a shower, a bunch of chalks in his pocket. I went with him a number of times. Every time the subway train would stop, he would look left and right to see if there were panels, and if there were two or three he would jump out and start drawing very, very quickly. Finish one, the next one, the next one. All the way to Harlem, about 50 stops, doing two or three drawings every stop. And then on the way back on a different route, all way to Queens, New Jersey, all around. Some lasted a few days, some a month. Thousands of these drawings.</p> <p>He was very aware of the traffic of life, and acting within it. Instead of feeling like an outsider, he saw public life as real life. He realised that very few of those millions of people travelling, hardly 1% went to a museum. The other component was to do with children. All this extraordinary energy that he had really related to children. Because he was like a child himself: wide open, ready to learn. Instead of having an ego problem like many artists, he was like a sponge. When he was working outside, everyone would watch him, because he was so concentrated, he brought such strong energy. He befriended many people while working outside publicly, on the streets.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bill T Jones: \u2018Much like Picasso, he could very quickly fill a wall in one go, and never use sketches or have to go back\u2019 Dancer and friend of Haring Keith in the 1980s was an amazing phenomenon. He was the last gasp of a certain sort of liberal sense of community, before identity politics took over. We were very different. I\u2019m African American, I have 11 siblings, I\u2019m from a lower-income family. With Arnie Zane, I had my dance company, and James Carroll, who was a very progressive art teacher in Kutztown, had a programme of bringing out people from New York to his students. He told me about this young man, an artist with spatial, improvisational skills. Much like Picasso, he could very quickly fill a wall in one go, never use sketches and never have to go back over the work. That was Keith. And then Bill Katz was an \u00e9minence grise of the downtown art world. He saw a rehearsal of a piece that Arnie and I were doing called Social Intercourse and there was something about the flattened, abstract shapes we were making that reminded him of Keith\u2019s work. I contacted Keith and went to his studio and asked him if he might do a poster for Social Intercourse and within a week, he gave me three wonderful drawings. I don\u2019t have them now, they were all stolen. He was in a rather modest place in Broome Street with his companion Juan Dubose, from Dominica. We became friends. Keith was younger, with an arrested, boylike quality \u2013 an overgrown child, that temperament. He was very kind and generous and mischievous. And he was living a New York dream, being a young gay man. He loved brown-skinned people. Graffiti culture was blowing up. He was very much part of club culture, of high and low, that mix, which was the 1980s. His subway drawings were like a cinematic experience: as the train moved it seemed as though they were moving. It was an exciting time and he was exciting. I am of the generation before \u2013 when I was 17, I was at the 1969 Woodstock. I did not experience disco. I moved to New York in 1978, the club scene was the Mudd Club, CBGBs. It seemed white and middle-class to me. The question is always: who is writing the narrative? Keith was an anomaly. How had he found his place among the young black and Hispanic Bronx fabulousness? I remember he was on five covers of art magazines at the same time: Artforum, Art In America, ARTnews and two others, and that was it: people were not happy. But he aspired to be his two heroes, Walt Disney and Andy Warhol, he wanted to become a household name, to be intergenerational. He painted my body for a show at the Robert Fraser gallery in London.. We were rather innocent about it. It took four-and-a-half hours to paint me. Someone said: \u201cThe press is coming!\u201d, with an hour to go. But for a brazen, extroverted person as myself, that was not a problem. I was the only black person in the room, and I was being displayed. That says a lot about that era \u2013 there was a lack of awareness. It was a wild frontier, there was a certain excitement and naivete. He did Grace Jones after me. Carlos Rodriguez (Mare139): \u2018Keith helped us realise that you could be street, but you could also commercialise your work\u2019 Graffiti artist and friend of Haring In the beginning, many of us were very suspicious of Keith and Jean-Michel and these so-called street artists, because in a way, they were co-opting this culture. The novelty of Keith and those surrounding him was different to the novelty of black and brown kids from uptown that were painting trains. If you\u2019re a white male\u2026 not to say if you\u2019re gay it\u2019s easier, but it\u2019s different to being a kid from the hood. But there was this mutual understanding and agreement with Keith, especially with those of us who were more artistically inclined and trying to navigate the next space off the streets, which was the galleries. We had a different need; there\u2019s a difference between surviving and succeeding in the gallery scene. But what was interesting was that Keith helped us realise that you could still be street, but you could also commercialise your work and sell in galleries. His impact is about self-empowerment \u2013 economically, culturally, politically. Artistically: how to run a studio, how to amplify a message, community service and activism. The Pop Shop inspired graffiti shops to open all over the world. He understood intellectual property, and being the brand, before many of us. Samantha McEwen: \u2018He was very sexy and we were all in love with him, really... he was a remarkable, special person\u2019 Artist, classmate and friend of Haring Keith was exactly the same with everyone: with a mailman, a celebrity, with a child. He could talk to anyone, and he would talk to anyone. Especially children. He would stop everything for children. He was very sexy and we were all in love with him, really, just because he was such fun. He was a remarkable, special person and you felt it as soon as you met him. New York was empty at that time. You could move apartments very easily because, honestly, there weren\u2019t many people there. You\u2019d walk around at two in the morning and there would be nobody else around. And it was cheap. We had a friend who worked at an art store and we would pile our arms up with supplies, paper and materials and she would ring through $3. You could eat for $2. Club 57 was a centre for us. It was so small! Really not big, and Drew [Straub] would be on the door, with his blue hair \u2013 he knew who to let in. There was something different on every night and none of it was cool. Carmel [Johnson Schmidt] and I, because we were from Europe, sometimes we would be at the back just thinking: \u201cWhat is this?\u201d I remember a lot of dressing up, like a night where you had to dress as cowboys, or nuns. A mud-wrestling night, that was hilarious. And there would be performances, bands. Keith did performances there, and at some point Kenny would get on stage, always. John Sex, too. Keith had a show at PS122 and that was where I first saw the baby, the radiant baby. His shining baby. It popped out at you, and I remember thinking: \u201cAh, so that\u2019s gonna be your thing, your tag? A baby? Really?\u201d But it shows something about him \u2013 there\u2019s not many men that would choose to have their signature be a baby. He was always working, looking for an artistic language that he could really communicate in. A language that talked to other people, not just something he could work in. Graffiti artists were just talking to each other really \u2013 Keith wanted to involve everyone in a language that could discuss Roland Barthes or speak directly to a child. The art world never changes, it\u2019s still the same today. I think money focuses attention, if work is being bought, it brings attention. But outside the art world, I think Keith has changed things. People express themselves outside the establishment far more.When I went to his funeral, I travelled back with Tony [Shafrazi, Haring\u2019s agent] and he said: \u201cIt\u2019s very rare for an artist to be fully formed at 20, and to achieve so much in just a decade.\u201d Kenny Scharf: \u2018I think of him often, and it\u2019s the fun and the joy I choose to remember\u2019 Painter, classmate and friend of Haring Keith was very much fun as a roommate, as someone to spend time with, go down to the coffee shop, the daily things. It was pretty easy in New York back then before cellphones or even answering machines\u2026 you just walked out the door and you didn\u2019t know where your day was gonna lead. A whole different vibe. Also, in order to have a conversation, you had to go out and meet in person. You need a communal place to hang out, you\u2019re not going to hang out in your closet. You need to go to the coffee shop or the club or the stoop. Usually when I think about Keith, I think about the fun. Something simple like buzzing him in downstairs when I lived in the East Village, opening the door and there he would be. I was just so happy to have him around me. That\u2019s what I choose to remember. A lot of interviews want to know about when he died, and I was by his side and it\u2019s very hard for me, you relive it every time. I think of him often, and it\u2019s the fun and the joy. He was just the most wonderful friend. Tony Shafrazi: \u2018He was like a whirling dervish \u2013 an extremely athletic body, very elongated\u2019 Gallerist who became Haring\u2019s dealer I came to New York and opened a gallery. I ripped everything out of the apartment where I lived and turned that into a gallery. I knew all the artists and Bill Beckley, a wonderful photo-narrative artist. I was beginning to show him, and he said if I needed someone to paint the walls he could bring a student. And that\u2019s how Keith came, to paint the walls. I noticed his way of working: very disciplined and remarkable energy. And also, when he finished work, he washed all the brushes and put them in a very organised row. I was impressed. More importantly, he didn\u2019t hang around, which everybody does, to beg for a show. With the subway drawings, he was so fast. There was never any need for preparation. I\u2019ve never known any artist to do this. He was like a whirling dervish \u2013 an extremely athletic body, very elongated \u2013 and he was constantly driven. It was not only the ability to scale, but even knowing where the line goes with nothing \u2013 no preparatory sketch, no notation, no slide projection on to a wall of a smaller image. It was so direct, just drawing head-on, stark. They didn\u2019t know how to describe it so they called it graffiti, but it wasn\u2019t. Different images, different identities, different narratives, different symbolism applied to narrative\u2026 it was much more complex. He would get up early in the morning, take a shower, a bunch of chalks in his pocket. I went with him a number of times. Every time the subway train would stop, he would look left and right to see if there were panels, and if there were two or three he would jump out and start drawing very, very quickly. Finish one, the next one, the next one. All the way to Harlem, about 50 stops, doing two or three drawings every stop. And then on the way back on a different route, all way to Queens, New Jersey, all around. Some lasted a few days, some a month. Thousands of these drawings. He was very aware of the traffic of life, and acting within it. Instead of feeling like an outsider, he saw public life as real life. He realised that very few of those millions of people travelling, hardly 1% went to a museum. The other component was to do with children. All this extraordinary energy that he had really related to children. Because he was like a child himself: wide open, ready to learn. Instead of having an ego problem like many artists, he was like a sponge. When he was working outside, everyone would watch him, because he was so concentrated, he brought such strong energy. He befriended many people while working outside publicly, on the streets.",

They\u2019re still going to sell out crowds because there are so many people in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area that support them. But it\u2019s not going to make a difference for the city of Oakland.\u201d</p> <p>Glover was able to attend a few games this season, but he doesn\u2019t foresee that happening when the team moves to San Francisco. \u201cThe [ticket] prices are going to go up,\u201d he said. \u201cYou got people in the higher class of living who are going to buy the tickets, so there aren\u2019t going to be too many people who can afford to go.

      "bodyText": "In the days leading up to the final series of professional basketball in Oakland, the yellow and blue of the city\u2019s beloved home team, the Golden State Warriors, shone from every corner. But in just a few weeks, Oakland will no longer be able to call the Warriors its own. When this season ends, the team will make the move across the bay to the $1bn Chase Center in San Francisco. The Warriors leave behind Oracle Arena, their home for the past 47 years, and a stalwart fanbase all too familiar with being left behind in an ever-changing world. With San Francisco as the epicenter of a tech-wealth earthquake that struck the cities of this region in disproportionate ways, it\u2019s hard for some longtime Oakland residents to not feel some resentment. After all, they loved the Warriors when no one gave them a second glance. Now, at the height of their success, they move across the bay to El Dorado. The fervor that usually accompanies the Warriors\u2019 championship runs feels tempered in Oakland this time around; the excitement joined with a dash of melancholy and unease. But this is also a city that loves deeply and, at times, unreasonably. And Oakland will cheer for its home team. The feet of millions of Golden State Warriors fans have paraded through the Coliseum Bart station over the years, but come next year, no longer. Construction has left the spartan interior half-gutted and chaotic, dust swirling around the large Steph Curry ads splashed on the walls. In the hours before tipoff for game 1 of the finals, the workers shoveling dirt near the fare gates accounted for the majority of the activity. Byron Glover sat a level above the noise on the platform, a bright Golden State cap propped upon his head and a pragmatic outlook for the team he has followed almost his entire life. An extravagant championship ring flashed in the place of where a wedding band would typically be situated. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad thing,\u201d the 56-year-old East Oakland resident said of the move. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to have support from the people of Oakland, but they\u2019re going to have a new facility, new friends, different fans. They\u2019re still going to sell out crowds because there are so many people in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area that support them. But it\u2019s not going to make a difference for the city of Oakland.\u201d Glover was able to attend a few games this season, but he doesn\u2019t foresee that happening when the team moves to San Francisco. \u201cThe [ticket] prices are going to go up,\u201d he said. \u201cYou got people in the higher class of living who are going to buy the tickets, so there aren\u2019t going to be too many people who can afford to go. There are a lot of people who are retired, season ticket holders, who don\u2019t have nothing to do. The middle class, we still have to work for the same money, pay our bills, and all that.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s giving up on the Warriors. \u201cWe still got to go with the flow,\u201d Glover said. \u201cYou been a fan for years, not just getting on the bandwagon, following the Warriors when they just started winning. You got to remember they weren\u2019t always winning. You\u2019re a real Warriors fan.\u201d He continued: \u201cA lot of people will say, \u2018Oh, forget the Warriors, they\u2019re going to San Francisco.\u2019 Well, they came from San Francisco. It\u2019s just too bad for the city of Oakland. It\u2019s just like the Raiders,\u201d the Oakland NFL team headed for Las Vegas. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing. That\u2019s how it goes. That\u2019s life.\u201d On game days, Tony Scott represents, sporting a bright yellow Warriors shirt under his Marriott bellhop uniform. For 36 years, the 58-year-old has worked at the Oakland Marriott City Center, in the same building as the Warriors headquarters, sharing the space with the team he\u2019s cheered for since 1975. \u201cWhen they were not good, I had people upstairs that would give me tickets,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that they\u2019re good, they pass by like it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business. They\u2019re a great team so everybody\u2019s on the bandwagon.\u201d Scott laughed. \u201cOh, you\u2019ll like this story. I can\u2019t say what year it was, but there was one year, the Celtics, and [their player] Ray Allen, you heard of him? Around 7.30, I said, \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 And he said, \u2018I\u2019m going to play golf. I\u2019m playing the Warriors.\u2019 The next night, he said, \u2018I\u2019ll be in bed. I\u2019m playing the Lakers. I\u2019m playing Kobe [Bryant].\u2019 Look how far we come! \u201cThere was a time when teams would come here and say it was an opportunity to show how good their players were because they were playing the Warriors. That\u2019s over. The Warriors are one of the best teams and they play together.\u201d Scott knows the games will only be a trip across the bay away, if he can afford tickets. But he can\u2019t help but wonder whether Oakland should have leveraged the presence of the Warriors more to create jobs and opportunities for more people. \u201cBefore they decided to go over to San Francisco, we had an opportunity to build,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing at the Coliseum. You go over to San Francisco, if I\u2019m married, I have the opportunity to have my wife come watch the game for a minute, maybe do some shopping, there\u2019s Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. There\u2019s things to do. That\u2019s why they\u2019re going to San Francisco.\u201d Hats line the shelves at the back of a small space in Old Oakland known as BOSK. The apparel store is one of the few that stocks wares emblazoned with \u201cThe Town\u201d, a proud nickname to rival \u201cThe City\u201d of San Francisco. The Warriors have sported the name on their jerseys in recent years, a gesture for East Bay fans after news of the team\u2019s move broke. Picking up a hat labeled \u201cOakland Warriors\u201d, a customer lamented: \u201cThey were never called this, were they?\u201d The team had represented The Town for four decades, and their fans had turned Oracle Area into \u201cRoaracle\u201d. But after leaving San Francisco in 1971, they didn\u2019t take their new city\u2019s name and instead became the Golden State. She bought the hat anyway. The store manager, Saaliahah Mays, says a lot of people have come looking for the Oakland merchandise to hold on to their team despite the move. \u201cWe all want to make sure that we have something that lasts. That represents that they were a part of our community at some point in time,\u201d she says. For Mays, an Oakland native who says she is not hugely into sports, the move has been bittersweet. The team has had a marked effect on the area, offering not just local pride but also community service. That will continue after their departure: the team\u2019s old practice space will be devoted to youth camps and not-for-profit organizations. Still, with the team\u2019s move to wealthy San Francisco, \u201cI feel like we are taking two L\u2019s,\u201d Mays says. \u201cIt was the same thing with the Raiders.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s deep,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we just have to roll with it. They still represent the Bay Area \u2013 we are still a part of it.\u201d After this season, the Oakland Warriors merch will be phased out. The store, Mays says, will still sell Golden State merch. \u201cWe are still going to support them,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut for right now, we are trying to keep it at home for as much as we can\u201d. Cafe Van Kleef in downtown Oakland is not a sports bar, but it\u2019s an Oakland bar, and the years that the proprietors weren\u2019t arguing with their cable company, they made a point to pull down the big screen and show the championship games. But next year? When the Warriors are in San Francisco? Will the bar air the games then? \u201cProbably,\u201d a bartender, Rick Eggers, answered at first. He\u2019s been a Warriors fan since he arrived in Oakland in 1989, and it\u2019s hard to just cut those ties. But he\u2019s also Oakland, through and through. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Warriors fan, I\u2019ve been to all their games, and now that they\u2019re leaving, I\u2019m not going to their games any more,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I want to see them win in Oakland once more before they leave.\u201d The dark, eclectic bar that specializes in fresh-squeezed greyhound cocktails was lively the afternoon before game 1 of the finals, with regulars filing in and greeting Eggers by name. He mulled the question as he helped out each patron along the bar. \u201cI think it\u2019s sad for the people who bought season tickets all these years and can\u2019t afford it there,\u201d he said after a beat. \u201cThey were from San Francisco so I understand it and all, but it hurts to see them go.\u201d \u201cSan Francisco, they want everything,\u201d a woman hollered from a few seats down. \u201cWe\u2019re going to miss them here,\u201d Eggers said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to miss us more,\u201d the woman retorted. \u201cThere are just some things money can\u2019t buy.\u201d So would the bar show a Warriors championship game, even after the move to San Francisco? Within 15 seconds after his first answer, Eggers had changed his mind from \u201cprobably\u201d to \u201cprobably not\u201d to a strong \u201cI doubt it\u201d. \u201cThey abandoned us,\u201d Eggers said. \u201cThey abandoned Oakland. And I\u2019m an Oakland person. I\u2019m sticking to Oakland.\u201d",

This groundbreaking event will feature a keynote from the award-winning Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, interventions from Dominic Grieve, Joanna Cherry and Stephen Kinnock, and a speech \u2013 with Q&amp;A \u2013 from Lord Neuberger, until recently Britain\u2019s most senior judge.

You have no idea whether the dish you\u2019ve ordered is going to be on target or far out in the deep, storm-lashed sea. You can eat well here, in a way which will make you coo and purr. Or the meal can leave you with aching eyeballs from all the rolling. Inconsistent doesn\u2019t quite cover it. At times it feels as if there are two kitchens back there. Cross your fingers and hope you get food prepared by the good one.</p> <p>That inconsistency extends to the service. When eating there everything is as it should be: attentive in all the right places, but good at disappearing when it\u2019s clear we\u2019re fine as we are. The problem lies with gaining entry to that room. With online booking you trade the intimacy of a conversation with a human being, for immediacy, precision and convenience. Here, when I attempt to book a table, the computer tells me that I don\u2019t have a booking yet; that they\u2019ll confirm within 48 hours. WTF? I want to know now. Actually, I need to know now. Because if you aren\u2019t going to give me a table, I\u2019ll need to book somewhere else. I don\u2019t have two days to spare waiting to find out.</p> <p>The website tells me that if I need to speak to someone urgently, I should email. Eh? I already have that relationship with my bank; I don\u2019t want it with a restaurant. I try phoning the number on the site. Across 24 hours I try five times, and only ever get an answer machine. Eventually, 28 hours after my first enquiry, I\u2019m told I have my table. Charmed, I\u2019m sure.</p> <p>Of course, when I get there, the huge, ballroom-like space is close to empty. Happening beats which I really wish were not happening at all ricochet off the high ceilings. There are banquettes along the walls and blocks of curving booths down the middle of the room, overhung by the kind of globe lights that are used to illuminate the pathways to student halls of residence. All of it looks like it could be de-installed and shoved in the back of a truck within 90 minutes if the hotel management finally decides none of this was a good idea. There are moments when I wish they would reach this conclusion soon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30bd072b5d3fb6cbdeb95968e4254b39b72381e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30bd072b5d3fb6cbdeb95968e4254b39b72381e3/365_401_4735_3287/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Crunchy and thrilling\u2019: sweet-salty pickled cherry tomatoes, silverskin onions, cauliflower florets and candy-pink radishes with wild garlic butter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Crunchy and thrilling\u2019: sweet-salty pickled cherry tomatoes, silverskin onions, cauliflower florets and candy-pink radishes with wild garlic butter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Soak gets its name from an on-trend interest in pickling, fermenting, brining and the like. At first, when they deliver us a plate of sweet-salty pickled cherry tomatoes, silverskin onions, cauliflower florets and candy-pink sliced radishes I am optimistic. They are crunchy and thrilling without being wince-inducing. It feels like a declaration of intent. The problem is that the kitchen, led by former Tom Aikens chef Chris Zachwieja, doesn\u2019t quite follow through on those pickles. From here on in, everything is understated.</p> <p>Still, there really are some great dishes and let\u2019s for the moment pretend we were served just those. From the list headed <a href=\"https://www.thesoak.co.uk/media/1084/soak-dinner.pdf\" title=\"\">\u201cJars, cured &amp; pickled\u201d</a> comes a dice of cured venison with a pleasing bite and intensity as if it got halfway to jerky and changed its mind. There are splodges of cured egg yolk and, across the top, a few peppery nasturtium petals. From the same list, lamb belly fritters with a black garlic mayo are a huge hit of meaty lanolin. Some on my table find them completely overwhelming. They point out that this kind of high flavour is why we started serving lamb with mint sauce. I find them irresistible and finish off everybody else\u2019s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d68411ffb3735e2da8ee1419a5b33b9aeed1806c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d68411ffb3735e2da8ee1419a5b33b9aeed1806c/0_0_5384_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A pleasing bite and intensity\u2019: cured venison, cured egg yolk and nasturtium petals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"695\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A pleasing bite and intensity\u2019: cured venison, cured egg yolk and nasturtium petals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From a list headed \u201cPlants &amp; garden\u201d there is a silky cauliflower soup, bobbing with gnocchi flavoured with Comt\u00e9 cheese, and a dish of smoked kohlrabi laid on a bold pea-green risotto of spelt. From the large plates there is a meaty roasted wood pigeon, served pink, in a deep glossy jus with ribbons of fermented mooli. It doesn\u2019t need the bullying pickled anchovies. Very few things do. We finish with a bright, sharp lemon tart with buttery biscuit base \u2013 I know what I did there \u2013 and a masterful dark chocolate and honeycomb baked Alaska which deserves and gets all our attention. And with that we went home and everything was lovely.</p> <p>Except it wasn\u2019t, was it? So, let\u2019s go right back to the beginning. A salad of cider-pickled eggs with hazelnuts and chicory is a grim reminder of 1970s pub food when a boiled egg salad was considered classy. The pickling of the eggs, the only thing which might have made it interesting, is meagre and insipid. Hot and sour pickled prawns with a lime and carrot salad reads beautifully. That\u2019s the only thing it does. It is a dull plate of crunchy, rubbery things. If you\u2019re going to use words like hot and sour, they\u2019d better be. They aren\u2019t.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f965e7417a431bfc447027fde1b966731ed98e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f965e7417a431bfc447027fde1b966731ed98e1/186_285_4278_3090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It deserves and gets all our attention\u2019: a masterful dark chocolate and honeycomb baked Alaska.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"722\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It deserves and gets all our attention\u2019: a masterful dark chocolate and honeycomb baked Alaska.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A plate of tomatoes with basil fregola looks exactly like the spelt dish, but is floppy and underseasoned. The \u201caubergine tempura\u201d pieces on top deserve to be inside quotation marks. They are an insult to deep frying. They haven\u2019t so much been battered as incarcerated, and leak oil as we bite in. A flavourless fillet of cured trout has a crisped skin, but nothing further to recommend it. Everything else on the plate \u2013 the ribbons of fennel, the torched cucumber, the gob of spittle-foam dribbled hither and yon \u2013 is equally bland and uninspiring. It feels like the cook responsible for the pigeon dish popped outside for a fag while this one was being knocked up.</p> <p>Finally, there is a failed rhubarb souffl\u00e9. It looks like a cupcake tucked away in a ramekin for its own safety. (I\u2019m now posting the pictures I took during my meal as a memory jogger, over on Instagram under <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jayrayner1/?hl=en\" title=\"\">@jayrayner1</a>, if you fancy taking a look). Amazingly, it manages to be slightly better than what they call a rum baba: a dense, collapsed, swamp of substandard sponge in a puddle of vaguely coconut-flavoured water, like something that has wept from a wound. Lumps of roasted pineapple loiter like witnesses at a crime scene.</p> <p>I find it extraordinary that the same kitchen which produced the glorious baked Alaska, with its glazed peaks and chocolate hit, could also be responsible for one of the worst desserts I have ever been served. For the money spent, which is significant, the whole experience is deeply unsatisfactory. But it\u2019s also something else: it\u2019s just seriously, inexplicably weird. And that is what sums up the Soak.</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>Another place with a developed interest in curing, pickling and fermenting is <a href=\"https://www.bytheriverbrew.co/trakol/\">Tr\u00e4kol</a>, the restaurant of the By The River Brew Co, on the Gateshead side of the Tyne.

That may be wise. Another study by the <a href=\"https://www.rsph.org.uk/\">Royal Society for Public Health</a> found that 62% of hospitality workers don\u2019t feel looked after by their employers; 74% have suffered verbal abuse and 24% have required medical or psychological help.</p> <p>In brighter news, <a href=\"https://www.ncclondon.ac.uk/hackney\">New City College</a> in London\u2019s Hackney is opening a caf\u00e9 and restaurant on its campus, specifically designed to give catering students hands-on experience of the industry.

For the money spent, which is significant, the whole experience is deeply unsatisfactory. But it\u2019s also something else: it\u2019s just seriously, inexplicably weird. And that is what sums up the Soak. News bites Another place with a developed interest in curing, pickling and fermenting is Tr\u00e4kol, the restaurant of the By The River Brew Co, on the Gateshead side of the Tyne. Try cured North Sea trout with fried curry leaf and yogurt, the soy pickled egg with cream cheese and togarashi and, best of all, the middle white pig feasting plate, including half a roasted head plus a 1kg chop, yours for \u00a350 (bytheriverbrew.co). Research released by caterer.com has found that 97% of school pupils and those leaving education have \u201cwritten off\u201d the idea of working in the hospitality industry. That may be wise. Another study by the Royal Society for Public Health found that 62% of hospitality workers don\u2019t feel looked after by their employers; 74% have suffered verbal abuse and 24% have required medical or psychological help. In brighter news, New City College in London\u2019s Hackney is opening a caf\u00e9 and restaurant on its campus, specifically designed to give catering students hands-on experience of the industry. OKN1, short for open kitchen and its postcode, starts trading this month and will serve a \u2018modern European\u2019 menu.

A light, daily sunscreen that won\u2019t clog pores</h2> <p>When people admit they don\u2019t wear sunscreen I try hard to wear my non-judgmental face. Inside, however, I am aghast. I wear it indoors, outdoors, right through the year. Most women of colour do not use sunscreen because we have been indoctrinated to believe that: \u2018Black don\u2019t burn.\u2019 My response is: \u2018It does and it will.\u2019 Regardless of race, everyone needs sunscreen. Many indulge in the best serums and face-changers but, without sun protection, it\u2019s a waste of time. A decent sunscreen protects your skin from premature ageing and pigmentation issues and, yes, skin cancer. Still, I do understand the reluctance to use sunscreen. It has a terrible reputation for being heavy and unyielding in texture, clogging pores and leaving an unattractive white tinge that makes you look like Casper the (un)Friendly Ghost. I have tried hundreds of sunscreens and Coola stands out as one of the best. I recommend it so often you\u2019d think I had shares in the company (I don\u2019t). It is organic, non-greasy, rich in antioxidants, protects against both UVA (anti-ageing) and UVB (anti-burn) rays and won\u2019t leave you ashy or with breakouts. Additionally, it deeply moisturisers the skin, gives you a glow and is light enough to use every day. Which I do. And I am evangelical about it. Try it and you will be, too.<br><em>Coola Sport Face SPF 50, \u00a330, <a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/coola\">cultbeauty.co.uk</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ba71e7fe1c5f89f195de7f4b52769b65b072ae3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba71e7fe1c5f89f195de7f4b52769b65b072ae3b/485_460_1519_2040/745.jpg\" alt=\"Gucci lipstick\" width=\"745\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gucci lipstick</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cosimo Sereni/no credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>On my radar...

But they\u2019ve grown on me because they are a great way to wear eye colour, sans skills. Things to remember: good lash primers separate and condition lashes (which stops them going crispy), deeper shades (particularly burgundy) are more wearable and while fluoro pink is a great way for people to find you in the dark, in a grown-up meeting it\u2019s just distracting. 1.

A light, daily sunscreen that won\u2019t clog pores When people admit they don\u2019t wear sunscreen I try hard to wear my non-judgmental face. Inside, however, I am aghast. I wear it indoors, outdoors, right through the year. Most women of colour do not use sunscreen because we have been indoctrinated to believe that: \u2018Black don\u2019t burn.\u2019 My response is: \u2018It does and it will.\u2019 Regardless of race, everyone needs sunscreen. Many indulge in the best serums and face-changers but, without sun protection, it\u2019s a waste of time. A decent sunscreen protects your skin from premature ageing and pigmentation issues and, yes, skin cancer. Still, I do understand the reluctance to use sunscreen. It has a terrible reputation for being heavy and unyielding in texture, clogging pores and leaving an unattractive white tinge that makes you look like Casper the (un)Friendly Ghost. I have tried hundreds of sunscreens and Coola stands out as one of the best. I recommend it so often you\u2019d think I had shares in the company (I don\u2019t). It is organic, non-greasy, rich in antioxidants, protects against both UVA (anti-ageing) and UVB (anti-burn) rays and won\u2019t leave you ashy or with breakouts. Additionally, it deeply moisturisers the skin, gives you a glow and is light enough to use every day. Which I do. And I am evangelical about it. Try it and you will be, too.

      "body": "<p>Esther Earl never meant to tweet after she died. On 25 August 2010, the 16-year-old internet vlogger died after a four-year battle with thyroid cancer. In her early teens, Esther had gained a loyal following online, where she posted about her love of Harry Potter, and her illness. Then, on 18 February 2011 \u2013 six months after her death \u2013 Esther posted a message on her Twitter account, @crazycrayon.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s currently Friday, January 14 of the year 2010. just wanted to say: I seriously hope that I\u2019m alive when this posts,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/crazycrayon/status/38450467637964800\" title=\"\">she wrote</a>, adding an emoji of a smiling face in sunglasses. Her mother, Lori Earl from Massachusetts, tells me Esther\u2019s online friends were \u201cfreaked out\u201d by the tweet.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d say they found her tweet jarring because it was unexpected,\u201d she says. Earl doesn\u2019t know which service her daughter used to schedule the tweet a year in advance, but believes it was intended for herself, not for loved ones after her death. \u201cShe hoped she would receive her own messages \u2026 [it showed] her hopes and longings to still be living, to hold on to life.\u201d</p> <p>Although Esther did not intend her tweet to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/23/artificial-intelligence-digital-immortality-mit-ryerson\" title=\"\">posthumous message</a> for her family, a host of services now encourage people to plan their online afterlives. Want to post on social media and communicate with your friends after death? There are lots of apps for that! <a href=\"https://medium.com/@replika/three-myths-about-replika-7717c2d2237\" title=\"\">Replika</a> and <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-to-become-virtually-immortal\" title=\"\">Eternime</a> are artificially intelligent chatbots that can imitate your speech for loved ones after you die; <a href=\"https://www.gonenotgone.com/Signup/presignup\" title=\"\">GoneNotGone</a> enables you to send emails from the grave; and DeadSocial\u2019s \u201cgoodbye tool\u201d allows you to \u201ctell your friends and family that you have died\u201d. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/feb/16/black-mirror-vegas-penguins-spy-huddle\" title=\"\">season two, episode one of Black Mirror</a>, a young woman recreates her dead boyfriend as an artificial intelligence \u2013 what was once the subject of a dystopian 44-minute fantasy is nearing reality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba112bb34a80fe35451fcaa9c48a21e34b5c551b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba112bb34a80fe35451fcaa9c48a21e34b5c551b/0_0_3729_2486/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Esther Earl at home in 2010 \u2026 before she died, she arranged for emails to be sent to her imagined future self.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Esther Earl at home in 2010 \u2026 before she died, she arranged for emails to be sent to her imagined future self.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boston Globe via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But although Charlie Brooker portrayed the digital afterlife as something twisted, in reality online legacies can be comforting for the bereaved. Esther Earl used a service called FutureMe to send emails to herself, stating that her parents should read them if she died. Three months after Esther\u2019s death, her mother received one of these emails. \u201cThey were seismically powerful,\u201d she says. \u201cThat letter made us weep, but also brought us great comfort \u2013 I think because of its intentionality, the fact that she was thinking about her future, the clarity with which she accepted who she was and who she hoped to become.\u201d</p> <p>Because of the power of Esther\u2019s messages, Earl knows that if she were dying, she would also schedule emails for her husband and children. \u201cI think I would be very clear about how many messages I had written and when to expect them,\u201d she adds, noting they could cause anxiety for relatives and friends otherwise.</p> <p>Yet while the terminally ill ponder their digital legacies, the majority of us do not. In November 2018, a YouGov survey found that only <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/11/06/rise-digital-inheritance-yougov-poll-shows-quarter-people-plan/\" title=\"\">7% of people want their social media accounts to remain online after they die</a>, yet it is estimated that by 2100, there could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/29/facebook-dead-users-2100-oxford\" title=\"\">4.9bn dead users on Facebook</a> alone. Planning your digital death is not really about scheduling status updates for loved ones or building an AI avatar. In practice, it is a series of unglamorous decisions about deleting your Facebook, Twitter and Netflix accounts; protecting your email against hackers; bestowing your music library to your friends; allowing your family to download photos from your cloud; and ensuring that your online secrets remain hidden in their digital alcoves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd76aa0415da96563f4b9896c34f188e437c2350\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd76aa0415da96563f4b9896c34f188e437c2350/0_51_2835_1701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Be Right Back, a young woman recreates her dead boyfriend as an artificial intelligence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Be Right Back, a young woman recreates her dead boyfriend as an artificial intelligence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe should think really carefully about anything we\u2019re entrusting or storing on any digital platform,\u201d says Dr <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/27/elaine-kasket-what-happens-to-data-when-we-die-ghosts-in-the-machine\" title=\"\">Elaine Kasket</a>, a psychologist and author of All the Ghosts in the Machine: Illusions of Immortality in the Digital Age. \u201cIf our digital stuff were like our material stuff, we would all look like extreme hoarders.\u201d Kasket says it is naive to assume that our online lives die with us. In practice, your hoard of digital data can cause endless complications for loved ones, particularly when they don\u2019t have access to your passwords.</p> <p>\u201cI cursed my father every step of the way,\u201d says Richard, a 34-year-old engineer from Ontario who was made executor of his father\u2019s estate four years ago. Although Richard\u2019s father left him a list of passwords, not one remained valid by the time of his death. Richard couldn\u2019t access his father\u2019s online government accounts, his email (to inform his contacts about the funeral), or even log on to his computer. For privacy reasons, Microsoft refused to help Richard access his father\u2019s computer. \u201cBecause of that experience I will never call Microsoft again,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our devices capture so much stuff, we don't think about the consequences for when we're not here</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Compare this with the experience of Jan-Ole Lincke, a 24-year-old pharmaceutical worker from Hamburg whose father left up-to-date passwords behind on a sheet of paper when he died two years ago. \u201cGetting access was thankfully very easy,\u201d says Lincke, who was able to download pictures from his father\u2019s Google profile, shut down his email to prevent hacking, and delete credit card details from his Amazon account. \u201cIt definitely made me think about my own [digital legacy],\u201d says Lincke, who has now written his passwords down.</p> <p>Yet despite growing awareness about the data we leave behind, very few of us are doing anything about it. In 2013, a Brighton-based company called <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d53245c-3653-11e3-8ae3-00144feab7de\" title=\"\">Cirrus Legacy</a> made headlines after it began allowing people to securely leave behind passwords for a nominated loved one. Yet the Cirrus website is now defunct, and the Guardian was unable to reach its founder for comment. Clarkson Wright &amp; Jakes Solicitors, a Kent-based law firm that offered the Cirrus service to its clients, says the option was never popular.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been aware for quite a period now that the big issue for the next generation is digital footprints,\u201d says Jeremy Wilson, head of the wills and estates team at CWJ. \u201cCirrus made sense and ticked a lot of boxes but, to be honest, not one client has taken us up on it.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson also notes that people don\u2019t know about the laws surrounding digital assets such as the music, movies and games they have downloaded. While many of us assume we own our iTunes library or collection of PlayStation games, in fact, most digital downloads are only licensed to us, and this licence ends when we die. </p> <p>What we want to do and what the law allows us to do with our digital legacy can therefore be very different things. Yet at present it is not the law that dominates our decisions about digital death. \u201cRegulation is always really slow to keep up with technology,\u201d says Kasket. \u201cThat means that platforms and corporations like Facebook end up writing the rules.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"46db26af04e99f41fdf6698c28e77b24466dbc22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46db26af04e99f41fdf6698c28e77b24466dbc22/0_0_4096_1860/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Scott stars in the new Black Mirror episode Smithereens, which explores our digital dependency.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"454\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Scott stars in the new Black Mirror episode Smithereens, which explores our digital dependency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix / Black Mirror</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2012, a 15-year-old German girl died after being hit by a subway train in Berlin. Although the girl had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/12/facebook-told-grant-grieving-mother-access-daughters-account\" title=\"\">given her parents her online passwords</a>, they were unable to access her Facebook account because it had been \u201cmemorialised\u201d by the social network. Since October 2009, Facebook has allowed profiles to be transformed into \u201cmemorial pages\u201d that exist in perpetuity. No one can then log into the account or update it, and it remains frozen as a place for loved ones to share their grief.</p> <p>The girl\u2019s parents sued Facebook for access to her account \u2013 they hoped to use it to determine whether her death was suicide. They originally lost the case, although a German court later granted the parents permission to get into her account, six years after her death.</p> <p>\u201cI find it concerning that any big tech company that hasn\u2019t really shown itself to be the most honest, transparent or ethical organisation is writing the rulebook for how we should grieve, and making moral judgments about who should or shouldn\u2019t have access to sensitive personal data,\u201d says Kasket.

      "bodyText": "Esther Earl never meant to tweet after she died. On 25 August 2010, the 16-year-old internet vlogger died after a four-year battle with thyroid cancer. In her early teens, Esther had gained a loyal following online, where she posted about her love of Harry Potter, and her illness. Then, on 18 February 2011 \u2013 six months after her death \u2013 Esther posted a message on her Twitter account, @crazycrayon. \u201cIt\u2019s currently Friday, January 14 of the year 2010. just wanted to say: I seriously hope that I\u2019m alive when this posts,\u201d she wrote, adding an emoji of a smiling face in sunglasses. Her mother, Lori Earl from Massachusetts, tells me Esther\u2019s online friends were \u201cfreaked out\u201d by the tweet. \u201cI\u2019d say they found her tweet jarring because it was unexpected,\u201d she says. Earl doesn\u2019t know which service her daughter used to schedule the tweet a year in advance, but believes it was intended for herself, not for loved ones after her death. \u201cShe hoped she would receive her own messages \u2026 [it showed] her hopes and longings to still be living, to hold on to life.\u201d Although Esther did not intend her tweet to be a posthumous message for her family, a host of services now encourage people to plan their online afterlives. Want to post on social media and communicate with your friends after death? There are lots of apps for that! Replika and Eternime are artificially intelligent chatbots that can imitate your speech for loved ones after you die; GoneNotGone enables you to send emails from the grave; and DeadSocial\u2019s \u201cgoodbye tool\u201d allows you to \u201ctell your friends and family that you have died\u201d. In season two, episode one of Black Mirror, a young woman recreates her dead boyfriend as an artificial intelligence \u2013 what was once the subject of a dystopian 44-minute fantasy is nearing reality. But although Charlie Brooker portrayed the digital afterlife as something twisted, in reality online legacies can be comforting for the bereaved. Esther Earl used a service called FutureMe to send emails to herself, stating that her parents should read them if she died. Three months after Esther\u2019s death, her mother received one of these emails. \u201cThey were seismically powerful,\u201d she says. \u201cThat letter made us weep, but also brought us great comfort \u2013 I think because of its intentionality, the fact that she was thinking about her future, the clarity with which she accepted who she was and who she hoped to become.\u201d Because of the power of Esther\u2019s messages, Earl knows that if she were dying, she would also schedule emails for her husband and children. \u201cI think I would be very clear about how many messages I had written and when to expect them,\u201d she adds, noting they could cause anxiety for relatives and friends otherwise. Yet while the terminally ill ponder their digital legacies, the majority of us do not. In November 2018, a YouGov survey found that only 7% of people want their social media accounts to remain online after they die, yet it is estimated that by 2100, there could be 4.9bn dead users on Facebook alone. Planning your digital death is not really about scheduling status updates for loved ones or building an AI avatar. In practice, it is a series of unglamorous decisions about deleting your Facebook, Twitter and Netflix accounts; protecting your email against hackers; bestowing your music library to your friends; allowing your family to download photos from your cloud; and ensuring that your online secrets remain hidden in their digital alcoves. \u201cWe should think really carefully about anything we\u2019re entrusting or storing on any digital platform,\u201d says Dr Elaine Kasket, a psychologist and author of All the Ghosts in the Machine: Illusions of Immortality in the Digital Age. \u201cIf our digital stuff were like our material stuff, we would all look like extreme hoarders.\u201d Kasket says it is naive to assume that our online lives die with us. In practice, your hoard of digital data can cause endless complications for loved ones, particularly when they don\u2019t have access to your passwords. \u201cI cursed my father every step of the way,\u201d says Richard, a 34-year-old engineer from Ontario who was made executor of his father\u2019s estate four years ago. Although Richard\u2019s father left him a list of passwords, not one remained valid by the time of his death. Richard couldn\u2019t access his father\u2019s online government accounts, his email (to inform his contacts about the funeral), or even log on to his computer. For privacy reasons, Microsoft refused to help Richard access his father\u2019s computer. \u201cBecause of that experience I will never call Microsoft again,\u201d he says. Compare this with the experience of Jan-Ole Lincke, a 24-year-old pharmaceutical worker from Hamburg whose father left up-to-date passwords behind on a sheet of paper when he died two years ago. \u201cGetting access was thankfully very easy,\u201d says Lincke, who was able to download pictures from his father\u2019s Google profile, shut down his email to prevent hacking, and delete credit card details from his Amazon account. \u201cIt definitely made me think about my own [digital legacy],\u201d says Lincke, who has now written his passwords down. Yet despite growing awareness about the data we leave behind, very few of us are doing anything about it. In 2013, a Brighton-based company called Cirrus Legacy made headlines after it began allowing people to securely leave behind passwords for a nominated loved one. Yet the Cirrus website is now defunct, and the Guardian was unable to reach its founder for comment. Clarkson Wright &amp; Jakes Solicitors, a Kent-based law firm that offered the Cirrus service to its clients, says the option was never popular. \u201cWe\u2019ve been aware for quite a period now that the big issue for the next generation is digital footprints,\u201d says Jeremy Wilson, head of the wills and estates team at CWJ. \u201cCirrus made sense and ticked a lot of boxes but, to be honest, not one client has taken us up on it.\u201d Wilson also notes that people don\u2019t know about the laws surrounding digital assets such as the music, movies and games they have downloaded. While many of us assume we own our iTunes library or collection of PlayStation games, in fact, most digital downloads are only licensed to us, and this licence ends when we die. What we want to do and what the law allows us to do with our digital legacy can therefore be very different things. Yet at present it is not the law that dominates our decisions about digital death. \u201cRegulation is always really slow to keep up with technology,\u201d says Kasket. \u201cThat means that platforms and corporations like Facebook end up writing the rules.\u201d In 2012, a 15-year-old German girl died after being hit by a subway train in Berlin. Although the girl had given her parents her online passwords, they were unable to access her Facebook account because it had been \u201cmemorialised\u201d by the social network. Since October 2009, Facebook has allowed profiles to be transformed into \u201cmemorial pages\u201d that exist in perpetuity. No one can then log into the account or update it, and it remains frozen as a place for loved ones to share their grief. The girl\u2019s parents sued Facebook for access to her account \u2013 they hoped to use it to determine whether her death was suicide. They originally lost the case, although a German court later granted the parents permission to get into her account, six years after her death. \u201cI find it concerning that any big tech company that hasn\u2019t really shown itself to be the most honest, transparent or ethical organisation is writing the rulebook for how we should grieve, and making moral judgments about who should or shouldn\u2019t have access to sensitive personal data,\u201d says Kasket. The author is concerned with how Facebook uses the data of the dead for profit, arguing that living users keep their Facebook accounts because they don\u2019t want to be \u201clocked out of the cemetery\u201d and lose access to relatives\u2019 memorialised pages. As a psychologist, she is also concerned that Facebook is dictating our grief. \u201cFacebook created memorial profiles to prevent what they called \u2018pain points\u2019, like getting birthday reminders for a deceased person,\u201d she says. \u201cBut one of the mothers I spoke to for my book was upset when her daughter\u2019s profile was memorialised and she stopped getting these reminders. She was like, \u2018This is my daughter, I gave birth to her, it\u2019s still her birthday\u2019.\u201d While Facebook users now have the option to appoint a \u201clegacy contact\u201d who can manage or delete their profile after death, Kasket is concerned that there are very few personalisation options when it comes to things like birthday reminders, or whether strangers can post on your wall. \u201cThe individuality and the idiosyncrasy of grief will flummox Facebook every time in its attempts to find a one-size-fits-all solution,\u201d she says. Matthew Helm, a 27-year-old technical analyst from Minnesota, says his mother\u2019s Facebook profile compounded his grief after she died four years ago. \u201cThe first year was the most difficult,\u201d says Helm, who felt some relatives posted about their grief on his mother\u2019s wall in order to get attention. \u201cIn the beginning I definitely wished I could just wipe it all.\u201d Helm hoped to delete the profile but was unable to access his mother\u2019s account.

      "body": "<p>On 6 May 2012, Joe Biden went on Meet the Press to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/06/joe-biden-supports-gay-marriage\">endorse marriage equality</a> \u2013 and credited an NBC sitcom for his decision: \u201cI think Will and Grace probably did more to educate the American public than almost anything anybody has done so far.\u201d</p> <p>Three days later, in the middle of his re-election campaign, Barack Obama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/09/barack-obama-supports-gay-marriage\">followed the lead of his vice-president</a>. In 1996, Bill Clinton had signed the Defense of Marriage Act (Doma) in the middle of the night because he thought that was necessary to ensure his re-election. Now a new Democratic president had embraced the push for equality as a political plus, especially with the younger voters who were so important to his success.</p> <p>Obama said that even the Republican college students he had met were \u201cvery clear\u201d about sexual orientation: \u201cThey believe in equality.\u201d He also suggested the benefits of a presidential unit that included a brilliant wife and two precocious children. His daughters, Malia and Sasha, had friends who were the children of same-sex couples, and it had never occurred to them that their friends\u2019 parents would be treated differently.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to them,\u201d Obama said, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective.\u201d</p> <p>The tidal wave of change continued. On 6 June, barely a month after the president\u2019s announcement, Judge Barbara Jones of the southern district of New York ruled in favor of Edith Windsor, whose case against Doma focused on the estate taxes she was forced to pay after the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/26/edith-windsor-thea-spyer-doma\">her wife, Thea Spyer</a>, a burden a straight widow would have avoided. The judge found that Doma was unconstitutional under the due process guarantees of the fifth amendment and ordered the federal government to issue Windsor a tax refund, including interest. Jones was the fifth federal judge to find the law unconstitutional.</p> <p>The political wisdom of Obama\u2019s position was confirmed in November when he was re-elected with 332 electoral votes and 51.1% of the popular vote. Voters in Maine, Maryland and Washington state approved marriage equality initiatives \u2013 and Minnesota voters rejected a state constitutional amendment that would have banned it. </p> <p>On 20 January 2013, in his second inaugural address, the president declared: \u201cOur journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law \u2013 for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9649f546e29a7b9447733df5ada6f471572e21c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9649f546e29a7b9447733df5ada6f471572e21c9/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edith Windsor is mobbed by journalists and supporters following oral arguments at the supreme court in March 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edith Windsor is mobbed by journalists and supporters following oral arguments at the supreme court in March 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Six months later, Edith Windsor was sitting at her lawyer\u2019s dining room table, along with the rest of her legal team. <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/30/the-perfect-wife\">The New Yorker reported</a> what happened next. Suddenly news of the supreme court\u2019s decision flashed across a computer screen: \u201cDoma Is Unconstitutional.\u201d</p> <p>There were whoops and hollers and then the telephone rang.</p> <p>\u201cWho am I talking to?\u201d Windsor asked.</p> <p>The call was coming from Air Force One.</p> <p>\u201cOh! Barack Obama?\u201d she exclaimed.

In fact, she has made it more American.\u201d</p> <p>The Windsor decision was only the first piece of good news. California governor Jerry Brown and the rest of the state\u2019s officials had declined to defend Proposition 8, a ban on same-sex marriage.

      "bodyText": "On 6 May 2012, Joe Biden went on Meet the Press to endorse marriage equality \u2013 and credited an NBC sitcom for his decision: \u201cI think Will and Grace probably did more to educate the American public than almost anything anybody has done so far.\u201d Three days later, in the middle of his re-election campaign, Barack Obama followed the lead of his vice-president. In 1996, Bill Clinton had signed the Defense of Marriage Act (Doma) in the middle of the night because he thought that was necessary to ensure his re-election. Now a new Democratic president had embraced the push for equality as a political plus, especially with the younger voters who were so important to his success. Obama said that even the Republican college students he had met were \u201cvery clear\u201d about sexual orientation: \u201cThey believe in equality.\u201d He also suggested the benefits of a presidential unit that included a brilliant wife and two precocious children. His daughters, Malia and Sasha, had friends who were the children of same-sex couples, and it had never occurred to them that their friends\u2019 parents would be treated differently. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to them,\u201d Obama said, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective.\u201d The tidal wave of change continued. On 6 June, barely a month after the president\u2019s announcement, Judge Barbara Jones of the southern district of New York ruled in favor of Edith Windsor, whose case against Doma focused on the estate taxes she was forced to pay after the death of her wife, Thea Spyer, a burden a straight widow would have avoided. The judge found that Doma was unconstitutional under the due process guarantees of the fifth amendment and ordered the federal government to issue Windsor a tax refund, including interest. Jones was the fifth federal judge to find the law unconstitutional. The political wisdom of Obama\u2019s position was confirmed in November when he was re-elected with 332 electoral votes and 51.1% of the popular vote. Voters in Maine, Maryland and Washington state approved marriage equality initiatives \u2013 and Minnesota voters rejected a state constitutional amendment that would have banned it. On 20 January 2013, in his second inaugural address, the president declared: \u201cOur journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law \u2013 for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.\u201d Six months later, Edith Windsor was sitting at her lawyer\u2019s dining room table, along with the rest of her legal team. The New Yorker reported what happened next. Suddenly news of the supreme court\u2019s decision flashed across a computer screen: \u201cDoma Is Unconstitutional.\u201d There were whoops and hollers and then the telephone rang. \u201cWho am I talking to?\u201d Windsor asked. The call was coming from Air Force One. \u201cOh! Barack Obama?\u201d she exclaimed. Composing herself, she said: \u201cI want to thank you.\u201d And then she added: \u201cI think your coming out for us made such a difference throughout the country.\u201d As in Romer v Evans in 1996, which held that government cannot legitimately base its decisions on animus toward gay people, and Lawrence v Texas, which made gay sex legal, Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority decision. For the third time, he catapulted the gay cause forward. Back in Manhattan, Windsor was taken on an impromptu victory lap around the island. People burst into tears and shouted: \u201cThank you, Edie!\u201d At the LGBT Community Center in Greenwich Village, Windsor\u2019s lawyer compared her to \u201cSusan B Anthony, or Rosa Parks, or Harvey Milk\u201d; James Esseks of the ACLU echoed the earlier words of the attorney Ted Olson, declaring Windsor to have \u201cmade the country more free and more fair and more equal today. In fact, she has made it more American.\u201d The Windsor decision was only the first piece of good news. California governor Jerry Brown and the rest of the state\u2019s officials had declined to defend Proposition 8, a ban on same-sex marriage. At the supreme court, chief justice John Roberts and four of his colleagues decided unelected proponents of the ban did not have standing to appeal a district court victory for two same-sex couples who had sought to marry.

They urged the UN to investigate the targeting of listed hospitals and asked the international community to put pressure on Russia and Syria to stop targeting medical centres and reverse funding cuts to surviving hospitals and clinics that are now overwhelmed by refugees.</p> <p>One paediatrician, Abdulkader Razouk, described to the <em>Observer</em> how he and his colleagues evacuated an entire hospital including dialysis patients, mothers in labour and premature babies in incubators, as airstrikes began in their town, at least 12 miles from the frontline. \u201cAfter the airstrikes, but before the direct attack, we knew the hospital would be targeted,\u201d he said in a phone interview about the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/05/17/724281900/in-syria-reports-of-19-medical-facilities-bombed-since-april-28\" title=\"\">Tarmala hospital</a>, which was eventually hit on 10 May. \u201cOnly a few medical staff stayed to provide emergency response.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/02/letters-bbc-wish-for-a-finger-in-every-pie\">Letters: The BBC\u2019s wish for a finger in every pie </a> </p> </aside>  <p>The airstrike destroyed more than half the hospital and much of its equipment from beds and generators to the operating theatres, emergency services and pharmacy. Staff went back briefly to hunt through the rubble for any supplies that survived the onslaught but the building is now abandoned. \u201cIt would be impossible to rebuild and reopen now,\u201d Razouk said. \u201cThe airstrikes are continuing and still targeting the hospital until this moment, even though it\u2019s empty.\u201d</p> <p>The May bombing was not the first attack on the hospital. That came in 2015, first with the Syrian military\u2019s wildly inaccurate barrel bombs, and later by Russian missiles, that destroyed a residential building next door but spared the clinic itself. In 2018 there was a direct hit on the clinic but then it was able to reopen after repairs.</p> <p>However the damage after the latest attack was so severe that it is beyond repair, and anyway most of the civilians it served have fled, Razouk said.</p> <p>\u201cThis was the worst attack, it has been very tough, there is no possibility whatsoever to continue work there,\u201d he said. \u201cLife can\u2019t return to this area, especially under these brutal attacks.

The huge number of refugees displaced by attacks has left those that are still operating overwhelmed.</p> <p>\u201cThe tactic of attacking health and other civilian infrastructure in Syria is not new, displacement is not new, these are all chronic issues.

      "bodyText": "Dozens of prominent doctors have called for urgent action to halt the bombing campaign by Syrian and Russian planes that has targeted more than 20 hospitals in Syria\u2019s north-west, putting many out of action and leaving millions of people without proper healthcare. Coordinates for many of those hit had been shared with the regime and its Russian backers by the United Nations in an effort to protect civilians. The Syrian opposition were promised war planes would avoid identified sites on bombing raids; instead they have endured more than a month of fierce attacks. Since late April, in defiance of a truce brokered by Moscow and Ankara last year, regular airstrikes on opposition-held territory in northern Idlib province have killed hundreds of civilians and displaced hundreds of thousands more, rights groups say. They have also destroyed key parts of the healthcare system, says a letter from doctors around the world published in the Observer. \u201cWe are appalled by the deliberate and systematic targeting of healthcare facilities and medical staff,\u201d they warned. \u201cTheir [the medical staff\u2019s] job is to save lives, they must not lose their own in the process.\u201d Signatories include Denis Mukwege, a gynaecologist who won the Nobel peace prize last year, Peter Agre, a physician who won the Nobel prize in chemistry in 2003, MP and doctor Sarah Wollaston, and Terence English, former president of the Royal College of Surgeons, as well as David Nott, a surgeon who works in war zones, and Zaher Sahloul, a Syrian exile, doctor and founder of a medical charity. They urged the UN to investigate the targeting of listed hospitals and asked the international community to put pressure on Russia and Syria to stop targeting medical centres and reverse funding cuts to surviving hospitals and clinics that are now overwhelmed by refugees. One paediatrician, Abdulkader Razouk, described to the Observer how he and his colleagues evacuated an entire hospital including dialysis patients, mothers in labour and premature babies in incubators, as airstrikes began in their town, at least 12 miles from the frontline. \u201cAfter the airstrikes, but before the direct attack, we knew the hospital would be targeted,\u201d he said in a phone interview about the Tarmala hospital, which was eventually hit on 10 May. \u201cOnly a few medical staff stayed to provide emergency response.\u201d The airstrike destroyed more than half the hospital and much of its equipment from beds and generators to the operating theatres, emergency services and pharmacy. Staff went back briefly to hunt through the rubble for any supplies that survived the onslaught but the building is now abandoned. \u201cIt would be impossible to rebuild and reopen now,\u201d Razouk said. \u201cThe airstrikes are continuing and still targeting the hospital until this moment, even though it\u2019s empty.\u201d The May bombing was not the first attack on the hospital. That came in 2015, first with the Syrian military\u2019s wildly inaccurate barrel bombs, and later by Russian missiles, that destroyed a residential building next door but spared the clinic itself. In 2018 there was a direct hit on the clinic but then it was able to reopen after repairs. However the damage after the latest attack was so severe that it is beyond repair, and anyway most of the civilians it served have fled, Razouk said. \u201cThis was the worst attack, it has been very tough, there is no possibility whatsoever to continue work there,\u201d he said. \u201cLife can\u2019t return to this area, especially under these brutal attacks. There are no people, not even animals, there\u2019s nothing left in there, it\u2019s like a doomed land. There is no hope to go back.\u201d He and other staff are opening a new temporary hospital near the Turkish border, where most of the residents of Tarmala have fled and are now living in refugee camps. It will have some of the neonatal incubators and dialysis machines evacuated before the strike, but there is a desperate need for more supplies. Around 80 medical facilities \u2013 including clinics and hospitals \u2013 have been shut because of damage in attacks or because of fear they will be targeted, said Mohamad Katoub from the Syrian American Medical Society. The huge number of refugees displaced by attacks has left those that are still operating overwhelmed. \u201cThe tactic of attacking health and other civilian infrastructure in Syria is not new, displacement is not new, these are all chronic issues. But this is the biggest displacement ever, and it is much further beyond our capacity as NGOs to respond,\u201d he said. Turkey, which backs Idlib\u2019s rebel groups, is already home to 3.6 million Syrians and faces the dilemma of whether or not to absorb any of the newly displaced. A group were reportedly planning a protest march to the border at the weekend. The de-escalation deal brokered last autumn saved Idlib and the surrounding countryside from an impending government assault. At the time, aid agencies warned that a military campaign would put the lives of 3 million civilians at risk, and trigger the worst humanitarian crisis of an already protracted and bloody war. But the agreement has unravelled since January, when the hardline Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) wrested control of the area from more moderate rebels. Damascus and Moscow have said the HTS takeover legitimises the current campaign against Idlib as they are targeting terrorists not covered by the ceasefire deal. Many civilians in Idlib now feel they have been caught between the harsh rule of HTS and the intensified regime assault, and say that life has all but ground to a halt. \u201cI was studying at Idlib university but I\u2019ve had to stop going. So has my sister,\u201d said 22-year-old Raja al-Assaad, from Ma\u2019arat al-Nu\u2019maan, which has been under heavy attack. \u201cSome people have left to try to go to Turkey but the truth is that there is nowhere to go. Nowhere in Idlib is safe. And in my town we already have lots of people who have been displaced from lots of other areas of Syria.\u201d \u201cAll normal life has shut down and there is nothing for us to do except wait for death.\u201d",

Harington, 32, was young when he was cast as Snow; as much as he\u2019s now over-identified with the role, he\u2019d have over-identified with it too. At the end, it could have felt like leaving a family. However, there\u2019s an upside. Harington may be as typecast as a soap actor, but at least he will have been handsomely paid. With no financial pressure, he can take all the time he needs to get well, then perhaps consider indie roles to redefine himself. Alternatively, find something different to do \u2013 or just chill in his pants in a lilo-chair and eat ice pops. I\u2019m not making light of Harington\u2019s suffering, just wishing him a full and speedy recovery. One winter has gone, to be replaced by another \u2013 but warmer weather is just around the corner. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>As Britain sees it, a state visit is an important way of celebrating and strengthening the relationship between two sovereign countries. It is a symbolic occasion intended to formalise and promote a voluntary alliance linking two independent peoples. The principal focus is not on individual politicians, except in so far as such leaders are seen as representing their fellow citizens. State visits are certainly not supposed to be an ego trip.</p> <p>This is something, among many other things, that Donald Trump plainly does not understand. When the Queen hosts a foreign leader, she does so in her capacity as head of state, not as a tour guide or re-election campaign prop. The honour she bestows belongs entirely to the country of which her guest is the current, temporary leader. Whatever he may think, the state visit is emphatically not a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/23/donald-trump-uk-state-visit-adult-children\" title=\"\">tribute to Trump</a>. Ever since Theresa May rashly issued the invitation, he has pushed for the proffered prize with shameless importunity. Evident reluctance and delay in Westminster and Whitehall was by no means wholly the result of Brexit distractions.

      "bodyText": "As Britain sees it, a state visit is an important way of celebrating and strengthening the relationship between two sovereign countries. It is a symbolic occasion intended to formalise and promote a voluntary alliance linking two independent peoples. The principal focus is not on individual politicians, except in so far as such leaders are seen as representing their fellow citizens. State visits are certainly not supposed to be an ego trip. This is something, among many other things, that Donald Trump plainly does not understand. When the Queen hosts a foreign leader, she does so in her capacity as head of state, not as a tour guide or re-election campaign prop. The honour she bestows belongs entirely to the country of which her guest is the current, temporary leader. Whatever he may think, the state visit is emphatically not a tribute to Trump. Ever since Theresa May rashly issued the invitation, he has pushed for the proffered prize with shameless importunity. Evident reluctance and delay in Westminster and Whitehall was by no means wholly the result of Brexit distractions. By his almost daily actions, Trump has demonstrated such disrespect and disdain for Britain and its national interests as to lead many people here to hope that he would not come at all.

Why is this happening? Because it\u2019s so profitable for corporations to use gig workers instead of full-time employees. Gig workers are about 30% cheaper because companies pay them only when they need them, and don\u2019t have to spend on the above-mentioned labor protections. Increasingly, businesses need only a small pool of \u201ctalent\u201d anchored in the enterprise \u2013 innovators and strategists responsible for the firm\u2019s competitive strength. Other workers are becoming fungible, sought only for reliability and low cost. So, in effect, economic risks are shifting to them. It\u2019s a great deal for companies like Uber and Google. They set workers\u2019 rates, terms, and working conditions, while at the same time treating them like arms-length contractors. But for many workers it amounts to wage theft. If America still had a Department of Labor, it would be setting national standards to stop this. Yet Trump\u2019s Anti-Labor Department is heading in opposite direction. It recently proposed a rule making it easier for big corporations to outsource work to temp and staffing firms, and escape liability if those contracting firms violate the law, such as not paying workers for jobs completed. On the other hand, California is countering Trump on this, as on other issues. Last Wednesday, the California assembly passed legislation codifying an important California supreme court decision: in order for companies to treat workers as independent contractors, the workers must be free from company control, doing work that\u2019s not central to the company\u2019s business, and have an independent business in that trade. (The bill is not yet law. It still has to pass the California Senate and be signed by the governor. And businesses are seeking a long list of exemptions \u2013 including ride-share drivers and many of high-tech\u2019s contract workers.) Whatever national rule eventually emerges for defining gig workers, they\u2019ll need a different system of social insurance than was the case when steady full-time employment was the norm. For example, they need income insurance rather than unemployment insurance. One model: If someone\u2019s monthly income dips below their average monthly income from all jobs over the preceding five years, they automatically receive half the difference for up to a year.

We are appalled by the deliberate and systematic targeting of healthcare facilities and medical staff, which is a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law.</p> <p>Throughout the Syrian conflict, we have seen both Russia and the Syrian government attack hospitals prior to major offensives, their collective aims seeming to be terrorising civilians and reducing medics\u2019 ability to treat the injured.</p> <p>Our letter couldn\u2019t come at a more desperate time. Since 26 April, at least 270 civilians have been killed due to Syrian government and Russian attacks while a further 300,000 people were displaced. The continued escalation of airstrikes and other hostilities means civilians require medical assistance more than ever. But the repeated targeting of medical facilities by the Syrian government and Russia has forced the hospitals that remain to operate under a state of emergency, only treating the most urgent cases and unable to take in patients for routine care. These hospitals serve the 4.5 million residents of north-west Syria.</p> <p>As doctors, medical workers and public health professionals from around the world, we condemn the Syrian and Russian governments in the strongest possible terms for their airstrikes on hospitals. We stand in solidarity with our Syrian colleagues on the ground who are risking their lives and demand immediate measures to protect their lives and work.</p> <p>What is happening in Syria is unimaginable. We have watched in horror the footage of repeated airstrikes on hospitals and listened in shock to our colleagues on the ground who described patients fleeing bombed hospitals with IV drips still attached and choking on dust raised by the explosions. Rather than being a place of healing and refuge, hospitals are now some of the most dangerous places for civilians to be.</p> <p>Many of the hospitals targeted by the Syrian government and Russia were based underground in secret locations to shield them from attack. As part of a United Nations deconfliction process, however, medical organisations shared their coordinates with the UN, which in turn shared them with Moscow and Damascus in a bid to shield them from attack. The decision to share coordinates was made after painstaking deliberations by medical staff and was ultimately adopted out of hope that it would protect their work and their facilities. The UN must immediately investigate the targeting of listed hospitals.</p> <p>All armed parties in the Syrian conflict must respect medical neutrality and allow doctors, nurses and paramedics to treat their patients without violence, threatened or actual. International governments must reverse their decision to cut funding to medical facilities in north-west Syria and put pressure on Russia and its Syrian ally to stop targeting hospitals.</p> <p>Healthcare in Syria has been under consistent attack since the 2011 uprising with medical workers forcibly disappeared and tortured and hospitals routinely bombed, killing dozens of doctors and nurses and patients. Between 2011 and December 2018, Physicians for Human Rights has documented 566 attacks on medical facilities, 90% of them by Syrian and Russian government forces. Attacks have involved banned weapons including barrel bombs and chemical agents that have killed a total of 890 medical personnel.

The number will dismay many in the party and make it difficult to support Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s earlier claims that its problem with antisemitism was down to a \u201csmall number of members and supporters\u201d. The Equality and Human Rights Commission\u2019s decision last week to investigate whether \u201cthe party unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish\u201d came as Labour\u2019s antisemitism problem showed no sign of abating. Last week the party was forced to suspend Labour NEC member Peter Willsman for suggesting that the antisemitism row was \u201calmost certainly\u201d the work of the Israeli embassy. Some senior Labour members said that if it was true that Willsman had made such a claim, he should be expelled. They contrasted the decision only to suspend him with the near immediate expulsion of the former spin doctor Alastair Campbell for admitting that he voted Lib Dem in the recent European elections. Peter Mason, national secretary of the Jewish Labour Movement, confirmed to the Observer that it had already submitted scores of testimonies to the watchdog. Mason said that a further call for evidence was being made to JLM members, and that when the second round of submissions was presented to the EHRC, the total number of confidential witness statements would be more than 100 and run to more than 1,000 pieces of paper.

      "body": "<p>Labour\u2019s performance in the European elections was even more dismal than many predicted: overtaken by the Liberal Democrats, it achieved third place with just 14% of the vote. One <a href=\"https://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2019/05/31/post-mortem-what-worked-for-remain-in-the-european-elections\" title=\"\">analysis</a> suggests that between 2.5 and 3 million of those who voted Labour in 2017 defected to one of the pro-Remain parties, while a <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/05/30/if-everyone-revealed-how-they-voted-last-week-labo\" title=\"\">YouGov poll</a> estimates that just four in 10 Labour members voted for the party.</p> <p>It would therefore have been reasonable to expect that the Labour leadership would have spent last week reassuring those who deserted it over its ambiguous Brexit position that it had heard their message. But instead, it chose to expel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/31/alastair-campbell-labour-expulsion-discrimination-appeal\" title=\"\">Alastair Campbell</a>, Tony Blair\u2019s former communications chief and a longtime member, for revealing that he voted Liberal Democrat. Just when Labour should be trying to attract the votes it lost to the Remain parties, it sends a signal that these people aren\u2019t welcome. As Campbell said, he was voting tactically, like tens of thousands of other members who supported pro-Remain parties, to try to get the party to change its stance.</p> <p>Since his expulsion, which he is appealing against, several former cabinet ministers and MPs have gone public and said they didn\u2019t vote Labour. Labour is hardly likely to expel them, which makes the decision regarding Campbell look petty. And it compares dreadfully with the party\u2019s lackadaisical approach to dealing with complaints of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/02/observer-view-labour-and-antisemitism\" title=\"\">antisemitism</a>, which prompted the Equalities and Human Rights Commission to launch a formal investigation into antisemitism in the party.</p> <p>The overwhelming beneficiary of Labour\u2019s losses were the Liberal Democrats. In an extraordinary revival, they won 20% of the vote, coming second only to the Brexit party. That result is unlikely to fully hold up in a general election, in which the first past the post electoral system puts far more pressure on voters to back one of the two main parties. But in a fragmenting party system, there is every chance that resurgent Liberal Democrats could again find themselves coalition kingmaker, just as in 2010.</p> <p>While it can be argued that the party benefited more from Labour\u2019s failings than its own vigour and ingenuity, some of its success has come deservedly as a result of the clarity of its Brexit position. Where Labour has fudged, the Lib Dems have been long been clear that they are a Remain party that backs a confirmatory referendum, with staying in as an option.</p> <p>That clarity does not extend to the rest of their platform. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/30/we-have-to-stop-no-deal-ed-davey-kicks-off-lib-dem-leadership-bid\" title=\"\">Ed Davey</a>, one of the two contenders to replace Vince Cable as leader, has defended the party\u2019s record in coalition with David Cameron between 2010 and 2015, arguing that it softened the impact of austerity.

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s performance in the European elections was even more dismal than many predicted: overtaken by the Liberal Democrats, it achieved third place with just 14% of the vote. One analysis suggests that between 2.5 and 3 million of those who voted Labour in 2017 defected to one of the pro-Remain parties, while a YouGov poll estimates that just four in 10 Labour members voted for the party. It would therefore have been reasonable to expect that the Labour leadership would have spent last week reassuring those who deserted it over its ambiguous Brexit position that it had heard their message. But instead, it chose to expel Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s former communications chief and a longtime member, for revealing that he voted Liberal Democrat. Just when Labour should be trying to attract the votes it lost to the Remain parties, it sends a signal that these people aren\u2019t welcome. As Campbell said, he was voting tactically, like tens of thousands of other members who supported pro-Remain parties, to try to get the party to change its stance. Since his expulsion, which he is appealing against, several former cabinet ministers and MPs have gone public and said they didn\u2019t vote Labour. Labour is hardly likely to expel them, which makes the decision regarding Campbell look petty. And it compares dreadfully with the party\u2019s lackadaisical approach to dealing with complaints of antisemitism, which prompted the Equalities and Human Rights Commission to launch a formal investigation into antisemitism in the party. The overwhelming beneficiary of Labour\u2019s losses were the Liberal Democrats. In an extraordinary revival, they won 20% of the vote, coming second only to the Brexit party. That result is unlikely to fully hold up in a general election, in which the first past the post electoral system puts far more pressure on voters to back one of the two main parties. But in a fragmenting party system, there is every chance that resurgent Liberal Democrats could again find themselves coalition kingmaker, just as in 2010. While it can be argued that the party benefited more from Labour\u2019s failings than its own vigour and ingenuity, some of its success has come deservedly as a result of the clarity of its Brexit position. Where Labour has fudged, the Lib Dems have been long been clear that they are a Remain party that backs a confirmatory referendum, with staying in as an option. That clarity does not extend to the rest of their platform. Ed Davey, one of the two contenders to replace Vince Cable as leader, has defended the party\u2019s record in coalition with David Cameron between 2010 and 2015, arguing that it softened the impact of austerity. Their track record belies this convenient retelling of their time in government. The Liberal Democrats championed regressive increases in the personal tax allowance that disproportionately benefited more affluent families and cost billions of pounds a year, a gap plugged with cuts to tax credits and benefits for low-income families with children. The speed with which they dropped their signature pledge to scrap tuition fees to support the tripling of fees in 2012 made them look opportunistic and devoid of principle. They failed to use the substantial power they wielded by dint of the fact Cameron relied on their votes in parliament in order to extract significant concessions on toxic policies such as the bedroom tax and the hostile environment.

So as they celebrate their success and elect a new leader, the Lib Dems must distance themselves from their lamentable record in coalition and come clean about their vision for Britain, outside of Brexit.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for now. Thanks for following along with us and be sure to check out our full ringside report from a historic night at Madison Square Garden. \u201cAJ got sloppy,\u201d says Eddie Hearn, who promotes Joshua. \u201cIt was a beautiful combination in the third round. He was in total control of the fight but he got sloppy and never recovered. Listen, tonight was his night but AJ will come back 100% and we will make the rematch in the UK in November or December. But this night now belongs to Andy Ruiz, he made history in the heavyweight division tonight.\u201d He adds: \u201cIt will go down in history as a very big one. AJ has the heart of a lion and will come back stronger. Now at least we know the opponent for the end of the year in the UK. Absolutely we will enact the immediate rematch. He will be devastated when it sinks in. It makes the fall fight a must win.\u201d \u201cHeavyweight boxing is on fire,\u201d Joshua says. \u201cI just have to turn it around a few notches and bring it back my way. I don\u2019t want people to drown in their sorrows. This will show I have the power and the strength.\u201d On the difference between tonight and Wladimir Klitschko: \u201cIt\u2019s all the same. It just wasn\u2019t my night. But listen, it is good for the TV. Good for DAZN and the people watching.\u201d On the stoppage: \u201cI want to fight. I don\u2019t do his job. I am never one of those fighters to disrespect a referee like he should have done this or he should have done that. He called it off when he thought I couldn\u2019t fight. It\u2019s a shame. But I don\u2019t want anyone to drown in their sorrows. It\u2019s the long game, not the short game.\u201d On the immediate rematch: \u201c100%. 100%.\u201d \u201cI want to thank God for giving me this victory, without him this wouldn\u2019t be possible,\u201d Ruiz says. \u201cI just feel so good, man. This is what I have been dreaming about. This is what I have been working hard for. I can\u2019t believe I just made my dreams come true. I just want to thank my team and my family. The sky is the limit, baby.\u201d On what happened in the third round: \u201cThat was my first time getting dropped on the floor. It just made me stronger. It just made me want it more. I just had to knock him down back.\u201d On taking Anthony Joshua\u2019s power: \u201cIt\u2019s because of the Mexican warrior I am, I have that Mexican blood in me. Talking about the Mexican fighting style, I just proved it.\u201d On sensing that Anthony Joshua was hurt: \u201cI could but I just didn\u2019t want to throw away what I had. I just wanted to hunt him down even more and work the body. I just wanted to listen to the game plan.\u201d Needless to say: stunning scenes at Madison Square Garden. Afterward Eddie Hearn, who promotes Joshua, said his fighter would exercise an immediate rematch clause after a shock that ranks among Buster Douglas v Mike Tyson and James Braddock v Max Baer among the biggest surprises in heavyweight championship history. Joshua lands a bit shot early on but Ruiz meets it, there\u2019s a flurry and down goes Joshua for a third time early in the seventh! Oh dear! Referee Mike Griffin is talking to Joshua in the corner after what appears to be a slip and ... he\u2019s waved it off!

Ruiz walks straight into a jab then nearly gets decked by a hook that\u2019s just off the mark. Very much a feeling-out first round.

If Canelo steps up in the future than it will happen.\u201d Hello and welcome to tonight\u2019s heavyweight title fight between Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz Jr. We\u2019re just about ready to go here at Madison Square Garden so we\u2019ll dispense with the pleasantries. But a quick nod to Katie Taylor, who unified all four lightweight title belts to become the undisputed champion at 135lbs with a dramatic majority-decision win over Delfine Persoon. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s his lookahead to tonight\u2019s main event.",

      "bodyText": "Anthony Albanese has unveiled Labor\u2019s new shadow ministry, saying the \u201coutstanding new team\u201d will hold the government to account and develop a fresh policy agenda to take to the next election. The former New South Wales premier Kristina Keneally is the big winner from the opposition leader\u2019s cabinet shake-up, taking the position of shadow home affairs minister after she secured a spot on Albanese\u2019s leadership team as deputy Senate leader. It is the first time Labor has had a shadow minister for the mega portfolio, which includes immigration and citizenship. Queenslander Jim Chalmers switches to the powerful Treasury portfolio, taking over from Chris Bowen who was a key architect of Labor\u2019s suite of economic policies, widely blamed for the party\u2019s defeat. Bowen has shifted to health. Bill Shorten, whom Albanese said would be treated with \u201cappropriate respect,\u201d has been given his former portfolio of disabilities, rebadged as shadow for the national disability insurance scheme, along with responsibility for government services. In other key promotions, the former ACT chief minister Katy Gallagher takes on finance, Western Australian MP Madeleine King takes on trade and Queenslander Terri Butler becomes the party\u2019s shadow environment minister. Shayne Neumann, the party\u2019s only regional Queensland MP, has been dumped from shadow cabinet, taking on an outer ministry position representing veterans and defence personnel. Many other of the party\u2019s senior positions remain unchanged, including deputy Richard Marles who remains as defence spokesman, Mark Butler who keeps energy, Penny Wong who stays with foreign affairs and Mark Dreyfus who remains as shadow attorney general. Albanese said the new team was a \u201cmajor step forward\u201d as Labor sought to reset its policy agenda in preparation for the 2022 election, praising his new economics team under Chalmers. \u201cI would back, person for person, Labor\u2019s frontbench versus the government benches every day of the week,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cThis team has the talent and the experience to both hold the Morrison government to account, but also to ensure that we develop an alternative program to take to the next election in March 2022. \u201cIt is a team where you have a number of people who have vast experience who have served in the cabinet before but a refresh with new talent coming in. \u201cOur economic team I think is particularly strong.\u201d Albanese said Shorten remained an \u201cimportant part of our team\u201d and would serve in shadow cabinet to hold the government to account over the rollout of the NDIS. \u201cHe looks forward to it with enthusiasm and he will do the job well,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cHe will hold the government to account and make sure that it is the people with disabilities who are at the centre of attention for that scheme as it is rolled out.\u201d On Facebook Shorten said he was \u201chonoured by the opportunity\u201d and thanked Albanese for the position. \u201cI\u2019m determined to see the promise of the NDIS fulfilled and I\u2019m going to give everything I have to making this great Labor initiative a reality for those who rely on it,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cWorking with people with disability, their carers and their families to create the national disability insurance scheme was my first job in politics and remains one of the great privileges of my life.\u201d The new leader, who will meet with his new ministry in Brisbane on Tuesday, said Bowen was \u201cvery excited\u201d about his new portfolio of health, saying he had requested a social policy portfolio. \u201cI am sure that he will fulfil that task with great credit to himself and to the party.\u201d Labor has appointed Indigenous woman Linda Burney to take up the role of Indigenous affairs shadow minister, after the government appointed Noongar man Ken Wyatt as the country\u2019s new minister for Indigenous Australians.

Talking about the Mexican fighting style, I just proved it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Joshua\u2019s physical advantages in height (four inches) and reach (eight) appeared even more ominous under the glare of the Garden lights as the chiseled 6ft 6in, 247lb champion spent the opening round fighting off the back foot while the challenger moved forward in pursuit. The 2012 Olympic gold medalist, who\u2019s emerged as one of boxing\u2019s biggest superstars during a run of sold-out stadium shows in the UK, continued to measure distance into the second, scoring in occasional spots as Ruiz struggled to negotiate his way around the jab.</p> \n<p>The widely preordained outcome appeared imminent in the third when Joshua sent the Ruiz\u2019s doughy 6ft 2in, 268lb frame to the deck with a left hook to the temple early in the round. \u201cThat was my first time getting dropped on the floor,\u201d the challenger said. \u201cIt just made me stronger. It just made me want it more. I just had to knock him down back.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ruiz comfortably beat the count, refused to clinch when Joshua closed in for the finish, then connected with a right hand over the top amid a firefight in the center of the ring that sent the champion to the canvas against the run of play.</p> \n<p>Joshua (22-1, 21 KOs) made it to his feet but Ruiz resumed the chase around the ring, battering the champion backward toward his own corner with a series of uncontested punches. Then near the end of the third, Ruiz connected with a heat-seeking right that knocked Joshua down and partially through the ropes, but the champion willed himself upright on sheer instinct and was saved by the bell.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7c13065e18f2ffb14eacd045c2b7779f2a08029\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7c13065e18f2ffb14eacd045c2b7779f2a08029/0_0_3943_2846/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Joshua\" width=\"1000\" height=\"722\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Joshua tries to make it to his feet during referee Mike Griffin\u2019s count after he was knocked down during the seventh round.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Franklin II/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The wounded Briton, suddenly unable to manage with the smaller man\u2019s hand speed, was still reeling when the bell sounded to start the fourth. Ruiz, curiously, backed off rather than resume the pell-mell onslaught that might have finished the task. Each man had tasted the other\u2019s power and both appeared wary as they kept their distance, allowing Joshua the precious time to rediscover his footing and escape immediate danger. The familiar geography of the encounter pressed on into the fifth as Ruiz stalked Joshua, who landed counters and pawing jabs in a slow retreat which the granite-chinned challenger walked through like raindrops.</p> \n<p>But Ruiz came on strong at the end of the sixth with a series of chopping right hands before Joshua went down for a third time under a hail of punches early in the seventh. The champion made it to his feet but Ruiz got the best of an exchange once more with a series of clubbing blows to floor his opponent again. Griffin\u2019s decision to wave it off, no longer convinced Joshua could defend himself as he sought to reset himself in a neutral corner with a trickle of blood running from his nose, ignited pandemonium among the announced sell-out crowd of 20,201, many of whom flew in from Britain to watch Joshua\u2019s first outing on American soil.</p> \n<p>Joshua, 29, suggested the stoppage was premature in the aftermath, but stopped short of criticizing the referee.</p> \n<p>\u201cI want to fight,\u201d said Joshua, who connected on 47 of 176 shots (27%) according to CompuBox\u2019s punch statistics, compared to 56 of 206 (27%) for Ruiz. \u201cI don\u2019t do [the referee\u2019s] job. I am never one of those fighters to disrespect a referee like he should have done this or he should have done that. He called it off when he thought I couldn\u2019t fight. It\u2019s a shame. But I don\u2019t want anyone to drown in their sorrows. It\u2019s the long game, not the short game.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ruiz\u2019s trainer, Manny Robles, said that his fighter executed their strategy to perfection.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe had a great game plan: to stay low, not fight tall and work behind the jab,\u201d Robles said. \u201cHit the chest, hit the body. I told him to either fight inside or stay outside. I did not want him to fight at mid-range and put himself in front of the big punches.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/01/katie-taylor-fight-undisputed-champion-delfine-persoon\">Katie Taylor becomes undisputed champion in epic scrap with Delfine Persoon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The extraordinary result effectively torpedoed the much-anticipated summit meeting between Joshua and Deontay Wilder, who\u2019s held the WBC\u2019s version of the heavyweight championship since 2015. That fight was until Saturday night the biggest that could be made in the sport today, but instead becomes a slain golden goose representing a cautionary tale for the industry on the perils of letting superfights marinate too long.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a true champion,\u201d Wilder <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BronzeBomber/status/1135030361224753152\">tweeted</a>. \u201cHis whole career was consisted of lies, contradictions and gifts. Facts and now we know who was running from who!!!!\u201d</p> \n<p>Afterward Eddie Hearn, who promotes Joshua, said his fighter would exercise the immediate rematch clause in the fight contract.</p> \n<p>\u201cAJ got sloppy,\u201d said Hearn during an in-ring interview over a cascade of boos that rang down from the mezzanine. \u201cIt was a beautiful combination in the third round. He was in total control of the fight but he got sloppy and never recovered. Listen, tonight was [Ruiz\u2019s] night but AJ will come back 100% and we will make the rematch in the UK in November or December. But this night now belongs to Andy Ruiz.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cAJ has the heart of a lion and will come back stronger. Now at least we know the opponent for the end of the year in the UK. Absolutely we will enact the immediate rematch. He will be devastated when it sinks in. It makes the fall fight a must win.\u201d</p> \n<p>Joshua, to his credit, was upbeat in defeat while affirming he wanted a second crack at Ruiz.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt just wasn\u2019t my night,\u201d he said. \u201cI just have to turn it around a few notches and bring it back my way.

Joshua (22-1, 21 KOs) made it to his feet but Ruiz resumed the chase around the ring, battering the champion backward toward his own corner with a series of uncontested punches. Then near the end of the third, Ruiz connected with a heat-seeking right that knocked Joshua down and partially through the ropes, but the champion willed himself upright on sheer instinct and was saved by the bell. The wounded Briton, suddenly unable to manage with the smaller man\u2019s hand speed, was still reeling when the bell sounded to start the fourth. Ruiz, curiously, backed off rather than resume the pell-mell onslaught that might have finished the task. Each man had tasted the other\u2019s power and both appeared wary as they kept their distance, allowing Joshua the precious time to rediscover his footing and escape immediate danger. The familiar geography of the encounter pressed on into the fifth as Ruiz stalked Joshua, who landed counters and pawing jabs in a slow retreat which the granite-chinned challenger walked through like raindrops. But Ruiz came on strong at the end of the sixth with a series of chopping right hands before Joshua went down for a third time under a hail of punches early in the seventh. The champion made it to his feet but Ruiz got the best of an exchange once more with a series of clubbing blows to floor his opponent again. Griffin\u2019s decision to wave it off, no longer convinced Joshua could defend himself as he sought to reset himself in a neutral corner with a trickle of blood running from his nose, ignited pandemonium among the announced sell-out crowd of 20,201, many of whom flew in from Britain to watch Joshua\u2019s first outing on American soil. Joshua, 29, suggested the stoppage was premature in the aftermath, but stopped short of criticizing the referee. \u201cI want to fight,\u201d said Joshua, who connected on 47 of 176 shots (27%) according to CompuBox\u2019s punch statistics, compared to 56 of 206 (27%) for Ruiz. \u201cI don\u2019t do [the referee\u2019s] job. I am never one of those fighters to disrespect a referee like he should have done this or he should have done that. He called it off when he thought I couldn\u2019t fight. It\u2019s a shame. But I don\u2019t want anyone to drown in their sorrows. It\u2019s the long game, not the short game.\u201d Ruiz\u2019s trainer, Manny Robles, said that his fighter executed their strategy to perfection. \u201cWe had a great game plan: to stay low, not fight tall and work behind the jab,\u201d Robles said. \u201cHit the chest, hit the body. I told him to either fight inside or stay outside. I did not want him to fight at mid-range and put himself in front of the big punches.\u201d The extraordinary result effectively torpedoed the much-anticipated summit meeting between Joshua and Deontay Wilder, who\u2019s held the WBC\u2019s version of the heavyweight championship since 2015. That fight was until Saturday night the biggest that could be made in the sport today, but instead becomes a slain golden goose representing a cautionary tale for the industry on the perils of letting superfights marinate too long. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a true champion,\u201d Wilder tweeted. \u201cHis whole career was consisted of lies, contradictions and gifts. Facts and now we know who was running from who!!!!\u201d Afterward Eddie Hearn, who promotes Joshua, said his fighter would exercise the immediate rematch clause in the fight contract. \u201cAJ got sloppy,\u201d said Hearn during an in-ring interview over a cascade of boos that rang down from the mezzanine. \u201cIt was a beautiful combination in the third round. He was in total control of the fight but he got sloppy and never recovered. Listen, tonight was [Ruiz\u2019s] night but AJ will come back 100% and we will make the rematch in the UK in November or December. But this night now belongs to Andy Ruiz.\u201d He added: \u201cAJ has the heart of a lion and will come back stronger. Now at least we know the opponent for the end of the year in the UK. Absolutely we will enact the immediate rematch. He will be devastated when it sinks in. It makes the fall fight a must win.\u201d Joshua, to his credit, was upbeat in defeat while affirming he wanted a second crack at Ruiz. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t my night,\u201d he said. \u201cI just have to turn it around a few notches and bring it back my way. I don\u2019t want people to drown in their sorrows. This will show I have the power and the strength.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "At least two Australian law firms are considering filing lawsuits against the manufacturer of Roundup after a landmark US court verdict in which a couple were awarded US$2bn after a jury agreed the weedkiller caused their cancer. On Sunday the Sydney Morning Herald reported that a number of local councils in Sydney were reviewing their use of the product, while the Victorian state government has launched its own review of glyphosate \u2013 the active ingredient in Roundup. At the same time, two Australian firms, LHD Laywers and Maurice Blackburn, are investigating a potential lawsuit against the product\u2019s manufacturer, the German pharmaceutical corporation Bayer. It follows a decision by a jury in California ordering Monsanto \u2013 owned by Bayer \u2013 to pay more than $US2bn to a couple who got cancer after using its weedkiller, the third and largest verdict against the company over Roundup in the US. Jonathan Walsh, principal at Maurice Blackburn, told Guardian Australia the firm had fielded \u201chundreds of inquiries\u201d since late 2018 from people exposed to glyphosate. \u201cIt\u2019s people from all walks of life, mums and dads using the product every weekend doing the garden, to more heavy users like those involved in vegetation management in particular and also people from the farming community where they use a lot of this product day in and day out,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re actively investigating a number of cases and we\u2019re in the stage of getting expert evidence to help support individual actions.\u201d Walsh said Maurice Blackburn had considered a class action but \u201cat this stage we\u2019re not pursuing that angle\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say we\u2019ve ruled it out, we\u2019re still keeping it active, but we\u2019re looking at individual cases presently,\u201d he said. But another firm, LHD, is currently circulating a class action investigation statement. \u201cMonsanto (now Bayer), the creator of Roundup, is facing claims the company failed to warn users that extended exposure to the weedkiller has been linked to certain forms of cancer,\u201d it states. \u201cAs a result, thousands of lawsuits have been filed by cancer victims against Monsanto in the US, alleging that the weedkiller causes cancer.

While Monsanto and Bayer insist the product is safe, in 2015 the World Health Organisation\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer ruled glyphosate was \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d. In April the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry published a 257-page report saying it could not rule out a link between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma and suggesting more research was needed. However, in an interim decision in May, the US Environmental Protection Agency found the product does not cause cancer or other health problems if it is used according to instruction labels, and in Australia the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority says the product is safe if used correctly. To date there have been no cases centred on the product run in Australia, but in the US Bayer has lost three court battles against people suffering cancer in the last 12 months while there are reportedly another 13,000 plaintiffs lining up to sue the company. In May, a jury in California ruled on Monday that Monsanto was liable for the non-Hodgkin lymphoma of Alva and Alberta Pilliod. The jury ordered the company to pay $1bn in damages to each of them, and more than $55m total in compensatory damages. That decision followed two consecutive trial wins for families taking on Monsanto over Roundup, which research has linked to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer that affects the immune system. Dewayne Johnson, a former school groundskeeper with terminal cancer, won a $289m victory in state court last year, and Edwin Hardeman, who sprayed Roundup on his properties, was awarded $80m in the first federal trial this year. Following the Pillio case, Bayer released a statement saying it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the decision and planned to appeal. \u201cWe have great sympathy for Mr and Mrs Pilliod, but the evidence in this case was clear that both have long histories of illnesses known to be substantial risk factors for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL), most NHL has no known cause, and there is not reliable scientific evidence to conclude that glyphosate-based herbicides were the \u2018but for\u2019 cause of their illnesses as the jury was required to find in this case,\u201d Bayer said at the time.",

It\u2019s strange you know. If you live until you\u2019re 70, historically speaking, then you can\u2019t really complain. So, I felt that I couldn\u2019t complain. But it\u2019s just that it [death] would be disappointing, that\u2019s all. I think death is disappointing but not something you can complain about at that age. Especially when you go to have chemotherapy ... and you see people in their 20s and people without hope ... I was most philosophical about it when I wasn\u2019t having chemotherapy because chemotherapy makes you feel so unbelievably sick that it\u2019s hard not to let it affect you psychologically. The first two months I thought this is going to be a breeze, the last two months were shocking. Anyway, how lucky can you be? A lot luckier than those who don\u2019t make it.\u201d</p> <p>We are sitting in a hotel bar in Adelaide. Watson looks healthy \u2013 lean, clear-eyed and fit. I\u2019ve just interviewed him and two other authors at an Adelaide Writers\u2019 Week event. It was a good show, Watson being a crowd favourite for his dry wit and skill as a raconteur.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was most philosophical when I wasn\u2019t having chemotherapy because chemotherapy makes you feel so unbelievably sick</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We talk a lot about death this day.</p> <p>Some who know Watson well might say this is illustrative of his affinity with that shadow-world of emotional chiaroscuro where he sometimes dwells for inspiration.</p> <p>It was Keating who said with Exocet pejorative intent at the launch of Watson\u2019s 2002 book about the former PM, <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/no-reconciliation-for-bleeding-heart-20110818-1iynh.html\">Recollections of a Bleeding Heart</a>, that the writer had the inclinations of a bat because, \u201che always heads back to the darkness to feed\u201d. (The pair fell out, and infamously so, over the book. Watson, these days, declines to speak publicly about their broken relationship. Salt and wounds.)</p> <p>But it<em> is</em> fitting that Watson dwell on mortality given his recent skirmish with it. We also traverse spirituality, faith, the great Australian mateship legend, Anzac mythology and Australia\u2019s failure \u2013 or refusal \u2013 to come to historic reckoning with its violent frontier and the mass killing of Indigenous people.</p> <p>Watson\u2019s writing \u2013 whether it\u2019s in a lush long-form narrative like The Bush, at mid-length in his essay, On Indignation, or the short-form musings he\u2019s published in every major Australian journal over five decades on everything from football and political leadership to American imperialism and George Orwell \u2013 stands on literary economy, technical elegance and, most of all, emotional and sensory precision.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/08/hillary-clinton-is-running-on-a-progressive-ticket-now-but-will-it-be-the-colour-of-her-presidency\">Hillary Clinton is running on a progressive ticket now, but will it be the colour of her presidency? | Don Watson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even for a now 70-year-old who\u2019s been writing for so many decades, the Watson catalogue is deep and rich.

Could you have done it 10 years ago for example?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s an interesting question. It never occurred to me. Morrie Schwartz [friend and owner of Black Inc publishers] told me to do it. He said, \u2018Your publisher should do it\u2019. And, look, it\u2019s alright. I don\u2019t know if collections are a good idea. But there it is. I don\u2019t think it will sell. I don\u2019t think it has sold. It might\u2019ve sold a couple of thousand copies. I don\u2019t read collections. I don\u2019t assume other people do either.

Such droll Watson whimsy on writing, on the human condition, on the universe, coupled with his endearing modesty, are partly why his legions of old and young readers are dedicated to his work and turn up in droves to hear him at festivals and publicity gigs.</p> <p>In 2018 Watson was too ill to write. But he has now returned to the projects he put in abeyance for a while after the leukaemia diagnosis.</p> <p>The first is a rewrite of his 1984 book <a href=\"https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/16610016?q&amp;versionId=44732219\">The Story of Australia</a>, a history aimed at 12- to 14-year-old readers. The other is his long-term objective to tell the story of the biological anthropologist Neville White, an Australian Vietnam veteran who has dedicated his life to helping the Donydji community of North East Arnhem Land attain sustainability. It is something of a labour of love for Watson, who first met White at La Trobe University in 1968, when the former soldier had just returned from his tour of duty in Vietnam.</p> <p>Every year for decades White took a team of Vietnam vets, many who suffered post-traumatic stress disorder, to Donydji to construct houses and public buildings and to train the young Yolngu men of the community in various trades.</p> <p>\u201cThey would go there every winter \u2026 and they would stay there for two or three months. And they would build houses \u2013 do all the stuff the bureaucracy failed to do,\u201d Watson says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Big brawny vets, rattling with pills a lot of them, working for nothing, some of them with Bjelke-Petersen attitudes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was a mixture of these big brawny vets, rattling with pills a lot of them, working for nothing, doing this stuff, some of them with Bjelke-Petersen attitudes towards everything. But they [the Yolngu] loved these guys. And over the years Neville filled thousands of notebooks copying down everything that he knew about them [the Aboriginal custodians]. He mapped the dreaming lines up there with his GPS, learnt their language. So there\u2019s all this very rich material. And somehow I\u2019m trying to write a book about it all. There\u2019s a lot in it. But it doesn\u2019t really have a shape yet. One hopes that it will find that in the end.\u201d</p> <p>Watson\u2019s books always find their narrative shape, often through a fusion of landscape, natural and built, travel, experience and memory. The Bush, for example, was a journey through country (in both the Indigenous and continental sense) that challenged Australians, urban coastal plain dwellers that we mostly are, to contemplate life in the towns and the remote, lonely, often melancholic emptiness beyond. It is the bush, as a place and as a state of mind, that is as central to that other mythologised place, Gallipoli, to Australians\u2019 storied sense of who we are. It was beautiful, poetic, hypnotic, unsettling \u2013 an antipodean equivalent in some ways, perhaps, to the non-fiction of the American nature writer and novelist, Barry Lopez, whose most recent book, Horizon, also traverses Australia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4640c187070d5f977006f0b858ccca1cb268791d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4640c187070d5f977006f0b858ccca1cb268791d/0_210_3744_4680/800.jpg\" alt=\"Don Watson thinks Australian mateship is based on the great silence William Stanner was talking about in his 1968 Boyer Lecture\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don Watson thinks the great silence William Stanner speaks about in his 1968 Boyer Lecture is what mateship is based on.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Chew</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not surprising to learn that Watson knows Lopez and has visited the American writer at his home on the western side of the Cascade range along the McKenzie River in Oregon.</p> <p>Lopez, like Watson, is renowned for his prolific output (he\u2019s written seven major non-fiction books and published hundreds of essays, and Horizon is the consequence of 30 years of travel and contemplation), as a meditative, elegant stylist and for his broad emotional range.</p> <p>Lopez has also published 10 works of fiction.</p> <p>Q: Have you contemplated writing a novel?</p> <p>\u201cOh very much. Still am. In fact when I couldn\u2019t write anything, when I stopped writing \u2026 when I got sick, what I did do was tap away at a couple of novels I\u2019d had an idea about for years. But I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be in a position to finish them. Or whether it\u2019s a good idea at my age.\u201d</p> <p>Q: Is that because you feel like you don\u2019t have the energy?</p> <p>\u201cThat and because I\u2019ve got to make a living and, you know, to take up fiction at this stage \u2013 it\u2019s probably not a smart idea. But I was doing some work on a TV series, some editing, after Christmas and that was fun. And I\u2019ve written a couple of films \u2013 I\u2019ve written about five films. Two of which were made. And I loved it! You know, I hate non-fiction. I hate being trapped in facts. I\u2019m hopelessly organised. I\u2019ve got crap everywhere. It\u2019s so hard to get the muse happening. Non-fiction \u2013 it takes so much organising to get the wheels on the rails. Whereas fiction would be a pure pleasure.\u201d</p> <p>Like many authors Watson tends to measure the future in terms of books not written and others still to be read.</p> <p>Which brings us back to mortality \u2013 something he hadn\u2019t much pondered until his own recent brush with it, even though he has had a lot of friends die over recent times including a good mate, four years ago.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am interested in religion you see.

We were sitting out in his backyard. And you realise that you\u2019re separated by the thinnest of membranes between one world and the absent next. You know, the abyss is just over there,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Watson is from rural Presbyterian stock. Does he share the faith of ancestors?</p> <p>\u201cNo. I feel that as a burden. It must be fantastic to have a faith but I don\u2019t. My father was a good Presbyterian. But no. I think it\u2019s all over when it\u2019s over. I think it\u2019s a beautiful thing. But sadly fallacious \u2026 I still like the sound of a good hymn, though, you know. That can still move me \u2026 and I still read the Bible a lot. Not for any religious reason. I just like the sound of the King James version. I am interested in religion you see. And that\u2019d be the thing about dying now \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t mind reading more about religion. There\u2019s all those things I haven\u2019t read enough about yet.\u201d</p> <p>For a decade Watson was an academic historian. And Australian historiography\u2019s negotiation of death, not Watson\u2019s own or his friends\u2019, but those of the tens of thousands of Indigenous people murdered on the Australian post-invasion frontier, occupied much of this conversation as they have his various writings.</p> <p>The anthropologist William Stanner, who delivered the 1968 Boyer Lectures \u2013 After the Dreaming, in which he coined the term the \u201cgreat Australian silence\u201d to describe <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/friday-essay-the-great-australian-silence-50-years-on-100737\">history\u2019s wilful ignorance of frontier violence</a> \u2013 was, Watson believes, \u201cthe profound writer of the 20th century in Australia\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat essay on the Dreaming is a startling thing ... he was just such a powerful writer and, you know, in such an individual way. I remember those Boyer Lectures. Nobody had ever done Boyer Lectures that had anything like as much profundity in them I think. Australian mateship was based on that great silence he talks about, I think.\u201d</p> <p>Q: What do you mean?</p> <p>\u201cWell I think what reinforces the silence in a place like Cloncurry [close to Battle Mountain, one of the more remarkable Australian sites of resistance and subsequent massacre] for instance? I mean you\u2019ll read it in Mary Durack [whose books <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/19/the-legacy-reverberates-how-a-repulsive-image-reminds-us-of-our-ugly-past\">mythologised pastoral expansion in the Kimberley</a> but sugar-coated the violence against Aboriginal people]. Just keep it under your hat. You know, the bad stuff? If you had to kill a few Blacks a bloke would never dob you in. I think that underpins a whole lot of things about Australia\u2019s character. There was always that contradiction between Myall Creek and what happened afterwards. You know, no one ever went down [for murdering Aboriginal people] after that. And the massacres only got worse. Largely because of the silence. And governments turned blind eyes.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/22/the-bush-by-don-watson-review-driven-by-the-burning-truth\">The Bush by Don Watson review \u2013 driven by the burning truth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This belies the Australian myth of mateship that would have some unique, nation-defining bond between men forged while stump-digging in the Mallee or in the shrapnel-peppered hills of an obscure finger of the Ottomans.</p> <p>Mateship was not, of course, unique to the Australians who fought at Gallipoli.

The prognosis was not good but a combination of selection and chemicals cured me.\u201d The thought of leaving a young family didn\u2019t make the initial prognosis any easier, he says. \u201cThat certainly gives it a different dimension. It\u2019s strange you know. If you live until you\u2019re 70, historically speaking, then you can\u2019t really complain. So, I felt that I couldn\u2019t complain. But it\u2019s just that it [death] would be disappointing, that\u2019s all. I think death is disappointing but not something you can complain about at that age. Especially when you go to have chemotherapy ... and you see people in their 20s and people without hope ... I was most philosophical about it when I wasn\u2019t having chemotherapy because chemotherapy makes you feel so unbelievably sick that it\u2019s hard not to let it affect you psychologically. The first two months I thought this is going to be a breeze, the last two months were shocking. Anyway, how lucky can you be? A lot luckier than those who don\u2019t make it.\u201d We are sitting in a hotel bar in Adelaide. Watson looks healthy \u2013 lean, clear-eyed and fit. I\u2019ve just interviewed him and two other authors at an Adelaide Writers\u2019 Week event. It was a good show, Watson being a crowd favourite for his dry wit and skill as a raconteur. We talk a lot about death this day. Some who know Watson well might say this is illustrative of his affinity with that shadow-world of emotional chiaroscuro where he sometimes dwells for inspiration. It was Keating who said with Exocet pejorative intent at the launch of Watson\u2019s 2002 book about the former PM, Recollections of a Bleeding Heart, that the writer had the inclinations of a bat because, \u201che always heads back to the darkness to feed\u201d. (The pair fell out, and infamously so, over the book. Watson, these days, declines to speak publicly about their broken relationship. Salt and wounds.) But it is fitting that Watson dwell on mortality given his recent skirmish with it. We also traverse spirituality, faith, the great Australian mateship legend, Anzac mythology and Australia\u2019s failure \u2013 or refusal \u2013 to come to historic reckoning with its violent frontier and the mass killing of Indigenous people. Watson\u2019s writing \u2013 whether it\u2019s in a lush long-form narrative like The Bush, at mid-length in his essay, On Indignation, or the short-form musings he\u2019s published in every major Australian journal over five decades on everything from football and political leadership to American imperialism and George Orwell \u2013 stands on literary economy, technical elegance and, most of all, emotional and sensory precision. Even for a now 70-year-old who\u2019s been writing for so many decades, the Watson catalogue is deep and rich. He has written 13 books, thousands of articles and published hundreds of essays. His most recent book, There it is again \u2013 Collected Writings, is, therefore, something of a selector\u2019s triumph, featuring republished standalone works from his archive and excerpts from other books. It\u2019s a wonderful, open-at-any-page compendium, a polymath\u2019s showpiece and a testimony to the range of one of Australia\u2019s greatest living (thankfully) male non-fiction writers. Q: At what point in your writing life do you decide to do a collection? Could you have done it 10 years ago for example? \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s an interesting question. It never occurred to me. Morrie Schwartz [friend and owner of Black Inc publishers] told me to do it. He said, \u2018Your publisher should do it\u2019. And, look, it\u2019s alright. I don\u2019t know if collections are a good idea. But there it is. I don\u2019t think it will sell. I don\u2019t think it has sold. It might\u2019ve sold a couple of thousand copies. I don\u2019t read collections. I don\u2019t assume other people do either. Anyway, it\u2019s there.\u201d That might just be the sound of the collective sharp exhalation of publishing PRs. Or maybe not. Such droll Watson whimsy on writing, on the human condition, on the universe, coupled with his endearing modesty, are partly why his legions of old and young readers are dedicated to his work and turn up in droves to hear him at festivals and publicity gigs. In 2018 Watson was too ill to write. But he has now returned to the projects he put in abeyance for a while after the leukaemia diagnosis. The first is a rewrite of his 1984 book The Story of Australia, a history aimed at 12- to 14-year-old readers. The other is his long-term objective to tell the story of the biological anthropologist Neville White, an Australian Vietnam veteran who has dedicated his life to helping the Donydji community of North East Arnhem Land attain sustainability. It is something of a labour of love for Watson, who first met White at La Trobe University in 1968, when the former soldier had just returned from his tour of duty in Vietnam. Every year for decades White took a team of Vietnam vets, many who suffered post-traumatic stress disorder, to Donydji to construct houses and public buildings and to train the young Yolngu men of the community in various trades. \u201cThey would go there every winter \u2026 and they would stay there for two or three months. And they would build houses \u2013 do all the stuff the bureaucracy failed to do,\u201d Watson says. \u201cIt was a mixture of these big brawny vets, rattling with pills a lot of them, working for nothing, doing this stuff, some of them with Bjelke-Petersen attitudes towards everything. But they [the Yolngu] loved these guys. And over the years Neville filled thousands of notebooks copying down everything that he knew about them [the Aboriginal custodians]. He mapped the dreaming lines up there with his GPS, learnt their language. So there\u2019s all this very rich material. And somehow I\u2019m trying to write a book about it all. There\u2019s a lot in it. But it doesn\u2019t really have a shape yet. One hopes that it will find that in the end.\u201d Watson\u2019s books always find their narrative shape, often through a fusion of landscape, natural and built, travel, experience and memory. The Bush, for example, was a journey through country (in both the Indigenous and continental sense) that challenged Australians, urban coastal plain dwellers that we mostly are, to contemplate life in the towns and the remote, lonely, often melancholic emptiness beyond. It is the bush, as a place and as a state of mind, that is as central to that other mythologised place, Gallipoli, to Australians\u2019 storied sense of who we are. It was beautiful, poetic, hypnotic, unsettling \u2013 an antipodean equivalent in some ways, perhaps, to the non-fiction of the American nature writer and novelist, Barry Lopez, whose most recent book, Horizon, also traverses Australia. It\u2019s not surprising to learn that Watson knows Lopez and has visited the American writer at his home on the western side of the Cascade range along the McKenzie River in Oregon. Lopez, like Watson, is renowned for his prolific output (he\u2019s written seven major non-fiction books and published hundreds of essays, and Horizon is the consequence of 30 years of travel and contemplation), as a meditative, elegant stylist and for his broad emotional range. Lopez has also published 10 works of fiction. Q: Have you contemplated writing a novel? \u201cOh very much. Still am. In fact when I couldn\u2019t write anything, when I stopped writing \u2026 when I got sick, what I did do was tap away at a couple of novels I\u2019d had an idea about for years. But I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be in a position to finish them. Or whether it\u2019s a good idea at my age.\u201d Q: Is that because you feel like you don\u2019t have the energy? \u201cThat and because I\u2019ve got to make a living and, you know, to take up fiction at this stage \u2013 it\u2019s probably not a smart idea. But I was doing some work on a TV series, some editing, after Christmas and that was fun. And I\u2019ve written a couple of films \u2013 I\u2019ve written about five films. Two of which were made. And I loved it! You know, I hate non-fiction. I hate being trapped in facts. I\u2019m hopelessly organised. I\u2019ve got crap everywhere. It\u2019s so hard to get the muse happening. Non-fiction \u2013 it takes so much organising to get the wheels on the rails. Whereas fiction would be a pure pleasure.\u201d Like many authors Watson tends to measure the future in terms of books not written and others still to be read. Which brings us back to mortality \u2013 something he hadn\u2019t much pondered until his own recent brush with it, even though he has had a lot of friends die over recent times including a good mate, four years ago. \u201cThree or four of us gathered, it was probably a month before he died. We were sitting out in his backyard. And you realise that you\u2019re separated by the thinnest of membranes between one world and the absent next. You know, the abyss is just over there,\u201d he says. Watson is from rural Presbyterian stock. Does he share the faith of ancestors? \u201cNo. I feel that as a burden. It must be fantastic to have a faith but I don\u2019t. My father was a good Presbyterian. But no. I think it\u2019s all over when it\u2019s over. I think it\u2019s a beautiful thing. But sadly fallacious \u2026 I still like the sound of a good hymn, though, you know. That can still move me \u2026 and I still read the Bible a lot. Not for any religious reason. I just like the sound of the King James version. I am interested in religion you see. And that\u2019d be the thing about dying now \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t mind reading more about religion. There\u2019s all those things I haven\u2019t read enough about yet.\u201d For a decade Watson was an academic historian. And Australian historiography\u2019s negotiation of death, not Watson\u2019s own or his friends\u2019, but those of the tens of thousands of Indigenous people murdered on the Australian post-invasion frontier, occupied much of this conversation as they have his various writings. The anthropologist William Stanner, who delivered the 1968 Boyer Lectures \u2013 After the Dreaming, in which he coined the term the \u201cgreat Australian silence\u201d to describe history\u2019s wilful ignorance of frontier violence \u2013 was, Watson believes, \u201cthe profound writer of the 20th century in Australia\u201d. \u201cThat essay on the Dreaming is a startling thing ... he was just such a powerful writer and, you know, in such an individual way. I remember those Boyer Lectures. Nobody had ever done Boyer Lectures that had anything like as much profundity in them I think. Australian mateship was based on that great silence he talks about, I think.\u201d Q: What do you mean? \u201cWell I think what reinforces the silence in a place like Cloncurry [close to Battle Mountain, one of the more remarkable Australian sites of resistance and subsequent massacre] for instance? I mean you\u2019ll read it in Mary Durack [whose books mythologised pastoral expansion in the Kimberley but sugar-coated the violence against Aboriginal people]. Just keep it under your hat. You know, the bad stuff? If you had to kill a few Blacks a bloke would never dob you in. I think that underpins a whole lot of things about Australia\u2019s character. There was always that contradiction between Myall Creek and what happened afterwards. You know, no one ever went down [for murdering Aboriginal people] after that. And the massacres only got worse. Largely because of the silence. And governments turned blind eyes.\u201d This belies the Australian myth of mateship that would have some unique, nation-defining bond between men forged while stump-digging in the Mallee or in the shrapnel-peppered hills of an obscure finger of the Ottomans. Mateship was not, of course, unique to the Australians who fought at Gallipoli. The survival of the troops of myriad ethnic backgrounds who made up the Ottoman forces \u2013 those Australia short-hands as \u201cthe Turks\u201d \u2013 relied equally upon one another for mutual survival and endurance. \u201cI think the worst thing is that Anzac was originally for the battalions \u2013 you know, for the people who\u2019d fought. And now it\u2019s become this big national thing that is poorly understood and more and more it\u2019s like a national religion.\u201d From there he segues to the Australian War Memorial and onto political leadership ... and on the conversation with Don Watson goes. A year ago it might\u2019ve ended. We can, perhaps, thank Mick Gordon that it didn\u2019t.",

      "bodyText": "A day after the deadliest US mass shooting this year in which 12 people were shot dead at a government building, Elizabeth Warren was asked what she would do to confront an \u201coverwhelming surge\u201d in such events. The Massachusetts senator said she wanted to reframe the question, then continued: \u201cIt\u2019s not just mass shootings.\u201d Every day in America, she said, gun violence occurs \u201con sidewalks and playgrounds and people\u2019s backyards. It\u2019s happening family by family across the country. And it doesn\u2019t get the same headlines. And that is wrong.\u201d In San Francisco on Saturday, Warren was one of 14 candidates for the presidential nomination appearing at the California Democratic convention, seeking to pitch to progressive voters. Her response, delivered at a \u201cBig Ideas\u201d forum hosted by the progressive group MoveOn, echoed what activists of color have argued for years: that the US gun control debate focuses too much on mass shootings and ignores the daily toll of gun violence, which disproportionately affects black and brown Americans. All the frontrunners for the Democratic nomination were in California, except Joe Biden, who was in Ohio. In all, 14 candidates converged, making this the largest gathering so far of 2020 hopefuls.

Both Gillibrand and former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke told the audience they supported legislation to establish a formal process for considering whether black Americans should receive reparations for slavery. Such a move would \u201csquarely confront the legacy of slavery and segregation and Jim Crow,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said, calling it \u201cfundamental to any repairs of the damage that we have caused\u201d.
