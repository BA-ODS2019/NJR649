      "bodyText": "Alan Turing, the scientist known for helping crack the Enigma code during the second world war and pioneering the modern computer, has been chosen to appear on the new \u00a350 note. The mathematician was selected from a list of almost 1,000 scientists in a decision that recognised both his role in fending off the threat of German U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic and the impact of his postwar persecution for homosexuality. The announcement by the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, completes the official rehabilitation of Turing, who played a pivotal role at the Bletchley Park code and cipher centre. While at Bletchley Park, Turing came up with ways to break German ciphers, including improvements to pre-second world war Polish methods for finding the settings for German Enigma machines. Carney said on Monday: \u201cAlan Turing was an outstanding mathematician whose work has had an enormous impact on how we live today. As the father of computer science and artificial intelligence, as well as [a] war hero, Alan Turing\u2019s contributions were far ranging and path breaking. Turing is a giant on whose shoulders so many now stand.\u201d The Bank praised Turing for his role as a scientist and for the impact he has had on society. Prosecuted for homosexual acts in 1952, an inquest concluded his death from cyanide poisoning two years later was suicide. The Bank acknowledged Turing\u2019s pivotal role in the development of early computers, first at the National Physical Laboratory and later at the University of Manchester. \u201cHe set the foundations for work on artificial intelligence by considering the question of whether machines could think,\u201d the Bank said. \u201cTuring was homosexual and was posthumously pardoned by the Queen, having been convicted of gross indecency for his relationship with a man. His legacy continues to have an impact on both science and society today.\u201d Peter Tatchell, the veteran gay rights campaigner, said the \u00a350 note announcement was a \u201cmuch-deserved accolade for one of the greatest minds of the 20th century\u201d. Turing\u2019s face will appear on the new \u00a350 polymer note when it goes into circulation in 2021, following a public consultation process designed to honour an eminent British scientist. The Bank said it had received a total of 227,299 nominations, covering 989 eligible characters. These were narrowed down to a shortlist of 12, with Carney making the final choice. The shortlisted characters, or pairs of characters, were Mary Anning, Paul Dirac, Rosalind Franklin, William Herschel and Caroline Herschel, Dorothy Hodgkin, Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, Stephen Hawking, James Clerk Maxwell, Srinivasa Ramanujan, Ernest Rutherford, Frederick Sanger, and Alan Turing.

Asked by the Guardian whether the new \u00a350 note was a missed opportunity to reflect diverse modern Britain, Carney said the Bank wanted to celebrate \u201call aspects of diversity\u201d and that \u201cto not represent the scale of scientific achievement in this country would be a mistake\u201d.

What we have today is a celebration of one of the greatest mathematicians and scientists in the United Kingdom and not just this country\u2019s history but world history.\u201d The note was unveiled at Manchester\u2019s Museum of Science and Industry, a short walk from the Manchester University building where Turing helped develop programming for the Ferranti Mark 1, the world\u2019s first commercially available electronic computer. A new exhibition at the museum showcases several artefacts connected to the pioneering scientist, including an original Enigma cipher machine used in the second world war, electronic components for a Ferranti Mark 1 computer and a Manchester University marketing brochure from 1951 with a photograph of Turing leaning over a computer. It was also in Manchester where the campaign to clear Turing\u2019s name began.

On Tuesday McCormack said he could understand the \u201cfrustration\u201d of the proponents of the Carmichael mine. \u201cThey were made to jump through more environmental hoops than perhaps any previous project in the nation,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s AM. \u201cAnd no doubt they wanted to determine \u2026 that those arguing against their proposals were not just some quasi anti-development groups or individuals.\u201d McCormack said he \u201cappreciated\u201d Adani\u2019s move could be seen as intimidating but defended the company by claiming there were \u201cmany, many people under lots and lots of banners saying things and suggesting things about Adani that \u2026 weren\u2019t true\u201d. When pressed, McCormack accepted that the CSIRO was \u201cindependent\u201d, adding that he respected its work \u201cand always will\u201d. CSIRO staff association secretary Sam Popovski told the ABC the revelations were alarming, and that Adani also trawled through scientists\u2019 social media accounts. \u201cWe\u2019re very concerned on behalf of our scientists at the CSIRO that a big company would go into looking at the personal lives of our members, including trawling their social media, in order to potentially discredit their work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was clear that Adani seemed to be suggesting bias, or potential bias, way before any of the scientific evidence was actually presented to the department.\u201d The scientists\u2019 names were not handed over, the federal environment department has said. Adani said it had written to the department in January to request \u201cassurance that individuals involved in any review processes were independent\u201d. This followed \u201cconcerning reports at the time that the state environmental regulator had commissioned a review which constituted individuals who had expressed anti-coal, anti-mining sentiments\u201d, it said.",

The Ministry of Defence has announced measures to persuade victims of such behaviours to come forward after the report concluded that many have stayed silent for fear of being seen as a troublemaker. \u201cMany simply consider that reporting inappropriate behaviour would get them nowhere,\u201d according to the report by Air Chief Marshal Michael Wigston, the new chief of the Air Staff. The report was commissioned in April after allegations surfaced of a sexual assault against a teenage female soldier. It said a \u201cnew generation\u201d of armed forces personnel, including a greater proportion of people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, women and other \u201cunderrepresented groups\u201d, had \u201cgrown up in a more open and permissive society\u201d than their forebears, it found. However, those people now often find themselves \u201cled by a cohort described by one external organisation as a \u2018pack mentality of white middle-aged men, especially in positions of influence\u2019 whose behaviours are shaped by the Armed Forces of 20 years ago\u201d. It added that a \u201csignificant number\u201d of military personnel have experienced \u201cbullying, discrimination and harassment, including sexual\u201d and that there was a \u201cdeficit of trust\u201d in complaints systems, with women and people of minority ethnic heritage more likely to find themselves dragged into disputes. There have been \u201crepeated suggestions\u201d that those in the military are not reporting inappropriate behaviour because they fear the consequences of doing so, the report said. It added that some personnel thinking about making complaints were worried about the \u201cimpact on their career prospects\u201d and \u201cbeing perceived as a trouble-maker\u201d, while \u201cmany simply consider that reporting inappropriate behaviour would get them nowhere\u201d. The armed forces were also found to be lagging behind wider society in dealing with issues associated with the #MeToo movement, while the use of language in the military \u201ccan be inappropriate and offensive, simply through a lack of understanding of how it may be perceived by a minority group\u201d. In response, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) announced that the newly created Defence Authority will have a role in investigating allegations such as sexual harassment, bullying and discrimination and give personnel greater opportunities to make complaints anonymously. Other measures included new compulsory diversity and inclusion training and a harassment survey will also be introduced in 2021 as part of a \u201cshift in culture\u201d, according to the department. \u201cWhile the great majority of service men and women go above and beyond what their duty demands of them, there is an unacceptable level of inappropriate behaviour in some areas,\u201d the MoD said. Inappropriate behaviour \u201chas no place in society, let alone in our armed forces\u201d, the defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt, added. \u201cThis report sends a clear message and I am committed to ensuring its recommendations are delivered in full. \u201cIn addition to the report, I want to ensure non-commissioned officers are able to address poor behaviour when they see it.

      "bodyText": "London and the southern regions of England are facing a dearth of teachers, nurses and police officers as rising rents make housing in large parts of the UK unaffordable for key public sector workers. A report by the consultancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers said there was an urgent need to increase the supply of homes after it found that the failure of public sector pay to keep pace with soaring housing costs had made it increasingly hard for workers on modest incomes to make ends meet. Public sector workers have been forced to accept below-inflation pay increases during the government\u2019s austerity drive of the past decade while rents have risen by more than the cost of living. London has witnessed the biggest squeeze on public sector workers but PwC said rising rents in the south-east, the east of England and the south-west meant it was too expensive to live outside the capital and commute in. John Hawksworth, PwC\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cConcerningly, we risk seeing professions that are integral to the UK\u2019s public services struggling to afford to rent in several regions in the UK. It\u2019s not just in London and the south-east that rent levels are pricing certain professions out \u2013 the east and south-west are also unaffordable for many key workers.\u201d PwC said the benchmark for an affordable rent was that it accounted for no more than 30% of an individual\u2019s gross annual income, but that this threshold had been crossed in the high-rent hot spots in the more prosperous parts of Britain. In London, workers in their 20s were spending more than half their incomes on rent, making it impossible for them to save up the deposit to buy a home. Hawksworth said that in Scotland and Wales, private rent levels were on average more affordable across professions, with the affordability ratio ranging between 15% and 22%, although he added that this might not be the case in cities such as Edinburgh or Cardiff. \u201cThe last five years has seen rental affordability ratios deteriorate and, in the UK as a whole, the amount spent on rent over this period has grown by 8%, while at the same time earnings growth remains relatively weak and below levels seen before the financial crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not only having an impact on social mobility, it will also hinder national productivity growth in the longer term by preventing people from moving to places in the UK where they can be most productive.\u201d Prison officers had the worst rental affordability ratios in London in 2017-2018, with housing costs accounting for 45% of their income.

There should be enough crockery, but it\u2019s always worth them taking an extra glass, cup, bowl, and plate. Many students recommend a multi-plug extension, as there\u2019s often a lack of plug sockets in rooms, and light sleepers should bring earplugs \u2013 maybe an eyemask too.

      "bodyText": "As your child heads off for a new independent life at university, you have one last chance to make sure they\u2019re prepared \u2013 so when it comes to packing that car you\u2019ll want to make sure every item warrants its space. First off, check with the university or accommodation provider to find out what they provide \u2013 many of the rooms in halls of residence and rented houses will have some of the basics, including a bed, desk, wardrobe, bedside table and chair. Although some unis also provide duvet covers and sheets, you may prefer to splash out on some new linen instead, so it\u2019s essential to know the size of the bed. Given the likelihood of a springy bed, a mattress protector is a sound investment too. You could try slipping a framed photo of the family into a box so they have something to remember you by, but, equally, your offspring may want to cover the walls with snaps of that Ibiza trip they all took as a final school-leaving hurrah. It\u2019s all about personalising this blank canvas of a new room. Lobby for a few low-maintenance plants to help generate a healthy homely atmosphere in their new space. If you\u2019re worried about them making friends, arm your child with some icebreakers \u2013 and that all-important doorstop, to encourage others to come wandering into their room. Board games have been enjoying a resurgence, as well as branching into new areas \u2013 dinosaur evolution anyone? \u2013 whereas the likes of Cards Against Humanity are best played once a few barriers (and drinks) are down. But back to the practical stuff \u2026 You\u2019ll need to cram in a clothes horse, a couple of towels, a laundry bag \u2013 for the weekly pilgrimage to the washing machine \u2013 a tin opener and bottle opener. There should be enough crockery, but it\u2019s always worth them taking an extra glass, cup, bowl, and plate. Many students recommend a multi-plug extension, as there\u2019s often a lack of plug sockets in rooms, and light sleepers should bring earplugs \u2013 maybe an eyemask too. A bike will give them a bit of freedom to explore on their own, if communal living becomes a bit much (and you have a roof rack). You may as well stock up on toiletries, washing powder and the like, because heading to the supermarket may not be top of your offspring\u2019s priority list. Stash away some condoms, too, if your relationship functions on that level, and a medical kit. They\u2019ll certainly thank you for a box of hardy and non-perishable food too \u2013 think olive oil, sauces, noodles, pasta, rice, beans, pulses, salt, pepper, teabags, coffee and cereal. Still got space? There\u2019s work to do at uni too, so squeeze in highlighters, folders, plastic wallets, pads and pens. And don\u2019t forget ID and any other uni documents they might have been sent. If they need anything else, they can always use the opportunity to knock on their new neighbours\u2019 doors and say hello. Download our parents\u2019 guide to uni supplement (pdf)",

With De Gea now in the final year of his contract, United have been trying for the last 18 months to persuade the Spain international to agree new terms and abandon thoughts of moving to another club. United\u2019s stance has never altered but the matter has been complicated by De Gea\u2019s advisers insisting their client receives a financial package that recognises he has been the club\u2019s player-of-the-year in four out of the last six seasons. De Gea\u2019s financial requirements are said to be significantly higher than the widely reported numbers of \u00a3350,000 a week and, though United have been keen to find a resolution, the numbers being so high explain why it has been such a difficult and drawn-out process. If everything goes according to plan and De Gea agrees to remain in Manchester, he will become the best-paid goalkeeper in the history of the sport.

As well as challenging Manchester City for the signing of the England centre-back Harry Maguire from Leicester, there have been discussions at Old Trafford about the potential availability of Sean Longstaff, the Newcastle midfielder. However, it is not clear yet whether that will result in a bid being tabled and, if not, it may be more that they keep close tabs on the 21-year-old over the coming season. One player who will not be moving to Old Trafford is Mario Lemina of Southampton, the suspicion being that the Gabonese midfielder has been erroneously linked to Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s team in an attempt to attract genuine bids from other clubs. Paul Pogba\u2019s hopes of leaving United this summer are becoming remote with the club receiving no bids for the France midfielder and the transfer window closing in less than a month. The deadline of this summer\u2019s transfer window is 8 August and is an issue regarding any potential deal. Solskj\u00e6r has already lost a midfielder in Ander Herrera, who joined Paris Saint-Germain as a free agent, so if Pogba was to depart it would be difficult for the manager to have to replace a second midfielder in the three and a half weeks left of the window. Real Madrid would like to sign Pogba but their valuation is markedly lower than United\u2019s. Real price him between \u00a3100-120m with United wanting closer to \u00a3170m. Both Pogba and his agent Mino Raiola have recently admitted the player\u2019s wish would be to leave so if he was to stay Solskj\u00e6r would face a challenge to ensure dressing room harmony is not affected.",

      "body": "<p>At the height of the celebrations the Oval resembled a playground at the end of term. There was Joe Root, marching across the pitch, a comet with a tail of schoolchildren in pursuit. A few metres away and another gaggle of kids, probably about 30 of them, had mobbed a TV camera and were screaming \u201cchampions\u201d into the lens.</p> <p>Impromptu fielding practice was underway and everything from caps to miniature cricket bats were seeking autographs. Amid all that, and squired by two burly security guards, Eoin Morgan hustled off the field and into the pavilion, the weighty World Cup trophy held securely in two hands.</p> <p>Speaking later, Morgan admitted he had defaulted to describing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over\" title=\"\">England\u2019s scintillating, graphene-fine victory over New Zealand</a> at Lord\u2019s as \u201cincredible\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jul/15/england-cricket-world-cup-final-reaction-new-zealand-live\">'An all-time-classic': England celebrates Cricket World Cup victory \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve said incredible 50 times since lifting the trophy,\u201d he said, for the 51st time. \u201cI\u2019d never allow myself to imagine winning the World Cup. Cynical me!\u201d The skipper also made a further observation, that he was grateful for those who had stuck with England\u2019s cricketers in tougher times, all those who \u201cbelieved because we believed\u201d.</p> <p>This event at the Oval was a gathering of the believers. In 2005, when England won the Ashes and cricket asserted itself into the public consciousness in a way it never has since, the celebrations were loud, lairy and highly public. The players were drunk and an open top bus tour through central London ended with a shambling trip to No 10. In 2019 Morgan\u2019s men got to meet the Prime Minister, with Theresa May receiving them at Downing Street. But there was no bus tour. Speculation was rife that it may have been considered too risky; what if nobody turned up?</p> <p>During the seven-week duration of the World Cup, a lot has been made about how cricket has declined in the years since Kevin Pietersen stopped putting peroxide in his hair. Much of the debate has focused around TV and the way coverage of the sport has been fenced off on subscription TV. The final, which was aired on Channel 4 as well as Sky Sports, was a rare chance for a broader public to watch. It still attracted many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/15/4-million-britons-watch-cricket-world-cup-final-on-free-to-air\" title=\"\">fewer viewers than the annual treat of Wimbledon</a>, however, and it will probably not be back again until the controversial new competition, The Hundred, hits the BBC next year.</p> <p>Television is important but the message of this event appeared to be it is not everything. What matters is legacy, whether kids are playing the sport, whether in the words of Root: \u201cWe\u2019ve left the sport in a better shape than we found it.\u201d So that is why the kids were there. They came from all backgrounds and ethnicity and gender (a notable visual contrast to the adults in attendance), but they shared an infectious enthusiasm for the sport and had watched the final on their dad\u2019s tablet. They were the legacy.</p> <p>Most were sourced from All Stars Cricket, a scheme for five- to eight-year-olds run by the England and Wales Cricket Board. It attempts to acquaint kids, only 7% of whom currently play the sport, with basic cricket skills. </p> <p>Vyom Srivastava, a 10-year-old whose favourite player is England\u2019s breakthrough fast bowler Jofra Archer, was one of those who took the day off school to attend with his parents. He extolled the scheme\u2019s virtues without taking breath. \u201cIt\u2019s really good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe play mini-matches where you have to hit three balls, we play volcanoes and craters.

      "bodyText": "At the height of the celebrations the Oval resembled a playground at the end of term. There was Joe Root, marching across the pitch, a comet with a tail of schoolchildren in pursuit. A few metres away and another gaggle of kids, probably about 30 of them, had mobbed a TV camera and were screaming \u201cchampions\u201d into the lens. Impromptu fielding practice was underway and everything from caps to miniature cricket bats were seeking autographs. Amid all that, and squired by two burly security guards, Eoin Morgan hustled off the field and into the pavilion, the weighty World Cup trophy held securely in two hands. Speaking later, Morgan admitted he had defaulted to describing England\u2019s scintillating, graphene-fine victory over New Zealand at Lord\u2019s as \u201cincredible\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve said incredible 50 times since lifting the trophy,\u201d he said, for the 51st time. \u201cI\u2019d never allow myself to imagine winning the World Cup. Cynical me!\u201d The skipper also made a further observation, that he was grateful for those who had stuck with England\u2019s cricketers in tougher times, all those who \u201cbelieved because we believed\u201d. This event at the Oval was a gathering of the believers. In 2005, when England won the Ashes and cricket asserted itself into the public consciousness in a way it never has since, the celebrations were loud, lairy and highly public. The players were drunk and an open top bus tour through central London ended with a shambling trip to No 10. In 2019 Morgan\u2019s men got to meet the Prime Minister, with Theresa May receiving them at Downing Street. But there was no bus tour. Speculation was rife that it may have been considered too risky; what if nobody turned up? During the seven-week duration of the World Cup, a lot has been made about how cricket has declined in the years since Kevin Pietersen stopped putting peroxide in his hair. Much of the debate has focused around TV and the way coverage of the sport has been fenced off on subscription TV. The final, which was aired on Channel 4 as well as Sky Sports, was a rare chance for a broader public to watch. It still attracted many fewer viewers than the annual treat of Wimbledon, however, and it will probably not be back again until the controversial new competition, The Hundred, hits the BBC next year. Television is important but the message of this event appeared to be it is not everything. What matters is legacy, whether kids are playing the sport, whether in the words of Root: \u201cWe\u2019ve left the sport in a better shape than we found it.\u201d So that is why the kids were there. They came from all backgrounds and ethnicity and gender (a notable visual contrast to the adults in attendance), but they shared an infectious enthusiasm for the sport and had watched the final on their dad\u2019s tablet. They were the legacy. Most were sourced from All Stars Cricket, a scheme for five- to eight-year-olds run by the England and Wales Cricket Board. It attempts to acquaint kids, only 7% of whom currently play the sport, with basic cricket skills. Vyom Srivastava, a 10-year-old whose favourite player is England\u2019s breakthrough fast bowler Jofra Archer, was one of those who took the day off school to attend with his parents. He extolled the scheme\u2019s virtues without taking breath. \u201cIt\u2019s really good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe play mini-matches where you have to hit three balls, we play volcanoes and craters. We learn lots of different skills.\u201d His friend Maha Ahmed, aged eight, agreed. Her favourite player is Moeen Ali. As the event warmed up, Darius Green had been coaching another group of kids underneath the Oval in the Ken Barrington Cricket Centre. His organisation, Soul Ltd, tries to apply the benefits of sport \u2013 increased fitness, social skills, better mental health \u2013 to youngsters more broadly. His cricket classes are funded by Surrey but they are by no means traditional. Everything in the room is neon, and the wickets are a sideshow, standing at the back of the room. Instead the kids practise throwing, rolling, jumping and catching. \u201cWe\u2019re using elements of the sport to help with more general skill development,\u201d Green said. \u201cAnd cricket is great for a number of skills, from eye-hand co-ordination to speed, endurance and cardio-vascular strength. With it not being a mainstream sport, kids don\u2019t tend to get bogged down in the details of it.\u201d Green\u2019s assessment of cricket as being outside the mainstream will distress some fans but in terms of participation he is correct. In 2016 Sport England\u2019s active people survey found fewer people playing cricket than squash, badminton or bowls. Thanks to Morgan, Archer, Stokes and co, however, cricket is thriving at the elite level. The challenge is for the latter to influence the former. And for everyone to keep on believing.",

Hunt said there would be hefty costs but promised to hand out cash to deal with them. </li> <li><strong>Johnson refused to apologise for homophobic comments he has made in the past.</strong> Both men talked up their records on LGBT rights and Johnson claimed to have been one of the earliest and most vociferous supporters. But he refused to apologise for language he used in newspaper columns in the past that display the opposite.</li> <li><strong>Both men accused Jeremy Corbyn of being antisemitic.</strong> Hunt said: \u201cUnfortunately, he may be,\u201d while Johnson said he had allowed antisemitism to flourish, which amounted to the same thing.</li> <li><strong>Each candidate refused to fully commit to ending the benefits freeze.</strong> But Hunt said he would end the five-week Universal Credit wait and would be sympathetic towards a plan to end a freeze on working age benefits freeze.

You are counsel for the prosecution or defence of an idea, or dream, or fear, hatred, party or politician. You take a brief, elbow doubt and ambiguity aside, and go \u2014 joyously or ferociously but always (in the moment) with passion and conviction \u2014 full pelt. What columnism is not is making absolutely sure first that you\u2019re right. To be frank, you sometimes rather doubt it.</p> <p>Columnism is embracing a plan or project as a faithless man might embrace a woman: with an intensity no less sincere for being passing, ever-ready to flip the project or lady once their usefulness is past.

Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, has been arguing for almost a year that a citizens\u2019 assembly could provide a solution to Brexit. Rory Stewart put the same idea at the heart of his Brexit plan during his short-lived bid for the Conservative party leadership. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/20/the-guardian-view-on-a-brexit-citizens-assembly-the-peoples-voice-is-needed\">the Guardian is also formally backing the idea.</a></p> <p>Unfortunately a Guardian endorsement does not always mean an idea is actually going to happen, and both possible future Tory leaders, as well as Jeremy Corbyn, have expressed no interest at all in using citizens\u2019 assemblies.</p> <p>But, not for the first time, progressive initiatives are being introduced first in Scotland and Wales. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has already announced that <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/news/citizens-assembly-of-scotland/\">she is setting up a citizens\u2019 assembly to consider what kind of country Scotland should be in the future, and how it should handle Brexit.</a> And today the Welsh assembly has announced that Wales\u2019 first citizens\u2019 assembly will meet for the first time in Newton, for three days starting from 19 July. Some 60 citizens were selected to take part, from a pool of 10,000 families randomly invited to apply, and they will consider ways to improve the democratic process in Wales. It is part of a series of events to mark 20 years of devolution.</p> <p><strong>Elin Jones</strong>, the assembly\u2019s presiding officer, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first citizens\u2019 assembly for Wales is a landmark event and an important step on our devolution journey.</p> <p>Public engagement is at the heart of the national assembly\u2019s work. We want people in all parts of Wales to get involved with the democratic process by sharing their views and ideas with us.</p> <p>For a democracy to thrive and improve, everyone must be involved.

Even before she became prime minister she was notorious amongst journalists for her reluctance to any anything indiscreet - Nick Robinson once turned down a lunch with her when she was home secretary and he was BBC political editor because he thought it would be a waste of time - and as PM she has got through countless interviews giving almost nothing away.</p> <p>But another rather less well-known characteristic of hers is that she is, in the words of Tory journalist <strong>Matthew Parris</strong>, \u201ca good hater\u201d. As Parris explained last year <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/she-won-confidence-vote-but-exasperating-theresa-may-is-running-on-empty-wfxq33c7b\">in a very good Times article (paywall)</a> about his various encounters with her:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I learnt that this well-mannered woman was a good hater. At the mention of a particular colleague\u2019s name her lip curled, she made no attempt to conceal her dislike, and rather seemed to enjoy the disdain.</p> </blockquote> <p>In her final days in office this side of May\u2019s character seems to be coming out - at least, a little. The Number 10 lobby briefing this morning (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jul/15/tory-leadership-latest-news-boris-johnson-liam-fox-dismisses-boris-johnsons-plans-for-us-uk-trade-deal-as-unrealistic-live-news?page=with:block-5d2c574d8f08d0b6ca530e0d#block-5d2c574d8f08d0b6ca530e0d\"> 11.48am)</a> seems to give a clue as to what she really feels about the US president who showed his gratitude for a state visit by insulting her in public. I can think of three other examples in recent weeks where she gave a glimpse of who else is on her hate list.</p> <p><strong>1 - Jeremy Corbyn. </strong>May has often denounced Corbyn at PMQs, but <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-07-03/debates/5A86E5BB-2661-4F48-B38C-F33FDCF84499/Engagements\">two weeks ago</a> there seemed to be an added bitterness in her voice as she effectively accused him of hypocrisy, saying Labour had no right to criticise no-deal when it repeatedly voted down her own proposed Brexit deal.</p> <p><strong>2 - Nicola Sturgeon.</strong> Barack Obama once said that the only people determined to obstruct anything he did, regardless of their own interests, were Vladimir Putin and congressional Republicans. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/04/tory-leadership-latest-newst-boris-johnson-jeremy-hunt-backtracks-and-insists-foxhunting-ban-will-not-be-repealed-live-news?page=with:block-5d1e328a8f08c8227e96a6e7#block-5d1e328a8f08c8227e96a6e7\">In a recent speech in Edinburgh, </a>May said something broadly similar about Sturgeon and the Scottish government. </p> <p><strong>3 - Boris Johnson.</strong> May has been reluctant to criticise her likely successor directly, but just occasionally we get a clue as to what she may be thinking privately.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it form us for the evening. You can see my summary of the Tory leadership debate here and a summary of the day\u2019s earlier events here. And, if you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Rowena Mason and Jessica Elgot have the full story: The defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt, who is backing Jeremy Hunt, said after the debate: Tonight, Jeremy again showed that he is the candidate the country can rely on to deliver Brexit and also the leader we need to win a majority at the next general election and take our country forward. Throughout the campaign, and all he has been dealing with as our foreign secretary, he has shown that he is a strong leader with solid judgment based on deeply-held values. He is a leader with a clear vision, deep values and sound judgment. I see it and the public see it. I hope the membership do too because our country needs to come together, get Brexit done and show the world what our country can do. That\u2019s all from this evening\u2019s debate, here\u2019s a summary of the main points: Both candidates to be prime minister refused to explicitly denounce Donald Trump\u2019s comments about ethnic minority congresswomen as racist. While both backed Theresa May\u2019s criticism of the US president, who used racist language to attack political opponents at the weekend, neither was actually willing to describe the remarks in such terms. Boris Johnson refused to commit to lowering the net migration figure after Brexit. His opponent, Jeremy Hunt, said it was what people voted for when they voted to leave the European Union and to ignore that would constitute a \u201cbetrayal\u201d. Johnson refused to say whether or not he had costed the no-deal Brexit he says the UK should seriously consider. He claimed the costs could be minimised with thorough preparation but said the Treasury would come up with \u201cspine-chilling figures\u201d. Hunt said there would be hefty costs but promised to hand out cash to deal with them. Johnson refused to apologise for homophobic comments he has made in the past. Both men talked up their records on LGBT rights and Johnson claimed to have been one of the earliest and most vociferous supporters. But he refused to apologise for language he used in newspaper columns in the past that display the opposite. Both men accused Jeremy Corbyn of being antisemitic. Hunt said: \u201cUnfortunately, he may be,\u201d while Johnson said he had allowed antisemitism to flourish, which amounted to the same thing. Each candidate refused to fully commit to ending the benefits freeze. But Hunt said he would end the five-week Universal Credit wait and would be sympathetic towards a plan to end a freeze on working age benefits freeze. Johnson refused to commit to any plan. Will each continue to freeze fuel duty? Each refuses to say, adding they want to make no more spending commitments. When was the last time each cried? Hunt refuses to answer. Johnson says it was when his bicycle was stolen from outside Parliament. Will Ben Stokes get a knighthood? Each says yes. Would Johnson keep Hunt as foreign secretary? He refuses to say, though he says he holds him in high regard. Johnson says he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019d be right to hand out jobs at this point. Would Hunt return Johnson to the foreign office? He says he would give him a big job. Will they go out for a pint after the contest? Both agree they would. Who do they want to win Love Island? Hunt says he doesn\u2019t watch it. Johnson says he has been watching vaguely, before asking the audience for help. He jokes that Amber should win, deliberately mistaking her for the work and pensions secretary. They are asked: Is Jeremy Corbyn personally antisemitic? \u201cUnfortunately, he may be,\u201d says Hunt, nodding. \u201cI think, by condoning antisemitism in the way he does, I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s effectively culpable of that vice, yes,\u201d says Johnson. The questions from the audience are finished, the candidates are moving to a \u201cquick-fire round\u201d. Each says he would stick to the pledge to achieve zero net carbon emissions by 2050. Asked about the difficulty young people have in getting on the property ladder, Hunt restates his \u201cright to own\u201d policy \u2013 under which he proposes to hand over land that has planning permission and invite young people to pay for a house to be built upon it. Johnson says the UK must build much more \u201cgood quality part buy, part rent\u201d homes to help young people who cannot afford a whole property immediately. These would be built on brownfield sites, he says. Hunt says the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, has persuaded him to end the five-week wait before people can claim Universal Credit, saying it was the right reform but had unexpected consequences. And he says he would look very sympathetically at Rudd\u2019s proposal to end the freeze on working age benefits. Johnson refuses to back the plan, saying he\u2019s \u201cprobably made enough spending commitments in the last week for the time-being\u201d. The pair share a laugh about Rudd\u2019s support as Hunt jokingly offers Johnson the DWP job. Johnson and Hunt are asked what changes they would make to the tax system to help the lowest paid. Johnson says he would raise the threshold for National Insurance and talks up the living wage. He repeats his somewhat opaque claim about his success in cutting poverty in London while serving as its mayor. Hunt says the country cannot afford the reforms he wants to make but, once he feels it can, he commits to allowing people to earn their first \u00a31,000 per month \u201cwithout paying any tax or any National Insurance\u201d. The candidates are asked how much right the public have to know about a potential prime minister\u2019s private life. Hunt says he\u2019s happy to have had his wife with him on the campaign trail. Johnson says he made it a rule years ago not to bring his family into his public life. His private life, of course, was the basis for serious questions about his character earlier in the campaign. Both candidates commit to making a woman either chancellor, foreign secretary or defence secretary. Johnson did so after some hesitation, saying: \u201cYes, I think so. Well, I dunno. I\u2019ve chucked it out there a \u2013 make of it what you will.\u201d The candidates are asked about diversity and LGBT rights \u2013 are they issues that are important to Tories? Both respond that they are proud of their record on the latter while in government. As Johnson finishes a point about having changed the rules to allow British embassies to fly the Rainbow Flag because the country must stand for its values, he is asked if he will, therefore, apologise for writing about \u201ctank-topped bumboys in the Ministry of Sound\u201d in a column. If you\u2019re going to excavate and disinter every single quotation from the millions of words I have written, you can of course try and twist things one way or another but I have a very proud record. He claims he was one of only a small number of Tories to support gay marriage when he was first elected to Parliament. Next question: How will each convince the public they are not simply \u201cself-serving posh boys\u201d. Johnson goes first, saying he will win trust by pushing through Brexit, then by pursuing classic conservative policies, such as backing business. \u201cAs a Charterhouse boy, I\u2019m never going to criticise Boris for going to Eton,\u201d Hunt replies \u2013 adding that the party has not done enough on attracting people. That\u2019s because it hasn\u2019t looked at issues like the cost of living, Hunt says. Asked about the possibility of the UK joining in hypothetical future US military strikes on Iran, both of the candidates say they don\u2019t believe such an outcome is likely and they do not seek a confrontation with the country. The candidates are asked if they back Theresa May\u2019s criticism of Donald Trump. The US president used racist language to attack Democratic congresswomen at the weekend. Hunt says he does and says he would be furious if someone spoke about his children in such terms. Johnson says relations between the two nations are important but that the US president \u201csimply cannot\u201d use such language. He repeatedly refuses to say explicitly whether or not he considers the remarks racist. Hunt says that, as foreign secretary, it wouldn\u2019t be helpful to use that term in reference to the US president. Johnson is asked whether or not he\u2019ll stand up to Donald Trump and asked about the Sir Kim Darroch case. Johnson repeats his line that he was sad to see Darroch resign and, after having influenced that decision by publicly and repeatedly refusing to explicitly back him, he claims he now does support the UK\u2019s outgoing envoy. The final question on Brexit: How likely is a trade deal with US? Hunt says it\u2019s \u201cvery likely\u201d and claims the Trump White House is very enthusiastic about such a move. He says \u201cwe are not going to put the NHS up for sale\u201d and says Trump\u2019s comments on the NHS were \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d. Trump initially said: \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing on trade, everything is on the table. So NHS or anything else. A lot more than that.\u201d Then he changed his mind, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t see [the NHS] being on the table. Somebody asked me a question today and I say everything is up for negotiation, because everything is. But that\u2019s something I would not see as part of trade. That\u2019s not trade.\u201d Read more on that here: Johnson says \u201cwe can start trade negotiations right away\u201d. It\u2019s pointed out to him that that\u2019s illegal and he clarifies that he means immediately after Brexit. He says the US is \u201cruthless\u201d in negotiations and will be \u201cvery, very tough\u201d. But he says the UK can nevertheless do a good deal and that he will not import goods that reduce UK standards. The candidates are asked whether they would prefer a second referendum or a general election if they cannot push through Brexit. Hunt says he will accept neither option and that\u2019s the reason for his refusal to set a hard deadline for Brexit. If he did set one, he says, he would have no option but to call a general election if Parliament blocked his deal. Johnson agrees that neither option is attractive and rules out any general election until Brexit is delivered. It\u2019s perhaps worth noting at this point that, should Brexit be delayed be a significant period, Johnson\u2019s hands would be tied on that point by the Fixed Term Parliaments Act. The candidates are asked how the Good Friday Agreement can be respected in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Johnson refers to a \u201cspirit of optimism\u201d and repeats his claims that the border discussions should be part of the free trade agreement negotiations. Hunt says there cannot be a hard border and that the technology exists to avoid one. But, he acknowledges, such measures are not going to be ready in time for Brexit, meaning there will be a gap. Johnson reiterates his claim that the border question can and should be answered during free trade negotiations \u2013 not as part of the withdrawal agreement. However, Channel 4 News\u2019 FactCheck quotes the European Commission\u2019s spokesperson as saying that \u201cit is possible to rework the Political Declaration on the framework of the future EU-UK relationship, but the Withdrawal Agreement [the deal struck by Theresa May] is not open for renegotiation\u201d. In other words, Johnson is claiming the EU will agree to do something it has explicitly and repeatedly said on the record it has no intention of doing. Johnson is asked how costly a no-deal Brexit would be. He refuses to say whether or not he has costed it, adding that the \u201cTreasury will come up with spine-chilling figures\u201d, but that the cost can be minimised if the UK prepares. Hunt says there are \u201creal costs for businesses\u201d that will not go away. He says he will hand \u00a36bn to farming and fishing communities to minimise the costs. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you can say they\u2019re vanishingly small.\u201d What if the Commons blocks a no-deal Brexit, they are asked? Hunt says his \u201cPlan A\u201d is to avoid such a scenario by securing a deal. He also attacks Johnson over his record while in cabinet, pointing out that he did not resign when the backstop plan was put in place and then subsequently voted for it once (while he acknowledges he voted for it three times). Newton Dunn asks if net immigration will come down under each of the candidates. Johnson says he wants control but refuses to say it will fall. Hunt agrees that control is the point but says people wanted overall levels of net migration to fall when they voted for Brexit. He claims not reduce net levels of immigration would be a betrayal and says the UK must train people currently in the country in order to reduce its reliance on migration to fill key jobs. Johnson says it\u2019s important not to send out a signal to the EU that the UK\u2019s willing to contemplate a further delay. The Sun\u2019s political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, asks if it\u2019s not unreasonable to suggest there\u2019s sufficient time to renegotiate a deal that took two years to negotiate in the first place. Johnson responds that he believes there\u2019s willingness within the EU to do a deal. And he says the UK must prepare for a no deal or risk lacking credibility on the continent. Hunt says he shares the enthusiasm for leaving on 31 October, saying that failing to leave at the end of March was a low-point for British politics. But he says Johnson\u2019s promising something he knows he cannot deliver when he pledges to leave at the end of October regardless of whether or not there\u2019s a deal in place. The foreign secretary says his plan his to be more flexible on the deadline if there\u2019s some sort of deal in place \u2013 though not quite finalised \u2013 at the end of September. The first half of the debate will address questions on Brexit. Luke Black, a Tory member, gets the first question: How can the candidates convince young Tories they are the person to push Brexit through? Johnson says he offers \u201cclarity of purpose\u201d to which the EU will respond. Hunt says he the real question is: \u201cWho has the plan?\u201d Both he and Johnson are willing to pursue no-deal, he says, but it\u2019s high-risk. There\u2019s less risk in sending a prime minister to Brussels to negotiate a deal. One presumes he means himself. The debate begins with one-minute opening statements from the two candidates. Johnson goes first, kicking off with his familiar \u201cget Brexit done\u201d line. Then he moves on to claim he has a plan to win people round to conservatism. Hunt says he too wants to \u201cdeliver Brexit\u201d and \u201cstop Corbyn\u201d. He says people who \u201cthink with their heads as well as their hearts\u201d will favour his plan for the former. And he says he wants to convince more young people to vote for the Conservatives. The head-to-head debate between Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson is about to get underway. We\u2019ll bring you updates from that as they come in. Numerous reports are now coming through that a shadow cabinet meeting will be convened on Monday \u2013 as requested by the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 to discuss claims of antisemitism within the Labour party. Jeremy Corbyn will then face the parliamentary Labour party (PLP). Starmer has demanded that the party work with the EHRC to shine a light on the claims. And Cryer, the PLP\u2019s chair, reportedly had some serious criticism of his own party at this evening\u2019s meeting: An update from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand on that video footage he said showed the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, apparently trying to avoid the cameras after addressing party staff: And there are reports of confrontation at this evening\u2019s PLP meeting over Labour\u2019s response to antisemitism allegations: Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, has posted an interesting Twitter thread looking at what concessions Boris Johnson might get out of Europe. In short - not much, he thinks, but do read the whole thread. It starts here. And last night he published this Brexit forecast. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. This is from Naz Shah, the shadow minister for women, commenting on our story about Boris Johnson arguing in an essay some years ago that Islam caused the Muslim world to be \u201cliterally centuries behind\u201d the west. (See 5.03pm.) Shah said: This is as historically inaccurate as it is Islamophobic. Boris Johnson must fully apologise for his record of racist remarks. After his previous comments describing women wearing the burqa as \u2018letterboxes\u2019 and \u2018bankrobbers\u2019, which has been linked to a rise in hate crime targeting Muslim women, Johnson\u2019s disgraceful views make him unfit to be an MP, let alone prime minister. His words will embolden the Islamophobes who, according to recent polling, make up over half of Conservative party members, who are about to choose the next prime minister of our country. From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand Theresa May held a roundtable in Downing Street today with representatives from the car industry. Number 10 has just sent out a press release that reads a bit like another attempt to define a legacy of sorts for her premiership. Here is an extract. The prime minister also set out a number of new commitments aimed at making electric vehicles more convenient than ever before to own, which were welcomed by attendees including: making England the first place in the world where every new-build home will be fitted with an electric car chargepoint, under a consultation launched today bringing forward plans to regulate chargepoints so that they use \u2018smart\u2019 technology which will send signals to electric vehicles to charge them at different times of the day, encouraging off-peak charging to keep costs down for consumers and helping prepare the energy system for mass uptake of electric vehicles all new rapid and higher powered chargepoints to provide \u2018pay as you go\u2019 debit or credit card payment options by spring 2020 \u2013 ending the current wide variety of payment systems which is a source of frustration for drivers The prime minister reaffirmed the government\u2019s ambition for better access to rapid chargepoints by 2030, following her recent announcement that the office of low emission vehicles will undertake a review to develop a vision for a core network of rapid chargepoints along England\u2019s key roadways. This would allow drivers to access them in a range of locations across the road network, including through and around cities. But one of the biggest issues for the car industry is Brexit, and in particular how no-deal would threaten the just-in-time supply chains used by factories in Britain. The press notice does not mention the risk of no-deal at all. Boris Johnson has been strongly criticised for arguing Islam has caused the Muslim world to be \u201cliterally centuries behind\u201d the west, in an essay unearthed by the Guardian, Frances Perraudin reports. At the risk of over-doing the Matthew Parris references today, Frances\u2019 story is a very good example of a Johnson trait that Parris described in his Times\u2019 column on Saturday (paywall). It is a very perceptive article on an essential Johnson trait. Here\u2019s an extract. There is communism; there is capitalism, Conservatism, Catholicism \u2014 and there is columnism. It\u2019s a cast of mind. Its practitioners are a type. First, foremost and for ever, Boris will be a columnist. The reflections on his and my trade which follow should be read also as thoughts on Johnson himself. Columnism is striking poses which (as any method actor will tell you) will only convince others if you yourself can temporarily inhabit the belief. You are counsel for the prosecution or defence of an idea, or dream, or fear, hatred, party or politician. You take a brief, elbow doubt and ambiguity aside, and go \u2014 joyously or ferociously but always (in the moment) with passion and conviction \u2014 full pelt. What columnism is not is making absolutely sure first that you\u2019re right. To be frank, you sometimes rather doubt it. Columnism is embracing a plan or project as a faithless man might embrace a woman: with an intensity no less sincere for being passing, ever-ready to flip the project or lady once their usefulness is past. It is hugging a set of principles fiercely to your breast while (should these principles not work out) keeping a wandering eye out for some spare ones down the back of the sofa. With parliament deadlocked over Brexit, there is growing interest in the idea that citizens\u2019 assemblies could be used to find policy solutions to problems that cannot be resolved by MPs. Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, has been arguing for almost a year that a citizens\u2019 assembly could provide a solution to Brexit. Rory Stewart put the same idea at the heart of his Brexit plan during his short-lived bid for the Conservative party leadership. And the Guardian is also formally backing the idea. Unfortunately a Guardian endorsement does not always mean an idea is actually going to happen, and both possible future Tory leaders, as well as Jeremy Corbyn, have expressed no interest at all in using citizens\u2019 assemblies. But, not for the first time, progressive initiatives are being introduced first in Scotland and Wales. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has already announced that she is setting up a citizens\u2019 assembly to consider what kind of country Scotland should be in the future, and how it should handle Brexit. And today the Welsh assembly has announced that Wales\u2019 first citizens\u2019 assembly will meet for the first time in Newton, for three days starting from 19 July. Some 60 citizens were selected to take part, from a pool of 10,000 families randomly invited to apply, and they will consider ways to improve the democratic process in Wales. It is part of a series of events to mark 20 years of devolution. Elin Jones, the assembly\u2019s presiding officer, said: The first citizens\u2019 assembly for Wales is a landmark event and an important step on our devolution journey. Public engagement is at the heart of the national assembly\u2019s work. We want people in all parts of Wales to get involved with the democratic process by sharing their views and ideas with us. For a democracy to thrive and improve, everyone must be involved. The Citizens\u2019 Assembly is a pioneering way in which we can make sure our work is in line with the priorities of people across the country. Here is the story by my colleagues Rowena Mason and Jessica Elgot on the offer by Labour peers to help Jeremy Corbyn address the antisemitism issue. And here is the full text of the peers\u2019 letter. These are from my colleague Rowena Mason. In an article for the Big Issue, Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and Tory leadership candidate, says as PM he would spend \u00a330m rolling out a new approach to homelessness in London and two other cities. He explains: I want to roll out the Housing First Approach that has been trailed in the West Midlands, Liverpool and Manchester. This approach operates on the basis of two key principles. That housing is basic human right, and that once homelessness is resolved other clinical and social issues will be resolved faster. It essentially means adopting the following approach \u2013 Immediate or near immediate access to permanent accommodation for people on the streets without a housing readiness assessment. No preconditions of treatment access or engagement are required to get this accommodation. They get unconditional access to whatever treatment they need. I don\u2019t think we have time to wait for the results of these pilots. So I will commit an extra \u00a330m to roll it out immediately in London and at least two other UK cities. That could help at least an extra 1000 people off the streets. This would be an immediate step-change but longer-term I will publish a full cross-government strategy to use every lever at my power to eradicate this scourge. And this is from the Labour MP David Lammy on the Trump tweets. This is from Nick Boles, the former Conservative MP who now sits as an independent. This is from Tortoise\u2019s Polly Curtis, who has been watching the morning news programmes in New York. Theresa May has criticised Donald Trump\u2019s \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d language towards four Democratic congresswomen, which has been condemned for racism, putting pressure on her likely successor, Boris Johnson, to speak out as well. The Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has urged Johnson and Jeremy Hunt to denounce Trump in similar terms. (See 12.06pm.) Downing Street has refused to stand up for the right of journalists to publish leaked official documents in the public interest after police warned last week that editors could face prosecution if they reveal any further diplomatic cables from the British ambassador to the US, Kim Darroch. Jeremy Hunt, the underdog in the Tory leadership contest, has rejected claims that Boris Johnson\u2019s victory next week is inevitable. More than 200 current and former Labour staffers, party members and supporters have written an open letter to Jeremy Corbyn challenging him to justify his handling of the antisemitism issue, Sky News is reporting. The signatories argue that if Corbyn is not prepared to face questions in public on this matter \u201cfrom an experienced interviewer\u201d, people will conclude he is not fit to lead a Labour government. (It sounds like they are hoping this might be another assignment for Andrew Neil.) Ursula von der Leyen, the woman seeking to replace Jean-Claude Juncker as the European commission president, has made last-minute pledges on the climate crisis, Brexit, an EU minimum wage and gender quotas for company boards as she faces a knife-edge vote on her candidacy. The Home Office lied to EU member states to remove victims of human trafficking and modern slavery in breach of European law, according to whistleblowers. This is from my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels. UK in a Changing Europe, an academic network, have been holding a Brexit conference today. Here are some of the highlights. You can read the full text of the speech from Bernard Jenkin, the Tory Brexiter and chairman of the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee, here. Gus O\u2019Donnell is a former cabinet secretary. Sir Vince Cable, the outgoing Lib Dem leader, has just told the BBC\u2019s Politics Live that he expects to see more MPs defecting to his party \u201cbefore the summer is out\u201d. There were a small number of Tory and Labour MPs who have given up on their parties, he said. But he would not be drawn on reports that the Tory MPs Phillip Lee and Guto Bebb are poised to switch if (as expected) Boris Johnson becomes party leader next week. Jo Swinson, a candidate in the Lib Dem leadership contest, has denounced President Trump as a racist. Nadhim Zahawi, an education minister and a supporter of Boris Johnson, told the BBC\u2019s Politics Live that he thought President Trump\u2019s tweets were \u201cinappropriate\u201d. But he would not describe them as racist, and argued that British politicians should not get involved in domestic internal politics, BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham reports. UPDATE: Here\u2019s the clip. From my colleague Jessica Elgot UPDATE: PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield has the text of the motion. Theresa May is famously reserved. Even before she became prime minister she was notorious amongst journalists for her reluctance to any anything indiscreet - Nick Robinson once turned down a lunch with her when she was home secretary and he was BBC political editor because he thought it would be a waste of time - and as PM she has got through countless interviews giving almost nothing away. But another rather less well-known characteristic of hers is that she is, in the words of Tory journalist Matthew Parris, \u201ca good hater\u201d. As Parris explained last year in a very good Times article (paywall) about his various encounters with her: I learnt that this well-mannered woman was a good hater. At the mention of a particular colleague\u2019s name her lip curled, she made no attempt to conceal her dislike, and rather seemed to enjoy the disdain. In her final days in office this side of May\u2019s character seems to be coming out - at least, a little. The Number 10 lobby briefing this morning (see 11.48am) seems to give a clue as to what she really feels about the US president who showed his gratitude for a state visit by insulting her in public. I can think of three other examples in recent weeks where she gave a glimpse of who else is on her hate list. 1 - Jeremy Corbyn. May has often denounced Corbyn at PMQs, but two weeks ago there seemed to be an added bitterness in her voice as she effectively accused him of hypocrisy, saying Labour had no right to criticise no-deal when it repeatedly voted down her own proposed Brexit deal. 2 - Nicola Sturgeon. Barack Obama once said that the only people determined to obstruct anything he did, regardless of their own interests, were Vladimir Putin and congressional Republicans. In a recent speech in Edinburgh, May said something broadly similar about Sturgeon and the Scottish government. 3 - Boris Johnson. May has been reluctant to criticise her likely successor directly, but just occasionally we get a clue as to what she may be thinking privately. There was a good example on Friday when she spoke out about people who think being PM is all about power, not service. It was not hard to decipher who she meant Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, says Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt should both also condemn President Trump\u2019s racist tweets. (See 11.48am.) So far both Johnson and Hunt have been silent on this. (See 11.17am.) Unusually Theresa May, via her press secretary, managed to issue a condemnation of President Trump\u2019s latest outrage before Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, who is normally much more ready to denounce him. But Sturgeon has now issued her own criticism on Twitter. This is from the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley who is just back from the Downing Street lobby. Here is the Guardian story about how Donald Trump posted a racist tweet on Sunday attacking four progressive Democratic congresswomen, telling them to \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came\u201d. And here are the Trump tweets. What\u2019s remarkable about this is that, until now, Theresa May has been extremely reluctant to criticise Donald Trump. Perhaps her stance has shifted in response to what he had to say about her last week. Here\u2019s a reminder. Sir Vince Cable has got a new job for when he stands down as leader of the Liberal Democrats next week. Birmingham City University has just announced that he will be joining them as a visiting professor at their Centre for Brexit Studies. \u201cSir Vince will take up the position this summer and will focus on looking at the economics and scenarios related to Britain\u2019s exit from the EU,\u201d the university says. From BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham This week the Guardian is running a series called the real Boris Johnson. You can read all today\u2019s articles here. They are all good, including Jennifer Rankin and Jim Waterson\u2019s article about how he made his names as a Brussels correspondent filing wilfully misleading stories about the EU. On the same theme, Martin Fletcher has written an article for Tortoise listing some of those exaggerated stories. But the highlight is probably this final paragraph, from the further reading box. Last year Der Spiegel admitted that one of its star reporters, Claas Relotius had likely embellished reports and fabricated entire events for years. He apologised, was stripped of various awards, and is not currently running for high office in Germany. In his Daily Telegraph column (paywall) Boris Johnson says that, if he becomes prime minister, his first budget would include tax breaks for firms that spend money helping their employees deal with stress and mental health problems. He says: As things stand, mental health and occupational health services are taxable as benefits in kind. That means they incur both income tax and national insurance. At most, employers can get a modest reimbursement of \u00a3500, but only if an employee is off for more than 28 days \u2013 a hopeless incentive, since the whole objective should be to keep the employee in the workplace, or to ensure that time off is as brief as possible. So let me make a suggestion. I believe it is time to offer preferential tax treatment to companies that look after employees in work \u2013 giving them the counselling and the help they need to do their jobs. It is time for the Treasury and the NHS to work together to review the rules. And if they can come up with a plan \u2013 and I am sure that they can \u2013 we should put it into effect this autumn in what, if I am lucky enough to be elected, would be the first budget of the new government. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has insisted that the Iran nuclear deal is not yet dead. Speaking ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, and referring to the agreement, he said: Well, it isn\u2019t dead yet. And we are totally committed to keeping the Middle East denuclearised. If Iran acquires nuclear weapons then other countries in the region will acquire nuclear weapons. It becomes a very, very toxic and dangerous situation. We are looking to find a way to preserve the nuclear deal. Iran is still a good year away from developing a nuclear weapon. We think there is still some closing but small window to keep the deal alive, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m here to talk about. What we are looking for is to give Iran a way out of this so that they can get back into compliance with that nuclear deal. Here are my colleagues John Crace and Marina Hyde on Liam Fox\u2019s Today interview. In his Today interview Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, also said there was no need for Sir Kim Darroch, the ambassador to Washington, to be replaced by a career diplomat. A politician could do the job, he suggested. I\u2019ve always thought that we should be using a wider range of people in some of our diplomatic posts ... Some senior members of parliament have gone on to take up posts, for example the high commission in Australia, and have been very successful at doing so. It did sound a bit as though Fox, an Americanophile with extensive Washington contacts, might be putting in a bid for the job himself, although given that he is supporting Jeremy Hunt in the Tory leadership contest, he is unlikely to feature on Boris Johnson\u2019s list of suitable candidates. The Times story saying that Boris Johnson would try to agree a partial UK-US trade deal by 31 October, covering just one area of trade, is sourced to an unnamed ally of Johnson\u2019s. (See 9.20am.) Asked to comment by the paper, the Johnson campaign did not confirm or deny the story, but insisted they were just focusing on winning the leadership election. However, this morning campaign sources are being more definitive. \u201cIt\u2019s not from us,\u201d a senior figure told me, adding that the story was \u201cnonsense\u201d. In his Today interview Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, was also asked about a recent claim by Boris Johnson, the favourite in the Tory leadership contest, that the UK should try to get the US to adopt British food standards in a trade deal. At a hustings last week Johnson said: I don\u2019t want us to do any deal with the US which in anyway jeopardises our animal welfare standards or our food hygiene standards. The quality of food in this country must be protected and if anything we should be insisting that if the Americans want to trade with us they should be obeying our standards. When asked if he thought this was realistic, Fox told Today: Well, I think if you go to the US and you say we are going to take any discussions on agricultural access off the agenda, you\u2019ll find that they close down pretty quickly in terms of their willingness to discuss things. When you go into a trade negotiation, both sides will have their asks, both sides will have their defensive elements, but it is certainly true that we should be trying to get an agreement with the United States as quickly as we possibly can. Today the Times splashes on a story (paywall) claiming that Boris Johnson plans to make \u201cresetting relations with President Trump one of his first acts in Downing Street\u201d and that he wants to negotiated a limited trade deal with the US in time for when the UK leaves the EU on 31 October. Here\u2019s an extract. Under plans being discussed by Mr Johnson\u2019s team he would strike a limited trade deal in \u201cone area\u201d of goods in time for October 31. He and Mr Trump would also establish the broad outlines of a fully fledged deal. \u201cThere is no question that the moment we leave on the 31st we should be in a position to get some kind of arrangement with the US,\u201d the source said. But on the Today programme this morning Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, who is backing Jeremy Hunt for the Tory leadership, said that Johnson\u2019s plan was impossible. He explained: We can\u2019t negotiate anything with the US until after we\u2019ve left the European Union ... It would be in breach of European law for us to do that. Negotiating a UK-US trade deal would take time, he said. He went on: You\u2019ve got the added complication, just remember, that we\u2019re now getting very close to the American pre-election year where it is quite hard to get things through congress. So even if you negotiate them quickly, you would not necessarily be able to ratify them. In the interview Fox also dismissed another Johnson proposal, for the UK to insist that any trade deal requires the US to match UK food standards. I will post the relevant quotes in a moment. UPDATE: This morning the Johnson camp has described the Times story about an early, partial trade deal with the US as \u201cnonsense\u201d. (See 9.32am.) Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, gives a speech on violent crime. As Vikram Dodd reports, he will argue that serious youth violence, such as stabbings and shootings, is strongly connected to social exclusion and austerity. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Sajid Javid, the home secretary, takes questions from the Commons. 7pm: Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt take part in a debate hosted by the Sun. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary at lunchtime and then another when I finish. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

But Australian TV had shown all those things first, more than two decades before the rest of the world. In 1972 the country, in the midst of its sexual revolution, got hooked on a new primetime serial called Number 96, which was launched with the infamous tagline: \u201cTonight, Australian TV loses its virginity.\u201d Number 96 didn\u2019t stop there with the world firsts: in 1973, Robyn Ross (Carolle Lea) revealed that she was \u201cnot really a girl\u201d, thereby making her the first trans character on television. She was portrayed by a real transgender person, the legendary Sydney showgirl Carlotta, who had been asked to provide a fake name to keep her identity and the shock storyline a secret. Media roundup The ABC reports that UTS and Curtin University are reviewing their funding and research approval procedures over fears of their links to a tech company and associate professor, respectively, with ties to the surveillance technology used by the Chinese government. The splash in the Australian blames \u201cstubborn employees who refuse to move into more productive companies\u201d for the nation\u2019s record-low wages growth, based on Treasury research. And the Mercury leads with the continuing search for a walker who went missing in the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair national park, as police warned of \u201cvery dangerous\u201d weather conditions. Coming up The Reserve Bank will release the minutes of last week\u2019s board meeting, giving insight into its decision to cut the cash rate to a new record low of 1%. The NSW court of appeal is due to hand down its judgment in the cricketer Chris Gayle\u2019s defamation damages case against Fairfax Media, and the company\u2019s cross-claim.",

For <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/hunt-and-johnson-the-backstop-is-dead-and-cant-be-in-any-eu-deal\">the final head-to-head debate in the Tory leadership race</a>, Team Hunt hadn\u2019t sent a single MP out into the spin room to explain why their man was about to win. Not even Liam Fox, who bizarrely had managed to out fact-check Boris Johnson on the status of a UK-US trade deal that very morning. It\u2019s come to something when the country depends on the international trade secretary \u2013 for the next week at least \u2013 as a voice of sanity.</p> <p>For Team Boris, Dominic Raab was looking every bit like a man who won\u2019t be taking public transport for much longer. The shiny ministerial limo awaits. Gone was the pent-up anger of his own failed leadership bid. The bulging neck veins of Captain Psycho had given way to Smiley Dom. The man whose road rage convictions are now spent and on whom no one has yet pinned any unsolved murders.</p> <p>This was a man happy in his own skin. A politician of hitherto hidden charm. Pleased to have chosen the winning side. Delighted his no-deal Brexit was now mainstream Conservative policy. As Amber Rudd was now desperate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/11/amber-rudd-drops-opposition-to-no-deal-brexit\">to phone in and confirm</a>. When she\u2019d said a no-deal Brexit would be a disaster what she had really meant was that it would be an unmitigated success.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/hunt-and-johnson-the-backstop-is-dead-and-cant-be-in-any-eu-deal\">Hunt and Johnson: the backstop is dead and can't be in any EU deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was the Sun-Talk Radio debate and Sun political editor Tom Newton Dunn laid down a few ground rules for Johnson and Hunt. The first of which was that there should be no repeat of last week\u2019s ITV debates when both men had talked over each other and Julie Etchingham. Boris and Jeremy nodded furiously. This time there were no woman involved so there would be no need to talk over anyone.</p> <p>\u201cPifflepafflewifflewaffle,\u201d Boris began in his by now well-rehearsed opening patter. Optimism, mojo, complete bollocks. That\u2019s what the country was crying out for. Hunt just looked washed out. He claimed to be passionate, but he looked to be of all passion spent. The Colonel Kurtz Doll had been consigned to the toy box. All that was left was an unwanted Ken. Barbie\u2019s wallflower.</p> <p>Brexit dominated the first 45 minutes and as expected neither man had any answers. But then a lack of realism has been the default position of both Boris and Hunt throughout and they weren\u2019t about to change now. Brexit was something that would happen providing you believed in it enough. What had been missing was someone who would look the EU in the eyes and tell them we were mad and self-destructive enough to trash the entire country to get things done.

      "bodyText": "It could just have been overconfidence. More likely it was a white flag. A giving in to the inevitable. For the final head-to-head debate in the Tory leadership race, Team Hunt hadn\u2019t sent a single MP out into the spin room to explain why their man was about to win. Not even Liam Fox, who bizarrely had managed to out fact-check Boris Johnson on the status of a UK-US trade deal that very morning. It\u2019s come to something when the country depends on the international trade secretary \u2013 for the next week at least \u2013 as a voice of sanity. For Team Boris, Dominic Raab was looking every bit like a man who won\u2019t be taking public transport for much longer. The shiny ministerial limo awaits. Gone was the pent-up anger of his own failed leadership bid. The bulging neck veins of Captain Psycho had given way to Smiley Dom. The man whose road rage convictions are now spent and on whom no one has yet pinned any unsolved murders. This was a man happy in his own skin. A politician of hitherto hidden charm. Pleased to have chosen the winning side. Delighted his no-deal Brexit was now mainstream Conservative policy. As Amber Rudd was now desperate to phone in and confirm. When she\u2019d said a no-deal Brexit would be a disaster what she had really meant was that it would be an unmitigated success. This was the Sun-Talk Radio debate and Sun political editor Tom Newton Dunn laid down a few ground rules for Johnson and Hunt. The first of which was that there should be no repeat of last week\u2019s ITV debates when both men had talked over each other and Julie Etchingham. Boris and Jeremy nodded furiously. This time there were no woman involved so there would be no need to talk over anyone. \u201cPifflepafflewifflewaffle,\u201d Boris began in his by now well-rehearsed opening patter. Optimism, mojo, complete bollocks. That\u2019s what the country was crying out for. Hunt just looked washed out. He claimed to be passionate, but he looked to be of all passion spent. The Colonel Kurtz Doll had been consigned to the toy box. All that was left was an unwanted Ken. Barbie\u2019s wallflower. Brexit dominated the first 45 minutes and as expected neither man had any answers. But then a lack of realism has been the default position of both Boris and Hunt throughout and they weren\u2019t about to change now. Brexit was something that would happen providing you believed in it enough. What had been missing was someone who would look the EU in the eyes and tell them we were mad and self-destructive enough to trash the entire country to get things done. Of course there would be casualties along the way, but true patriotic Brits should be prepared to lay down their lives so that everyone who survived could be made poorer. On and on the nonsense went. Both men unilaterally ditched the Northern Ireland backstop and put their faith in alternative border technologies that did not yet exist. Boris even promised to take back control by increasing immigration. Not exactly what many Brexiters had voted for, but trust in politics is now so low that no one really cares what anyone says. Coherence is a state to which no one now even aspires. Lying is now truth. Johnson was just as confused on a trade deal with the US. This time he had at least read clause 5(c) of Gatt 24 but he still hadn\u2019t bothered to mug up on clause 5(d). Details, details. Asked to condemn President Trump\u2019s tweets about four Democrat congresswomen, Hunt said that his three children were half-Chinese. Boris avoided talking about his children. Mainly because he can\u2019t always remember how many he has. Or what their nationalities might be. Both men couldn\u2019t bring themselves to say what they thought was racist about the racist tweet.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have declared the Northern Ireland backstop \u201cdead\u201d and promised to throw it out of any deal they negotiate with the EU, in comments that significantly harden their Brexit positions. The Tory leadership rivals both ruled out trying to tweak the backstop, which critics said could trap the UK indefinitely in a customs union with the EU. They said it would not feature in any deal with the EU, saying it was no good to have a time limit on it or a way of the UK exiting it unilaterally \u2013 even though Eurosceptics had previously indicated they could vote for such compromises. Pressed in a Sun and Talk Radio debate on whether he would seek a time limit to the backstop, Johnson said: \u201cThe answer is no. The problem is really fundamental. It needs to come out.\u201d He said his policy would be \u201cno to time limits or unilateral escape hatches or these kind of elaborate devices, glosses, codicils and so on which you could apply to the backstop\u201d. \u201cI think the problem is very fundamental. It has been devised by this country as an instrument of our own incarceration in the single market and customs union. It needs to come out,\u201d he added. Hunt agreed, saying \u201cthe backstop, as it is, is dead\u201d, adding that there had to be a new way. \u201cI don\u2019t think tweaking it with a time limit will do the trick,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we are going to get a deal we must have an absolute cast-iron commitment to the Republic of Ireland that we will not have border infrastructure. So what they liked in the backstop was the fact it guaranteed that. If we are going to solve that we need to find another way of guaranteeing that same thing.\u201d The EU has repeatedly ruled out reopening Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement to revisit the backstop, which Brussels regards as a way of protecting the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland from a return to a hard border between them. However, both leadership candidates appeared categorical on Monday that they would throw it out of the deal entirely \u2013 or proceed to a no-deal Brexit. Hunt and Johnson endorsed the concept of \u201calternative arrangements\u201d such as customs checks away from the border or trusted trader schemes. They declined to say what would happen if MPs decide to block a no-deal Brexit, even as the House of Lords on Monday made moves to stop parliament being suspended to force it through. A cross-party group of peers launched their bid in the Lords this week, as they warned that the \u201cprocedural gambit\u201d was needed to stop a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, issued a fresh warning to Johnson and Hunt on Monday that he would do \u201ceverything I can\u201d to prevent a no-deal Brexit. The chancellor, who said he will not serve in the incoming government, insisted he would try to support the new administration. He added: \u201cSo long as they are focused on doing the things that will strengthen the UK economy and make it resilient in the future, I will be fully supportive. But if the new government tries to drive the UK over a cliff edge called no-deal Brexit, I will do everything I can to stop that happening.\u201d The two hopefuls to succeed May took a more conciliatory tone than in previous debates, with Hunt helping Johnson as he struggled with a question about his private life.

However, Johnson refused to give a guarantee to Hunt that he would return the favour and put him in his cabinet, with talk reported among his allies that he will only appoint senior ministers who are thoroughly committed to implementing a no-deal Brexit if necessary. Hunt said he would offer at least one of the four top cabinet roles to a female MP and Johnson agreed after some hesitation, but those commitments were criticised by former Tory MP Nick Boles who said they should be pledging gender balance at the top. \u201cI cannot believe Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt think they\u2019ve done enough by promising one of the top four cabinet posts to a woman?

      "bodyText": "Two Jeffrey Epstein accusers offered emotional entreaties in court on Monday, asking a judge not to release the financier before his trial on sex trafficking charges. One alleged victim, who identified herself as Courtney Wild, said: \u201cI was sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein, starting at the age of 14.\u201d The financier has been detained in an especially secure part of Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federal jail in lower Manhattan, since his arrest earlier this month for the alleged sex trafficking of minors. Epstein, 66, pleaded not guilty last week. He appeared in court on Monday over his request for house arrest while awaiting trial \u2013 which prosecutors vehemently oppose. Judge Richard Berman did not issue a decision, saying he would do so on Thursday. Prosecutor Alex Rossmiller said the case was getting stronger. Since the investigation, which he described as a \u201ccovert\u201d effort that took months, was unsealed, he said \u201cmany individuals\u201d who have identified themselves as victims or witnesses have come forward. Rossmiller, who has repeatedly said Epstein\u2019s wealth would make it possible for him to flee, also cited unknown factors surrounding Epstein\u2019s finances. During a search of Epstein\u2019s Manhattan home, authorities found a \u201clocked safe\u201d containing cash, diamonds and an expired passport apparently with Epstein\u2019s picture but a \u201cname that was not his\u201d. The passport, from the early 1980s, was from a \u201cforeign country\u201d and listed Epstein\u2019s country of residence as \u201cSaudi Arabia\u201d. It was also revealed in court that Epstein\u2019s financial information disclosure, necessary for his bail request, ran to just one page. Rossmiller said the document lacked information on Epstein\u2019s assets, such as diamonds and art, \u201cboth of which were [found] in abundance\u201d at his home. The one-page document was unsealed. It listed Epstein\u2019s net worth as $559,120,954, comprised of nearly $195m in hedge funds and private equity, $113m in equities, $57m in cash and $14m in fixed income, with six properties comprising the remainder. The document also said the market value of his East 71st Street mansion was just under $56m, not $77m, as prosecutors have claimed. Wild said publicity had not necessarily made it easier to come forward, as Epstein\u2019s attorneys have argued in court. \u201cHe\u2019s a scary person to have walking the streets,\u201d she said, with a reserved air, wearing a white shirt and black trousers as she addressed the judge. The second accuser, Annie Farmer, stood and said: \u201cI was 16 years old when I had the misfortune of meeting Jeffrey Epstein here in New York.\u201d She said it was difficult to come forward because of Epstein\u2019s \u201cwealth and privilege\u201d. Berman asked if she was saying that Epstein engaged in sexual contact with her. She said: \u201cHe was inappropriate with me.\u201d The judge asked if she would go into details. She said: \u201cI would prefer not to go into the details at this time.\u201d The attorney David Boies, who represents some Epstein accusers, told the Guardian: \u201cThis is a good judge and I know he will do what he considers the right thing.\u201d Lawyers for Epstein, who is a registered sex offender following a case in Florida 11 years ago, insist home detention and electronic monitoring and a mortgage-backed bond on his Manhattan mansion will be enough to stop him fleeing the country. Since his 2008 guilty plea to state prostitution charges and subsequent 13 months behind bars, he has been a law-abiding citizen, they have argued. Pressed by Berman on whether his clean post-incarceration record really indicates that he will stay out of trouble, Epstein lawyer Martin Weinberg said: \u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s an out-of-control rapist. \u201cHe does not fit within the paradigm,\u201d Weinberg added. Epstein\u2019s legal team said they would offer his private jet as collateral and a trustee or trustees could be appointed to live in Epstein\u2019s residence and report any violation. Weinberg also said Epstein would be willing to back his pretrial release with $100m. Prosecutors cited the potentially thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females authorities found while searching his home as proof that Epstein remained dangerous. Rossmiller said authorities had identified at least one person in those photos \u201cwho has identified herself as a victim\u201d. Prosecutors maintained that electronic monitoring would just shorten a head start if Epstein decided to flee and dismissed his house arrest pitch as a request to live in a \u201cgilded cage\u201d. They also alleged that Epstein wired several hundred thousands of dollars \u201cto influence\u201d two possible witnesses. Multiple accusers have asked prosecutors to seek Epstein\u2019s detention throughout his case, prosecutors said. Epstein, who purportedly had ties to Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and other powerful men, is charged in a 13-page indictment with sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. It is alleged that some victims were just 14 years old. Prosecutors contend that from 2002 to 2005, Epstein \u201csexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls\u201d and paid some victims to recruit others \u201cin order to maintain and increase his supply of victims\u201d. These accusers were lured to provide massages \u201cwhich would be performed nude or partially nude\u201d, the indictment claimed, saying these massages would turn \u201cincreasingly sexual in nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts\u201d. Prosecutors have also claimed that at Epstein\u2019s New York home, \u201cthe massage room is still set up the same way it was 15 years ago\u201d, with sex paraphernalia and a massage table. The New York case comes amid increasing scrutiny of Epstein\u2019s prior case that was spurred by a bombshell Miami Herald investigation. In 2007, Epstein and the US attorney\u2019s office in Miami, then led by Alexander Acosta, brokered a deal that ended a federal investigation into allegations involving at least 40 teenage girls. Acosta resigned as Trump\u2019s labor secretary on Friday, following extensive criticism. Weinberg said the deal was approved by the justice department\u2019s former criminal division head, as well as a former deputy attorney general.",

The revelation will fuel the belief that police attempted to build a case against journalists after the highly damaging leak, despite the federal government\u2019s previous assurances to the contrary. Guardian Australia has learned that police, at least initially, were highly interested in whether journalists had acknowledged they might be committing crimes while accepting documents from McBride, a former military lawyer now facing years in prison.

Amar Virdi took six for 78 \u2013 14 for 139 in the match \u2013 with only Ravi Ashwin showing much resistance with the bat.</p> <p>Ashwin, who finished with match figures of 12 for 144, was sanguine about taking 23 wickets in three games and losing every one. \u201cIt\u2019s not happened a lot in my career, like that,\u201d he said. He returns for the final rounds in September and Notts will need him at his best for even a sniff of avoiding relegation.</p> <p><strong>Lancashire</strong> fortified their position at the top of Division Two after defeating <strong>Sussex</strong> by an innings and 51 runs at Old Trafford. It completed a dismal month for Sussex who need the T20 Blast to produce a timely fillip \u2013 though they at least had the thrill of watching Delroy Rawlins make a maiden first-class century. His partnership of 128 with David Wiese was the ballast the game needed to entertain a fair crowd in short sleeves. Matt Parkinson took a career best 10 for 165 in the match.</p> <p>It was another chastening day for the leaders, <strong>Somerset</strong>, against <strong>Yorkshire </strong>at Headingley. They were bowled out for 196 shortly after lunch and were following on soon afterwards. Keshav Maharaj took seven wickets in the first innings. When batting again, Somerset were 159 for four at the close \u2013 Tom Banton, unbeaten on 58, remains their best hope of a draw.</p> <p>At Chelmsford, <strong>Essex</strong> tightened their grip against <strong>Warwickshire</strong>. Alastair Cook made his second 80 of the game before Dan Lawrence and Simon Harmer added quick runs. Essex declared with a lead of more than 400.</p> <p><strong>Kent</strong>\u2019s batsmen shone in the high-scoring game at the Ageas Bowl. Joe Denly was out for 154, Heino Kuhn made 95 and the evergreen Darren Stevens a swashbuckling 60 as they snatched first-innings lead over <strong>Hampshire</strong>. Fidel Edwards grabbed five for 118.</p> <p>At Chesterfield, where <strong>Derbyshire </strong>are hosting <strong>Northamptonshire</strong>, all results are still possible after a topsy-turvy day when 24 wickets fell; and at the Riverside three late wickets by <strong>Durham</strong>\u2019s Chris Rushworth all but destroyed <strong>Worcestershire</strong>\u2019s hopes of surviving the game.</p> <p>On the first day of the Cheltenham festival, Neil Dexter made 56 as <strong>Leicestershire</strong> were bowled out for 252. And at Sophia Gardens, fifties from Marnus Labuschagne and Charlie Hemphrey look unlikely to save <strong>Glamorgan</strong>. Sam Robson had made an unbeaten 140, the first <strong>Middlesex</strong> player to carry his bat since Nick Compton in 2006.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d2cc3a78f08d0b6ca531379\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-15T18:25:28.456Z\">7.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Old Trafford square </strong>is covered, the sprayers are on, and that\u2019s the last Championship cricket here till August.

      "bodyText": "The day after the night before brought no comfort for Nottinghamshire, defeated in three days by Surrey. Amar Virdi took six for 78 \u2013 14 for 139 in the match \u2013 with only Ravi Ashwin showing much resistance with the bat. Ashwin, who finished with match figures of 12 for 144, was sanguine about taking 23 wickets in three games and losing every one. \u201cIt\u2019s not happened a lot in my career, like that,\u201d he said. He returns for the final rounds in September and Notts will need him at his best for even a sniff of avoiding relegation. Lancashire fortified their position at the top of Division Two after defeating Sussex by an innings and 51 runs at Old Trafford. It completed a dismal month for Sussex who need the T20 Blast to produce a timely fillip \u2013 though they at least had the thrill of watching Delroy Rawlins make a maiden first-class century. His partnership of 128 with David Wiese was the ballast the game needed to entertain a fair crowd in short sleeves. Matt Parkinson took a career best 10 for 165 in the match. It was another chastening day for the leaders, Somerset, against Yorkshire at Headingley. They were bowled out for 196 shortly after lunch and were following on soon afterwards. Keshav Maharaj took seven wickets in the first innings. When batting again, Somerset were 159 for four at the close \u2013 Tom Banton, unbeaten on 58, remains their best hope of a draw. At Chelmsford, Essex tightened their grip against Warwickshire. Alastair Cook made his second 80 of the game before Dan Lawrence and Simon Harmer added quick runs. Essex declared with a lead of more than 400. Kent\u2019s batsmen shone in the high-scoring game at the Ageas Bowl. Joe Denly was out for 154, Heino Kuhn made 95 and the evergreen Darren Stevens a swashbuckling 60 as they snatched first-innings lead over Hampshire. Fidel Edwards grabbed five for 118. At Chesterfield, where Derbyshire are hosting Northamptonshire, all results are still possible after a topsy-turvy day when 24 wickets fell; and at the Riverside three late wickets by Durham\u2019s Chris Rushworth all but destroyed Worcestershire\u2019s hopes of surviving the game. On the first day of the Cheltenham festival, Neil Dexter made 56 as Leicestershire were bowled out for 252. And at Sophia Gardens, fifties from Marnus Labuschagne and Charlie Hemphrey look unlikely to save Glamorgan. Sam Robson had made an unbeaten 140, the first Middlesex player to carry his bat since Nick Compton in 2006. The Old Trafford square is covered, the sprayers are on, and that\u2019s the last Championship cricket here till August. They\u2019re confident of growing sales for the Blast - I really hope last night works for them, and everyone else - county clubs, colts sections of cricket clubs, etc etc. Congratulations to Surrey and Lancashire for two great wins - even if they were against two teams suffering collective batting meltdowns. May the break do them both good. Thanks for dropping by today to chew the fat. One more CC Live to go till the summer break. Hope to see some of you here tomorrow too - new and old. Plenty to play for - especially keen to see if Warwickshire can possibly bat out the day against Siddle and Harmer. Good night! And one last thing - apparently Lancashire sold 800 tickets yesterday for the Blast game on Sunday! Tickets are available from \u00a31 for kids and \u00a38 for adults. See here for details. That\u2019s it from me for a bit while I write up... Some backbone from Somerset - a 38 run partnership from Banton and Bartlett but you have to say its unlikely. Roland Jones got Labuschagne, but too early - he only had fifty.! Glamorgan 125 for two and a long way (431 runs) from home. Leicestershire 192 for six. A fifty from Neil Dexter and a near-fifty from Paul Horton and everything going fast forward and upside down at Chesterfield, where Northants were bowled out for 122 - Palladino 4-33. But Derby are now serenely 37 for 0 - needing another 278. Just went to see Jason Gillespie. What an impressive guy - no nonsense, straight-talkin\u2019. Sussex are packing up, piling on the coach. Lancashire are on the pitch, having a beer and a kick around. Jimmy Anderson is bowling with a heavily strapped leg. Warwicks start the quest for 401, Hampshire are 21 for one, trailing by 125. Durham are way on top - leading Worcestershire by 299. Of some interest perhaps - the World Cup final OBO was the seventh biggest story of all time by page views on the Guardian site. Bad news for Somerset, good news for Yorkshire: Azhar and Hildreth both gone. It falls on Abell (53 not out) and Banton (6 not out). A tall order. Actually it doesn\u2019t fall on Abell as he\u2019s just fallen to Fisher. Somerset 101-3 and in a big hole, trailing by 223. Shaun is a Kentish man watching Hampshire v Kent at the Ageas Bowl with his Hampshire inlaws. Cricket spreading the lurve part 7684. \u201cHere at the sun- kissed Ageas Bowl, only Fidel Edwards for Hampshire managed to get much of kick out of a benign batting track. Kent were eventually dismissed for 555, giving a first innings lead of 153. An early tea was taken and Hampshire are 1 for no wicket in reply. \u201c Thank you Shaun. And that\u2019s it at Old Trafford! All over! The last two wickets fall seven balls into the afternoon session. Hamza lbw for a duck. Parkinson 10-165 in the match. Lancashire 23 points - up, up and away. At Sophia Gardens, Glamorgan are having one of their not quite so good days. At tea they were 94 for 1 (Selman) chasing an improbable 556. Marnus Labuschagne is unbeaten on 47. No time for more Marnus miracles, surely? Earlier Sam Robson had scored his second century of the season. Parkinson now has his career-best figures of nine (and more?) for 165. Also, in some act of medieval surrender, the Sussex flag has been taken down and returned to the scorer... And proof that Jofra Archer is a very nice boy: \u201cTough-love\u201d Amar Virdi : 14 for 139. Surrey - onwards and upwards. Notts - um...believe tomorrow can be better. My friends Sharda Ugra and Neeru Bhatia tell me these are the most kick-ass Urdu couplets created on the go for the World Cup. It\u2019s tea at Chelmsford where Dan Lawrence and Simon Harmer have smashed 84 runs in 20 overs - Harmer passed 1,000 first-class runs for Essex with 43 from 64 balls. Warwickshire, breathe. A day and maybe a min-session to last. But don\u2019t think about it for a while. Back to Chesterfield and the picture has changed a little. Northants still boast a 250+ lead but in their second innings, they are now five wickets down. Fynn Hudson-Prentice, having top scored for Derbyshire with 55, had a hand in removing Northants\u2019 top three batsmen, boasting a run-out followed by two lbw decisions. Josh Cobb has rallied things for the visitors, taking them from 49-5 to 70-5. At Notts, Virdi ends the partnership between Stuart Broad and Ravi Ashwin. Broad is out for 30, stumped by Smith and Virdi now has 14 wickets in the match. Broad\u2019s departure left Notts on 148-9 still 201 runs behind. And Dave at the York\u2019s Theatre Royal also needs news: Echoing Paul below, any news from Headingly and the Tykes\u2019 rout of Somerset? Pretty please. Dave, it was the game many of us were hoping to forget. Somerset now following on (42-0) after being bowled out for a mere 196. Seven wickets for Keshav Maharaj, including Dom Bess - the two of them have previous, if you remember, from Ciderabad last year. Five hundred passed at Chelmsford in the big-score nailed-on draw. Kudos to Fidel Edwards, 5-109 on a bowler\u2019s burial ground. And hey-ho Darren Stevens, who hit eight fours and two sixes in his 60. And Delray Rawlins goes to his hundred with a huge six straight into the pavilion! And then is out next ball! To the hundredth ball of his innings. His first first-class century and only the second against Lancashire this year. Well played young man. An email from Paul Billington: Any chance of a nod to Northants for their morning\u2019s work? Looks like they might have a healthy lead going into the afternoon / evening, which given their start to the season is always a surprise to me. Not in the same magnitude as yesterday obviously, but still...! Paul, yes, I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s very remiss of me. It\u2019s been a strange County Blog today. Five wickets for Ben Sanderson in a sensational spell at Chesterfield. He bowled unchanged for 11 overs as Derby collapsed from 43 for 1 to 60 for 6. Northants, batting again, have a lead of 215. A century partnership here at Old Trafford off 76 balls and in 51 minutes. Thanks very much, say Sussex - that\u2019ll do nicely. Only the fourth century partnership against Lancashire this season. They still trail by 150-like, but they\u2019re having a go. Cripes! I nearly missed Notts\u2019 innings! 92-7. I wonder if Ravi Ashwin ( 16 not out ) knew what he was letting himself in for. Another four wickets for Amar Virdi - 12 in the match, with a few more to pocket yet. Sorry all, I was momentarily distracted somewhere else. Rather a turn-up for the books here, Sussex have put on 80 in ten overs since lunch. Now 197-5. DIVISION ONE Chelmsford Essex 245 (Cook 84; Rhodes 5-17) and 169-4 (Cook 83; Rhodes 3-17) v Warwickshire 161 (Siddle 5-33) Ageas Bowl: Hampshire 409-9 dec (Organ 100, Rossouw 92; Stevens 5-68) v Kent 433-6 (Denly 154, Bell-Drummond 94, Kuhn 73 not out) Trent Bridge: Notts 116 (Virdi 8-61) and 58-3 (Virdi 2-26) v Surrey 240 (Ashwin 6-69) and 224-9dec (Smith 57, Clark 54; Ashwin 6-75) Headingley: Yorkshire 520 (Ballance 111, Kohler-Cadmore 102, Brook 101; Bess 4-130) v Somerset 164-8 (Maharaj 5-44) DIVISION TWO Riverside: Durham 212 (Eckersley 50, Raine 78 not out) and 120-2 v Worcestershire 151 (Rushworth 4-28) Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 171 (Lloyd 67; Helm 5-53; Roland-Jones 4-45) v Middlesex 384 (Malan 166; Carey 4-54) and 342 (Robson 140 not out) Old Trafford: Lancashire 494-6dec (Jones 88, Vilas 132 not out) v Sussex 127 (Parkinson 6-23) and 117-5 (Rawlins 53 not out) Chesterfield: Day 2: Derby 121-8 (Sanderson 4-36) v Northants 342 (Bavuma 134) Cheltenham: Day 1: Gloucestershire v Leicestershire 92-2 Incidentally, my ten year old informed me when I got home last night that there were three Rajasthan Royals players in England\u2019s winning side: Stokes, Buttler and Archer. I take this as a sign that in cricket\u2019s many guises, there is something for everyone. Ooops, Salt falls on the stroke of lunch, bowled by Parky for 37. He can\u2019t believe it. Lunch scores to follow. HPG you\u2019re fine coming to OT - Rawlins and Salt have put on 65 with nary a scare. Geoff\u2019s ammunition: I would never usually do this, but this by me. Just because I\u2019m so excited to be part of it. And Andy on Lord\u2019s: There\u2019s more but I\u2019ll leave you to find it! Rolling coverage all day. Ok Geoff. One last go.... I promise this will be my last comment about Stokes\u2019s Choice (as it\u2019s now celebrated in ethics classes). Wouldn\u2019t the least selfish decision have been to do whatever was best for the game (aka best for the ages) when choosing to take or decline an equivalent number of runs? If denying his team mates an ill-deserved victory is judge\u2019s selfish, what does that make those team mates? But by blocking out two balls - isn\u2019t that a bit like going back to the future? You don\u2019t know what would have happened if you hadn\u2019t done it. What about if he would have hit the last two balls for six even if that overthrow hadn\u2019t gone over the boundary? And what happens if Rashid had then been Mankaded by Boult (such a ludicrous suggestion I feel embarrassed for mentioning it). Something for everyone to chew around over lunch. Gary Naylor is feeling lyrical at Chelmsford: Lees showing great stoicism for Durham with his 103 ball 38 not out, though Bancroft has gone, for 28. The Durham lead is now 157 - they\u2019re 96 for one. Oh dear. Notts have lost their first wicket. Morkel continues in his battle to be a pace bowler who takes wickets at the newly named (by me) Bunsen Bridge. It\u2019s Slater and he got a duck. Hang on .... eight extras in a scores of 24??? Charles Anderson with the Kiwi view from Nelson (where I once spent a lovely night in 2002). Ali went to the press conferences of two of the smartest and best human beings in cricket: Kane Williamson and Eoin Morgan. Rawlins has just hit the first six of the match. Off Parky. And there\u2019s another one on its way - thumps into the boundary boards but four this time. And another . He\u2019s looking in super touch actually. Vic\u2019s match report: The best of the OBO boys: Also - much bloody brilliant reading in the Guardian today about that miraculous event from yesterday. Still can\u2019t believe it. Barney: and Geoff: Parky is on, and there is simultaneously a high-pitched squeal from the watching school kids. What can you say? I love how Notts are still encouraging people to watch the Live Feed. Bye-bye Ben Brown. Head is down, bat held upside down, he walks off the pitch. Sussex 39 for four. Surrey have declared: 224 for nine. Ravi Ashwin 12-144. Notts need 349 to win - shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Geoff\u2019s back: \u201cYou might well think I was being harsh about Stokes but surely the difference between benefitting from or negating the ricochet advantage was also the difference between being the hero of the hour or a hero for the ages.\u201d Possibly, but wouldn\u2019t he by becoming the hero for the ages, also be making a selfish decision for his team? Tricky one. For further discussion. Meanwhile, Sussex are now 37 for 3; Alastair Cook has passed fifty in Essex\u2019s 117 for one; Denly was out for 154 - Kent 369-4; two more wickets for Ravi Ashwin, who has now got 12 wickets in the game; and Maharaj more than doing a job for Yorkshire! Somerset 108 for seven. Davies still there 33 not out. Sussex lose another I\u2019m afraid. Tick-tock, tick-tock, there\u2019s no stopping this Lancs bowling attack against this batting line-up. Lots of school children here to see it anyway. Wells lbw Onions 0. Sussex 29-2. \u201cGood morning Tanya!\u201d Good morning Geoff! \u201cNice to get back to proper cricket.One thing about yesterday\u2019s doubly tied game: I\u2019ve seen several approving comments about Stokes asking for the ricochet overthrows to be chalked off. Given that couldn\u2019t happen, why didn\u2019t he then simply block a ball or two in recompense? That would have been sporting.And as it now transpires that it should have been five not six runs for the overthrow incident, wouldn\u2019t sporting decorum require England to forfeit the \u2018victory\u2019? (PS I have no Kiwi affiliations.).\u201d Ooooh, Geoff that\u2019s harsh. Ask a man like Stokes to block a couple of balls as the country roars him on and his teammates are sitting in the dressing room? Lancashire make an early breakthrough - Chopra caught behind off Richard Gleeson from the fourth over of the day. And reports from Chelmsford! DIVISION ONE Chelmsford Essex 245 (Cook 84; Rhodes 5-17) and 73-1 v Warwickshire 161 (Siddle 5-33) Ageas Bowl: Hampshire 409-9 dec (Organ 100, Rossouw 92; Stevens 5-68) v Kent 319-3 (Denly 138 not out) Trent Bridge: Notts 116 (Virdi 8-61) v Surrey 240 (Ashwin 6-69) and 184-7 (Smith 57; Ashwin 4-64) Headingley: Yorkshire 520 (Ballance 111, Kohler-Cadmore 102, Brook 101; Bess 4-130) v Somerset 76-4 DIVISION TWO Riverside: Durham 212 (Eckersley 50, Raine 78 not out) and 26-0 v Worcestershire 151 (Rushworth 4-28) Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 171 (Lloyd 67; Helm 5-53; Roland-Jones 4-45) v Middlesex 384 (Malan 166; Carey 4-54) and 189-5 Old Trafford: Lancashire 494-6dec (Jones 88, Vilas 132 not out) v Sussex 127 (Parkinson 6-23) and 15-0 Chesterfield: Day 2: Derby 34-1 v Northants 342 (Bavuma 134) Cheltenham: Day 1: Gloucestershire v Leicestershire I\u2019ve just seen a tweet from John Lewis congratulating the England cricket team! And so many, many, many more from Tooting to Auckland and three times round the world. The Black Caps too - what grace, what dignity. Kane Williamson is an incredible human being. I hope that Jacob Rees Mogg one day learns that joy is an emotion to be savoured not twisted. In a straw poll of the playground this morning, the three people I spoke to were talking about the cricket, none of them usually watch it. Is this a moment? A word of quiet congratulation here to the ECB. For all their faults it was their vision and they ran with it. Thank god Sky decided at the last minute to lend their rights to Channel four. Oh help, the umpires are walking out and I haven\u2019t done the start of play scores... The happiest of mornings this beautiful Monday. I\u2019m running behind, but I guess you might be desperate to chat. So I\u2019ll open the blog now .... all yours!",

Nadiya (Hussain, winner of 2015\u2019s Great British Bake Off and a shining light in the darkness \u2013 but we\u2019ll come back to that) chooses breakfast pancakes because her children are always asking for breakfast pancakes. Then simplify it. The quickest way to do this is to shout at your children that they\u2019ll have cereal and like it, but Nadiya is a good mother and a good baker so she finds an alternative. Nadiya makes a very thick breakfast pancake, swirls jam and peanut butter and bakes it in the oven. It serves 12.

I need the latter part of this explained to me, but nobody does. Instead, Nadiya fills four preserving jars with different combinations of easy yet guilt-free ingredients (tinned mushrooms \u2019n\u2019 frozen spinach, kimchi \u2019n\u2019 beef jerky, shreds of roast chicken you have in the fridge because either \u201ctime-poor\u201d is an elastic term or you are \u201cdeli-price rich\u201d and buy them ready-cooked \u2019n\u2019 lime) plus some rice noodles and spoonfuls of a spice paste she and Kim cook from scratch because \u201cinvesting time up front gives you more in the future\u201d. Surely not as much as lifting a jar down from a supermarket shelf would \u2026 but! Ours is not to reason why. Ours is but to watch in awe as boiling water is added and four instant meals are created. Not one of which, I suspect, the average child would eat without the kind of cajoling \u2019n\u2019 threats that would depredate substantially upon one\u2019s free time, but never mind. Kim claims the tooled-up Pot Noodles have given her back \u201cheadspace\u201d and we must away! To make Nadiya\u2019s lunch!</p> <p>Is it toast, we ask? No! It is tortillas coated in beaten egg and rolled up with mushrooms, dried parsley (lots of flavour in dried herbs. No guilt!), garlic granules and tomato paste. Is that quicker and easier than toast, we ask? No, we don\u2019t, because we have to rush \u2026 to a mushroom growing factory, for some reason. Ah, because Nadiya loves mushrooms! And because Nadiya is not just a good baker and a good mother, but a good presenter and a good person, she doesn\u2019t make the \u201cWhy is living through Brexit like being a mushroom?\u201d joke.

Why don\u2019t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done.

Only Omar, who is from Somalia, was not born in the US.</p>\n    <p>Trump has subsequently launched several further attacks on the congresswoman accusing them of \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1150732346099978240\">foul language &amp; racist hatred</a>\". On 16 July <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1151089268535767042\">he tweeted</a> that they had been \"spewing some of the most vile, hateful, and disgusting things ever said by a politician in the House or Senate, &amp; yet they get a free pass and a big embrace from the Democrat Party.

Not one is willing to challenge him when he blows these racist dog whistles. The only conclusion is they agree with him and his racism.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bardella argues Trump is giving voice to sentiments long seething in the party. \u201cThe agenda of Republicans has always favoured white people and now for the first time in contemporary times they have a leader who is willing to ascribe words to that agenda.\u201d</p> \n<p>While Republicans fear Trump\u2019s base, the truth is \u201cdeeper and darker\u201d, Bardella said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re at Trump\u2019s mercy; they agree with him. The Republican party practices racism and white nationalism. It\u2019s not fear; they approve of it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s approval rating in the party regularly tops 90%, a record except for George W Bush after 9/11. Some praise his achievements \u2013 a robust economy, packing the courts with conservatives \u2013 and others revel in his attacks on Democrats, \u201cliberal elites\u201d, political correctness and the mainstream media.</p> \n<p>Internal opposition has been all but vanquished, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/how-donald-trump-conquered-the-republican-party-aa807726-dd47-480a-a953-9c96bd67a54a.html\">the Axios website summarised:</a> \u201cTrump knows he can say whatever he likes and face no consequences from the party he has conquered.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe few Republicans who dared to defy him either got crushed by pro-Trump candidates in primaries (Representative Mark Sanford), quit the party (Representative Justin Amash) or retired (Senators Jeff Flake and Bob Corker). One remaining critic, Senator Mitt Romney, mostly pushes back by issuing stern but ineffectual tweets. And Senator Ben Sasse, who used to lambaste the president, has mostly gone silent.\u201d</p> \n<p>Flake and former Ohio governor John Kasich criticised the president on Monday. As for Ryan, the former speaker is sniping from the sidelines. In a new book by Tim Alberta, American Carnage, he says Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t know<em> anything</em> about government\u201d and operates on \u201cknee-jerk reactions\u201d. The president blasted back, calling Ryan a \u201clame duck failure\u201d.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.hhh.umn.edu/directory/lawrence-jacobs\">Larry Jacobs,</a> director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: \u201cPaul Ryan was famously enabling of Trump as speaker. Now he\u2019s left and discovered a new career, he\u2019s found his courage and is speaking out against the president.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jacobs noted that many electoral districts are \u201clopsided\u201d in a way that rewards partisan politics. \u201cRepublicans are scared to death of Trump\u2019s followers. Speaking out is, for a number of Republicans, seen as the equivalent of political suicide.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cThe bigger issue is the acquiescence of Republican members of Congress allowing Trump to tarnish the party as a racist party. Trump is seizing the name brand of the Republican party and remaking it in his racist image.\u201d</p> \n<p>Progressives are under no illusions. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cobyjowens?lang=en\">Coby Owens,</a> chief executive of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouthCaucusUSA\">Youth Caucus of America</a>, said: \u201cThis just goes to show it\u2019s all about the party over the people. America is supposed to be a melting pot for everyone. Trump\u2019s \u2018Make America great again\u2019 was always more \u2018Make America great\u2019 for some people, and it\u2019s the people that look like them.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis has become the party of Trump and defending him at all costs. It\u2019s sad the Republican party used to be for families and conservative values; that\u2019s something you could disagree with but still discuss and come to an agreement. What they\u2019re doing now has nothing to do with policy and is about empowering one section of society.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "In an unfashionable corner of Washington, with African American community activists standing behind him, House speaker Paul Ryan described Donald Trump\u2019s view that an American-born judge was not qualified to preside over a case because of his Mexican heritage as the \u201ctextbook definition of a racist comment\u201d. It was June 2016 and Trump\u2019s hostile takeover of the Republican party was not quite complete. Three years later, when the now US president provided another example of racism ripped from the textbook, the response was different. Crickets. Trump\u2019s bigoted and false tweets telling four congresswomen of colour to \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they came from \u2013 three were born in the US \u2013 rather than \u201cloudly and viciously telling the people of the United States\u201d how to govern said as much as about the Republican party as it did his own nativist instincts. While Democrats piled in to defend Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, and introduced a House resolution, Trump\u2019s own party was almost entirely silent. Senator Susan Collins described his tweets as \u201cway over the line\u201d. Fred Upton, a congressman from Michigan, wrote that he was \u201cappalled\u201d. And Chip Roy, a congressman from Texas, tweeted that Trump \u201cwas wrong\u201d but could not resist adding: \u201cI just as strongly believe non-citizens who abuse our immigration laws should be sent home immediately, &amp; Reps who refuse to defend America should be sent home [from Congress].\u201d On the other side of the equation, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina unleashed a tirade in defence of the president. He told Fox News: \u201cWe all know that AOC [Ocasio-Cortez] and this crowd are a bunch of communists. They hate Israel, they hate our own country.\u201d At the White House, Trump defended his position. The bulk of the party said nothing. Why? For Kurt Bardella, a commentator and former GOP congressional aide, it\u2019s fairly simple. They share Trump\u2019s views. \u201cRepublicans agree with the president\u2019s racist tweets,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s the only explanation. It\u2019s a pattern of behaviour that the president engages in overtly racist rhetoric.\u201d Bardella highlighted examples including Trump\u2019s attacks on African American football players who \u201ctake a knee\u201d during the anthem to protest racial injustice; his pardoning of Joe Arpaio, a sheriff who discriminated against Latino people in Arizona; his drawing of moral equivalence between protesters and white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia; and his reported description of African nations, Haiti and El Salvador as \u201cshithole countries\u201d. \u201cOn and on we see this president insulting people who aren\u2019t white,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Republican party says nothing and they support the president. Not one is willing to challenge him when he blows these racist dog whistles. The only conclusion is they agree with him and his racism.\u201d Bardella argues Trump is giving voice to sentiments long seething in the party. \u201cThe agenda of Republicans has always favoured white people and now for the first time in contemporary times they have a leader who is willing to ascribe words to that agenda.\u201d While Republicans fear Trump\u2019s base, the truth is \u201cdeeper and darker\u201d, Bardella said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re at Trump\u2019s mercy; they agree with him. The Republican party practices racism and white nationalism. It\u2019s not fear; they approve of it.\u201d Trump\u2019s approval rating in the party regularly tops 90%, a record except for George W Bush after 9/11. Some praise his achievements \u2013 a robust economy, packing the courts with conservatives \u2013 and others revel in his attacks on Democrats, \u201cliberal elites\u201d, political correctness and the mainstream media. Internal opposition has been all but vanquished, the Axios website summarised: \u201cTrump knows he can say whatever he likes and face no consequences from the party he has conquered. \u201cThe few Republicans who dared to defy him either got crushed by pro-Trump candidates in primaries (Representative Mark Sanford), quit the party (Representative Justin Amash) or retired (Senators Jeff Flake and Bob Corker). One remaining critic, Senator Mitt Romney, mostly pushes back by issuing stern but ineffectual tweets. And Senator Ben Sasse, who used to lambaste the president, has mostly gone silent.\u201d Flake and former Ohio governor John Kasich criticised the president on Monday. As for Ryan, the former speaker is sniping from the sidelines. In a new book by Tim Alberta, American Carnage, he says Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t know anything about government\u201d and operates on \u201cknee-jerk reactions\u201d. The president blasted back, calling Ryan a \u201clame duck failure\u201d. Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: \u201cPaul Ryan was famously enabling of Trump as speaker. Now he\u2019s left and discovered a new career, he\u2019s found his courage and is speaking out against the president.\u201d Jacobs noted that many electoral districts are \u201clopsided\u201d in a way that rewards partisan politics. \u201cRepublicans are scared to death of Trump\u2019s followers. Speaking out is, for a number of Republicans, seen as the equivalent of political suicide.\u201d He added: \u201cThe bigger issue is the acquiescence of Republican members of Congress allowing Trump to tarnish the party as a racist party. Trump is seizing the name brand of the Republican party and remaking it in his racist image.\u201d Progressives are under no illusions. Coby Owens, chief executive of Youth Caucus of America, said: \u201cThis just goes to show it\u2019s all about the party over the people. America is supposed to be a melting pot for everyone. Trump\u2019s \u2018Make America great again\u2019 was always more \u2018Make America great\u2019 for some people, and it\u2019s the people that look like them. \u201cThis has become the party of Trump and defending him at all costs. It\u2019s sad the Republican party used to be for families and conservative values; that\u2019s something you could disagree with but still discuss and come to an agreement. What they\u2019re doing now has nothing to do with policy and is about empowering one section of society.\u201d",

Downing Street criticised Trump\u2019s comments but stopped short of branding him a racist. \u201cHer view is that the language which was used to refer to the women was completely unacceptable,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said. Trump was highly critical of May last week, saying she had made a \u201cmess\u201d of Brexit, following leaked diplomatic cables from the UK ambassador to Washington that described him as inept and insecure. Johnson, who was condemned for his failure to defend the ambassador, Sir Kim Darroch, is keen to rebuild the relationship with the US after the serious diplomatic row. Johnson has claimed he said nothing that should have been a factor in the ambassador\u2019s decision to quit, but that is not an assessment shared in Whitehall or by Darroch. Trump had condemned Darroch and sought to ostracise him in an attempt to punish the envoy and apparently to drive him from his job. The latest row about Trump\u2019s remarks is a test case of how far the next prime minister will put what they regard as the national economic interest and the pursuit of the special relationship ahead of defending essential British values and principles. There is a fear that with Brexit imminent, an increasingly isolated UK will have to turn more towards a Trump-led administration in its search for key allies. May\u2019s condemnation of Trump is a further sign the prime minister is willing to loosen the shackles in the final days of her premiership and say what she thinks. The Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, said earlier that May was right and \u201cboth men vying to be her successor should say so\u201d. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the president\u2019s comments were \u201cnot OK and diplomatic politeness should not stop us saying so, loudly and clearly\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The family of a private school pupil who was fatally stabbed have spoken of their devastation and said they will \u201ctake legal steps\u201d after a teenager was found not guilty of his murder. A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named, had been accused of killing his friend Yousef Makki, 17, during an argument in an affluent suburb of Cheshire. But on Friday the teenager, known only as Boy A, was found not guilty of both murder and manslaughter following a trial at Manchester crown court. Speaking for the first time since the verdicts, Makki\u2019s family said on Monday that their grief had been compounded by the acquittal and that they would be \u201ctaking legal steps\u201d to challenge it. Makki\u2019s elder sister, Jade Akoum, said: \u201cWe as Yousef\u2019s family are absolutely devastated by the verdict given on Friday. We have suffered heartbreaking losses twice now, firstly in losing Yousef and secondly now that no one has been found accountable of his murder. \u201cThis has affected us all immensely, not just our family but every one in the community too. All we wanted was justice for Yousef and closure. It feels now that we have not achieved that.\u201d Makki, who came from an Anglo-Lebanese family and lived in Burnage, dreamed of becoming a heart surgeon and had won a scholarship to attend the prestigious Manchester Grammar school. The trial heard that the teenager was stabbed in the heart with a flick knife after getting into an argument with his friends in the upmarket Cheshire village of Hale Barns, a suburb popular with footballers and television stars. On 2 March, Makki was with the two defendants when they made a botched attempt to buy \u00a345 worth of cannabis on a farm track. Boy A was attacked and had his bicycle thrown over a hedge. Boy A then later pushed Makki, who called him a \u201cpussy\u201d and punched him in the face, the court heard. The defendant told the jury Makki pulled out a knife and he responded by also taking out a knife, then accidentally stabbed his friend. Boy A then got rid of the knives in a panic before realising how serious the injury was and started to try to staunch the blood pouring from his wounded friend\u2019s chest as he lay dying in the street. Makki\u2019s father, Ghaleb Makki, collapsed in court following the not guilty verdicts, which prompted shouting and tears from the victim\u2019s family and emotional scenes as Boy A walked free from the dock into the arms of his relatives. Akoum, 28, on Monday described her brother as a \u201ccaring and loving brother, son and uncle\u201d and \u201can incredibly bright and ambitious person\u201d who had achieved all A grades in his GCSEs the year before his death. She said he was a \u201cloyal and loving friend\u201d who would \u201cgo above and beyond to support his friends in difficult times and had a kind and humble nature\u201d. Akoum, a mother of three, said: \u201cWe understand the country is as upset as the rest of us on the verdict and we will of course be taking steps legally to ensure Yousef\u2019s life did not end in vain.\u201d At a family event in Stockport, Akoum thanked teachers at Manchester Grammar school for their support and thanked her brother\u2019s friends \u201cfor upholding Yousef\u2019s memory with dignity\u201d. \u201cYousef was so lucky to have had you all as friends. All the letters, emails and messages from the public, we all really appreciate your kindness,\u201d she said. Boy A denied murder, claiming that he acted in self-defence because Makki had pulled out a knife. He admitted possession of a flick knife and perverting the course of justice by lying to police. A second 17-year-old, Boy B, was cleared of lying to police about what he had seen but admitted possession of a flick knife. Both were cleared of conspiracy to commit robbery before Makki\u2019s death. In a statement, Boy A\u2019s family said on Friday they welcomed the verdicts and that the jury had come \u201cto a proper conclusion on the evidence\u201d. They added: \u201cThere are, however, no winners in this case. Yousef\u2019s death was a tragedy and our son will have to live with his responsibility of his role for the rest of his life. \u201cBut the Makki family\u2019s hurt and loss are infinitely greater. Nothing we can say can make up for that or change it.\u201d \u2022 This article was edited on 23 August 2019 to amend details relating to Boy B.",

Eight former employees appeared on the programme to discuss the handling of complaints.

Exposing racism and corruption represents Labour values in action, and these whistleblowers should be thanked, not demonised.\u201d It also addresses a series of questions to Corbyn about the extent of his knowledge of any interference in antisemitism cases and the workplace atmosphere in the party. \u201cThe crisis has moved beyond a question of rules and disciplinary processes, to a question of a political culture, and crucially, leadership,\u201d the letter says. \u201cAs its leader, the moral responsibility for Labour\u2019s antisemitism crisis ultimately sits with you. Own that responsibility, or give it away to someone who will.\u201d Labour staffers in the GMB union have also submitted a motion for discussion at their branch meeting this week, demanding an apology for the party\u2019s response and condemning \u201cobscene threats of legal action\u201d. The motion, which will be debated on Thursday, condemns the Labour press office\u2019s Twitter response to the programme and says it was \u201cunacceptable for an employee\u2019s workload or the culture of an organisation to cause staff to have breakdowns or to contemplate suicide as several whistleblowers claimed on the programme\u201d. Corbyn visited Labour HQ and spoke to staff on Monday morning, although a source said it was not a formal address. A Labour spokesman said there had been no attempt to discredit any Jewish member experiencing antisemitism but defended the party\u2019s right to attack comments made by former staff which it considered to be inaccurate. \u201cOur response highlighted the Panorama team inventing a quote, editing emails and making no serious attempt to understand the party\u2019s procedures for dealing with antisemitism,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cA number of claims made in the Panorama programme by former staff members are inaccurate and some of the individuals have a clear record of political opposition or hostility to the Labour leadership.\u201d Last Wednesday, Labour\u2019s general secretary, Formby, wrote to all staff about the Panorama programme, saying she knew some would be \u201cdistressed\u201d by the programme and the ensuing coverage and that the party had full confidence in them. A party source also said it was wrong to link the legal threats made by the party against some individuals to the Panorama programme. \u201cThe letter was sent several months ago. It was not about antisemitism and was unrelated to the Panorama programme, which the party did not know about at the time,\u201d the source said. The BBC has defended the Panorama documentary. A spokesman said: \u201cThe BBC stands by its journalism and we completely reject any accusations of bias or dishonesty. The investigation was not pre-determined, it was driven by the evidence. The outcome shows the serious questions facing the Labour party and its leadership on this issue. The programme adhered to the BBC\u2019s editorial guidelines, including contacting the Labour party in advance of the broadcast for a full right of reply.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 18 July 2019 to clarify that half, not all, of the 200 signatories to the letter were current or former Labour staff.",

As the ticker-tape settled in the aftermath of England\u2019s historic win over New Zealand at Lord\u2019s, the 32-year-old said he would take time away from the game to consider whether he will still be worth his place in the team in four years\u2019 time. But before the next 50-over World Cup, due to be hosted by India in 2023, there is its Twenty20 equivalent in Australia late next year. While England\u2019s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, is due to end his stint after the upcoming Ashes series, he fancies Morgan will at least want to lead his side to a second trophy.

Better than expected results from Citigroup boosting Wall Street and the prospect of stimulus for China lifted the FTSE at the start of the week. </p> <p>Chinese GDP data showed that the economy grew by 6.2% its lowest level of growth in almost a decade. However, rather than depressing the market, hopes of stimulus for the world\u2019s second largest economy have boosted risk appetite, lifting demand for riskier assets such as stocks. Just as we are seeing with the US, the prospect of easing financial conditions is not being interpreted as bad news for stocks. Instead the prospect of cheaper borrowing in the case of the Fed and support from the PBOC is giving investors plenty of confidence to buy in. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d2cb8fc8f0845f89e30daf2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-15T17:40:03.314Z\">6.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Expert: Foolish to celebrate China's slowdown</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Donald Trump may feel vindicated by China\u2019s economic problems, but Americans won\u2019t be cheering if the US economy suffers the consequence.</strong></p> <p>Few countries would be fully insulated from a Chinese economic hard-landing, and America would certainly feel consequences - including less demand for US goods and financial volatility if emerging markets were also dragged down.</p> <p>Patrick Chovanec, managing director of Silvercrest Asset Management, fears that the official GDP data are masking the true weakness of China\u2019s economy.....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1150725567450406917\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">China\u2019s economy is slowing (deeper than the official number indicates) mainly due to long-standing domestic issues (overinvestment and bad debt) though trade frictions don\u2019t help.

In addition to quarterly data which marked an increase by 1.6%, the markets reacted to a spike in industrial production. In June, the annual growth accelerated from 5% to 6.3%. Since China is the largest raw materials importer, strong industrial figures are setting the demand for the commodities. As a result, we see an increase in purchases of mining companies, as well as Australian and New Zealand dollars, which are in demand in the hope of increasing exports to China.</p> <p>At the same time, in a more global context, one cannot lose sight of the fact that the current data remains very weak. The annual growth rate of the economy has slowed to a minimum level over the past 27 years, and the current surge in production has been stimulated by the Chinese government.

      "bodyText": "If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our news story on the Chinese growth figures.... and president Trump\u2019s response. Donald Trump has claimed that his tariff battle with China is working after official data from Beijing showed growth in the world\u2019s second biggest economy dropping to its slowest pace since 1992. The US president said the impact of his protectionist measures had been to cause an exodus of companies from China, as Beijing announced that its annual rate of expansion had slowed from 6.4% to 6.2% in the second quarter of 2019. In tweets that were immediately challenged by economists, Trump said his tough action had forced China\u2019s leaders to the negotiating table. Responding to evidence that trade tension was one factor behind the slowdown, Trump said: \u201cChina\u2019s 2nd Quarter growth is the slowest it has been in more than 27 years. The United States Tariffs are having a major effect on companies wanting to leave China for non-tariffed countries. Thousands of companies are leaving. This is why China wants to make a deal.... \u201c...with the U.S., and wishes it had not broken the original deal in the first place. In the meantime, we are receiving Billions of Dollars in Tariffs from China, with possibly much more to come. These Tariffs are paid for by China devaluing &amp; pumping, not by the U.S. taxpayer!\u201d The US has imposed tariffs on $250bn (\u00a3199bn) worth of Chinese goods including chemicals and machinery, while China has placed import levies on $110bn of US goods such as soybeans. More here: European stock markets ended the day higher, blown upwards by hopes of fresh Chinese stimulus measure to prop up growth. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 ended 25 points higher at 7,531, up 0.35%, while the German DAX gained 0.5%. Mining stocks and industrial groups gained. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index explains that some investors expect the People\u2019s Bank of China to ease monetary policy: After a brief stint in the red the FTSE has powered higher on Monday as risk on dominated. Better than expected results from Citigroup boosting Wall Street and the prospect of stimulus for China lifted the FTSE at the start of the week. Chinese GDP data showed that the economy grew by 6.2% its lowest level of growth in almost a decade. However, rather than depressing the market, hopes of stimulus for the world\u2019s second largest economy have boosted risk appetite, lifting demand for riskier assets such as stocks. Just as we are seeing with the US, the prospect of easing financial conditions is not being interpreted as bad news for stocks. Instead the prospect of cheaper borrowing in the case of the Fed and support from the PBOC is giving investors plenty of confidence to buy in. Donald Trump may feel vindicated by China\u2019s economic problems, but Americans won\u2019t be cheering if the US economy suffers the consequence. Few countries would be fully insulated from a Chinese economic hard-landing, and America would certainly feel consequences - including less demand for US goods and financial volatility if emerging markets were also dragged down. Patrick Chovanec, managing director of Silvercrest Asset Management, fears that the official GDP data are masking the true weakness of China\u2019s economy..... Time for a quick recap: China\u2019s economy has slowed to its slowest rate in almost 30 years, as its economy continued to be buffered by the trade war with America. Chinese GDP expanded by 6.2% in the second quarter of 2019, compared with a year earlier, the weakest since the data began being reported in 1992. Beijing\u2019s government warned that the economic outlook was tough. \u201cEconomic conditions are still severe both at home and abroad,\u201d said a spokesman. Analysts believe China\u2019s leadership could take fresh action to stimulate its economy, to avoid growth falling below the crucial 6% mark (still strong by G7 standards!). There are also signs that China\u2019s economy could be picking up. Industrial production growth accelerated to 6.3% year-on-year, while retail sales growth jumped to 9.8%. Donald Trump seized on the GDP data as proof that imposing $250bn of tariffs on Chinese imports was working. He tweeted that the trade war is having a \u201cmajor effect\u201d, and would spur Beijing to make a deal. US factories in the New York region have strengthened this month, after Trump and Xi Jinping agreed to restart trade negotiations. In the UK, computer science pioneer Alan Turing has been chosen to appear on the next \u00a350 note. Bank of England governor Mark Carney said: \u201cAlan Turing was an outstanding mathematician whose work has had an enormous impact on how we live today. As the father of computer science and artificial intelligence, as well as war hero, Alan Turing\u2019s contributions were far ranging and path breaking. Turing is a giant on whose shoulders so many now stand.\u201d The PM agrees: Shares in UK retail group Sports Direct have plunged by 10%, after it delayed its financial results. It blamed auditing complexity, and the challenge of integrating its House of Fraser. Boom! America\u2019s stock market has hit a new all-time high at the start of trading in New York. The S&amp;P 500 index and the Dow Jones industrial average have both touched fresh records, adding to last week\u2019s gains. Here\u2019s Reuters take on those Trump trade war tweets: U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday pointed to slowing economic growth in China amid restarted trade talks, saying U.S. tariffs were having \u201ca major effect\u201d and warning that \u201cpossibly much more\u201d were to come. Growth data released earlier on Monday showed the world\u2019s second-largest economy had slowed to 6.2% in the second quarter, its weakest pace in at least 27 years amid ongoing trade pressure from the United States. \u201cThis is why China wants to make a deal with the U.S., and wishes it had not broken the original deal in the first place,\u201d Trump tweeted. Trump and his administration are seeking to push China to make a trade pact after talks broke down in May. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to restart negotiations at their meeting at the G20 last month. U.S. and Chinese negotiators spoke by phone last week, and in-person talks are expected soon in Beijing, U.S. officials have said. America\u2019s National Association of Manufacturers points out that the Empire manufacturing survey isn\u2019t THAT good. Factories may be growing again, at least in and around New York, but new orders are still down and employment level fell again. Here\u2019s NAM\u2019s chief economist, Chad Moutray: Economists say we shouldn\u2019t get too excited by the Empire manufacturing report. The pick-up in growth is encouraging, but US factories will still be hurt by a trade war. Newsflash: Factories in the New York region have strengthened this month, after the US and China agreed to restart trade talks. The Empire State manufacturing index, just released the, has risen to 4.3 in July, up from -8.6 in June. That\u2019s the biggest turnaround in two years. Any positive reading suggests that manufacturing activity is expanding across New York state. Factory bosses reported that current business conditions improved this month. At the end of June, Donald Trump and China\u2019s Xi Jinping agreed to resume negotiations, removing the immediate threat of another flurry of tariffs. Reaction to follow.... Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at financial platform Willis Owen, agrees that the trade war is hurting China\u2019s economy. But, with growth at a 27-year low, Lowcock also believes China can take action if the slowdown worsens. \u201cThe Chinese GDP data shows that the trade war with the US is having an effect, as exports slowed. Although the US and China have announced they are re-starting negotiations it doesn\u2019t look like a resolution will come quick enough for any imminent turnaround in the economic data. \u201cThere are, however, some positives. The weaker economic data still shows an economy growing above 6% per annum, with domestic consumption continuing to grow. At the same time, China can intervene with further stimulus should the government become concerned. \u201cChina is slowing but it still looks manageable, and in the meantime investors get access to some fast growing companies, at sharply cheaper valuations currently than they were earlier this year. Nonetheless, while now may be a more attractive entry point thanks to the falls, investing in China requires a long term focus and a lot of patience.\u201d Reaction to president Trump\u2019s trade war tweets range from the educational to the bewildered: Inaccurate tweets are one thing - at least today\u2019s ones aren\u2019t racist, unlike Trump\u2019s shameful attack on four progressive Democratic congresswomen yesterday, which has just been condemned by Theresa May\u2019s office. Just in: Donald Trump has claimed that the slowdown in China\u2019s economy is due to the trade war he began last year. In a couple of factually questionable tweets, the president claims that companies are leaving China to dodge his tariffs, and that those tariffs are also bringing money into the US. Factcheck 1: A recent survey showed that 40% of US companies were considering moving manufacturing out of China. But economists said this is only partly due to the trade war. Plus, firms could leave most of their supply chain in China, and just complete the work in another country, circumventing tariffs. Factcheck 2: These tariffs are paid by US companies when they import goods, not by the Chinese firm doing the exporting. Trump often gets this wrong - arguing that China is actually picking up the tab by cutting its prices or weakening its currency. But in May, the IMF showed that US importers have born the cost. While Alan Turing is an excellent choice to be honoured on a UK banknote, it\u2019s a blow to campaigners who hoped the Bank of England would recognise an ethnic minority citizen, for the first time ever. The Banknotes of Colour campaign say they were ignored by the Bank, even though it claims to take diversity and equality \u201cvery seriously\u201d. In a letter in today\u2019s Financial Times, Zehra Zaidi and Dr Patrick Vernon say: Our campaign exhausted every avenue. We garnered more than 150,000 petition signatures. On December 16 2018, our campaign secured the support of celebrities such as David Oyelowo, Meera Syal and Gemma Chan, who signed a Sunday Times letter alongside 220 people in public life. On February this year, a letter signed by 100 cross-party politicians was sent by Helen Grant MP to the governor. On April 2, she presented a private members bill in parliament. Our campaign has not been taken seriously by the Bank. We have been met with a wall of legalese that the BoE has fulfilled its public sector equality duty. What then of the duty to engage with under-represented groups? Between the October 2018 announcement that there would be a new \u00a350 note and the November 2018 announcement that the category would be #ThinkScience, the BoE allowed campaigns such as ours to be active for weeks. The BoE did not explain why it went against its own criteria of ensuring professional diversity on banknotes, in replacing a current scientist on the \u00a350 in James Watt with another scientist. Moreover, there is now a complaint by a group called the Black Physicists that the BoE did not accept its nomination and who have asked the Treasury select committee to review the process. The campaign weren\u2019t even told than the announcement was coming today. Here\u2019s the full shortlist of scientists considered for the \u00a350 note, drawn from 989 different scientists who were nominated by the public: Mary Anning (1799-1847) \u2013 a self-taught palaeontologist known around the world for the fossil discoveries she made in her hometown of Lyme Regis. Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac (1902-1984) \u2013 whose research revolutionised our understanding of the universe\u2019s smallest matter. Rosalind Franklin (1920-1958) \u2013 who drove the discovery of DNA\u2019s structure, a critical breakthrough in our understanding of the biology of life. Stephen Hawking (1942-2018) \u2013 who made outstanding contributions to our understanding of gravity, space and time. William (1738-1822) and Caroline Herschel (1750-1848) \u2013 a brother and sister astronomy team devoted to uncovering the secrets of the universe. Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin (1910-1994) \u2013 whose research using x-ray crystallography delivered ground-breaking discoveries which shaped modern science and helped save lives. Ada Lovelace (1815-1852) and Charles Babbage (1791-1871) \u2013 visionaries who imagined the computer age. James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) \u2013 who made discoveries which laid the foundations for technological innovations which have transformed our way of life. Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) \u2013 whose incredible talent for numbers helped transform modern mathematics. Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) \u2013 who uncovered the properties of radiation, revealed the secrets of the atom and laid the foundations for nuclear physics. Frederick Sanger (1918-2013) \u2013 whose pioneering research laid the foundations for our understanding of genetics. Alan Turing (1912-1954) \u2013 whose work on early computers, code-breaking achievements and visionary ideas about machine intelligence made him one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. The news that Alan Turing, the father of modern computing, will grace the new \u00a350 is being well-received. Here\u2019s Conservative MP Guy Opperman: Labou MP Lucy Powell is just as pleased -- this is a rare issue that can unite MPs across the House of Commons. Scientist Dr Emily Grossman, a member of the Advisory Committee which made the choice, says there was a very strong shortlist. The new \u00a350 will feature one of Alan Turing\u2019s most famous quotes, given to The Times in 1949 about the opportunities of computing: \u201cThis is only a foretaste of what is to come, and only the shadow of what is going to be.\u201d The note is also illustrated with a very high-level mathematical formulae, as my colleague Nicola Davis explains: It will also reference one of Turing\u2019s academic papers, \u201cOn Computable Numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem\u201d, in which he essentially envisages computing machines and shows there are indeed unsolvable problems \u2013 in other words, propositions that cannot be deemed provable or not based only on rules and statements of fact. Newsflash: Alan Turing, the scientist famous for helping to crack the wartime Enigma code and pioneering the modern computer, has been chosen to appear on the Bank of England\u2019s new \u00a350 note. The mathematician was chosen from a list of almost 1,000 scientists in a decision that recognised both his role in fending off the threat of German U-boats in the Battle of Atlantic and the impact of his postwar persecution for homosexuality. Bank\u2019s governor Mark Carney is making the announcement now at the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester. Turing played a pivotal role at the Bletchley Park code and cypher centre during the second world war, but was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts. He died from cyanide poisoning two years later; a inquest concluding his death was suicide. Here\u2019s a concept version of the new \u00a350, which will enter circulation in 2021. And here\u2019s the full story: Mining stocks are among the risers on the London stock exchange this morning, on hopes that China\u2019s economy will perk up. FxPro\u2019s analyst team explain: \u201cThe Chinese GDP came out better than expected, somewhat reducing concerns about the growth rate of the second largest world economy. In addition to quarterly data which marked an increase by 1.6%, the markets reacted to a spike in industrial production. In June, the annual growth accelerated from 5% to 6.3%. Since China is the largest raw materials importer, strong industrial figures are setting the demand for the commodities. As a result, we see an increase in purchases of mining companies, as well as Australian and New Zealand dollars, which are in demand in the hope of increasing exports to China. At the same time, in a more global context, one cannot lose sight of the fact that the current data remains very weak. The annual growth rate of the economy has slowed to a minimum level over the past 27 years, and the current surge in production has been stimulated by the Chinese government. Under these conditions, market growth momentum can be very unsustainable if no further good news follows.\u201d Heads-up: In 15 minutes we discover which pioneering scientist is being honoured as the face of the Bank of England\u2019s new \u00a350 note. China\u2019s stock market ended the day up 0.4%, as traders anticipated fresh government stimulus measures to spur growth. There was also relief that the GDP report wasn\u2019t worse, and that retail sales and industrial output growth accelerated. Europe\u2019s mini rally has now fizzled out, though: Because China\u2019s GDP data only dates back to 1992, we can only say for certain that today\u2019s data is the worst in at least 27 years. It\u2019s probably the worst in around 30 years, as the FT explains: Chinese economic growth plummeted in the aftermath of the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square, but recovered and began its long period of expansion after Deng Xiaoping\u2019s \u201csouthern tour\u201d of 1992. The real economy also slowed sharply during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s and in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008. Over in Berlin, the government has warned that Germany\u2019s economy is under pressure. In its monthly report, the economy ministry warned that industrial activity is subdued, partly due to to weak global demand. It also singled out trade conflicts, geopolitical tensions and Brexit as key \u201cdownward risks\u201d. But, the ministry also hopes growth may pick up over the summer: \u201cAfter what is shaping up to be a subdued development in the second quarter, the forces of economic upswing could become more prominent again if the external environment settles.\u201d Data firm Markit has spotted that China\u2019s business leaders are unusually pessimistic about their prospects: But they\u2019re not alone. Business confidence worldwide has weakened to a 10-year low, as bosses anticipate weaker profits and less investment. Graham Spooner, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, says Sports Direct investors are understandably spooked by the delay to its results. \u201cIt was no surprise to see Sports Direct\u2019s shares drop sharply in response to this news, near to a seven-year low. Whenever a company announces a delay to reporting results within just a few days of when they are due the market naturally becomes concerned. Investors should note that part of this is due to a review of processes carried out by the company\u2019s auditors, Grant Thornton, but the decision to buy House of Fraser rests entirely on Sports Direct\u2019s management. That purchase was just one of several over the past year, including Evans Cycles, and trading on the high street has been difficult for many retailers. Until the company publishes its results and investors can see the situation for themselves they should be very wary.\u201d In the City, shares in retail group Sports Direct have plunged over 10% after it announced its annual results, due on Thursday, will be delayed. The problem is two-fold. 1) \u201cComplexities\u201d over the integration of House of Fraser, which SPD acquired lat summer, and uncertainty over its future performance. 2) \u201cIncreased scrutiny\u201d of SPD\u2019s auditors, Grant Thornton, who are taking longer than usual to crunch the numbers. Last week they were slammed by regulators for doing a shoddy job, with audit quality at the firm labelled a \u201cmatter of deep concern\u201d. Sports Direct admits that there\u2019s a danger that the guidance given in Sports Direct\u2019s announcement of 13 December 2018 could be affected by the ongoing auditing work. That\u2019s sent its shares sliding 11% to 231p, the weakest since the end of 2018. More here: China\u2019s growth report may reassure investors that the global economic outlook isn\u2019t as bad as feared, says Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. He\u2019s encouraged by the pick-up in retail spending and factory production in June: Is it really that bad? England won the cricket world cup, a Frenchman\u2019s in yellow in the Tour de France, Wimbledon managed a fortnight free of rain delays and the Chinese economy is recovering from the weakness that it suffered at the start of the year. There\u2019s a distinct risk that the theme for markets this week will be \u2018it\u2019s not that bad\u2019, particularly in London. China\u2019s barrage of economic data this morning may show real GDP growth continuing its gradual and suspiciously steady pace of slowdown continuing (6.2% y/y in Q2) but there were clear accelerations in retail sales, industrial production and capital spending. GDP data should always be viewed with some scepticism, as they\u2019re a blunt and incomplete measure of how a country is faring. This has spurred New Zealand to use wellbeing as a better measure, as it tries to tackle wealth inequality, homelessness, child poverty and mental health issues. But China\u2019s growth reports can often send eyebrows higher - due to Beijing\u2019s ability to consistently hit its GDP targets. Some analysts suspect that local officials feel heavy pressure to report that their region is performing as planned - even if it isn\u2019t. As the Financial Times reported in March, there are signs that some data is being falsified. \u201cSince local governments are rewarded for meeting growth and investment targets, they have an incentive to skew local statistics,\u201d said the authors led by Chang-Tai Hsieh, economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and research associate at the US National Bureau of Economic Research. For years, the sum of China\u2019s provincial GDP has exceeded the national figure, a clear sign of statistical inflation at the local level. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has previously acknowledged that \u201csome local statistics are falsified\u201d, and in 2017 the central government accused three provinces in China\u2019s north-east rust belt of fabricating data. Investors in Europe are taking the China slowdown in their stride. The London stock market has opened a little higher, with the FTSE 100 index up 8 points. There are stronger gains in other countries, with Germany\u2019s DAX gaining 0.8%. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says traders are anticipating more stimulus measures from the Chinese government to spur growth (and relieved that industrial output and retail spending rose in June). Bad news = good news. Relatively lacklustre growth in China has the market baying for more stimulus. To be fair, despite the headline Q2 GDP number slipping to a 30-year low at 6.2%, there were some signs of encouragement. Industrial production rose 6.3% in June, an improvement on the 5% growth in May. Retail sales also beat forecasts. Most of the recent softness seems trade-related, with exports having dipped 1.3%. The Chinese government is likely to do whatever it takes to keep its growth rate above 6%, says Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM: Today China reported its slowest rate of quarterly economic expansion in almost three decades. The economy grew 6.2% in Q2, in line with markets\u2019 expectations, but 0.2% below Q1 growth. Policymakers will likely defend the 6% growth levels over the second half of 2019 by escalating stimulus measures, whether it\u2019s in the shape of fiscal or monetary. On the bright side, industrial output grew 6.3% in June and retail sales easily beat market expectations coming at 9.8%. Whether this trend will be sustained remains to be seen, but so far, the data clearly reflects that China is not headed towards a hard landing. Although China\u2019s growth rate has slowed in recent quarters, there are signs that its economy may be picking up. Industrial production rose by 6.3% year-on-year in June, up from 5% in May. Retail sales growth sizzled too - up 9.8% from 8.6%. This may show that Beijing\u2019s recent stimulus measures are starting to pay off. This charts confirms that China\u2019s growth rate is now the weakest since modern records began in the early 1990s. The trade war with America has pulled it below its slump after 2008 financial crisis: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Along with death and taxes, you can usually rely on China\u2019s GDP figures to be bang on target.... despite the challenge of measuring growth across such a huge country. And once again, Beijing has hit the spot -- reporting that its economy grew at an annual rate of 6.2% in the second quarter of 2019. Although strong by advanced economy standards, that\u2019s actually the weakest growth rate seen in China in 27 years -- a sign that the trade war that has raged with America for the last year is causing economic damage. Government spokesman Mao Shengyong blamed weak economic conditions within China, and in the global economy. \u201cEconomic conditions are still severe both at home and abroad, global economic growth is slowing down and the external instabilities and uncertainties are increasing. \u201cThe economy is under new downward pressure\u201d The second quarter economic growth was the country\u2019s slowest pace since the first quarter of 1992 \u2014 the earliest quarterly data on record, according to Reuters. Tom Rafferty, principal economist for China at The Economist Intelligence Unit, blames trade tensions between Beijing and Washington. He writes: \u201cUncertainty caused by the US-China trade war was an important factor and we think this will persist, despite the recent tariff truce. \u201cBusinesses remain skeptical that the two countries will reach a broader trade agreement and recognise that trade tensions may escalate again.\u201d But on the optimistic side, this is within Beijing\u2019s goal of growth of between 6% and 6.5% this year. The economy doesn\u2019t appear to be falling over, despite Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to cut China\u2019s trade surplus with America. Investors aren\u2019t panicking. China\u2019s stock market is calm as a mill pond today, with the CSI 300 index up 0.07%. As Stephen Innes of Vanguard Partners puts it: The China GDP data was very much in line with consensus confirming the markets view that the economy continues to slow, and while GDP touched 27 years low in Q2, the on consensus print does lessen the market fears that China\u2019s economy is headed for a hard landing. As such risk assets will respond favourably but it\u2019s hard to escape the economic realities that the US-China trade war is having on global economies. More reaction to follow.... Also coming up today The economics diary is a little thin, but we do get the latest Empire survey of manufacturers in the New York region. Plus, the Bank of England will reveal the face of its new \u00a350 note. Alas, there isn\u2019t time to add one of our cricketing heroes [or the gracious Kane Williamson] , so the honour will go to a pioneer from the world of science. The agenda 11.15am: Bank of England unveils new \u00a350 note 1.30pm: US Empire Manufacturing survey of factories in the New York area (expected to rise to 0.5, up from -8.6).",

That vital six over midwicket off Trent Boult in the final over at Lord\u2019s was a brilliant snapshot of a man feeling the moment in his limbs, his tendons, his blood.

Some throw the kitchen sink at it. Ben Stokes throws Ben Stokes at it.</p> \n<p>It is an instinct that would repay him later in that flukish deflection as he dived to make his ground. And the same quality was there <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/03/west-indies-win-world-t20-final-carlos-brathwaite-sinks-england\" title=\"\">in Kolkata</a> too, the night Stokes just kept trying to bowl a yorker to Carlos Brathwaite and Brathwaite just kept on hitting him over the rope. No pulling back, no quarter. This has been a Stokes theme.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/15/diversity-strength-england-win-cricket-world-cup\">Diversity is one of our strengths and it helped us win the World Cup | Moeen Ali</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Probably expectation always hung a little heavily. Aged 14, Stokes was already a schoolboy star, hobnobbing with Joe Root at the Bunbury festival and rising through the levels with thrilling assurance. Aged 21, he already had five first-class hundreds, the first Englishman to do that so young since Denis Compton. That startlingly brutal 258 in Cape Town; the more brilliant century at Perth against one of the great Australian pace attacks: these were glimpses of a genuine A-list talent.</p> \n<p>Fine moments but there were others, ones that left him bruised. It felt as if Sunday was coming. Stokes had already had a fine World Cup. He ended up with the ninth-highest run total. He bowled briskly. He fielded with righteous fury and took that bravura catch in the deep on the opening day at the Oval, a catch that also seemed to involve reaching back into the past, behind him, plucking the ball out of some other timeline.</p> \n<p>Lord\u2019s can be a heavy kind of place and batting was tough. In the early morning Henry Nicholls, a fine Test player, had looked as if he had won a raffle to open in a World Cup final. Later, Jofra Archer bowled a series of vicious bouncers at Colin de Grandhomme, who took the ball bravely on helmet, shoulder and chest. A sure sign summer is here: the sound of leather on De Grandhomme.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"47686ff2-fb35-4312-a373-0b304467431b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DP19zgbJuPk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It lasted through the day. Some bowlers make the ball talk. Boult had it burbling in fluent Etruscan as England\u2019s innings began. It was time to bat with some heart and soul, to bat in the deeper gears, something Stokes has been working on all year as though in silent preparation.</p> \n<p>Jos Buttler was more fluent as England\u2019s two most explosive batsmen produced a vital, hard\u2011bitten partnership, but he also hit one up in the air just as they got close.</p> \n<p>And really it had to be Stokes. Another end note, another moment of jeopardy. There were two dot balls at the start of Boult\u2019s final over. Suddenly England needed 15 off four. Not again. Stokes wandered away and thrashed at the air with his bat, frustrated but not raging. Then came that full-body launch over midwicket. Then came the moment that settled the tournament.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/15/england-cricket-world-cup-odd-oval-party\">Hangovers, smiles and screaming kids: England\u2019s odd Oval party | Andy Bull</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Again Stokes was all in, throwing himself at the crease as he hared back to make his ground for a second run. Again something comical and even quite cruel happened. Except this time it happened to somebody else. The deflection off Stokes\u2019s bat to take the ball to the pavilion boundary was a moment of outrageous luck. But not quite dumb luck. Stokes knew where the ball was coming from. He was quick enough and brave enough to throw himself full length, not stopping, not taking a breath, taking England with him towards that glorious end.</p> \n<p>What happens from here is wide open. Stokes will be 32 when the next World Cup comes round. Before then there is a chance to make a little more Ashes impact and to become a founding star of that strange new beast The Hundred. He has his moment now. Something has lifted: Bristol, Kolkata, the sense of a player with a long dark cloud following him. Stokes 3.0, the post-redemption years, might well be the best bit of this story. </p>",

Some players address the ball with their bat face or with their wrists. Some throw the kitchen sink at it. Ben Stokes throws Ben Stokes at it. It is an instinct that would repay him later in that flukish deflection as he dived to make his ground. And the same quality was there in Kolkata too, the night Stokes just kept trying to bowl a yorker to Carlos Brathwaite and Brathwaite just kept on hitting him over the rope. No pulling back, no quarter. This has been a Stokes theme. Probably expectation always hung a little heavily. Aged 14, Stokes was already a schoolboy star, hobnobbing with Joe Root at the Bunbury festival and rising through the levels with thrilling assurance. Aged 21, he already had five first-class hundreds, the first Englishman to do that so young since Denis Compton. That startlingly brutal 258 in Cape Town; the more brilliant century at Perth against one of the great Australian pace attacks: these were glimpses of a genuine A-list talent. Fine moments but there were others, ones that left him bruised. It felt as if Sunday was coming. Stokes had already had a fine World Cup. He ended up with the ninth-highest run total. He bowled briskly. He fielded with righteous fury and took that bravura catch in the deep on the opening day at the Oval, a catch that also seemed to involve reaching back into the past, behind him, plucking the ball out of some other timeline. Lord\u2019s can be a heavy kind of place and batting was tough. In the early morning Henry Nicholls, a fine Test player, had looked as if he had won a raffle to open in a World Cup final. Later, Jofra Archer bowled a series of vicious bouncers at Colin de Grandhomme, who took the ball bravely on helmet, shoulder and chest. A sure sign summer is here: the sound of leather on De Grandhomme. It lasted through the day. Some bowlers make the ball talk. Boult had it burbling in fluent Etruscan as England\u2019s innings began. It was time to bat with some heart and soul, to bat in the deeper gears, something Stokes has been working on all year as though in silent preparation. Jos Buttler was more fluent as England\u2019s two most explosive batsmen produced a vital, hard\u2011bitten partnership, but he also hit one up in the air just as they got close. And really it had to be Stokes. Another end note, another moment of jeopardy. There were two dot balls at the start of Boult\u2019s final over. Suddenly England needed 15 off four. Not again. Stokes wandered away and thrashed at the air with his bat, frustrated but not raging. Then came that full-body launch over midwicket. Then came the moment that settled the tournament. Again Stokes was all in, throwing himself at the crease as he hared back to make his ground for a second run. Again something comical and even quite cruel happened. Except this time it happened to somebody else. The deflection off Stokes\u2019s bat to take the ball to the pavilion boundary was a moment of outrageous luck. But not quite dumb luck. Stokes knew where the ball was coming from. He was quick enough and brave enough to throw himself full length, not stopping, not taking a breath, taking England with him towards that glorious end. What happens from here is wide open. Stokes will be 32 when the next World Cup comes round. Before then there is a chance to make a little more Ashes impact and to become a founding star of that strange new beast The Hundred. He has his moment now. Something has lifted: Bristol, Kolkata, the sense of a player with a long dark cloud following him. Stokes 3.0, the post-redemption years, might well be the best bit of this story.",

Belvoir took home 13 of the 43 accolades on offer at Australia\u2019s annual live performance awards, held in Melbourne on Sunday and Monday nights. The event typically include awards for theatre, musicals, opera, dance, circus, touring and more. The epic production of S Shakthidharan\u2019s Counting and Cracking, in collaboration with Co-Curious, was a clear standout. The 16-actor play with a story spanning four generations from Sri Lanka to Australia won a total of seven awards over the two nights including best production, best new Australian work and best direction by Shakthidharan and Belvoir\u2019s artistic director Eamon Flack. Prakash Belawadi won the award for best male actor in a play, while Vaishnavi Suryaprakash won best supporting female actor. Members of Counting and Cracking\u2019s creative team, Dale Ferguson and Stefan Gregory, received awards for best scenic design and best sound design respectively. A revitalised production of Barbara and the Camp Dogs, Ursula Yovich and Alana Valentine\u2019s road story rock show, was Belvoir\u2019s other big hitter, awarded best musical and best original score. Yovich\u2019s \u201cboisterous\u201d alter-ego Barbara won her best female actor in a musical, while her co-star Elaine Crombie picked up the companion award for best female actor in a supporting role in a musical. Kate Mulvany was awarded best female actor in a play for her performance in Belvoir\u2019s Every Brilliant Thing, while Paul Blackwell won best male actor in a supporting role in a play for Faith Healer, a co-production with State Theatre Company South Australia. Elsewhere, Barrie Kosky and Suzanne Andrade\u2019s short-run Komische Oper Berlin production of The Magic Flute won awards for best opera, best direction and best male performer in a supporting role for Tom Erik Lie. Hannah Gadsby won best comedy performer for her much-anticipated Nanette follow-up show, Douglas. Melbourne\u2019s much-hyped Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (Parts One and Two) took home only one award, for Neil Austin\u2019s lighting design. 2018\u2019s Dark Mofo festival, run by Tasmania\u2019s Museum of Old and New Art (Mona), received the discretionary award for best special event \u2013 the only category that does not take nominations. Its summer festival, Mona Foma, won best contemporary music festival. The full list of nominees and winners can be found on the Helpmann awards website.",

      "bodyText": "It has been more than two years since Indigenous leaders resolved to push for a constitutionally enshrined Indigenous voice in parliament. Last week the Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, said he would put forward a model for a referendum on constitutional recognition within this term of parliament. But it remains unclear what that model will look like, and what, if anything, the Australian public will ultimately be asked to vote on. Here\u2019s what we know about the government\u2019s current position. Does Wyatt\u2019s statement mean the Morrison government will enact the Uluru statement? It doesn\u2019t appear so. Wyatt told the press club in his Naidoc week address on Wednesday that he would develop a \u201cconsensus option\u201d for referendum within three years. The Uluru statement from the heart proposed a referendum to introduce a constitutionally enshrined first nations voice to parliament, as well as a national process of truth-telling and treaty-making through a Makarrata commission. Wyatt told the press club \u201cthe development of a local, regional and national voice will be achieved\u201d, but that it would be based on strengthening existing jurisdictional organisations and advisory structures, with a focus on those at state and territory level. Treaties, he said, were best progressed there, rather than federally. He told the ABC that he interpreted the idea of a voice as \u201cnot just a singular voice, it was voices from every level\u201d. Enshrining a first nations voice to parliament is not the only option for constitutional recognition \u2013 we have been debating options for some time \u2013 but it was the only one put forward in the Uluru statement. In case there was any doubt about the government\u2019s position, the Australian reported on Saturday that \u201csenior government sources\u201d said a constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament was \u201cnot going to happen on [Scott Morrison\u2019s] watch\u201d. Morrison has previously joined his predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull, in describing the idea of a voice as a \u201cthird chamber\u201d of parliament, a line repeated in the past week by Peter Dutton, Barnaby Joyce and Craig Kelly. Is an Indigenous voice a third chamber of parliament? No. Isn\u2019t that debatable? No. Politicians who say the voice to parliament would be a third chamber are knowingly incorrect. So what is a voice to parliament? The structure has not been finalised and the report of the referendum council said parliament should design the voice in consultation with Aboriginal people. But a third chamber of parliament is outside the scope. When asked to describe the kind of body they were talking about, delegates at the Uluru dialogues spoke of wanting something similar to the disbanded Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, but with constitutional protection so it could not be unilaterally abolished, and more robust governance structures. Atsic was also accused of being a third chamber of parliament by John Howard, who went on to abolish the organisation when he was prime minister. He told parliament in 1989 that Atsic would \u201ccreate a black nation within the Australian nation\u201d. But politicians do not need to look backwards for how the voice could work, they just need to look at Victoria. What\u2019s happening in Victoria? Enrolment is under way for Aboriginal people in Victoria to vote in the First People\u2019s Assembly, a representative body of 21 elected representatives drawn from five voting regions, and 12 nominated representatives, one from each of the 12 formally recognised traditional owner groups in the state. That body is tasked with working with the state government to set up an independent treaty authority, creating a treaty negotiation framework, and creating and administering a self-determination fund. Treaty commissioner Jill Gallagher has described it as \u201ca voice to parliament to Victoria\u201d. Enrolment is open to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 16 and over who have lived in Victoria for at least three years, and all Victorian traditional owners. Any Victorian traditional owner who is eligible to be a director of a corporation can stand as a candidate, and there are quotas for female or non-male representation. The assembly is also creating a separate Aboriginal electoral roll to manage its elections, which will be independent from government. Voting will run from 16 September to 20 October, with the first meeting expected to be held in late October. What are other states doing? The Queensland government announced on Sunday that it would begin a treaty process, led by a panel co-chaired by Bidjara and Birri-Gubba Juru academic Jackie Huggins. The deputy premier, Jackie Trad, said it would be a community-led process with no preordained outcome that could take a number of years. Former Australian of the year and Yawuru man Mick Dodson was appointed treaty commissioner in the Northern Territory in February, eight months after the Territory government signed the historic Barunga agreement. He has been given just over two years to consult Aboriginal people, determine the best model for a treaty or treaties in the NT, develop a framework for treaty negotiations with government, and recommend the best model for Aboriginal representation in the process. Western Australia launched a community consultation process in September to help design a new independent statutory office to advocate and provide accountability for Aboriginal people in government policy and actions. The proposal is for one appointed official, not a representative body, but one of the consultation questions asked how Aboriginal people should be involved in the selection of that person. The Labor party in South Australia has pledged to enact the Uluru statement on a state level, with the creation of a voice to parliament and a treaty and truth-telling commission similar to the First Peoples Assembly in Victoria if it is elected in 2022. The Weatherill government had begun negotiating clan-based treaties before it lost the 2018 election. The Marshall Liberal government is honouring preliminary agreements struck through that process but does not support treaties. The NSW Labor party promised to establish a treaty following the 2019 election, which it lost. All these initiatives have been put forward by Labor governments or oppositions, echoing the national commitment from Labor to enact a voice to parliament and put the question to referendum, before it lost the May federal election. Shouldn\u2019t we focus on practical reconciliation? That is the standard response of conservative politicians who oppose overt moves toward self-determination. It\u2019s also a false dichotomy. The voice to parliament emerged from the constitutional dialogues as the preferred model because it was not symbolic and offered, according to the Uluru statement, \u201csubstantive constitutional change and structural reform\u201d. Creating a representative body that would have direct input into policy that overwhelmingly affects Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is not a symbolic nicety. If it were, it might be more acceptable to government.",

      "bodyText": "As ever the politics of the past week has been dominated by retirees and the issue of \u201cdeeming rates\u201d. It says something about our political debate that we just had an election fought with lies and scare campaigns about the impact of the ALP\u2019s policies for retirees and since then the biggest issue aside from tax has been on an issue that actually does affect retirement incomes. And while we can suggest maybe the ALP should have brought up the issue during the election campaign and not after, to be honest, as a Gen Xer I\u2019m just utterly fed up with it all. Now sure, deeming rates and how they affect retirees\u2019 incomes is important, but the overall emphasis placed on current retirees is completely out of whack with the pressing economic issues of this country. The big retirement scare for us as a country is not how those currently retired are coping, but what is in store for those hoping to do so in the next 10 to 20 years. Last week, as one does when you reach a certain age, I spent a bit of time mucking about on sites that I found after searching: \u201cHow much money do I need to retire?\u201d I\u2019m 20 years from retirement age and so am at the point where having consolidated all my super accounts (I had four of them) I\u2019m now thinking about what I need to do to be able to retire at 67 ... 68 ... 70? And when looking at these sites, such as the Asic \u201cmoney smart\u201d site, you notice one nice little sentence below the table estimating how much you need to retire either \u201cmodestly\u201d or \u201ccomfortably\u201d that should be written in flashing lights. The sentence is: \u201cThe table below ... assumes you own your home.\u201d It should also be an issue that is flashing red for our politicians and media. Last Friday the latest household wealth and income survey results led to some dumb reporting about how suddenly \u201cAustralians are millionaires\u201d because on average the wealth of all Australian households is $1.02m. Only 30% of households have more than $1m in wealth, but so rich are some that it skews the overall average. It was all rather silly and ignored the massive issue highlighted in the survey: that the main wealth asset for Australians \u2013 home ownership \u2013 is dropping quickly. I noted last week that overall home ownership \u2013 including both those who have a mortgage and those who have paid it off \u2013 has fallen from 73% in 2000-01 to just 65%. But when we look at the breakdown of ages we see the massive problem coming for future retirees \u2013 and it is one that largely was not an issue for current retirees. In 2017-18 something happened that has never occurred before: more 55-64-year-olds were still paying off a mortgage than owned their home outright: At the turn of the century, 64% of people in their pre-retirement years lived in a house owning no mortgage; now it is just 37%. Forty per cent of such households are still paying a mortgage compared with 20% in 2000. The percent of renters aged 55-64 has also risen in that time from 14.7% to 21.0%. And this is where that nice little sentence in the superannuation guides comes back with a vengeance. Because \u201cassumes you own your home\u201d means assumes you have paid off the mortgage. If you go to the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia\u2019s retirement guide, none of the budget expenses for \u201cASFA Retirement Standard for retirees\u201d include rent or mortgage repayments. For those aged 44-54, the issue is even more stark. Sure, you got to listen to Nirvana while at uni, but take a look at how few of you own a home compared with those 20 years older than you: In 2000, almost as many 44-54-year-olds had paid off their mortgage as held one. Now 55% have a mortgage and just 17% have paid it off. Over the past 30 years, the amount of 65+ year-olds who have paid off their mortgage is just under double the amount of 45-54-year-olds who had done so 20 years earlier. Thirty-nine percent of those aged 45-54 in 2000 had paid off a mortgage. That age cohort is now over 65 which has 74% owning a home outright. It suggest that with just 16.9% of 45-54-year-olds at the moment having paid off their home, in 20 years that will see only around 32% of retirees having done so. Right now our retirement systems operates with three-quarters of retirees owning a home; in 20 years it will need to work with less than a third doing so. To cope we\u2019re going to need big changes \u2013 older people living with children more than now perhaps \u2013 and it will also require greater reliance on aged pensions and social housing. But aged pensions and housing require tax revenue, and the number of prime aged workers \u2013 those who earn the most and pay the most taxes \u2013 is shrinking: And we also have a government that has just decided that in five years\u2019 time it should drastically shrink the tax base. A lower percentage of people earning high incomes combined with less tax being gathered from those workers while home ownership rates fall. It\u2019s a recipe for disaster, and it is one that the fixation on current retirees utterly ignores. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

We may not be that progressive a country anymore, particularly in light of our late adoption of same-sex marriage, but once upon a time we led the world in shattering television taboos about the LGBT community. That legacy lives on today in family-friendly shows like Neighbours \u2013 but look back a little further before declaring anything gay on TV is a first.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Number 96, The Box and Prisoner: Cell Block H are all available on DVD</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 Andrew Mercado is an Australian film and TV historian</em></p> <p><br></p>",

I have always thought this presentation of a gay hero to a mass audience did more for the acceptance of sexual minorities in Australia than all the solemn speeches of judges and professors or the worthy talk programs on the ABC.\u201d Number 96 didn\u2019t stop there with the world firsts: in 1973, Robyn Ross (Carolle Lea) revealed that she was \u201cnot really a girl\u201d, thereby making her the first trans character on television. She was portrayed by a real transgender person, legendary Sydney showgirl Carlotta, who had been asked to provide a fake name to keep her identity and the shock storyline a secret. Later that year, Marie Crowther (played by Gold Logie winner Hazel Phillips) outed herself as a lesbian after being caught caught peeping on Vera (Elaine Lee) in the shower. Although brief, she is probably TV\u2019s first lesbian (but sadly, many of these early episodes have not survived). In 1974, another saucy soap, The Box, premiered with bisexual Vicki Stafford (Judy Nunn) kissing teenager Felicity (Helen Hemingway). It aired on 11 February and was TV\u2019s first ever gay kiss, just beating the UK who screened their own a few days later when BBC2 teleplay Girls, airing on 22 February, showed two female army officers kissing. The sex, nudity and gay situations on Number 96 and The Box made both Aussie shows too explicit to be aired in other countries, so it is no surprise that most historians are unaware of their impact. But they could at least acknowledge Prisoner\u2019s Franky Doyle (Carol Burns) from 1979, a show which was seen repeatedly all over the world and was particularly popular in the US and UK. Prisoner: Cell Block H, as it was known outside of Australia, featured several long-running lesbian characters, but few matched the impact of Franky, whose on-screen death inspired a group of American lesbian bikers to lay a wreath at their local Los Angeles TV station. Franky Doyle was TV\u2019s first out butch lesbian, and given television (ie male network executives) usually prefers \u201clipstick lesbians\u201d (ie pretty, feminine ones), she hasn\u2019t had much competition in the years since. Except of course in other women\u2019s prison dramas, including Prisoner reboot Wentworth, where Franky Doyle lives again. So to all LGBT historians around the world: please start giving Australia some credit. We may not be that progressive a country anymore, particularly in light of our late adoption of same-sex marriage, but once upon a time we led the world in shattering television taboos about the LGBT community. That legacy lives on today in family-friendly shows like Neighbours \u2013 but look back a little further before declaring anything gay on TV is a first. \u2022 Number 96, The Box and Prisoner: Cell Block H are all available on DVD \u2022 Andrew Mercado is an Australian film and TV historian",

      "body": "<p>England have announced their intention to have fun at this World Cup, and now \u2013 for a few days at least \u2013 they truly can. This defeat of Jamaica here in Liverpool has effectively secured them a semi-final spot, in their first of this week\u2019s matches. For Jamaica, however, it was almost certainly the end of the dream \u2013 after their surprise defeat to South Africa on Sunday it will be the first time since 1995 that they have not made it into the knockout rounds.</p> <p>That is a major blow for a team who came into this tournament ranked second in the world and with great expectations of their first trophy in 15 attempts. Still, their captain, Jhaniele Fowler, took a deep breath and a philosophical stance. \u201cWe\u2019re devastated, we\u2019re disappointed because we wanted to go further,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what can we do? We\u2019re not going to kill ourselves.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/15/australia-coach-questions-world-cup-format-after-diamonds-demolish-barbados-netball\">Australia coach questions World Cup format after Diamonds demolish Barbados</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jamaica went toe-to-toe with England throughout the first half, pulling back every time their opponents began to pull away. They even held the lead, briefly, in the second quarter, in a game where bodies regularly bounced off each other and fell to the ground \u2013 especially around England\u2019s shooting circle, where Jamaica\u2019s prodigious young defender Shamera Sterling tried to make life hard for the veteran combination of Jo Harten and Helen Housby.</p> <p>An even more crucial fight was happening at the other end, where Geva Mentor took on Fowler. If England\u2019s goalkeeper \u2013 the best defender in the world \u2013 could not keep her rival away from the posts, then no one could.</p> <p>At 6ft 6in, Fowler is always an imposing figure on court in most games although it is also fair to say she is not a player who exerts unnecessary energy. While Mentor fluttered around her, or flew out of the circle to effect flying intercepts on an unsuspecting wing defence, the Jamaican waited patiently.</p> <p>Under the posts, however, she is a stone-cold killer. Her arm reached so close to the net that she popped balls in as if she was casually putting cans away on her kitchen shelf \u2013 and yet she could still seem unhappy with the result. She said afterwards that if she looked frustrated, it was at herself, but that was surely a kindness to her teammates. She did not miss a single shot \u2013 43 in total. </p> <p>Jamaica were always on the fightback, having started scrappily, but England were making their own mistakes and by the end of the first quarter there was just a goal between the sides. It was only after half-time that Jamaica\u2019s defence began to crumble against England\u2019s relentless midfield pressure, Serena Guthrie hassling Nicole Dixon at centre.</p> <p>Harten paid tribute to Sterling, the 24-year-old who has become famed in the game for her intercepts, but England handled that threat well and there were few of her tricks on display. Instead, it was Harten who pulled off magical feats, popping up in spaces that had not existed seconds previously as if she should be accompanied by a puff of smoke.</p> <p>Guthrie, the England captain, said: \u201cIf we\u2019d lost to Jamaica the pressure would have been on. We now can afford to do things like rest people, mix up combos and work on some new things.\u201d</p> <p>She barely needed to add that they also plan to enjoy the tournament more.</p> <p>Northern Ireland began their second round with their second close defeat in two days, after Malawi closed them out with an impressive display in the final 15 minutes of a tough-fought game.</p> <p>Northern Ireland came into this tournament ranked one place above Malawi, and twice they had their opponents within two goals, clawing back a nine-goal deficit in the third quarter. But wayward shooting cost them against a team that was not missing \u2013 their comparative averages of 74% and 92% was the ultimate difference between the sides.</p> <p>Dan Ryan, the coach, said his side would keep their disappointment in perspective and that Northern Ireland had \u201cshowed a sense of character\u201d after an emotional two-goal defeat to Zimbabwe on Sunday. \u201cIt was about how you show up and stand up. We rode a contest against a great side. We needed to tweak a few things, but it was about a response and we responded beautifully.\u201d</p> <p>There was disappointment, too, for Scotland, who lost to South Africa \u2013 who remain unbeaten in this tournament \u2013 by 28 goals. The Thistles have struggled to find consistency in their play and on Wednesday face Jamaica, who will be playing for pride, and their stated goal of a top-eight finish is ebbing away.</p>",

      "bodyText": "England have announced their intention to have fun at this World Cup, and now \u2013 for a few days at least \u2013 they truly can. This defeat of Jamaica here in Liverpool has effectively secured them a semi-final spot, in their first of this week\u2019s matches. For Jamaica, however, it was almost certainly the end of the dream \u2013 after their surprise defeat to South Africa on Sunday it will be the first time since 1995 that they have not made it into the knockout rounds. That is a major blow for a team who came into this tournament ranked second in the world and with great expectations of their first trophy in 15 attempts. Still, their captain, Jhaniele Fowler, took a deep breath and a philosophical stance. \u201cWe\u2019re devastated, we\u2019re disappointed because we wanted to go further,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what can we do? We\u2019re not going to kill ourselves.\u201d Jamaica went toe-to-toe with England throughout the first half, pulling back every time their opponents began to pull away. They even held the lead, briefly, in the second quarter, in a game where bodies regularly bounced off each other and fell to the ground \u2013 especially around England\u2019s shooting circle, where Jamaica\u2019s prodigious young defender Shamera Sterling tried to make life hard for the veteran combination of Jo Harten and Helen Housby. An even more crucial fight was happening at the other end, where Geva Mentor took on Fowler. If England\u2019s goalkeeper \u2013 the best defender in the world \u2013 could not keep her rival away from the posts, then no one could. At 6ft 6in, Fowler is always an imposing figure on court in most games although it is also fair to say she is not a player who exerts unnecessary energy. While Mentor fluttered around her, or flew out of the circle to effect flying intercepts on an unsuspecting wing defence, the Jamaican waited patiently. Under the posts, however, she is a stone-cold killer. Her arm reached so close to the net that she popped balls in as if she was casually putting cans away on her kitchen shelf \u2013 and yet she could still seem unhappy with the result. She said afterwards that if she looked frustrated, it was at herself, but that was surely a kindness to her teammates. She did not miss a single shot \u2013 43 in total. Jamaica were always on the fightback, having started scrappily, but England were making their own mistakes and by the end of the first quarter there was just a goal between the sides. It was only after half-time that Jamaica\u2019s defence began to crumble against England\u2019s relentless midfield pressure, Serena Guthrie hassling Nicole Dixon at centre. Harten paid tribute to Sterling, the 24-year-old who has become famed in the game for her intercepts, but England handled that threat well and there were few of her tricks on display. Instead, it was Harten who pulled off magical feats, popping up in spaces that had not existed seconds previously as if she should be accompanied by a puff of smoke. Guthrie, the England captain, said: \u201cIf we\u2019d lost to Jamaica the pressure would have been on. We now can afford to do things like rest people, mix up combos and work on some new things.\u201d She barely needed to add that they also plan to enjoy the tournament more. Northern Ireland began their second round with their second close defeat in two days, after Malawi closed them out with an impressive display in the final 15 minutes of a tough-fought game. Northern Ireland came into this tournament ranked one place above Malawi, and twice they had their opponents within two goals, clawing back a nine-goal deficit in the third quarter. But wayward shooting cost them against a team that was not missing \u2013 their comparative averages of 74% and 92% was the ultimate difference between the sides. Dan Ryan, the coach, said his side would keep their disappointment in perspective and that Northern Ireland had \u201cshowed a sense of character\u201d after an emotional two-goal defeat to Zimbabwe on Sunday. \u201cIt was about how you show up and stand up. We rode a contest against a great side. We needed to tweak a few things, but it was about a response and we responded beautifully.\u201d There was disappointment, too, for Scotland, who lost to South Africa \u2013 who remain unbeaten in this tournament \u2013 by 28 goals. The Thistles have struggled to find consistency in their play and on Wednesday face Jamaica, who will be playing for pride, and their stated goal of a top-eight finish is ebbing away.",

      "bodyText": "The high court has ruled that Gavin Woodhouse can be removed as a director of a series of his subsidiary companies after a judge heard the embattled financier had been withdrawing tens of thousands of pounds from a bank account he had kept secret from administrators. The move follows temporary administrators taking control of five Woodhouse companies over the past two weeks, including care homes and a planned adventure park. A crisis has engulfed the entrepreneur\u2019s business interests after an undercover investigation by the Guardian and ITV News raised questions about what had happened to millions of pounds of private investors\u2019 savings. During his ruling on Monday, which allowed interim managers to remove Woodhouse as a director of any subsidiary of the five companies they now oversee, Judge Alastair Norris said: \u201cIt appears that Mr Woodhouse has been seeking to extract from subsidiary companies further monies from accounts that were not disclosed to the interim managers as being accounts that NPD Group has interests. These accounts appear to be hotel operating accounts at Barclays, whereas the rest of the group banking is done at NatWest bank, about which the interim managers were told.\u201d The judge was told how Woodhouse had made two \u00a320,000 withdrawals from the account on 8 July and 11 July, \u201capparently for payment of legal expenses and for transfer to his personal account\u201d. The court also heard about how Woodhouse and his wife had been receiving a combined salary of \u00a3280,000 a year from one of his companies, while also borrowing hundreds of thousands of pounds from the firm. Norris, who has frozen Woodhouse\u2019s personal assets, added that the court had only heard \u201cone side of the story\u201d as the businessman had yet to be given the chance to explain his actions to the court. Over three separate hearings this month, temporary administrators have been appointed by the high court to run Woodhouse\u2019s holding company, Northern Powerhouse Developments, his adventure resort group, Afan Valley, two care home firms, MBI Clifton Moor and MBI Hawthorn, and his hotel holding company, Giant Hospitality. In the first hearing, Judge Sally Barber ruled that the financier\u2019s business model appeared to be \u201cthoroughly dishonest\u201d.

Malign individuals have surfaced only too regularly during the past 5,000 years of mankind\u2019s \u201cprogress\u201d. Resistance to malignancy has cost the oppressed their lives, sacrificed often selflessly for others, and indeed the \u201cSpartacus\u201d spirit can be extrapolated from \u201cfor the many, not the few\u201d, deemed \u201ca sinister slogan\u201d by Freedland. To me it means greater justice and equality for people who have been left behind.</p> <p>Reckless, base populist rhetoric belongs to the \u201cisms\u201d of the right. It is socialists\u2019 duty to ensure that the disaffected masses are not swept up into dangerous fascistic populism. No other political grouping in the UK but Labour has the power or determination to make that happen in these febrile times. To undermine Corbyn\u2019s efforts simply helps open the door wider to rightwing populism.<br><strong>Rosie Brocklehurst</strong><br><em>St Leonards on Sea, East Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland reckons \u201cthe many not the few\u201d is a sinister slogan. Not really. It came to the forefront in Blair\u2019s introduction to our <a href=\"http://labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml\" title=\"\">1997 manifesto</a>: \u201cI want a Britain that is one nation \u2026 run for the many not the few, strong and sure of itself at home and abroad\u201d. The slogan itself was taken directly from <a href=\"http://www.labourcounts.com/oldclausefour.htm\" title=\"\">Clause IV</a> of our then newly modernised constitution.</p> <p>Clause IV defines democratic socialism as \u201ccommunity in which power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many not the few; where the rights we enjoy reflect the duties we owe \u2026 To these ends we work for \u2026 a dynamic economy, the enterprise of the market and the rigour of competition.\u201d Therefore, for most of us, Labour became a party of what counts is what works, not one of outdated ideology.</p> <p>However, it is sinister that a modernised Labour movement \u2013 strategically delivered by the many \u2013 could so easily be hijacked by a recalcitrant few. Nevertheless, even after four years of far-left resurgence, our reforming Clause IV settlement is still intact and binding.<br><strong>Mike Allott</strong><br><em>Chandler\u2019s Ford</em><em>, Hampshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Contrary to Jonathan Freedland\u2019s bizarre suggestion, \u201cthe few\u201d of Labour\u2019s slogan \u201cFor the many, not the few\u201d are not to my knowledge seen by Labour members as being more likely to be Jewish than the rest of society; many Jewish people and families are among the \u201cmany\u201d, on average incomes, <a href=\"https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/cuts-leave-charedi-children-in-poverty-1.22187\" title=\"\">or in poverty</a>.</p> <p>The UK is one of the most unequal countries in Europe. Money has trickled up, not down, the richest having more than doubled their wealth in a few years, while incomes in general are 3% lower than before the financial crash. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/10/boris-johnson-promise-tax-cut-raise-40p-threshold\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson\u2019s offer of more tax cuts to the wealthy</a> came just months after Philip Alston, UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty, reported that poverty has inflicted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/16/uk-austerity-has-inflicted-great-misery-on-citizens-un-says\" title=\"\">\u201cgreat misery\u201d on people in the UK, with the government in denial</a>. The Labour slogan \u201cFor the many, not the few\u201d is about actually being \u201call in it together\u201d.<br><strong>Elizabeth York</strong><br><em>Northampton</em></p> <p>\u2022 It was a measured article by Jonathan Freedland. Two points. First, capitalism isn\u2019t either a structural issue or about individual agency \u2013 it may have its own logic but it is knowingly implemented and applied by individuals and groups, so the two are mutually constitutive.</p> <p>Second, there is confusion among populists about elitism, which in a time of increasing inequality and social fragmentation stirs racism. Greater political education and critical engagement with the causes of elitism, inequality and exclusion would help, and this requires unpacking the ideologies of populism that sustains this. Not so easy when there are forces afoot in politics, the media and elsewhere that are more than happy to sustain this status quo.<br><strong>Dr Paul Clements</strong><br><em>Goldsmiths</em><em>, University of London</em></p> <p>\u2022 It would have been useful if Jonathan Freedland had quoted polling evidence in his article. While its focus is on levels of antisemitism among party activists and members, if we look at Labour supporters <a href=\"https://antisemitism.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Antisemitism-Barometer-2017.pdf\" title=\"\">a 2017 YouGov/Campaign Against Antisemitism survey</a> suggests they are a little less antisemitic than the general population: 64% of everyone polled did not endorse any antisemitic statements, while 36% endorsed one antisemitic statement (this compares with 68% and 32% respectively for Labour supporters). Similarly, a <a href=\"https://cst.org.uk/public/data/file/7/4/JPR.2017.Antisemitism%20in%20contemporary%20Great%20Britain.pdf\" title=\"\">2017 report from the Institute for Jewish Policy Research</a> (IJPR) found \u201cthe political left, captured by voting intention or actual voting for Labour, appears in these surveys as a more Jewish-friendly, or neutral, segment of the population\u201d.</p> <p>Also, the 2017 <a href=\"https://antisemitism.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Antisemitism-Barometer-2017.pdf\" title=\"\">YouGov/Campaign Against Antisemitism poll</a> found \u201cLabour party supporters are less likely to be antisemitic than other voters\u201d, such as Tory and Ukip supporters. And comparing YouGov polling on antisemitism from January 2015 and August 2017 (Corbyn was elected Labour leader in September 2015) shows antisemitism among Labour voters <a href=\"https://evolvepolitics.com/yougov-polls-show-anti-semitism-in-labour-has-actually-reduced-dramatically-since-jeremy-corbyn-became-leader/\" title=\"\">reduced slightly in this period.</a></p> <p>The IJPR concluded that \u201cthe absence of clear signs of negativity towards Jews on the political left\u201d was \u201cparticularly curious in the current context\u201d as there were \u201cperceptions among some Jews of growing leftwing antisemitism\u201d. Could this confusion be down to commentators using insinuation and anecdotal examples instead of hard evidence?<br><strong>Ian Sinclair</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The antisemitism or alleged antsemitism in the Labour party reported in the media has come as a shock to so many party members. I\u2019ve been a member for 63 years, a parliamentary candidate five times and a Labour councillor for more than 40 years. During this period I have attended hundreds of meetings and met thousands of members. I can honestly say that I have never ever heard an antisemitic remark. In fact the opposite: I\u2019ve seen very strong support for the Jewish community.<br><strong>John Mann</strong><br><em>Irchester, Northamptonshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 If, when asked half a decade ago, to which of our two main political parties should one ascribe the terms \u201cracism\u201d and \u201canarchy\u201d, few would have difficulty answering. How swiftly things fall apart as we now are faced with the racist left and anarchist right. No wonder fear and confusion haunt our increasingly friendless country.<br><strong>Dr Richard Clubb</strong><br><em>Ealing, London</em></p> <p>\u2022 In your article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/13/corbyn-decries-bbcs-inaccuracies-over-labour-antisemitism\" title=\"\">Corbyn decries BBC\u2019s \u2018inaccuracies\u2019 over Labour antisemitism</a>, theguardian.com, 13 July) you quote Jeremy Corbyn as saying that \u201cIt\u2019s less than 0.1% of our membership that have ever been involved in any accusation, never mind any resolution of the issue.\u201d Mr Corbyn needs to be asked: if that is so, then why is it that so many Labour candidates for high office seem to be selected from that 0.1%?<br><strong>Bernard Kay</strong><br><em>York</em></p>",

But surely one does not exclude the other? Malign individuals have surfaced only too regularly during the past 5,000 years of mankind\u2019s \u201cprogress\u201d. Resistance to malignancy has cost the oppressed their lives, sacrificed often selflessly for others, and indeed the \u201cSpartacus\u201d spirit can be extrapolated from \u201cfor the many, not the few\u201d, deemed \u201ca sinister slogan\u201d by Freedland. To me it means greater justice and equality for people who have been left behind. Reckless, base populist rhetoric belongs to the \u201cisms\u201d of the right. It is socialists\u2019 duty to ensure that the disaffected masses are not swept up into dangerous fascistic populism. No other political grouping in the UK but Labour has the power or determination to make that happen in these febrile times. To undermine Corbyn\u2019s efforts simply helps open the door wider to rightwing populism. Rosie Brocklehurst St Leonards on Sea, East Sussex \u2022 Jonathan Freedland reckons \u201cthe many not the few\u201d is a sinister slogan. Not really. It came to the forefront in Blair\u2019s introduction to our 1997 manifesto: \u201cI want a Britain that is one nation \u2026 run for the many not the few, strong and sure of itself at home and abroad\u201d. The slogan itself was taken directly from Clause IV of our then newly modernised constitution. Clause IV defines democratic socialism as \u201ccommunity in which power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many not the few; where the rights we enjoy reflect the duties we owe \u2026 To these ends we work for \u2026 a dynamic economy, the enterprise of the market and the rigour of competition.\u201d Therefore, for most of us, Labour became a party of what counts is what works, not one of outdated ideology. However, it is sinister that a modernised Labour movement \u2013 strategically delivered by the many \u2013 could so easily be hijacked by a recalcitrant few. Nevertheless, even after four years of far-left resurgence, our reforming Clause IV settlement is still intact and binding. Mike Allott Chandler\u2019s Ford, Hampshire \u2022 Contrary to Jonathan Freedland\u2019s bizarre suggestion, \u201cthe few\u201d of Labour\u2019s slogan \u201cFor the many, not the few\u201d are not to my knowledge seen by Labour members as being more likely to be Jewish than the rest of society; many Jewish people and families are among the \u201cmany\u201d, on average incomes, or in poverty. The UK is one of the most unequal countries in Europe. Money has trickled up, not down, the richest having more than doubled their wealth in a few years, while incomes in general are 3% lower than before the financial crash. Boris Johnson\u2019s offer of more tax cuts to the wealthy came just months after Philip Alston, UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty, reported that poverty has inflicted \u201cgreat misery\u201d on people in the UK, with the government in denial. The Labour slogan \u201cFor the many, not the few\u201d is about actually being \u201call in it together\u201d. Elizabeth York Northampton \u2022 It was a measured article by Jonathan Freedland. Two points. First, capitalism isn\u2019t either a structural issue or about individual agency \u2013 it may have its own logic but it is knowingly implemented and applied by individuals and groups, so the two are mutually constitutive. Second, there is confusion among populists about elitism, which in a time of increasing inequality and social fragmentation stirs racism. Greater political education and critical engagement with the causes of elitism, inequality and exclusion would help, and this requires unpacking the ideologies of populism that sustains this. Not so easy when there are forces afoot in politics, the media and elsewhere that are more than happy to sustain this status quo. Dr Paul Clements Goldsmiths, University of London \u2022 It would have been useful if Jonathan Freedland had quoted polling evidence in his article. While its focus is on levels of antisemitism among party activists and members, if we look at Labour supporters a 2017 YouGov/Campaign Against Antisemitism survey suggests they are a little less antisemitic than the general population: 64% of everyone polled did not endorse any antisemitic statements, while 36% endorsed one antisemitic statement (this compares with 68% and 32% respectively for Labour supporters). Similarly, a 2017 report from the Institute for Jewish Policy Research (IJPR) found \u201cthe political left, captured by voting intention or actual voting for Labour, appears in these surveys as a more Jewish-friendly, or neutral, segment of the population\u201d. Also, the 2017 YouGov/Campaign Against Antisemitism poll found \u201cLabour party supporters are less likely to be antisemitic than other voters\u201d, such as Tory and Ukip supporters. And comparing YouGov polling on antisemitism from January 2015 and August 2017 (Corbyn was elected Labour leader in September 2015) shows antisemitism among Labour voters reduced slightly in this period. The IJPR concluded that \u201cthe absence of clear signs of negativity towards Jews on the political left\u201d was \u201cparticularly curious in the current context\u201d as there were \u201cperceptions among some Jews of growing leftwing antisemitism\u201d. Could this confusion be down to commentators using insinuation and anecdotal examples instead of hard evidence? Ian Sinclair London \u2022 The antisemitism or alleged antsemitism in the Labour party reported in the media has come as a shock to so many party members. I\u2019ve been a member for 63 years, a parliamentary candidate five times and a Labour councillor for more than 40 years. During this period I have attended hundreds of meetings and met thousands of members. I can honestly say that I have never ever heard an antisemitic remark. In fact the opposite: I\u2019ve seen very strong support for the Jewish community. John Mann Irchester, Northamptonshire \u2022 If, when asked half a decade ago, to which of our two main political parties should one ascribe the terms \u201cracism\u201d and \u201canarchy\u201d, few would have difficulty answering. How swiftly things fall apart as we now are faced with the racist left and anarchist right. No wonder fear and confusion haunt our increasingly friendless country. Dr Richard Clubb Ealing, London \u2022 In your article (Corbyn decries BBC\u2019s \u2018inaccuracies\u2019 over Labour antisemitism, theguardian.com, 13 July) you quote Jeremy Corbyn as saying that \u201cIt\u2019s less than 0.1% of our membership that have ever been involved in any accusation, never mind any resolution of the issue.\u201d Mr Corbyn needs to be asked: if that is so, then why is it that so many Labour candidates for high office seem to be selected from that 0.1%?

      "body": "<p>Three days before Christmas 2015, when I was 19, I had my breasts reduced in size. Sitting alone in my flat after the operation at Ross Hall hospital in Glasgow, I confronted my scars for the first time, and I cried.</p> <p>It was not the first time that I had cried over my body, but these were not the tears of a miserable, frustrated teenager. I felt as if I had been through a battle and had emerged victorious. Holding those stitched-up breasts, a manageable 32E down from a 34GG, I was finally, gloriously me.</p> <p>After Simona Halep was crowned the 2019 Wimbledon champion, I wondered if she had felt the same after her surgery 10 years ago. Halep, then a 17-year-old rising star, had felt that her chest was affecting her game, and opted to have her breasts reduced from a 34DD to a 34C. \u201cIt\u2019s the weight that troubles me,\u201d <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2014/05/31/how-breast-reduction-saved-a-tennis-stars-career/\" title=\"\">she said at the time</a>. \u201cMy ability to react quickly \u2013 my breasts make me uncomfortable when I play.\u201d</p> <p>Although <a href=\"https://www.si.com/tennis/2018/05/24/simona-halep-interview-french-open-tennis\" title=\"\">she told Sports Illustrated last year</a> that her breast-reduction surgery had been her \u201cbiggest sacrifice\u201d for the sport, Halep has said she has never regretted the decision. \u201cI didn\u2019t like them [her breasts] in my everyday life either. I would have gone for surgery even if I hadn\u2019t been a sportswoman.\u201d</p> <p>Today, as a 23-year-old journalist, I still feel the magnitude of my decision, and its impact not just on my body, but on my mental health and every other aspect of my life. I no longer need to hide my body under layers of clothing or sleep in a particular position to avoid strain. I can sit up straight without attracting stares, or accusations of being attention-seeking. Most liberating of all, the operation freed me from chronic headaches, and back and neck pain that had led me to take painkillers every day.</p> <p>Breast-reduction surgery is carried out under general anaesthetic, most often by cosmetic surgeons in private practice. The operation usually involves removing excess fat, glandular tissue and skin, and reshaping the remaining breast tissue. The nipple is moved, creating a scar that, for most women, runs vertically and across the breast crease in an anchor shape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1e5b7ab0d7e81eab40b4354ae86d53bce54e447\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1e5b7ab0d7e81eab40b4354ae86d53bce54e447/0_68_3404_2043/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simona Halep \u2026 says she never regretted her decision.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simona Halep \u2026 says she never regretted her decision.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The operation can remove up to a kilogram from each breast, and takes between 90 minutes and four hours, depending on the extent of the reduction; a two-night hospital stay is recommended. It is also expensive: about \u00a36,500, <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cosmetic-procedures/breast-reduction-female/\" title=\"\">according to the NHS</a>, excluding any consultations or follow-up care.</p> <p>Despite all this, the number of people having the procedure is on the rise. In 2018, 4,409 women had their reductions paid for by NHS England, up from 4,354 in 2017, 4,188 in 2016 and 3,959 in 2015.<strong> </strong>The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons\u2019 annual audit in May found that it was the <a href=\"https://baaps.org.uk/media/press_releases/1708/cosmetic_surgery_stats_number_of_surgeries_remains_stable_amid_calls_for_greater_regulation_of_quick_fix_solutions\" title=\"\">second-most-popular procedure for women</a> (after breast augmentation), with 4,014 women in the UK having paid to have their breasts reduced in the past year, an increase of 7% between 2017 and 2018.</p> <p>That so many women are prepared to shoulder the cost themselves is testament to the life-changing potential of the procedure. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20048598\" title=\"\">A 2010 study by Georgetown University Hospital</a> found that many breast reduction patients reported an improvement in their chronic headaches and migraines following reduction surgery.</p> <p>Patient satisfaction is high: in 2012, a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22964671\" title=\"\">10-year retrospective analysis</a> of 600 consecutive patients at a single institution in the US found that more than 95% of them would opt to have the surgery again. It concluded that there was a demonstrable improvement in the patient\u2019s quality of life, regardless of their weight and size or how much breast tissue was removed.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t even consider a breast reduction to be a cosmetic procedure \u2013 it\u2019s an incredibly beneficial operation,\u201d says Chris Hall, a consultant plastic surgeon in Belfast and a member of the British Association of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons (Bapras). \u201cThe physical benefits, how patients feel psychologically afterwards and the improvement of their quality of life are all well-documented. Unfortunately, the eligibility criteria set, which has been increasingly tightened over the years, makes it almost impossible to get the procedure on the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>The NHS criteria <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ebi-statutory-guidance-v2.pdf\" title=\"\">are supported by the</a> Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which includes the Royal College of Surgeons and the independent assessors the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. A patient must have had a steady BMI of less than 27; their breasts must be of \u201cmassive disproportion to body habitus\u201d; they could or should have \u201cintractable intertrigo\u201d (inflammation caused by skin-to-skin friction), \u201casymmetry greater than one cup size\u201d and \u201csignificant psychological distress\u201d.</p> <p>But many women who have sought to have their surgery covered have complained of inconsistencies and lack of transparency over how to qualify. Amy Hill, a 23-year-old personal trainer, was initially rejected for a breast reduction despite a bra size of 28KK. \u201cI hated my breasts \u2013 they were a constant strain on me,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Getting a bra was impossible. When she went to Bravissimo, a specialist shop with the slogan \u201cinspiring big-boobed girls to feel amazing\u201d, they told her that they didn\u2019t make them in her size. \u201cI cried in the changing rooms.\u201d</p> <p>For the best part of a year, she wore a bikini top. \u201cIt was all that would fit me. I would always attract unwanted attention: people thought they were fake. You could always see them. They were enormous.\u201d</p> <p>When Hill was told that she did not meet the criteria for a reduction \u2013 \u201cthey told me they didn\u2019t affect me mentally enough\u201d \u2013 she blacked out, she says. \u201cI was so desperate for it. For someone to turn around and tell me \u2018no\u2019 \u2013 it devastated me.\u201d</p> <p>But she kept pushing. \u201cThe whole process was so long and exhausting. I would wait three months for an appointment for them to then tell me something they could have told me on the phone. I was going to give up, but my mum had had [the operation] when she was my age, and told me that I needed to just keep trying. She said that it wasn\u2019t as hard for her as it was for me.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the NHS decides that no one is getting a reduction, then it should tell us that it isn\u2019t going to fund it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hill eventually had a breast reduction on the NHS in 2016, when she was 21. In hospital, after her operation, a nurse didn\u2019t believe that her breasts had previously been as large as she said. \u201cShe made me get out of the bed to measure them,\u201d says Hill. \u201cEveryone else in the ward was commenting that I couldn\u2019t have possibly been the size I said I was; that it was impossible.</p> <p>\u201cI was so embarrassed, I cried. I felt a bit shamed by people for not appreciating my breasts, and wanting to get rid of them.\u201d</p> <p>But Hill has not regretted the operation for a moment. \u201cBefore, when I went to the gym, I had to wear three bras. Now, within a year of beginning training as a personal trainer, I\u2019m opening a gym of my own. I was very lucky to get the procedure.\u201d</p> <p>The eligibility criteria differ in every sector of the NHS, meaning that women seeking the surgery are almost at the mercy of a postcode lottery, says Russell Bramhall, a consultant at the Canniesburn plastic surgery unit in Glasgow Royal Infirmary. \u201cI cannot remember the last time I did a breast reduction on the NHS. Everything has got tighter and tighter; we work in a poorly funded state system.\u201d The referral process and long waiting times can also be a barrier.</p> <p>In my case, I was right to compare my journey to a battle. I campaigned for my operation to be performed by the NHS for four years. NHS Scotland recognises breast reductions under its exceptional referral protocol for procedures that are not treating an underlying disease process, and thereby only provides them on very rare occasions. Patients must be referred to a clinical psychologist after assessment and are subject to the decision of a clinical commissioning group.</p> <p>I was expected to strip and stand at every consultation, poked and prodded by male doctors, student doctors and nurses. I felt I had no choice \u2013 it was as if by opting to have the surgery, I had given up my right to privacy.</p> <p>At one appointment, a young GP printed off NHS advice on breast reductions after Googling it. At my psychiatric evaluation, a female clinical psychologist asked me: \u201cWhen you say you think people are staring at you on the street \u2013 are you not staring at them first?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6937feabaceaed68f627307719d77c5bb4859a90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6937feabaceaed68f627307719d77c5bb4859a90/8_64_588_735/400.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Hill \u2026 had a breast reduction on the NHS.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Hill \u2026 had a breast reduction on the NHS.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amy Hill</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After an exhausting, humiliating and intrusive fight with my GP and NHS Scotland, I ended up paying for the operation myself. The system effectively pushes women seeking breast reductions into the private sector, say Bramhall and Hall.</p> <p>Ann (not her real name), a 22-year-old student living in Scotland, wants a reduction operation for her 36FF breasts, but can\u2019t afford to go private. \u201cI want to like the way my breasts look, but I really don\u2019t, even though all my sexual partners love them. There have been times when I have felt so frustrated, I have imagined the psychological and physical relief of just chopping them straight off my body. They don\u2019t make me feel more feminine, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019d feel less of a woman without them.\u201d</p> <p>Ann finds that clothes never fit properly, and bras cost much more than those in standard sizes. But most of all, she says, \u201cmy back hurts \u2013 but not enough for the NHS\u201d.</p> <p>Bramhall says that as well as the physical problems associated with large breasts \u2013 \u201cback pain, shoulder pain, infections, bra straps cutting, impetigo-like thrush under the breast\u201d \u2013 the impact on people\u2019s mental health and quality of life is often not considered. \u201cA common mental symptom in my patients is low self-esteem and poor body image. They lack confidence socially, and when they are out of their clothing with their partners. I get women all the time who describe not feeling comfortable in swimwear or summer clothing \u2013 the amount of pleasure they get in summer is lessened. People wear loose clothing all the time to camouflage their appearance. It\u2019s not taken into account at all.\u201d</p> <p>Those who can\u2019t afford private surgery may be tempted by cheaper options that are not always safe or well-regulated. Bapras members report seeing patients who had post-op complications after cosmetic procedures outside the UK, where eligibility criteria are often more lax or even nonexistent. In many cases, having unmanageably large breasts is associated with health complications such as obesity, due to the inability to exercise, and anxiety and depression, due to low self-esteem and self-image (which can morph into body dysmorphic disorders).</p> <p>Hall says the NHS criteria can deny surgery to those who need it most. \u201cA lot of the criteria are based on poor evidence: for example, it is very hard to maintain a BMI of below 27 for two years with large breasts. You can\u2019t exercise. If you are slim, they look bigger. If you are a size M, your breasts can weigh the equivalent of 2lb of sugar on both sides.\u201d</p> <p>Both consultants acknowledge the pressure that the NHS is under, leading it to prioritise trauma and cancer cases. \u201cThe NHS doesn\u2019t have a bottomless pit of money,\u201d says Hall, \u201cbut what Bapras would like is transparency and uniformity. We would like the same eligibility criteria across the country so it is consistent, no matter where you live. If the NHS decides that no one is getting a reduction, then it should tell us that there is no money, and that it isn\u2019t going to fund it.\u201d</p> <p>It speaks to a wider issue in women\u2019s health issues not being taken seriously that every year, thousands of women are paying for a procedure that undoubtedly improves their health and quality of life. I had struggled with the decision to seek surgery, wondering if it was anti-feminist to want to change my body \u2013 but my reduction turned out to be the most empowering decision I had ever made. It was not just about making my breasts smaller \u2013 it was a path to a life of confidence, free from pain.<strong> </strong>I gained autonomy over my body, but I had to fight for it.</p>",

I no longer need to hide my body under layers of clothing or sleep in a particular position to avoid strain. I can sit up straight without attracting stares, or accusations of being attention-seeking. Most liberating of all, the operation freed me from chronic headaches, and back and neck pain that had led me to take painkillers every day. Breast-reduction surgery is carried out under general anaesthetic, most often by cosmetic surgeons in private practice. The operation usually involves removing excess fat, glandular tissue and skin, and reshaping the remaining breast tissue. The nipple is moved, creating a scar that, for most women, runs vertically and across the breast crease in an anchor shape. The operation can remove up to a kilogram from each breast, and takes between 90 minutes and four hours, depending on the extent of the reduction; a two-night hospital stay is recommended. It is also expensive: about \u00a36,500, according to the NHS, excluding any consultations or follow-up care. Despite all this, the number of people having the procedure is on the rise. In 2018, 4,409 women had their reductions paid for by NHS England, up from 4,354 in 2017, 4,188 in 2016 and 3,959 in 2015. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons\u2019 annual audit in May found that it was the second-most-popular procedure for women (after breast augmentation), with 4,014 women in the UK having paid to have their breasts reduced in the past year, an increase of 7% between 2017 and 2018. That so many women are prepared to shoulder the cost themselves is testament to the life-changing potential of the procedure. A 2010 study by Georgetown University Hospital found that many breast reduction patients reported an improvement in their chronic headaches and migraines following reduction surgery. Patient satisfaction is high: in 2012, a 10-year retrospective analysis of 600 consecutive patients at a single institution in the US found that more than 95% of them would opt to have the surgery again. It concluded that there was a demonstrable improvement in the patient\u2019s quality of life, regardless of their weight and size or how much breast tissue was removed. \u201cI don\u2019t even consider a breast reduction to be a cosmetic procedure \u2013 it\u2019s an incredibly beneficial operation,\u201d says Chris Hall, a consultant plastic surgeon in Belfast and a member of the British Association of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons (Bapras). \u201cThe physical benefits, how patients feel psychologically afterwards and the improvement of their quality of life are all well-documented. Unfortunately, the eligibility criteria set, which has been increasingly tightened over the years, makes it almost impossible to get the procedure on the NHS.\u201d The NHS criteria are supported by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which includes the Royal College of Surgeons and the independent assessors the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. A patient must have had a steady BMI of less than 27; their breasts must be of \u201cmassive disproportion to body habitus\u201d; they could or should have \u201cintractable intertrigo\u201d (inflammation caused by skin-to-skin friction), \u201casymmetry greater than one cup size\u201d and \u201csignificant psychological distress\u201d. But many women who have sought to have their surgery covered have complained of inconsistencies and lack of transparency over how to qualify. Amy Hill, a 23-year-old personal trainer, was initially rejected for a breast reduction despite a bra size of 28KK. \u201cI hated my breasts \u2013 they were a constant strain on me,\u201d she says. Getting a bra was impossible. When she went to Bravissimo, a specialist shop with the slogan \u201cinspiring big-boobed girls to feel amazing\u201d, they told her that they didn\u2019t make them in her size. \u201cI cried in the changing rooms.\u201d For the best part of a year, she wore a bikini top. \u201cIt was all that would fit me. I would always attract unwanted attention: people thought they were fake. You could always see them. They were enormous.\u201d When Hill was told that she did not meet the criteria for a reduction \u2013 \u201cthey told me they didn\u2019t affect me mentally enough\u201d \u2013 she blacked out, she says. \u201cI was so desperate for it. For someone to turn around and tell me \u2018no\u2019 \u2013 it devastated me.\u201d But she kept pushing. \u201cThe whole process was so long and exhausting. I would wait three months for an appointment for them to then tell me something they could have told me on the phone. I was going to give up, but my mum had had [the operation] when she was my age, and told me that I needed to just keep trying. She said that it wasn\u2019t as hard for her as it was for me.\u201d Hill eventually had a breast reduction on the NHS in 2016, when she was 21. In hospital, after her operation, a nurse didn\u2019t believe that her breasts had previously been as large as she said. \u201cShe made me get out of the bed to measure them,\u201d says Hill. \u201cEveryone else in the ward was commenting that I couldn\u2019t have possibly been the size I said I was; that it was impossible. \u201cI was so embarrassed, I cried. I felt a bit shamed by people for not appreciating my breasts, and wanting to get rid of them.\u201d But Hill has not regretted the operation for a moment. \u201cBefore, when I went to the gym, I had to wear three bras. Now, within a year of beginning training as a personal trainer, I\u2019m opening a gym of my own. I was very lucky to get the procedure.\u201d The eligibility criteria differ in every sector of the NHS, meaning that women seeking the surgery are almost at the mercy of a postcode lottery, says Russell Bramhall, a consultant at the Canniesburn plastic surgery unit in Glasgow Royal Infirmary. \u201cI cannot remember the last time I did a breast reduction on the NHS. Everything has got tighter and tighter; we work in a poorly funded state system.\u201d The referral process and long waiting times can also be a barrier. In my case, I was right to compare my journey to a battle. I campaigned for my operation to be performed by the NHS for four years. NHS Scotland recognises breast reductions under its exceptional referral protocol for procedures that are not treating an underlying disease process, and thereby only provides them on very rare occasions. Patients must be referred to a clinical psychologist after assessment and are subject to the decision of a clinical commissioning group. I was expected to strip and stand at every consultation, poked and prodded by male doctors, student doctors and nurses. I felt I had no choice \u2013 it was as if by opting to have the surgery, I had given up my right to privacy. At one appointment, a young GP printed off NHS advice on breast reductions after Googling it. At my psychiatric evaluation, a female clinical psychologist asked me: \u201cWhen you say you think people are staring at you on the street \u2013 are you not staring at them first?\u201d After an exhausting, humiliating and intrusive fight with my GP and NHS Scotland, I ended up paying for the operation myself. The system effectively pushes women seeking breast reductions into the private sector, say Bramhall and Hall. Ann (not her real name), a 22-year-old student living in Scotland, wants a reduction operation for her 36FF breasts, but can\u2019t afford to go private. \u201cI want to like the way my breasts look, but I really don\u2019t, even though all my sexual partners love them. There have been times when I have felt so frustrated, I have imagined the psychological and physical relief of just chopping them straight off my body. They don\u2019t make me feel more feminine, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019d feel less of a woman without them.\u201d Ann finds that clothes never fit properly, and bras cost much more than those in standard sizes. But most of all, she says, \u201cmy back hurts \u2013 but not enough for the NHS\u201d. Bramhall says that as well as the physical problems associated with large breasts \u2013 \u201cback pain, shoulder pain, infections, bra straps cutting, impetigo-like thrush under the breast\u201d \u2013 the impact on people\u2019s mental health and quality of life is often not considered. \u201cA common mental symptom in my patients is low self-esteem and poor body image. They lack confidence socially, and when they are out of their clothing with their partners. I get women all the time who describe not feeling comfortable in swimwear or summer clothing \u2013 the amount of pleasure they get in summer is lessened. People wear loose clothing all the time to camouflage their appearance. It\u2019s not taken into account at all.\u201d Those who can\u2019t afford private surgery may be tempted by cheaper options that are not always safe or well-regulated. Bapras members report seeing patients who had post-op complications after cosmetic procedures outside the UK, where eligibility criteria are often more lax or even nonexistent. In many cases, having unmanageably large breasts is associated with health complications such as obesity, due to the inability to exercise, and anxiety and depression, due to low self-esteem and self-image (which can morph into body dysmorphic disorders). Hall says the NHS criteria can deny surgery to those who need it most. \u201cA lot of the criteria are based on poor evidence: for example, it is very hard to maintain a BMI of below 27 for two years with large breasts. You can\u2019t exercise. If you are slim, they look bigger. If you are a size M, your breasts can weigh the equivalent of 2lb of sugar on both sides.\u201d Both consultants acknowledge the pressure that the NHS is under, leading it to prioritise trauma and cancer cases. \u201cThe NHS doesn\u2019t have a bottomless pit of money,\u201d says Hall, \u201cbut what Bapras would like is transparency and uniformity. We would like the same eligibility criteria across the country so it is consistent, no matter where you live. If the NHS decides that no one is getting a reduction, then it should tell us that there is no money, and that it isn\u2019t going to fund it.\u201d It speaks to a wider issue in women\u2019s health issues not being taken seriously that every year, thousands of women are paying for a procedure that undoubtedly improves their health and quality of life. I had struggled with the decision to seek surgery, wondering if it was anti-feminist to want to change my body \u2013 but my reduction turned out to be the most empowering decision I had ever made. It was not just about making my breasts smaller \u2013 it was a path to a life of confidence, free from pain. I gained autonomy over my body, but I had to fight for it.",

As luck would have it, I\u2019ve just uploaded Chameleon #7, which may or may not contain some Easter eggs for cluedoku solvers. Other than that: I got a pretty good reception for Chameleon #6 when it was in the hot seat at Big Dave\u2019s Rookie Corner, Chameleon #3 has an Abba theme, if that floats your boat, and I think Porcia may have Chameleon #5 in mind when she comments that I sneak \u201cvisual chicanery\u201d into my puzzles. Thanks very much to everybody who persevered with the puzzle, apologies to anyone who abandoned it, and thanks also to you, Alan, for hosting it in the first place. Many thanks to Chameleon, Chameleon #7 is recommended and I hope others are inspired \u2026",

While working in a bar at his home in Dungannon just before Christmas in 1986 Clarke brushed with the kind of tragedy which afflicted Northern Ireland for so long. \u201cThe bomb scare came at 8.30, everybody out, bomb went off at 9.00 and the place was flattened,\u201d said the 50-year-old. \u201cThat was life in Northern Ireland. Bombs were going off quite frequently. And a lot of people, unfortunately, paid a heavy penalty for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. That was our life back there at that stage. \u201cYou think at that stage, when everything was going on, about whether we were ever going to have a tournament such as this. It was beyond the realms of possibility. It was just never going to happen. So to get to the point where you guys are all sitting here doing this has been an incredible journey for what we\u2019ve all come through.\u201d Clarke\u2019s early rise was just one interesting facet of a draw which paired McIlroy with Paul Casey and the US Open champion, Gary Woodland. McIlroy\u2019s quest to win the Claret Jug for a second time begins shortly after 10am. Tiger Woods will have to wait until after 3pm to sample Portrush in competition format. Woods partners Patrick Reed for the first time in a major and, as an apparent reward for progress in Europe over the past 18 months, Matt Wallace. Woods played 18 holes for the second day in succession from 8am on Monday, with Rickie Fowler and Dustin Johnson.",

      "bodyText": "South Africa\u2019s former president Jacob Zuma has told a judicial inquiry into corruption allegations that he is the victim of a plot by foreign intelligence agencies to seek his downfall. Speaking on the first day of five days of testimony, Zuma denied he had presided over an immense system of corruption and patronage that drained billions from the country\u2019s exchequer. Zuma was ousted last year after almost a decade in power, following a bitter internal battle within the ruling African National Congress party. He faces hours of questioning by Raymond Zondo, a senior judge, mandated to investigate allegations of \u201cstate capture\u201d in South Africa during his presidency. In hearings on Monday morning, Zuma claimed two foreign intelligence agencies had recruited spies within the ANC as part of a scheme to control South Africa and that the inquiry was designed to smear him. \u201cI have been vilified, alleged to be the king of corrupt people,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people who infiltrated, there are spies who were at work. I asked people in [my] organisation: \u2018What have I done?\u2019 They can\u2019t tell me. This commission \u2026 must be the grave of Zuma. He must be buried here.\u201d The inquiry was set up after an ombudsman\u2019s report uncovered apparent evidence of improper contact between three wealthy businessmen brothers \u2013 Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta \u2013 and senior officials in Zuma\u2019s administration. The report, which stopped short of asserting criminal behaviour, called for an investigation into whether Zuma, some of his cabinet members and some state companies had acted improperly. Among the cases it reviewed was an allegation by the then deputy finance minister that the Guptas had offered to secure him his boss\u2019s job, as well as claims that Zuma had directed state firms to award tenders to companies owned by the family. Zuma has said the three Gupta brothers are his friends but he denies any influence-peddling in their relationship. The Gupta family denied the accusations and left South Africa around the time that Zuma was ousted. The inquiry has also heard a series of further serious allegations from witnesses in recent months, describing massive bribes paid to officials by businesses seeking favours. Throughout the day, the 77-year-old Zuma and his lawyers continued to portray the him as a victim. \u201cI have been provoked and provoked to the last degree \u2026 My own family suffers \u2026 people forget that I have a family who do not want to hear lies about me,\u201d he said. Zuma said he could trace the conspiracy against him to the early 1990s, when he received an intelligence report that two foreign intelligence agencies \u201cfrom big countries\u201d and a branch of the apartheid government had come up with a strategy to get rid of him. \u201cThey took a decision that Zuma must be removed from the decision-making structures of the ANC. That\u2019s why the character assassination, that is the beginning of the process that has put me where I am today,\u201d Zuma said After the hearing, he addressed hundreds of supporters who had gathered outside the offices of the inquiry in Johannesburg. Some wore military fatigues emblazoned with the emblem of the former armed wing of the ANC shouted: \u201cHands off Zuma!\u201d Natasha Mazzone, a senior parliamentarian with the opposition Democratic Alliance party, said Zuma was trying to whitewash serious allegations: \u201cThe fact that we\u2019ve heard a conspiracy theory dating back to 1990 is proof that the real truth is going to take a long time to extract.\u201d There have been fears that Zuma will use the hearings as a platform to attack his successor, Cyril Ramaphosa, who led the ANC to a convincing election victory in May but has so far been unable to fully assert his authority over the party. Observers say Ramaphosa needs to move quickly to root out entrenched networks of patronage and graft, often involving individuals who owe senior positions within the party or public administration to Zuma. Zuma faces a separate corruption investigation involving 16 charges of fraud, racketeering and money laundering relating to a deal to buy European military hardware to upgrade South Africa\u2019s armed forces in 1994.

Steve was born in Whitechapel, east London, one of the two sons of Sylvia (nee Wise), who worked in the fashion industry, and her husband, Isaac, a household goods salesman, who died when Steve was two years old. At Central Foundation Boys\u2019 school in Hoxton, Steve was voted head of the sixth form, led a campaign to abolish school caps, set up a branch of the Young Communist League and attended anti-Vietnam war marches. After studying psychology at Nottingham University, in his early 20s he became a reporter on the Bromley Times in Kent before moving to Cornwall to work for the Western Morning News and Plymouth Sound radio. In 1978 the BBC offered him a reporter\u2019s job on the west country radio show Morning Sou\u2019West, then in London on Newsbeat and on TV shows such as Here and Now, Just One Chance and The Money Programme. Eventually he moved out of frontline journalism and took his skills first to the Fostering Network, where he managed its media affairs, and then to the Design Council. After retiring he helped people with mental health problems as a volunteer at the Maytree Respite Centre in Finsbury Park, north London, and was also a part-time, associate NHS hospital manager at Barnet, Enfield and Haringey mental health trust, responsible for making decisions about the discharge of patients detained under the Mental Health Act.

      "bodyText": "Extinction Rebellion has carried out protests in five UK cities, marking the start of what it describes as a \u201csummer uprising\u201d. The environmental activist group is calling for greater government action against the climate emergency. Monday\u2019s demonstrations \u2013 targeting London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow \u2013 caused disruption to traffic in parts of the cities. Protests in each city are focusing on a different ecological threat: rising sea levels, floods, wildfires, crop failures and extreme weather. According to Extinction Rebellion, more than 3,000 activists across the country have signed up to participate in acts of civil disobedience this week, a third of those in London. The group has installed large coloured boats in each location, branded with the message \u201cAct Now\u201d. Extinction Rebellion is demanding that the UK government prevents further losses to biodiversity and commits to producing net zero greenhouse gases by 2025. The group said it would carry out \u201ccreative acts of civil disobedience\u201d including blocking roads and bridges, as well as holding educational workshops. The London activists have promised to continue the action for a week. More than 15 police vans accompanied the crowd outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, where about 250 protesters blocked the Strand from about 9am to 5pm. The group included children as young as three months old. Police said there had been no arrests. A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion said: \u201cAfter [our campaign in] April, parliament declared an environmental emergency, but no action has been taken on this, so we\u2019re here to remind them that actions speak louder than words.\u201d The group said it had chosen the Royal Courts of Justice after it was announced last week that more than 1,000 activists who had participated in April\u2019s demonstrations were facing prosecution. Extinction Rebellion disrupted London and other cities with 11 days of protests that it cast as the biggest act of civil disobedience in recent British history. \u201cWe\u2019re here in solidarity with them and climate activists all over the world who are putting their lives on the line for climate justice,\u201d a spokesperson said. The group occupied the Strand for the duration of the day, with activists sitting on the ground and singing together to stop traffic. In the early evening the group moved on to a camp in a park near Waterloo where they planned to stay overnight. Sue Hayman, the shadow environment secretary, addressed the crowd from the boat installation. She praised the pressure that Extinction Rebellion was putting on the government and local councils to highlight the severity of the climate crisis. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to make a real difference, we have to have the political will to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is serious, this is a real emergency and we cannot carry on as we are.\u201d Roc Sandford, 61, said: \u201cI\u2019m involved because I have children and I want them not to starve and die in social collapse.

      "body": "<p>One of the best stories about Vicky McClure concerns the time she flew by private jet to attend the Berlin film festival in 2008 with Madonna. \u201cIt was, like, wow, a whirlwind.\u201d And the next day, McClure was back at her office job sorting out the mail. \u201cAnswering the door: \u2018Hello, postie? Yeah, I\u2019ll let you through.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/14/festivals.comedy\">Filth &amp; Wisdom</a>, wasn\u2019t too well received, alas. But being handpicked by Madonna for her directorial debut \u2013 McClure must have felt she was about to make it? \u201cWhen you\u2019re young,\u201d says the actor, her blue eyes widening, \u201cit\u2019s hard because your expectations are so high. Just having so much rejection, I\u2019d built quite a thick skin. Even so I was like, \u2018This is it, I know it.\u2019 And it wasn\u2019t, again.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s safe to say McClure has made it now. We are sitting in a fancy London hotel and, last night, she was at a screening of her latest drama, though she insists: \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel that relaxed about things. I live in the real world and I don\u2019t take things for granted.\u201d As the newly promoted DI Kate Fleming in the BBC\u2019s Line of Duty juggernaut, McClure reached a prime-time audience, and her recent documentary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/02/our-dementia-choir-with-vicky-mcclure-review-your-tears-will-flow-unstoppably\">Our Dementia Choir</a>, was one of the most affecting TV shows of the year. Now she\u2019s about to star in a standalone film, one of three dramas in an anthology for Channel 4, created with writer and director Dominic Savage.</p> <p>Her film, I Am Nicola, is about a disintegrating relationship set against a background of coercive control. When Savage asked what kind of story she\u2019d like to do, McClure said a drama about a relationship. \u201cI\u2019m fascinated by them,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a massive part of who you are, and it\u2019s destructive \u2013 and it\u2019s amazing.

It can be quite isolating and you don\u2019t really know you\u2019re in it when you\u2019re in it.\u201d These previous relationships weren\u2019t abusive, though, as Nicola\u2019s is. \u201cIt was just being young \u2013 two people not really knowing how to have an adult relationship.\u201d</p> <p>Savage worked out the scenes, but the dialogue was improvised. \u201cYou\u2019ll see a scene that could last two minutes but we\u2019ve spent 20 minutes beforehand and after developing it, so it feels like you\u2019ve got a lot of raw emotion. It\u2019s interesting. I like working that way.\u201d McClure has known Fitzpatrick since she was 11, when they both attended Nottingham\u2019s drama group, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/apr/07/nottingham-fame-academy-the-village\">Television Workshop</a>, where improvisation was a key part.</p> <p>McClure grew up in the city, where her dad was a joiner and her mum a hairdresser.

My head just spun.\u201d</p> <p>When she was 14, she got a place at London\u2019s Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts, but her parents couldn\u2019t afford to send her. (Years later, she found letters they had written to the council and arts organisations pleading for donations.) \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what I was missing so it was fine. Looking back, you kind of go, \u2018It wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u2019\u201d And anyway, the workshop was brilliant. \u201cIt was a bit of a shithole, really,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s what I loved about it.

      "bodyText": "One of the best stories about Vicky McClure concerns the time she flew by private jet to attend the Berlin film festival in 2008 with Madonna. \u201cIt was, like, wow, a whirlwind.\u201d And the next day, McClure was back at her office job sorting out the mail. \u201cAnswering the door: \u2018Hello, postie? Yeah, I\u2019ll let you through.\u2019\u201d The film, Filth &amp; Wisdom, wasn\u2019t too well received, alas. But being handpicked by Madonna for her directorial debut \u2013 McClure must have felt she was about to make it? \u201cWhen you\u2019re young,\u201d says the actor, her blue eyes widening, \u201cit\u2019s hard because your expectations are so high. Just having so much rejection, I\u2019d built quite a thick skin. Even so I was like, \u2018This is it, I know it.\u2019 And it wasn\u2019t, again.\u201d It\u2019s safe to say McClure has made it now. We are sitting in a fancy London hotel and, last night, she was at a screening of her latest drama, though she insists: \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel that relaxed about things. I live in the real world and I don\u2019t take things for granted.\u201d As the newly promoted DI Kate Fleming in the BBC\u2019s Line of Duty juggernaut, McClure reached a prime-time audience, and her recent documentary, Our Dementia Choir, was one of the most affecting TV shows of the year. Now she\u2019s about to star in a standalone film, one of three dramas in an anthology for Channel 4, created with writer and director Dominic Savage. Her film, I Am Nicola, is about a disintegrating relationship set against a background of coercive control. When Savage asked what kind of story she\u2019d like to do, McClure said a drama about a relationship. \u201cI\u2019m fascinated by them,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a massive part of who you are, and it\u2019s destructive \u2013 and it\u2019s amazing. I had ideas about what I wanted that to feel and look like. I love watching people doing really boring, normal stuff. Dominic\u2019s brave enough to do that, to capture it.\u201d Nicola is a hairdresser while her boyfriend (Perry Fitzpatrick) has an office job, and their relationship begins to feel suffocating. Some of I Am Nicola is based on McClure\u2019s own experiences: \u201cJealousy and trust issues. It can be quite isolating and you don\u2019t really know you\u2019re in it when you\u2019re in it.\u201d These previous relationships weren\u2019t abusive, though, as Nicola\u2019s is. \u201cIt was just being young \u2013 two people not really knowing how to have an adult relationship.\u201d Savage worked out the scenes, but the dialogue was improvised. \u201cYou\u2019ll see a scene that could last two minutes but we\u2019ve spent 20 minutes beforehand and after developing it, so it feels like you\u2019ve got a lot of raw emotion. It\u2019s interesting. I like working that way.\u201d McClure has known Fitzpatrick since she was 11, when they both attended Nottingham\u2019s drama group, the Television Workshop, where improvisation was a key part.

This is the point at which interviewers are incredulous that the dazzling and successful McClure doesn\u2019t live in London, but in Nottingham with her fiance, the actor and director Jonny Owen. \u201cOh my God, it\u2019s as if I\u2019m living on the moon,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes me laugh that it\u2019s such a big deal.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/15/can-you-solve-it-cheese-cube-nibbles\">Earlier today</a> I set you the following four puzzles:</p> <p><em>1. You have a cube of cheese that measures 3 x 3 x 3 inches, and you want to slice it into 27 smaller 1 x 1 x 1 inch cubes, as shown below. If you have a straight knife, what\u2019s the minimum number of slices you need to do it? You are allowed to rearrange the pieces after each slice.</em></p> <p><em>Does it make any difference if you have a really, really elastic cheese?</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3a393fc3d6cdd30f66d27fae08f4c5569a4a216\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3a393fc3d6cdd30f66d27fae08f4c5569a4a216/52_61_778_467/500.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Solution</strong></p> <p>With a rigid cheese, the minimum number of slices is 6, which are the slices along the dotted lines in the picture. That\u2019s two through each set of parallel faces. Consider it this way: if you are going to cut the cube into 27 smaller \u2018subcubes\u2019, these subcubes will be the 9 on the bottom horizontal slice, the 9 on the middle horizontal slice and the 9 on the top horizontal slice. The subcube in the centre of the middle slice will require six slices, because it has six faces, and each of these faces will need to be cut from a different slice. (All the other subcubes have once face that is part of an external face of the original cube, so these subcubes require less slices. But the middle one requires six).</p> <p>In the case of a really, really elastic cheese, if it were possible to fold the cube over, so that one slice could cut two faces (These faces would be parallel once the cheese was unfolded), then theoretically you only need three slices: one slice for each set of parallel faces. You would need to fold the cheese over in three different (perpendicular) ways for each of these slices. Messy!</p> <p><em>2. A cube of cheese is divided into 27 identical smaller \u2018subcubes\u2019, as above. A mouse starts at one of the corner subcubes and eats his way through the cheese (without ever passing through the same subcube more than once.) Whatever subcube the mouse is in, it can only move into a subcube that is horizontally or vertically adjacent to it.</em></p> <p><em>Show a path through the cheese that passes through every subcube and ends in the centre subcube, or prove that such a path is impossible.</em></p> <p><strong>Solution</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s impossible. Imagine that the 27 subcubes are coloured as in a 3-d chequerboard, so every white cube is vertically and horizontally adjacent only to black cubes, and vice versa. Let the corner sub cubes all be black. The cube thus contains 14 black sub cubes, and 13 white sub cubes. The centre subcube will be white.</p> <p>If the mouse can only travel horizontally or vertically, the subcubes it travels through must alternate black and white. So if the first cube visited is black, every odd-numbered cube it visits will be black, and every even-numbered cube will be white. It is therefore impossible for the 27th cube to be white, so the (white) centre cube cannot be the final cube visited.</p> <p><em>3. A cheese cube is sitting on a horizontal table. If you slice it in half by making a vertical cut, midway between, and parallel to, two of the sides, the cross section of the cut will be a square.</em></p> <p><em>How do you slice a cube into two equal parts, such that the cross-section of the slice is a hexagon?</em></p> <p><strong>Solution</strong></p> <p>The fact you can get a hexagon out of a cube is a lovely surprise. You cut it like this:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"276efb068d2e2912f85c2f0ca5f864b987c661cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/276efb068d2e2912f85c2f0ca5f864b987c661cb/0_0_1974_958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"485\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Reader Rachel Baker made one out of butter (she had ran out of cheese):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6101a35ea529ee7526c003329944c4e6185a2315\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6101a35ea529ee7526c003329944c4e6185a2315/103_262_1128_677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>4. How do you slice a cube of cheese into six pieces of identical volume with only three cuts?</em></p> <p><strong>Solution</strong></p> <p>The most pleasing symmetrical method is to cut down the diagonals, as Rachel Baker demonstrates here with a cube of parmigiano reggiano. Slice 1 is vertical from the diagonal on the top face to the diagonal on the bottom face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4583b3c8e872108a80528c15de76affd58269cba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4583b3c8e872108a80528c15de76affd58269cba/48_201_763_457/500.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Slices 2 and three are between the diagonals on other pairs of faces. Each of the three diagonals needs to meet at one of the vertices of the cube.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02234f832f1422891aa7442243e76ae6a564dbc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02234f832f1422891aa7442243e76ae6a564dbc5/41_286_901_540/500.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The six pieces are all tetrahedrons \u2013 four-sided objects where each side is a triangle, in this case isoceles triangles. The pieces have identical volume but are not identical, coming in two orientations. Rachel\u2019s impressively neat slicing earns her today\u2019s prize of one of my books. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9a217b1871d878e3b02b20a357fd7a118d1eba7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9a217b1871d878e3b02b20a357fd7a118d1eba7/0_610_1293_776/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Rachel\u2019s is not the only solution.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Hunt\u2019s well-publicised dash to Brussels to save the world from war with Iran will be seen by his more cynical opponents as a last-minute bid to save his Conservative leadership hopes. Before attending an EU foreign ministers\u2019 meeting on Monday, Hunt declared portentously that the prospect of Middle Eastern states acquiring nuclear weapons posed \u201can existential threat to mankind\u201d. That\u2019s scary stuff, certainly deserving of a seasoned statesman\u2019s full attention. Showboating aside, what the foreign secretary\u2019s Brussels mission really demonstrates is that unilateral British efforts to defuse the Iran crisis have failed miserably. In particular, this failure has cruelly exposed the hollowness of Britain\u2019s claims to wield special influence in Washington\u2019s corridors of power.

      "body": "<h2>Beth Ditto, singer</h2> <p>In the early 2000s, everyone I knew was in a band but none of us dreamed of breaking through. I used to record my vocals in the bathroom and I was really bad at writing lyrics. So we had lots of half-written punk songs.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn043ArR98M\">Standing in the Way of Control</a> changed everything. The song was partly sparked by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Marriage_Amendment\">Federal Marriage Amendment</a>, a proposal by the George W Bush administration to outlaw same-sex marriage [subsequently defeated]. At the time, my very best friend \u2013 who was queer like me \u2013 was having a brutally hard time. He lived in Olympia, which was three hours from where I was in Portland. We\u2019d talk on the phone and he\u2019d open up and was very vulnerable. The world felt like it was turning upside down and he was having trouble existing. The amendment was the final straw, so I wrote the song for him to know how much I loved him \u2013 and to tell the administration to fuck off.</p> <p>I\u2019d always been scared of writing lyrics but Standing in the Way of Control came out in a two-minute splurge. I drew on personal experiences, such as growing up in the Bible Belt and being labelled a bitch because I wasn\u2019t going to scripture class, and being called weak because things like sexism, racism and homophobia really affected me. My size was more of an issue then too. I wasn\u2019t bullied at school or anything \u2013 I was outgoing and popular \u2013 but I\u2019d ask myself: \u201cWhy do people think like this?\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn043ArR98M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yn043ArR98M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I guess everyone can relate to the title, the idea of resisting control. It wasn\u2019t just my gay friends who were having dark times. The economy was shit and people were struggling. We were called a gay band, a queer band, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/09/bikini-kill-riot-grrrl-were-back-its-intense\">riot grrrl</a> band, but we were just working-class kids and people connected with our song.</p> <p>So many people have told me, \u201cThat song got me through ninth<sup> </sup>grade\u201d, which makes me very happy. Sadly, the song\u2019s as relevant now as ever, and the friend who I wrote it for is having the same crisis once again.</p> <h2>Nathan \u2018Brace Paine\u2019 Howdeshell, guitar, bass and keyboards</h2> <p>We wrote this song in our drummer, Kathy Mendon\u00e7a\u2019s basement.

      "bodyText": "Beth Ditto, singer In the early 2000s, everyone I knew was in a band but none of us dreamed of breaking through. I used to record my vocals in the bathroom and I was really bad at writing lyrics. So we had lots of half-written punk songs. Standing in the Way of Control changed everything. The song was partly sparked by the Federal Marriage Amendment, a proposal by the George W Bush administration to outlaw same-sex marriage [subsequently defeated]. At the time, my very best friend \u2013 who was queer like me \u2013 was having a brutally hard time. He lived in Olympia, which was three hours from where I was in Portland. We\u2019d talk on the phone and he\u2019d open up and was very vulnerable. The world felt like it was turning upside down and he was having trouble existing. The amendment was the final straw, so I wrote the song for him to know how much I loved him \u2013 and to tell the administration to fuck off. I\u2019d always been scared of writing lyrics but Standing in the Way of Control came out in a two-minute splurge. I drew on personal experiences, such as growing up in the Bible Belt and being labelled a bitch because I wasn\u2019t going to scripture class, and being called weak because things like sexism, racism and homophobia really affected me. My size was more of an issue then too. I wasn\u2019t bullied at school or anything \u2013 I was outgoing and popular \u2013 but I\u2019d ask myself: \u201cWhy do people think like this?\u201d I guess everyone can relate to the title, the idea of resisting control. It wasn\u2019t just my gay friends who were having dark times. The economy was shit and people were struggling. We were called a gay band, a queer band, a riot grrrl band, but we were just working-class kids and people connected with our song. So many people have told me, \u201cThat song got me through ninth grade\u201d, which makes me very happy. Sadly, the song\u2019s as relevant now as ever, and the friend who I wrote it for is having the same crisis once again. Nathan \u2018Brace Paine\u2019 Howdeshell, guitar, bass and keyboards We wrote this song in our drummer, Kathy Mendon\u00e7a\u2019s basement.

      "bodyText": "Van Aert wins a stage on his maiden Tour. The young Belgian went early, about 250m from the line and was able to hang on to win by a couple of centimetres despite a powerful late surge from Elia Viviani, who looked thoroughly disgusted himself as he crossed the line. Van Aert has never competed in a race of longer than seven stages in length before this Tour. He has already spent time in the white jersey for best young rider and now has a stage win to his name. Pinot loses 1min 40sec: Thibaut Pinot, Rigoberto Uran, Richie Porte, Jakob Fuglsang and Alexey Lutsenko roll over the line, having lost 1min 40sec on their GC rivals. The 24 year old Belgian wins the stage. I think Wout van Aert has got up to win it for Team Jumbo-Visma. 500m to go: Sunweb continue their lead out, with one and then another rider peeling off the front. 1km to go: Sunweb have four riders in front of Matthews at the sharp end of the race, with Caleb Ewan and Peter Sagan lurking with intent behind them. 2.7km to go: Deceuninck-Quick Step step up the already relentless pace at the front, hoping to get Elia Viviani to the front in the final 200 metres. The yellow jersey group lead the Pinot group by 1min 08sec. Team Sunweb are also forming an orderly queue, preparing themselves to lead out Michael Matthews. 5km to go: The gap from the yellow jersey group to the Pinot group increases to 1min 04sec. Mikel Landa is a further 30 seconds back. 7km to go: Movistar\u2019s riders drop back to try to limit the damage for Mikel Landa, leaving Nairo Quintana and Ernesto Valverde to fend for themselves in the yellow jersey group, where Team Ineos continue to put the hammer down. There is some confusion about the whereabouts of Caleb Ewan, who is only a slip of a lad and difficult to pick out. 13km to go: The Pinot group is now 46 seconds behind the yellow jersey. At the front of the course, along with Julian Alaphilippe, Team Ineos are shovelling coal into the furnace in an effort to end the challenge of several struggling GC contenders. In terms of potential stage winners, Alexander Kristoff and Matteo Trentin are also well positioned, along with Elia Viviani, Sonny Colbrelli, Peter Sagan and Michael Matthews. 14km to go: Caleb Ewan, Elia Viviani and Peter Sagan are all in the front group and seem the most likely contenders to contest the sprint. Ewan, in particular, could really do with a win. Having already used up their domestiques, the big-hitters in the Pinot/Uran/Porte/Fuglsang group are now 28 seconds behind the leaders. Vincenzo Nibali has been dropped to the third group on the road. They\u2019ve shot their bolt, the gap is widening and the riders in the yellow jersey group are working hard to pile on the hurt. 19km to go: The Pinot group has closed the gap to 13 seconds after a heroic dig at the front by Astana\u2019s Alexey Lutsenko. Now Richie Porte takes over. 2okm to go: Yup, Fuglsang is in the second group, which is currently 29 seconds behind the yellow jersey group and losing more time. Team Jumbo-Visma\u2019s George Bennett is in the third group, which is 1min 38sec behind the yellow jersey. The breakaway has been caught: That was inevitable, but the big news at the moment is that the peloton has split into three parts and several big names have been caught in the second group, which is 25 seconds behind the first. Porte, Pinot and Uran are among them. There is a suggestion, as yet unconfirmed, that Astana\u2019s Jakob Fuglsang may also have been caught out. An email: \u201cBiscuits in the US are kind of like fluffy, less dense scones but without the fruit,\u201d writes Paul Fox. |Bojangles are pretty good but Popeye\u2019s are better, with spicier Cajun chicken.\u201d \u201cThe US South prides itself on fluffy, delicious buttermilk biscuits,\u201d writes Rory Kramer. \u201cIt\u2019s a soft, leavened bread that\u2019s often super buttery yet somehow also light. Biscuits are glorious and Bojangles is a great chain and I say this as someone who has never lived in the south but acknowledges the gloriousness that is fried chicken and biscuits.\u201d 29km to go: Correction: Thibaut Pinot, Giulio Ciccone, Vicenzo Nibali, Richie Porte and Fabio Aru have all missed the split and are on the chase in the second of the three groups the peloton split into a few moments ago. 30km to go: The relentless pace at the front of prompts the peloton to fracture into three different groups. EF Education First rider Rigoberto Uran looks to have been caught out. All the rest of the GC contenders are well placed in the front of the three groups. 35km to go: Several riders are dropped off the back of the peloton as race leader Julian Alaphilippe puts in a big turn on the front of the bunch, alongside Elia Viviani. The gap is in to 56 seconds. The bunch is currently booting along at 46km per hour, compared to the breakaway\u2019s 44.6km per hour. That\u2019s quick. 36km to go: The gap from the six-man breakaway to the bunch is 1min 26sec. By my estimation, between Friday\u2019s stage and today\u2019s stage, I have now done 10 hours worth of consecutive Tour de France live blogging, in which precisely little or nothing of interest has happened for nine hours and 58 minutes. Fight! Fight! Fight! \u201cResponding to John O\u2019G\u2019s anti-Bojangles slander on the Tour live blog,\u201d writes Kyle Taylor. \u201cChicken and biscuits are great, whatever the elitist guy John O\u2019G says. Bojangles biscuits especially are incredible. Definitely one of the better fast food restaurants in the US. \u201cI hate Trump but sports stadium branding has literally nothing to do with where candidates have rallies. This particular coliseum is in Charlotte, North Carolina which is a very important place for campaigns to go.\u201d Chicken and ... biscuits? Somebody is going to have to talk the rest of the class how that works. What kind of biscuits? Of course, here in Blighty, biscuits are what Americans call \u201ccookies\u201d. I\u2019m guessing nobody is going to Bojangles for a feed of roast chicken and chocolate Hob Nobs or Custard Creams. 52km to go: Several teams take the opportunity to have unofficial feed zones in place for the peloton as they make their way up the final climb. I will take this opportunity to have a short, unofficial break of my own before we get to the business end of the stage. The gap is two minutes, I\u2019ll be back in about five. 53km to go: The gap goes back out to 1min 34sec as the breakaway group hit the top of the day\u2019s final climb. For the fourth time today, Natnael Berhane leads the escape party over the top. He\u2019s in fifth place in the King of the Mountains standings. Behind them, the peloton is back together, although Ryan Zabel and Yeann Offredo have been dropped. 56km to go: The riders are heading towards the final classified climb of the day, the category three Cote De La Malric. It\u2019s 492m above sea level, 3.6km long and has a gradient of 4.7%. 58km to go: The peloton splits up as Team Ineos up the pace at the front and the crosswinds buffet the bunch. A group of 30 or so riders - among them, polka dot jersey Tim Wellens - are now 30 seconds behind the yellow jersey group. The gap from our six-man breakaway to the yellow jersey is now a mere 40 seconds. An email: \u201cOn the subject of you looking up Deceuninck,\u201d writes John O\u2019G. \u201cI used to watch Nascar and there was one race that was sponsored by Bojangles. I looked it up expecting it to be some sort of gentlemen\u2019s club but it was, in fact, a fast food shop whose specialty was \u2018chicken and biscuit\u2019. Chicken and biscuit! Needless to say I did not frequent that establishment when I was in the States.\u201d I think Donald Trump staged one of his rallies at a place called the Bojangles Coliseum, which is another reason not to patronise the restaurant of the same name. Intermediate sprint result 1. Odd Christian Eiking: 20pts 2. Anthony Turgis: 1 3. Mads W\u00fcrtz Schmidt: 15 4. Tony Gallopin: 13 5. Michael Sch\u00e4r: 11 6. Natnael Berhane: 10 At 1min 40sec 7. Sonny Colbrelli: 9 8. Peter Sagan: 8 9. Daniel Oss: 7 10. Greg Van Avermaet: 6 11. Marcus Burghardt: 5 pts 12. Michael Matthews: 4 pts 13. Maxime Monfort: 3 pts 14. Jasper Stuyven: 2 pts 15. Matej Mohoric: 1 pt Gareth Thomas responds: \u201cI have not attempted to throw a kettle over a pub while riding at 60 mph down the south side of the St Gotthard pass,\u201d he concedes. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure there are many reasons why this could prove unhelpful behaviour on Swiss roads.\u201d 69km to go: Team Ineos are leading the charge in the peloton, as the teams of various GC contenders move to the front of the peloton, alert to the dangers of crosswinds on the exposed, narrow road they\u2019re travelling along. The gap is 1min 07sec. 72km to go: Yoann Offredo is currenbtly struggling to stay in touch with the peloton. The Wanty-Gobert rider spent much of last week in breakaways, but has been feeling poorly for the past couple of days. Nearby at the back of the bunch, polka-dot jersey Tim Wellens has dropped back to his team car to get some ice to stuff down the back of his shirt. Some correspondence: \u201cIn response to Gareth Thomas clocking 60mph on a steel-framed racing bike with small touring panniers on the fast downhill run south of the St Gotthard pass some years ago,\u201d writes Craig Fawcett. \u201cI\u2019ve got a mate who once threw a kettle over a pub.\u201d \u201cRe: the optimum point, due to drag, when Gareth Thomas cannot go any faster downhill,\u201d writes Nic Clarke, who is a science teacher. \u201cThat would be, as my year 9 class could tell you, your terminal velocity. Well at least half of them. Probably.\u201d A question: \u201cWhat do you think is next for Cav?\u201d asks Lloyd. \u201cDo you think he can come back next year (and motivated as never) or is it the end of an era?\u201d It\u2019s a good question and a difficult one to answer, not least because he was suffering a debilitating virus for much of last year. He\u2019s not getting any younger and there are some speedy young bucks in the ranks that are probably faster than him, but he may well have a couple more Tour stage wins left in his legs. He\u2019d certainly have fancied his chances today, if he hadn\u2019t been controversially dropped by Team Dimension Data the week before the Tour commenced. 86km to go: With six lots of points already snaffled, Sonny Colbrelli is the first man from the peloton to roll over the line, shadowed by Peter Sagan a few metres behind. The gap from the breakaway group to the bunch is now 1min 33sec. 88km to go: Odd Christian Eiking is first over the line at a decidedly uncontested intermediate sprint. Anthony Turgis is second and Mads Wurtz Schmidt is third. Intermediate sprint: The breakaway is approaching La Primaube, the secen of today\u2019s intermediate sprint. While none of the chaps in today\u2019s breakaway are in contention for the green jersey, there are cash prizes up for grabs for the teams of the first three riders over the line. First gets \u20ac1,500, second trousers \u20ac1,000 and third gets \u20ac500. Behind the breakaway, Peter Sagan already has his customary stranglehold on the green jersey and leads Michael Matthews by 60 points. Sagan has 204 points, Matthews has 144 poiunts, Sonny Colbrelli is third on 129, one point ahead of Elia Viviani. 93km to go: The field passes through the small southern city of Rodez, which isn\u2019t too far from Carcassone, Toulouse and Montpelier on the map. An email: \u201cCav\u2019s got Quick Step in his house,\u201d writes Matthew Trim, sending this report veering perilously close to Hello! magazine territory, as we step inside Mark Cavendish\u2019s well appointed Tuscany villa. An email: \u201cMax Richez was clocked at 96.7kph which sounds like a lot,\u201d writes Gareth Thomas. \u201cIt is roughly 60.5mph. I clocked 60mph on a steel-framed racing bike with small touring panniers on the fast downhill run south of the St Gotthard pass some years ago. There is an optimum point, due to drag, when you cannot go any faster. Panniers don\u2019t help either!\u201d 103km to go: The gap continues to hove between two and three minutes and is currently at 2min 37sec. Michael Schar (CCC), Natnael Berhane (Cofidis), Anthony Turgis (Total Direct Energie), Odd Christian Eiking (Wanty-Groupe Gobert), Mads Wurtz Schmidt (Katusha-Alpecin) and Tony Gallopin (AG2R La Mondiale) are the men in front and the intermediate sprint is next on their agenda, although they may pass through the feed zone first, if they haven\u2019t done so already. 107km to go: And Quick Step make laminated flooring. I knew that already. 110km to go: Curiosity finally having got the better of me, I have discovered that Deceuninck, of Deceuninck-Quick Step fame, make sustainable PVC windows and doors. By their own account, their \u201cheritage flush and sculptured sash windows look great in any surrounding, from country cottages to modern townhouses. Their subtle charm and elegance will transform your home. The collection is ideal for period properties and for those who want to add or restore character to their homes with its unique, unrivalled, aesthetics and sympathetic symmetrical design giving a property perfect balance and harmony\u201d. Yep, it\u2019s come to this. A new top speed: I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and guess it was on a downhill, but it has emerged that Deceuninck-Quick Step rider Max Richez has set a new top speed for this year\u2019s Tour, getting clocked at 96.7km per hour earlier in this stage. Crikey. 114km to go: The breakaway continue to pedal along at a fair old lick, 39.9km per hour, to be exact. The peloton continue to keep them on a tight rein, with the gap at 2min 47sec. An email: \u201cAs a teacher I would never have been able to attend even a stage of the TDF,\u201d writes KG. |So when the 1994 route included Dover-Brighton I took my chance. I formed a cycling club, quite a good one as it turned out. Next I contacted a deserving local cycling charity and formed a link. Next I went to the boss with my plan to go from Manchester to Brighton, three days, on a sponsored ride in support of the charity. \u201cGood publicity for the College. Good man, he agreed and we got to work. And it did work. A goodly sum was raised, the local paper featured it, we had a great time and there we were at L\u2019arrive\u00e9 of a stage. Everything into the back up van and home in time for Songs of Praise.The things you have to do!\u201d 119km to go: I wasn\u2019t quick enough to get a screengrab, but the camera just cut to Didi Senft, the trident-waving German super fan who dresses as the devil and is a regular on the roadside at the Tour and Giro. Aged 67, he was standing on a wall, gesticulating furiously as the peloton passed, risking life and limb with a drop of what looked like a couple of 100 metres behind him. 125km to go: The field is making its way up the third of four classified climbs today, the Cote d\u2019Espalion. It\u2019s a mere bump in the road, at just 603m above sea level, 5.2km in length with a gradient of 4.9%. I say a mere bump in the road, but I almost certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to make it to the top. An email: \u201cEnjoying the coverage here in the Auvergne,\u201d writes Andy Taylor. \u201cTwo points though - the site refers to today as a flat stage ... not much, when I went along it last year! Up and down, big vertical relief. Other point is that today isn\u2019t a traditional day off. Ordinary working day here as are all the breaks when Bastille Day falls at the weekend. Holiday season, certainly. No \u2018pont\u2019 between the holiday itself and the weekend.\u201d I was misinformed. 139km to go: The stage may be ostensibly \u201cflat\u201d, but the terrain is very hilly and the weather is hot, around 30 degrees celsius. Michael Schar (CCC), Natnael Berhane (Cofidis), Anthony Turgis (Total Direct Energie), Odd Christian Eiking (Wanty-Groupe Gobert), Mads Wurtz Schmidt (Katusha-Alpecin) and Tony Gallopin (AG2R La Mondiale) continue to pootle along in the breakaway, with a gap of 3min 03sec back to a peloton that is being towed along by Tony Martin. A few wheels back, race leader Julian Alaphilippe is out of his saddle and having a bit of a stretch. I\u2019m about to do much the same thing, while going back to my team care for some sustenance. I\u2019ll be back in five minutes or so. 150km to go: The gap remains just below three minutes on a stage that is very low on excitement. Because today is a national holiday in France, in the wake of Bastille Day yesterday, so the riders have been forced out of their beds to race on what is traditionally a rest day. They\u2019ll have tomorrow off instead, although all of them will probably still do 100 kilometres or so just to keep their legs from seizing up. A lot of the main GC contenders and big name sprinters will also have media duties to attend to. For the journalists covering the race, it\u2019s a low pressure day that brings with it a welcome opportunity to do some much needed laundry! 168km to go: On Eurosport, the commentary team are citing a previous example of when a group of riders in a breakaway, in a similar kind of stage to this, put the word out, via their sporting directors, that if the bunch didn\u2019t allow them a gap of at least 3min 30sec and at least a sporting chance of winning the stage, they would all sit up and allow the peloton to catch them. This prompted panic from the teams of assorted sprinters in the bunch, who were worried about the prospect of having to defend attacks from other, fresher riders, so they acceded to the breakaway\u2019s wishes. What chance the same thing happening today? Not much of one, by the looks of things, but our six-man escape party must be wondering what the point of their mission is beyond getting some publicity for their team sponsors. 169km to go: The gap from the six-man breakaway to the bunch is a shade under three minutes after almost 50 kilometres of \u201cracing\u201d. An email: \u201cFor me the Tour always signals the transition into the summer holidays,\u201d writes Jason Humphreys. \u201cWorking at a university, July means the lectures are over and its exam time. For me that means long days in the office, correcting exams, and tying up as many loose ends as possible to try and make the return to productivity in September a bit smoother. \u201cIt also means more relaxed clothing, longer walks at lunchtime, and the daily companionship of the action from France via podcast, live ticker or a well-placed iPad on the desk \u2013 not to mention a spike in my Amazon activities. I was wondering what it\u2019s like for you? You seem to get the gig every summer. Do you see it as a welcome break from football and the chance to get your teeth into something else, or do you find yourself returning a DHL parcel every other day?\u201d A good question, Jason. I really enjoy doing these liveblogs of the Tour. It is an always welcome palate cleanser that affords me the opportunity to almost completely ignore football transfer speculation, meaningless pre-season friendlies, which seem to get a lot of football fans very exercised indeed but barely interest me at all. Having said that, stages like today\u2019s and last Friday\u2019s, where almost nothing happens at great length, are a bit of a drag. 179km to go: The gap from Natnael Berhane (Cofidis), Anthony Turgis (Total Direct Energie), Odd Christian Eiking (Wanty-Groupe Gobert), Mads Wurtz Schmidt (Katusha-Alpecin) and Tony Gallopin (AG2R La Mondiale) to the bunch is 2min 24sec as the escape party head up the second categorised climb of the day. Nobody\u2019s working too hard in either group. Natnael Berhane is the best placed rider on GC in the breakaway - he\u2019s 90th overall, 57min 13sec behind Julian Alaphilippe. 186km to go: The gap from our six-man breakaway to the bunch is 2min 35sec and Tony Martin is putting in the hard yards at the front of the peloton. As exercises in utter futility go, few can match being in an escape party that is being kept on such a tight rein. Back in the peloton, it\u2019ll be another easy day for the GC contenders, while those unconcerned with the GC will be able to relax safe in the knowledge that we\u2019re almost certain to have a sprint finish. 196km to go: The gap from the six-man breakaway to the bunch is out to 2min 33sec. The riders are tackling the first classified climb of the day, the category 4 Cote De Mallet, which is 2.2km in length with a gradient of 5.2% and is 907m above sea level. Your breakaway: Michael Schar (CCC), Natnael Berhane (Cofidis), Anthony Turgis (Total Direct Energie), Odd Christian Eiking (Wanty-Groupe Gobert), Mads Wurtz Schmidt (Katusha-Alpecin) and Tony Gallopin (AG2R La Mondiale). The gap is 2min 17sec. 206km to go: Sagan and Matthews, first and second in the green jersey standings, return to the bunch. Team CCC rider Michael Schar has bridged the gap to the breakaway, which is now six strong and 1min 48sec clear. 207km to go: The breakaway riders are still being held on a piece of elastic and are not away safely from the bunch yet. Today\u2019s stage has yet to settle. 208km to go: Natnael Berhane (Cofidis), Anthony Turgis (Total Direct Energie), Odd Christian Eiking (Wanty-Groupe Gobert), Mads Wurtz Schmidt (Katusha-Alpecin) and Tony Gallopin (AG2R La Mondiale) have escaped from the peloton and opened a gap of 19 seconds. Michael Matthews and Peter Sagan are trying to bridge the gap. They\u2019re racing on stage 10: Today\u2019s roll-out is complete and a strung out peloton, led by Marcus Burghardt, is chasing down an early attempt at a breakaway. Another withdrawal: Team CCC rider Alessandro De Marchi\u2019s had a nasty crash yesterday and was taken to hospital in an ambulance. A key man in Saturday\u2019s breakaway, the Italian suffered a broken collar bone, fractured ribs and a punctured lung after coming a cropper around 50 kilometres into yesterdays stage. De Marchi is the fifth rider to be forced out of this year\u2019s Tour, leaving a field of 171. Mitchelton Scott\u2019s stage nine diary: The Aussie team won the stage on Bastille Day, courtesy of Daryl Impey. Here\u2019s how they chronicled events for posterity. Stage three review Mitchelton Scott\u2019s South African rider Daryl Impey won his first ever stage of the Tour de France on the back of a breakaway. Jeremy Whittle was in Brioude to see him do it. From William Fotheringham\u2019s stage-by-stage report: Long and hot, a scenic beginning before a 30km descent off the Cantal plateau for the 10th day of racing in a row, with the first rest day 24 hours later than usual. The script of early breakaway, late catch, scary sprint should be followed, but most of the riders will be just making sure they drink enough. All eyes will be on whichever sprinter has hit form early on, as Marcel Kittel did in 2017 and Mark Cavendish did the year before. The hilly route of this year\u2019s first half of the Tour favours a lighter rider such as Elia Viviani.",

However scary it seems, we know deep down that at such fraught moments the unadulterated truth must be spoken out loud \u2013 without it there is no real chance of growing closer.</p> <p>The same goes for the European Union. I absolutely love the EU \u2013 but if we Brits get a chance for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/15/how-would-a-second-brexit-referendum-work\" title=\"\">second referendum</a> in the UK, we will need to argue for remain in different terms than we did last time. We will need to articulate the value of our continuing relationship to the EU in an honest and grownup conversation. We have learned from 2016 that simply cheerleading will not defeat the elaborate lies we know our opponents will concoct, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/14/boris-johnson-brussels-bashing-stories-shaped-politics\" title=\"\">disinformation</a> they have already propagated.</p> <p>And, sure, the EU is far from perfect but it is much more than the present state of its institutional organs. It is above all an ideal of community born out of the ashes of the second world war and cemented by the values at the heart of the hard-fought peace: democracy, partnership, and human rights.</p> <p>But it is precisely because I love the EU that I am intent on being honest with all those who are a part of it. Far too often the institutions that are meant to serve us fail to live up to our ideals. No doubt this is no different in Brussels than in Westminster, Washington DC or Paris.

      "bodyText": "If you have ever had a close, meaningful relationship, you will know just how important honest and open communication is \u2013 all the more so when that relationship is in jeopardy. However scary it seems, we know deep down that at such fraught moments the unadulterated truth must be spoken out loud \u2013 without it there is no real chance of growing closer. The same goes for the European Union. I absolutely love the EU \u2013 but if we Brits get a chance for a second referendum in the UK, we will need to argue for remain in different terms than we did last time. We will need to articulate the value of our continuing relationship to the EU in an honest and grownup conversation. We have learned from 2016 that simply cheerleading will not defeat the elaborate lies we know our opponents will concoct, and the disinformation they have already propagated. And, sure, the EU is far from perfect but it is much more than the present state of its institutional organs. It is above all an ideal of community born out of the ashes of the second world war and cemented by the values at the heart of the hard-fought peace: democracy, partnership, and human rights. But it is precisely because I love the EU that I am intent on being honest with all those who are a part of it. Far too often the institutions that are meant to serve us fail to live up to our ideals. No doubt this is no different in Brussels than in Westminster, Washington DC or Paris.

I\u2019ve seen that in him before. He won\u2019t give his wicket away. He\u2019ll take that responsibility to try and see the job through and close the deal - and by hook or by crook he did. He had that determination all the time, that game management as well as the talent. It doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that he was able to do that. You talk about his lack of concentration in the team meeting or school environment, but the ability to concentrate with that bat in hand is unbelievable and he showed that on many occasions with us. He wanted to be involved in all formats of the game - his batting, his bowling, his fielding. He could throw the ball further than anybody I\u2019d ever seen\u2026He came through and matured in the game at the same time as Twenty20 took off. I thought he could play T20 for England potentially, knowing he could reach the boundary - he\u2019s always been able to hit the ball. The interesting thing to me is that he\u2019s made his mark in Test matches as much as he has in the one-day game. He\u2019s not just a professional cricketer, he\u2019s not just an international cricketer, he\u2019s actually a world-class cricketer. You can\u2019t really spot that!

When you\u2019re playing a final of a World Cup after seven weeks\u2019 hard toil, to decide it by some obscure means that is made for T20 cricket is ridiculous.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d2c65848f08cf92bb7702dd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-15T11:40:24.778Z\">12.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Sky interview Jason Roy. </strong>He can hardly speak.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be part of something like that again.

The judgement error was the timing of when the fielder threw the ball. The act of the overthrow starts when the fielder releases the ball. That\u2019s the act. It becomes an overthrow from the instant of the throw.</p> \n   <p>In this particular case, the umpires have got a lot on their plate, because like every ball, they\u2019ve had to watch the batsmen complete the first run, they\u2019ve had to watch the ball being fielded, to understand how it\u2019s in play, whether the fielder\u2019s done the right thing. Then they\u2019ve got to look to see when the ball is released, in case there is an overthrow. And that happens every delivery of the game. And then they\u2019ve got to back to see where the two batsmen are.</p> \n   <p>They\u2019ve then got to follow on and see what happens after that, whether there is a run out, whether there\u2019s an \u2018obstructing the field\u2019, whether the ball is taken fairly. There\u2019s multitudes of decisions to be taken off the one delivery. What\u2019s unfortunate is that people think that umpiring is just about outs and not outs. They forget we make 1000s of decisions every match.</p> \n   <p>So it\u2019s unfortunate that there was a judgement error on the timing of the release of the ball and where the batsmen were. They did not cross on their second run, at the instant of the throw. So given that scenario, five runs should have been the correct allocation of runs, and Ben Stokes should have been at the non-striker\u2019s end for the next delivery.</p> \n   <p>We\u2019re not perfect. You\u2019ve got the best two umpires in the elite panel doing the final. They\u2019re doing their best like the other two teams are. This is just part of the game.</p> \n   <p>I think it\u2019s unfair to say that the World Cup was decided by that one event. There\u2019s a lot of \u2018what ifs\u2019 and \u2018what should bes\u2019 and \u2018what could bes\u2019 that happen off those 600-plus deliveries.

In a couple of hours they\u2019ll be at Downing Street. In a matter of months, by all accounts, they\u2019ll be at Buckingham Palace to pick up some gongs. In short, it\u2019s a marvellous time to be a cricket fan (unless you\u2019re a Kiwi). Enjoy! A few news bites: Labour\u2019s Tom Watson wants there to be at least one England game on free-to-air television every year. \u201cEngland winning the Cricket World Cup final was an astonishing achievement that had millions of people at the edge of their seats. It was brilliant to see great cricket come out from behind the paywall and for the final to be shown on free-to-air TV,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want as many people as possible to be able to share in the best of our sporting moments. That\u2019s why Labour would review the list of crown jewel sporting events that are broadcast free-to-air.\u201d Rugby union ace Brad Shields says the cricketers have inspired England\u2019s ball-throwing types: \u201cThe emotion in the room when England won really showed, it was crazy. It brought us down to earth, making some of us realise \u2018now this is real, we can be those people on TV\u2019. I\u2019m glad I was with the team to watch it. To know we\u2019re capable of that and to have that opportunity is pretty cool. We know that we could be the next team to win the World Cup for England and that\u2019s our goal.\u201d A postbox near Lord\u2019s has been painted white. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it published in a few different places that England is the first country to win the men\u2019s World Cup for football, rugby and cricket,\u201d notes Phil Russell. \u201cDo you think it is a coincidence that they had to go to extra time on each occasion to do it? Being an England supporter is something else when it comes to emotional roller-coasters!\u201d \u201cI spent yesterday watching both the cricket and tennis finals on adjacent screens in a Teddington pub,\u201d writes Michael Mand. \u201cJust as both went to \u2018extra time\u2019, the bar staff decided that both had ended in draws and turned off the TVs, so that a lame Bob Dylan impersonator could take the stage.\u201d That\u2019s an abomination. I\u2019d have been beyond furious. I\u2019d have been knockin\u2019 on the landlord\u2019s door, that\u2019s for sure. Here\u2019s a great photo from the Oval celebrations: Here\u2019s Richard Williams on yesterday\u2019s Super Sporting Sunday: Several readers experienced precisely the same commentary outage described by Justin Horton below. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it completely spoiled the whole thing, but it certainly took the wind out of the sails at exactly the wrong moment and you would have heard loud swearing coming from my flat if you\u2019d been walking past,\u201d writes Richard Harman, from Bressanone, Italy. Lots of you are sending in your World Cup final stories, and if you\u2019ve got some more World Cup feelings to get off your chest, this might be the place for it: Here\u2019s Tim de Lisle, who did some fine work on the OBO yesterday. I suspect that there are a lot of similar words stored for posterity on a lot of journalists\u2019 laptops. A report from this morning\u2019s Kennington-based celebrations: \u201cI work around the corner from the Oval and popped down earlier to hang with the champs,\u201d writes Lewis Freeth. \u201cPaparazzi were heckled for obstructing our view like a swarm of clicky locusts. That aside, it\u2019s a lovely old lump of gold.\u201d I don\u2019t like plugging obvious PR exercises, but NatWest have programmed a bowling simulator to precisely replicate Trent Boult\u2019s super over, and anyone who turns up to Kings Cross today (it ends at 6pm) can have a go facing it, which sounds like fun (annoyingly lengthy queue depending). Meanwhile Justin Horton is in Huesca. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a great finish for everybody. I live abroad and had listened to the radio commentary via cricketworldcup.com right from the opening over. But with about five overs to go, at what I should think was half past six your time, it suddenly cut out, to be replaced by a message saying something like \u2018This programme is no longer available. This is either because of rights restrictions or a technical error. Please try again later.\u2019 \u201cTry as I might, I couldn\u2019t get it back, and though all kinds of ball-by-ball services were available (eventually I went and sat in the shed, and followed the Super Over online) it\u2019s very much not the same, especially when you\u2019ve followed the whole game. I don\u2019t know who or what was responsible, or if anybody else had the same experience, but it spoiled the match, the day and the memory completely.\u201d Any fellow sufferers out there? Hi everyone, Simon here again. I return with an email from Tony Chronnell: \u201cMy Dad and I were at England\u2019s first final in 1979 when Viv Richards and Collis King smashed us all around the ground. These days I\u2019m living in Hamburg and I watched the end of the game with my German wife (who doesn\u2019t understand cricket at the best of times and certainly couldn\u2019t understand my gibbering attempts to explain the last few overs). Today I\u2019m sitting here in the office amongst German, Finnish, Chinese and Italian colleagues, none of whom follow cricket or know that England won the World Cup, or can share the agonies and ecstasy of last night. It\u2019s fair to say that the Company IT system is currently experiencing an unusual spike in the number of cricket pages and videos viewed, but luckily no one has yet caught me crying at my desk! And my 84 year old Dad when I texted him last night to share my joy and thank him for introducing me to cricket all those years ago? A single message saying, \u2018Not a fair result\u2019!\u201d Jimsey on the Australian reaction to losing as compared to their old friends in New Zealand. \u201cIn response to Anthony Pease\u2019s lovely email, I\u2019d wager here in Australia we couldn\u2019t possibly react with the same level of grace, sportsmanship and humility that the Black Caps have if we\u2019d lost a final in that manner. Unfortunately it\u2019s not in the DNA of the national cricket team, and that is the biggest lesson we need to learn since Sandpaper-gate. Ah well, there\u2019s always the Ashes.\u201d David Horovitz emails from Jerusalem, where he\u201dwatched the mind-boggling drama unfold through Sunday afternoon and evening via a succession of unreliable live-streaming websites that went into beyond-infuriating buffering mode at several pivotal moments \u2014 though not, crucially, in the final minutes.\u201d Horovitz wrote this in a Times of Israel piece last night, in the immediate aftermath of all that glorious insanity: \u201cWhat was most striking was the composition of this England team... This group of players, of different places of origin, skin color and religion, having come close to exiting the tournament in its earlier rounds, pulled and pushed each other forward to victory. It was a success that ultimately came down to team spirit, to togetherness... It exemplified a whole so much greater than the sum of its disparate parts... What a joy to behold.\u201d Memories of 2015. Here\u2019s how we covered the final four years ago, which was not quite so exciting. For reference, the writer was Australian. They might be more excited once they come out of their current wilderness period. That might be the Ashes, of course. Announcing the result: \u201cSmith pulls to leg for four and it\u2019s all over. Australia win by seven wickets. The final was a bit of a letdown really, but there\u2019s no question that the best team in the tournament have won it.\u201d Final post: \u201cSo that\u2019s that. A decent tournament comes to an end \u2013 it\u2019s not been a classic but it\u2019s not been too bad.\u201d Alex Hughes was watching the game in a most exotic location, but then had to reach for the bank of Mum and Dad. \u201cI watched the game yesterday on my laptop in a hostel in Merida, Mexico. Unfortunately, my (totally legitimate cough cough) stream went down just before the start of the 49th over. After the excruciating experience of following the 49th over by refreshing the OBO, I decided to call my parents back in the UK and my Dad provided commentary for me on the super overs via a WhatsApp call. While this was not quite the same standard of commentary as TMS it had its own unique charm. It was difficult to hear what dad was saying because he was being drowned out by the sound of Mum just screaming something inaudible about Jofra Archer over and over again in background during the second super over. By the end mum was so frazzled she was muttering something about Australians (not sure why) and on the last ball Dad finally also lost his composure and just screamed \u2018run out, run out, run out, run out\u2019 so I just about got the message that England had won.\u201d Anthony Pease emails in: \u201cAfternoon, John Is it just me, or are the Kiwis taking this result with significantly more grace and humour than their cross-Tasman cousins?\u201d I couldn\u2019t possibly comment. Cockermouth School PE teacher Chris Hayes, Ben Stokes\u2019 cricket coach for four years, has been talking to the Press Association about his star pupil: I was absolutely convinced he would not be out. I\u2019ve seen that in him before. He won\u2019t give his wicket away. He\u2019ll take that responsibility to try and see the job through and close the deal - and by hook or by crook he did. He had that determination all the time, that game management as well as the talent. It doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that he was able to do that. You talk about his lack of concentration in the team meeting or school environment, but the ability to concentrate with that bat in hand is unbelievable and he showed that on many occasions with us. He wanted to be involved in all formats of the game - his batting, his bowling, his fielding. He could throw the ball further than anybody I\u2019d ever seen\u2026He came through and matured in the game at the same time as Twenty20 took off. I thought he could play T20 for England potentially, knowing he could reach the boundary - he\u2019s always been able to hit the ball. The interesting thing to me is that he\u2019s made his mark in Test matches as much as he has in the one-day game. He\u2019s not just a professional cricketer, he\u2019s not just an international cricketer, he\u2019s actually a world-class cricketer. You can\u2019t really spot that! You think this lad is good and he\u2019ll make a cricketer, but to go on and be a world-class cricketer... he\u2019s been unbelievable. New Zealand captain Kane Williamson has been Instagramming: Simon Jenkins thinks the final should have ended in a tie. Cricket had gone the way of football\u2019s penalty shootouts. Publicity corner from an Aussie bookmaker? From the New Zealand Herald. Australian bookmaker Sportsbet has refunded those who put money on the Black Caps to win the Cricket World Cup final against England...The company said it had refunded 11,458 people a total sum of $426,223 after the host nation won the final on a controversial boundary countback rule following tied scores after 102 overs of cricket. \u201cPunters who backed New Zealand in both the head to head and the outright tournament market will be refunded their stakes in bonus bets. Let\u2019s not beat around the bush, for a World Cup to be decided in that manner is an absolute disgrace, and the punters shouldn\u2019t have to pay for the ineptness of the ICC,\u201d said a spokesman. Vic Marks considers whether cricket can recapture the audiences of yore. Jim Waterson has the news on the viewing figures. For reference, 15m watched the Rugby World Cup final in 2003, and in 1966 it was 32.3m viewers. It was 7.4m for the Ashes in 2005. Afternoon. No scenes like this as yet. or this from 2003, for that matter. Or this from 1966. I\u2019m going to take a quick(ish) break. John Brewin will keep you up do date in the meantime - send your emails to him here, if you would. Bye for now! \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of people asking who wrote the script for England\u2019s 50th over, in particular the six runs from the overthrow,\u201d writes Chris Laycock. \u201cDoes no one else remember the episode of Neighbours where Karl needed a six off the last ball to win? He hit it for two, but then got four overthrows to win the match. Just me then?\u201d This is actually a thing. As neighboursepisodes.com describes it: Drew is batting and now they need 6 to win off two balls. Unfortunately, the ball goes in the air and Drew is caught out. Now it\u2019s up to Karl to make six off the last ball. Joe raises his eyes to heaven and prays. Gordon Collins torments Lou and says he doesn\u2019t fancy Karl\u2019s chances.Karl steps up to the crease and Joe advises him - \u201cNever Give In\u201d The ball comes and Karl hits it, but it isn\u2019t hit for six. However, a series of fielding errors ensues - they run two and then the ball goes over the boundary and gives them and extra four. Our Heroes start shouting excitedly that they\u2019ve won, Joe kisses Karl and Lou tells Gordon Collins that he\u2019ll take cash or cheque! \u201cI was just at the Oval and can confirm that Liam Plunkett looked mullered,\u201d reports Daniel King. Mike Hesson, New Zealand\u2019s head coach from 2012 to 2018, has written for the Sydney Morning Herald about the World Cup final. Here\u2019s how he starts: Kane Williamson and Eoin Morgan should have jointly lifted the Cricket World Cup. Certainly neither England nor New Zealand deserved to lose. Using a Super Over to decide it was farcical and the International Cricket Council needs to give itself an uppercut for even entertaining it as a tiebreaker. To just copy and paste the playing conditions from Twenty20 and use the highest number of boundaries to determine who wins in the event of a tied Super Over is not at all necessary. This is a 50-over World Cup. I didn\u2019t agree with the concept of the Super Over in the first place. The whole idea of a Super Over is in a situation when you need a side to progress, like in a semi-final. That\u2019s when the necessity of finding a winner makes sense. When you\u2019re playing a final of a World Cup after seven weeks\u2019 hard toil, to decide it by some obscure means that is made for T20 cricket is ridiculous. Sky interview Jason Roy. He can hardly speak. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be part of something like that again. The yo-yo of emotions throughout the whole day was scary. I couldn\u2019t watch. I spent 10 overs in the showers just holding my head. I didn\u2019t know what was going on. He says that after delivering the ball to Jos Buttler for the decisive run-out \u201cI tried to run off, but realised by legs don\u2019t work. My legs were wobbling. I lay on the floor for a couple of minutes.\u201d He also says he will \u201chopefully\u201d be part of England\u2019s Ashes team. I\u2019ve been surprised by how decent all the England players look at the Oval, compared with the Pietersen- and Flintoff-led madness in 2005. However, apparently there are some rough faces about: This gallery of Tom Jenkins\u2019 best photographs from Lord\u2019s is thoroughly excellent: The Times is reporting that every member of England\u2019s World Cup squad will be honoured for their achievement, saying \u201cWhitehall sources\u201d have told them that MBEs and OBEs will be handed out in the New Year Honours list. \u201cAt 86-4, I decided to cut my losses and accompany my wife to the 14 July celebrations at the French embassy in Amman rather than endure the pain of watching the capitulation at home alone, but took my earphones along just in case,\u201d writes Charlie Dunmore. \u201cAt 150-4 I tuned into to TMS, and spent the next two hours staring blankly ahead while people quaffed their wine and chatted around me. My primal scream when Butler broke the stumps to win the game drew plenty of strange looks, but not half as many as when I sheepishly explained that England had just become World Champions. \u2018Champions de quoi..?\u2019\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think anything will faze me again,\u201d says Jos Buttler: I can\u2019t believe what has happened, but it\u2019s nice to wake up and know it did. I don\u2019t think anything will faze me again. I don\u2019t think think I\u2019ll ever care about anything ever again. I don\u2019t really care what happens now in my career.\u201d We were laughing about the fact that four years of work came down to one ball. Four years and then then it\u2019s one ball ... can we get a run-out? It justifies everything we have done for four years to get to this point. It\u2019s an incredible journey. At the end I remember that 10 seconds of just running around, the atmosphere is something that will live with me forever. It\u2019s alright when you\u2019re in the middle because it\u2019s what you know - catch a ball, smash the stumps - but the consequences are obviously quite a lot larger! The England players are gamely submitting to interviews on the field at the Oval. Here\u2019s Mark Wood: It hasn\u2019t quite sunk in until this morning. Everyone\u2019s on their phones, talking about last night. Last night was pure ecstasy. Everyone was on top of the world. It\u2019s pretty surreal to be honest. A pretty special moment. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever see anything like that again. Especially in a World Cup final. Almost beyond belief. This just in from our deputy political editor, Rowena Mason: Theresa May - a devoted cricket fan - has invited the England men\u2019s cricket team to Downing Street for a reception this evening to celebrate their victory. Ahead of the event, she said: \u201cYesterday was a brilliant performance by a brilliant team. They showed flair courage and an absolute determination to become world champions. The achievement delivered in such a thrilling style on home soil will live forever in our sporting history. It is also exciting to think how many children will be inspired by this victory to pick up a bat for the first time and hopefully become the great cricketers of tomorrow.\u201d Theresa May was at Lord\u2019s yesterday (and at Wimbledon on Saturday; she had quite the sporting weekend): \u201cA couple of contributions haven\u2019t yet received the focus they perhaps deserve,\u201d writes John Withington. \u201cFirstly, Jofra Archer faced with seven needed off four balls? A remarkable comeback after the first three balls including the wide. And how about Jason Roy who\u2019s not had a good tournament in the field? The ball followed him all over the park in that final over, fielding three of the six legal deliveries. The first he fumbled terribly to concede an extra run. The second he chose the wrong end to throw to. He knew that he\u2019d probably lost the World Cup when England could have had two run-outs to win the game. And then the final ball. He was probably a little too deep on the boundary, wasn\u2019t the fastest off the line, but gathered cleanly and fired in the perfect throw. Massive bottle under huge pressure.\u201d Here\u2019s our news story on the suggestion that England were erroneously awarded an extra run: Stephen van Rooyen, Sky\u2019s UK and Ireland chief executive, has released a statement about the viewing figures: We\u2019ve been proud host broadcasters of a home cricket World Cup, dedicating a channel and showing every single minute, which has been absorbing from the first ball to the unforgettable final delivery. Sunday saw a peak across Sky and Channel 4 of 8.3 million \u2013 a huge audience for a huge moment for British sport. On Sky\u2019s channels our peak was 3.5m alone, a fitting way to cap a terrific tournament. We are proud of our long term cricket partnership, which has grown over three decades, delivering record investment into the sport. This partnership will continue with our coverage of the Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s Ashes this Summer, and by working with the ECB to deliver a new grassroots cricket participation campaign New Zealand\u2019s players have also been up and out this morning: As a remarkably fresh-faced group of players sign infinite autographs on the Oval turf, Ashley Giles is quizzed by Sky: Amazing day yesterday. The boys all thoroughly enjoyed their night I think as well. I think some of them have slept. We just don\u2019t have days like we had yesterday. To be world champions, after all the work that\u2019s gone in over the last four years, and the emotions yesterday, I think we\u2019re all exhausted. The whole day was hard but the last half an hour was just dreadful. I thought we\u2019d won it, then I thought we\u2019d lost it, then I thought we\u2019d lost it by even more, and then to go to the super over ... I understand there were three or four people in the crowd who passed out. For now, they have arrived at the Oval, and are fighting their way through a throng of schoolkids. The England team will attend a reception with the Prime Minister at Downing Street at 7pm this evening. A visual reminder of England\u2019s last post-victory visit: More cricket/Tanya Aldred action: today\u2019s County Championship liveblog is happening here: This from Yevaru BTL on England\u2019s controversial overthrow six: \u201cOn TMS, Michael Vaughan said he was sat near Jos Buttler when that overthrow happened. Buttler\u2019s reaction shows he\u2019s as cool off the pitch as he is on it: \u2018That\u2019s the first one Ben has middled all day.\u2019\u201d Here\u2019s Tanya Aldred\u2019s take on yesterday\u2019s drama: I suspect there are lots of stories like this one, from Ben Lingard. \u201cI have never gone through such emotion watching sport,\u201d he writes. \u201cI started the day sat on the sofa at my parents house with my dad, not long after the loss of [England\u2019s] third wicket I had to leave to catch a train home. I get on the train , boot up the Sky Go app, Buttler and Stokes at the crease. I am hitting every ball with them, screaming at every boundary and wincing at every near miss and my heart stopping every time . A fellow fan across the carriage spots me and takes out his headphones as we both see Buttler slice in the hands of the NZ sub fielder. \u201cIt\u2019s over,\u2019 he says. \u201cNext a train change at Lancaster. I run phone in hand to make the Virgin train, I dart into the nearest door and commence viewing, there is a man there receiving updates over the phone from his wife. I invite him to watch with me on my phone, a few minutes later there are 5 of us huddled around my phone, cheering, jeering, hoping our hearts don\u2019t pack up! What a rollercoaster, myself and four complete strangers in absolute delirium as Buttler takes the bails off to break New Zealand hearts!\u201d The gates are open at the Oval and the England team and their new trophy are about 15 minutes away. There are 1,000 local schoolchildren there, but grown-ups are allowed too. In New Zealand, there are some complaints that the title was eventually decided on a fairly arbitrary metric (the number of boundaries hit in the final), rather than on wickets taken, or dot balls bowled, or just letting the teams share the trophy. This is what the former New Zealand all-rounder Dion Nash told stuff.co.nz: It\u2019s ridiculous... really absurd. It\u2019s about as random as tossing a coin. But you also have to look at it from the [view of the] people setting the rules. I mean who thinks it\u2019s going to be a draw, and then you draw in the Super Over? What are the chances? You can\u2019t complain, it was done at the start of the tournament. [But] I think that\u2019s probably indicative of where the game\u2019s mindset\u2019s at. Why not credit the guys who took the most wickets? The real measure that was used for generations was least amount of wickets lost. So why have we changed that? Meanwhile the former Kiwi wicket-keeper Peter McGlashan said this: I think it\u2019s a shame, that we\u2019ve played a tournament which has gone for 48 games, and yet it\u2019s decided by someone getting out a piece of paper and a pen and picking apart the bones, New Zealand\u2019s strength throughout this tournament has been about rotating the strike, our strength hasn\u2019t been boundaries, so it seems a bit of a shame to be judged by that all of a sudden. A Super Over works for T20s, but I think 50-over cricket needs to have something that reflects the amount of work and energy that\u2019s gone into the game. The Super Over just seems the wrong way to decide it. It\u2019s a little bit like deciding a marathon with a 100-metre sprint at the end of it - it\u2019s not the appropriate way to judge the performance of the athletes on show. Another choice clip from yesterday, as Moeen and Rashid make a last-minute dash from the imminent Champagne deluge. Overnight viewing figures suggest that a peak of 4.5 million people watched on Channel 4, with an average of 2.4 million. Sky also showed it on three channels, which had a combined average viewership of 1,474,000 people, and a peak of a shade under three million. In the Sunday sporting spectacular it was well beaten by the tennis (peak 9.6 million, average 6 million), but thrashed the GP (peak 2.5 million, average 1.8 million). This bit wasn\u2019t in the highlights packages, for some reason: Here\u2019s a report on celebrations on the streets of England (my favourite bit of this photo, by the way, is the random shoe flying through the top-left corner): And here\u2019s a report on the rather different reaction on the streets of New Zealand: The cricket is of course on all British front pages today. Here\u2019s the Guardian: Though I do think the Times\u2019 wraparound front wins today\u2019s front-page title by a knockout: \u201cYou\u2019ve hit the nail on the head there, I think,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cWhat made yesterday\u2019s events at Lord\u2019s so memorable was not just the incredible skill allied to heart-stopping drama, but the sheer likeability of both sets of players, and the honouring of crickets greatest traditions. I for one will forever associate England\u2019s eventual triumph, after a remarkable four year journey, with the unbelievable class and dignity shown by the New Zealand players. *Cliche alert* (but it needs saying, because it\u2019s true) - cricket really was the winner.\u201d Some advice from New Zealand\u2019s Jimmy Neesham: One of the big talking-points remains the six runs awarded to England when the ball deflected off Ben Stokes\u2019 bat and to the boundary, turning two runs for England into six. Here\u2019s a visual reminder: Here\u2019s the relevant law: 19.8 Overthrow or wilful act of fielder If the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder, the runs scored shall be any runs for penalties awarded to either side and the allowance for the boundary and the runs completed by the batsmen, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of the throw or act. The issue being that the batsmen had not crossed for the second run when Martin Guptill released the ball. Thus England should have been awarded five runs, rather than six. The former umpire Simon Taufel has been speaking to the Australian media about this, and here\u2019s what he told the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age: There was a judgement error on the overthrow. The judgement error was the timing of when the fielder threw the ball. The act of the overthrow starts when the fielder releases the ball. That\u2019s the act. It becomes an overthrow from the instant of the throw. In this particular case, the umpires have got a lot on their plate, because like every ball, they\u2019ve had to watch the batsmen complete the first run, they\u2019ve had to watch the ball being fielded, to understand how it\u2019s in play, whether the fielder\u2019s done the right thing. Then they\u2019ve got to look to see when the ball is released, in case there is an overthrow. And that happens every delivery of the game. And then they\u2019ve got to back to see where the two batsmen are. They\u2019ve then got to follow on and see what happens after that, whether there is a run out, whether there\u2019s an \u2018obstructing the field\u2019, whether the ball is taken fairly. There\u2019s multitudes of decisions to be taken off the one delivery. What\u2019s unfortunate is that people think that umpiring is just about outs and not outs. They forget we make 1000s of decisions every match. So it\u2019s unfortunate that there was a judgement error on the timing of the release of the ball and where the batsmen were. They did not cross on their second run, at the instant of the throw. So given that scenario, five runs should have been the correct allocation of runs, and Ben Stokes should have been at the non-striker\u2019s end for the next delivery. We\u2019re not perfect. You\u2019ve got the best two umpires in the elite panel doing the final. They\u2019re doing their best like the other two teams are. This is just part of the game. I think it\u2019s unfair to say that the World Cup was decided by that one event. There\u2019s a lot of \u2018what ifs\u2019 and \u2018what should bes\u2019 and \u2018what could bes\u2019 that happen off those 600-plus deliveries. That\u2019s the nature of sport. Let\u2019s just start with this moment. It\u2019s 220-7, England need 22 from nine balls, and Trent Boult catches Ben Stokes just inside the rope, before tossing the ball to Martin Guptill. If he treads on the boundary rope before throwing the ball, it\u2019s six. If he doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s out, and New Zealand effectively win the World Cup. Just think of all the sportspeople in all the sports who would and indeed do do absolutely anything to give their sides victory: punch the ball off the line in the dying moments of World Cup quarter-final; arrange state-sponsored doping factories; sneak sandpaper onto the field in their underpants. And then consider what Guptill\u2019s instinct was at this moment: to instantly award England the six. Sure, the TV umpire would have done it anyway, but I thought that moment of honesty summed up the Kiwis\u2019 class. So far this morning I\u2019ve watched the Channel 4 highlights, and then Sky\u2019s highlights. For what it\u2019s worth, Sky\u2019s were much better. Anyway, I can confirm that it actually happened, and the entire business was absolutely ludicrous in the most fantastic way: drama, skill, luck, mistakes from players and umpires, emotion, more drama, the use of rules that few would have expected anyone would even read let alone put into action, and also the most phenomenal sportsmanship, astonishingly impressive in the circumstances. Let\u2019s see what the world has to say about it, shall we?",

The upwardly mobile journalist had promised Black he would abandon hopes of a political career to preside over the political weekly, but was almost immediately seeking to contest a parliamentary seat.</p> \n<p>By the time the Blacks threw open their 11-bedroom Kensington house to guests in 2001, Johnson was not just a magazine editor, but also the Conservative candidate for Henley \u2013 and his reputation for getting away with it was well and truly established.</p> \n<p>A high point of the party was a performance by Kit and the Widow, a satirical double act. One of the guests made a note of the chorus: \u201cThat effrontery so sordid/should be cherished and rewarded/Is a fact to be applauded/As public life goes on/Let honour be accorded/That he\u2019s pulled off such a con/Let it be lauded, the BoJo phenomenon.\u201d</p> \n<p>Black even declared: \u201cIf Boris wants to run for No 10, the Telegraph is behind him.\u201d But nobody took him seriously.

      "bodyText": "When Conrad Black, then owner of the Spectator and Daily Telegraph, and his wife, Barbara, decided to throw a party in Boris Johnson\u2019s honour, the magazine\u2019s editor and aspiring politician had already let his proprietor down. The upwardly mobile journalist had promised Black he would abandon hopes of a political career to preside over the political weekly, but was almost immediately seeking to contest a parliamentary seat. By the time the Blacks threw open their 11-bedroom Kensington house to guests in 2001, Johnson was not just a magazine editor, but also the Conservative candidate for Henley \u2013 and his reputation for getting away with it was well and truly established. A high point of the party was a performance by Kit and the Widow, a satirical double act. One of the guests made a note of the chorus: \u201cThat effrontery so sordid/should be cherished and rewarded/Is a fact to be applauded/As public life goes on/Let honour be accorded/That he\u2019s pulled off such a con/Let it be lauded, the BoJo phenomenon.\u201d Black even declared: \u201cIf Boris wants to run for No 10, the Telegraph is behind him.\u201d But nobody took him seriously. As the guest ruefully observed: \u201cEverybody puddled themselves with guffawing laughter of disbelief at the very thought.\u201d Johnson\u2019s tenure as editor of the Spectator from 1999 to 2005 partly overlapped with his seven years as the Conservative MP for Henley. He also wrote a column for the Telegraph, motoring columns for GQ and several books, and was briefly \u2013 and disastrously \u2013 on the Tory frontbench as shadow arts minister. His period at the helm of the Spectator was so colourful the conservative weekly became known as the Sextator \u2013 its publisher, a star columnist and the editor were all embroiled in separate affairs \u2013 and he only just kept his political career on track. Johnson had narrowly avoided being fired by the then Conservative leader, Michael Howard, in October 2004, after an unsigned leading article in the magazine (in fact written not by the editor but by Simon Heffer) accused Liverpool of indulging in \u201cvictim status\u201d in the aftermath of the murder in Iraq of Kenneth Bigley, who came from the city. In the end, after being sent to Merseyside to apologise in person, Johnson hung on \u2013 but only a month later, he was toast. It transpired Johnson had been engaged in an on-off affair with Petronella Wyatt, a columnist with the magazine. He had been married to Marina Wheeler since 1993, and his four children were all of primary school age at the time. But Wyatt had become pregnant and chose to have an abortion in a private hospital \u2013 two days before Johnson\u2019s trip to Liverpool \u2013 a decision Johnson backed, although he initially declined to help pay the \u00a31,500 bill. When confronted about the affair by the Mail on Sunday, he lied, saying: \u201cI have not had an affair with Petronella. It is complete balderdash. It is an inverted pyramid of piffle.\u201d It was, however, later confirmed by Wyatt\u2019s mother. As Sunday newspapers prepared to run the story, Johnson told one journalist to \u201cpublish and be damned\u201d. Two hours later, he was fired from the shadow cabinet. He had lied about the affair, and his political career imploded. Andrew Gimson, the Spectator\u2019s then foreign editor, was also Johnson\u2019s first biographer.

Amin was expelled by the forum in June after criticising the party leadership\u2019s response to reports of Islamophobia and comparing Johnson\u2019s popularity to that of Adolf Hitler in the 1930s. In the book, published after the airing of a TV series with the same name, Johnson likened the Roman empire to the EU, marvelling at the former\u2019s ability to create unity across continents. The essay was written as negotiations for Turkey to join the EU were under way and Johnson argued Ankara should be allowed to become a member, creating \u201conce again a Roman economic community\u201d and \u201creuniting the two halves of the Roman empire around the shores of the Mediterranean\u201d. He said the country\u2019s \u201cfar from perfect\u201d record on human rights was \u201cone of the most important reasons for keeping the Turks on the tram tracks to EU membership, surely, that we thereby help the progressive forces in Turkey and stop the country drifting backwards\u201d.

The victim succumbed to his injuries on the scene,\u201d a Virginia Beach Police Department spokesman said in a statement. \u201cThe driver of the vehicle remained on scene with police.\u201d Whitaker was elected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2006, and was a champion in four weight classes: lightweight, junior welterweight, welterweight and junior middleweight. The American was known as a brilliant defensive boxer with many opponents struggling to lay a hand on him. He retired in 2001 after three defeats in his final four fights with but he was in his prime in the 80s and 90s. He also won a gold medal as a lightweight at the 1984 Olympics.

There\u2019s still work to be done but the races have generally been relatively strong.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mercedes have won all but one race this season and completed a remarkable seven one-two finishes. Their car has a comfortable edge over the rest of the field and Hamilton was relishing its performance.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy trust in the car is incredibly high,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what the car is able to do and so I guess the experience of last year has made me a bit more confident to push it more and, being that it is so close, I need to try and eke a bit more out of the car.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the buildup to the race Hamilton had bemoaned the clash with Wimbledon and the Cricket World Cup final but on the ground at least the British GP boasted the most spectators with a sell-out crowd of 141,000. It was announced last week that the British GP has renewed its contract to host Formula One for a further five years and the dates of the race will be under consideration. Those watching at Silverstone on Sunday were treated to a thrilling encounter with close racing, overtaking and wheel-to-wheel contests across the field.</p> \n<p>Despite the intensity of some of the racing, particularly between Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc and Verstappen, the stewards deemed it all to be hard but fair and imposed only one penalty, on Vettel for his misjudgment which he admitted had been a mistake.</p> \n<p>The drivers welcomed this approach by the stewards. Hamilton, too, approved of them, allowing a hands-off approach as long as the racing was clean. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone wants, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cGood for them, I\u2019m glad it was a great day for the sport.\u201d</p> \n<p>With Mercedes enjoying a strong advantage and Ferrari no closer to matching them, the Scuderia\u2019s task looks increasingly to be battling a resurgent Red Bull. Verstappen is now a solid third in the championship, 13 points in front of Vettel. At Silverstone their race pace was impressive and Pierre Gasly, who has had a lacklustre season thus far, returned his equal best F1 finish with fourth and pulled a great move to pass Vettel during the race.</p> \n<p>Hamilton knows he is now in a two-way title fight but bemoaned the lack of a greater challenge at the front. \u201cI love the racing, I do love the racing element, I loved competing against Ferrari last year. I wish the battle today was with the Ferraris. It\u2019s different when you\u2019re racing within a team and I much, much prefer it when you\u2019re racing with the Red Bull and Ferrari but currently that\u2019s not how it is.\u201d</p>",

Hamilton has won four of the past five championships and believes each one has brought him on as a driver but he insisted he would not stop looking to improve further . \u201cEvery year you get a bit more comfortable within yourself and within the methods you use and the processes you go through,\u201d he said. \u201cBut qualifying\u2019s not been spectacular this year, still not perfect. There\u2019s still work to be done but the races have generally been relatively strong.\u201d Mercedes have won all but one race this season and completed a remarkable seven one-two finishes. Their car has a comfortable edge over the rest of the field and Hamilton was relishing its performance. \u201cMy trust in the car is incredibly high,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what the car is able to do and so I guess the experience of last year has made me a bit more confident to push it more and, being that it is so close, I need to try and eke a bit more out of the car.\u201d In the buildup to the race Hamilton had bemoaned the clash with Wimbledon and the Cricket World Cup final but on the ground at least the British GP boasted the most spectators with a sell-out crowd of 141,000. It was announced last week that the British GP has renewed its contract to host Formula One for a further five years and the dates of the race will be under consideration. Those watching at Silverstone on Sunday were treated to a thrilling encounter with close racing, overtaking and wheel-to-wheel contests across the field. Despite the intensity of some of the racing, particularly between Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc and Verstappen, the stewards deemed it all to be hard but fair and imposed only one penalty, on Vettel for his misjudgment which he admitted had been a mistake. The drivers welcomed this approach by the stewards. Hamilton, too, approved of them, allowing a hands-off approach as long as the racing was clean. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone wants, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cGood for them, I\u2019m glad it was a great day for the sport.\u201d With Mercedes enjoying a strong advantage and Ferrari no closer to matching them, the Scuderia\u2019s task looks increasingly to be battling a resurgent Red Bull. Verstappen is now a solid third in the championship, 13 points in front of Vettel. At Silverstone their race pace was impressive and Pierre Gasly, who has had a lacklustre season thus far, returned his equal best F1 finish with fourth and pulled a great move to pass Vettel during the race. Hamilton knows he is now in a two-way title fight but bemoaned the lack of a greater challenge at the front. \u201cI love the racing, I do love the racing element, I loved competing against Ferrari last year. I wish the battle today was with the Ferraris. It\u2019s different when you\u2019re racing within a team and I much, much prefer it when you\u2019re racing with the Red Bull and Ferrari but currently that\u2019s not how it is.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "France Galop, French racing\u2019s ruling body, will cut admission prices for this year\u2019s Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe and \u201cpromise that every English racing fan should have a proper drink\u201d if Enable wins her third Arc at Longchamp in October, following widespread criticism of the facilities and customer service at the track in 2018 after a \u20ac140m (\u00a3123m) redevelopment. Thousands of British and Irish racing fans make an annual pilgrimage to Paris on the first weekend in October for Europe\u2019s richest and most prestigious race. Last year, though, many left bitterly disappointed and threatening never to return, amid reports of extended queues for toilets, betting windows, sandwich kiosks and bars, many of which seemed to run out of supplies by mid-afternoon. The problems arose despite an attendance of just 35,000 on Arc day, 20,000 fewer than saw Golden Horn\u2019s victory in 2015 before the old Longchamp closed for redevelopment. Fans paid \u20ac20 (\u00a317) to watch that race, and \u20ac30 (\u00a326) when the Arc moved to Chantilly in 2016 and 2017. For the first Arc at the new Longchamp, however, the price was hiked to \u20ac75 (\u00a368). That will drop to \u20ac65 (\u00a357) this year, while admission to the Jardin de l\u2019Arc enclosure \u2013 described as \u201cthe biggest pub in Paris\u201d \u2013 will be \u20ac20 from \u20ac30. The overall customer service for racegoers should also improve dramatically. \u201cWe had more than 30 race meetings before the Arc [last year] but the Arc is the Arc,\u201d Olivier Delloye, the CEO of France Galop, said this weekend. \u201cThat was probably our biggest mistake. We probably forgot after two years of the Arc being staged at Chantilly, which attracted much fewer English people, that the English people coming for the races bet much more than the French people, that they tend to drink a little more than the French people as well. So we were short of the basic services.\u201d Fabrice Favetto Bon, France Galop\u2019s marketing director, said that the track \u201cwill have 400 [betting] outlets compared to 343 last year. We\u2019ll have a lot more kiosks like you have in England [and] operators with tablets will have huge signage to make them very seeable for everybody. \u201cWe will implement more than 100 bars and pop-up restaurants and toilets will be increased by 30pc. We want to win back the trust of English fans, to tell them: give us a second chance.\u201d",

Here\u2019s our roundup of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/jun/17/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/jul/08/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">your comments and photos</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/jul/01/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\"> </a>from last week.</p> <p>Good news from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11420064\">Kemster</a>, who is \u201cthoroughly enjoying\u201d Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>World-building and story telling of the highest order and not the \u201chard\u201d sci-fi tome I was expecting at all. It does require a certain level of concentration but that is a small price to pay (if any at all) for such a good book.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jokha Alharthi\u2019s Celestial Bodies has made <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/100610593\">Rea Sist </a>cry:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s a rare book that moves me deeply, but even rarer than makes me cry, I\u2019m ancient and male. Jokha Alharthi\u2019s Celestial Bodies did just that. If the idea of a book about three sisters in practically medieval Oman in the 1970s sounds oppressive, it\u2019s the opposite. Think of it more like an Ursula le Guin novel set in a dusty planet, it is that remote. The people are instantly recognisable, as they pursue love within a country in transition, one where slavery still exists. There is also a possible murder within the tale, a subtle strand amongst many. Plus an ideal beach read!</p> </blockquote> <p>Emilia Pine\u2019s Notes has impressed <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15227882\">UndercoverOps:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I recently read and loved Emilia Pine\u2019s Notes to Self, gobbled down in one sitting on a flight from London to Marseille. It made me realise that I very rarely read non-fiction these days, but I used to enjoy essay collections.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17381240\">greenmill </a>has just finished The Spy And The Traitor by Ben McIntyre:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u2026 having bought it on impulse during an airport departure lounge wait. Ripped through it in no time and even though I knew in advance how it turned out, the true story which is a jaw-dropping mix of narrowly avoided Armageddon, double dealing, death defying escapes and almost comical incompetence (mostly by the KGB) kept me turning the pages. Not my usual thing but thoroughly enjoyed it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Where the Sun Shines Out by Kevin Catalano has engrossed and challenged <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3231012\">writeronthestorm</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve almost finished Where the Sun Shines Out by Kevin Catalano - this is one of the bleakest fiction books I\u2019ve read for quite some time. Yet, it is strangely engrossing. The story centres on what happens to people involved with, or connected to, the abduction of two young boys. The immediate aftermath and also the years upon years that follow. It\u2019s a heartbreaking and deeply uncomfortable read not for the faint of heart. This is challenging stuff!</p> </blockquote> <p>This Body\u2019s Not Big Enough for Both Of Us by Edgar Cantero provides some good niche reading, according to <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2475818\">pubbore</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s a comedy thriller starring a private investigator who is actually two siblings in the same body, each controlling one hemisphere of the brain. I\u2019m not sure if Cantero carries off the conceit entirely convincingly, but if you like gleefully tasteless violence and funny one-liners I can recommend it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3828881\">Swelter </a>has some tasty provocations from QD Leavis\u2019 Fiction and the Reading Public:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m enjoying it immensely.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. Good news from Kemster, who is \u201cthoroughly enjoying\u201d Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune: World-building and story telling of the highest order and not the \u201chard\u201d sci-fi tome I was expecting at all. It does require a certain level of concentration but that is a small price to pay (if any at all) for such a good book. Jokha Alharthi\u2019s Celestial Bodies has made Rea Sist cry: It\u2019s a rare book that moves me deeply, but even rarer than makes me cry, I\u2019m ancient and male. Jokha Alharthi\u2019s Celestial Bodies did just that. If the idea of a book about three sisters in practically medieval Oman in the 1970s sounds oppressive, it\u2019s the opposite. Think of it more like an Ursula le Guin novel set in a dusty planet, it is that remote. The people are instantly recognisable, as they pursue love within a country in transition, one where slavery still exists. There is also a possible murder within the tale, a subtle strand amongst many. Plus an ideal beach read! Emilia Pine\u2019s Notes has impressed UndercoverOps: I recently read and loved Emilia Pine\u2019s Notes to Self, gobbled down in one sitting on a flight from London to Marseille. It made me realise that I very rarely read non-fiction these days, but I used to enjoy essay collections. Meanwhile, greenmill has just finished The Spy And The Traitor by Ben McIntyre: \u2026 having bought it on impulse during an airport departure lounge wait. Ripped through it in no time and even though I knew in advance how it turned out, the true story which is a jaw-dropping mix of narrowly avoided Armageddon, double dealing, death defying escapes and almost comical incompetence (mostly by the KGB) kept me turning the pages. Not my usual thing but thoroughly enjoyed it. Where the Sun Shines Out by Kevin Catalano has engrossed and challenged writeronthestorm: I\u2019ve almost finished Where the Sun Shines Out by Kevin Catalano - this is one of the bleakest fiction books I\u2019ve read for quite some time. Yet, it is strangely engrossing. The story centres on what happens to people involved with, or connected to, the abduction of two young boys. The immediate aftermath and also the years upon years that follow. It\u2019s a heartbreaking and deeply uncomfortable read not for the faint of heart. This is challenging stuff! This Body\u2019s Not Big Enough for Both Of Us by Edgar Cantero provides some good niche reading, according to pubbore: It\u2019s a comedy thriller starring a private investigator who is actually two siblings in the same body, each controlling one hemisphere of the brain. I\u2019m not sure if Cantero carries off the conceit entirely convincingly, but if you like gleefully tasteless violence and funny one-liners I can recommend it. Finally, Swelter has some tasty provocations from QD Leavis\u2019 Fiction and the Reading Public: I\u2019m enjoying it immensely. Leavis is a militant and unapologetic champion of the \u201chighbrow\u201d: \u2018Those novels which have some pretensions to literary merit and can be criticised by serious standards (it is common even in literary circles to fling the epithet \u2018highbrow\u2019 at it).\u2019 In order to demonstrate the universality of the belief that, in the 1920s and 1930s, the most popular literature is invariably the worst, she quotes Arnold Bennett (Evening Standard July 19th, 1928): \u2018Nearly all bookish people are snobs, and especially the more enlightened among them. They are apt to assume that if a writer has immense circulation, if he is enjoyed by plain persons, and if he can fill several theatres at once, he cannot possibly be worth reading and merits only indifference and disdain.\u2019 Elsewhere she accuses Bennett\u2019s literary column of being one of the forces, along with book-of-the-month clubs, that perpetuate and codify \u201cmiddlebrow\u201d literature. Nearly all bookish people are snobs? What kind of know-nothing would write that? Interesting links about books and reading Amazon workers plan strike for \u201cPrime day\u201d. Dorothy Iannone\u2019s 1969 A Cookbook \u201cdrips with love and colour\u201d. Times Literary Supplement contributors reflect on the impact of Iris Murdoch. \u201cI suspect that the first dictator of this country will be called Coach\u201d: William H Gass\u2019s 1995 novel, The Tunnel, now seems all too prescient.

Who, we asked ourselves, does this stuff better? And yet amid the unfolding delirium of Sunday\u2019s sporting cavalcade there were moments when it was impossible not to pause the action and ask what it means, in the times through which we are living, to find a few hours\u2019 relief by cheering a bunch of talented people hitting a ball or driving round in circles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jul/15/cricket-world-cup-england-new-zealand-revival\">Epic final defines a triumphant World Cup \u2013 will it spark a cricket revival? | Vic Marks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whoever and wherever you were, it was a glorious day. There may have been nothing quite like having a seat at Lord\u2019s as the astonishing climax to the World Cup final went through its various stages of escalating delirium. But the real place to be was in England\u2019s back garden, with family and friends and a big screen and a bucket full of iced drinks. Then, as an average sort of day was transformed by golden late-afternoon sunlight, you could watch and marvel at it all, surfing on one wave of emotion after another.</p> <p>The TV cameras captured the enthusiasm of all those crowds, from the grassy mounds to the royal box. But that\u2019s where Stormzy, Jeff Bezos, Sharron Davies, Daniel Craig, Seb Coe, Clare Foy, John Bercow and those nice Cambridges and Cumberbatches got it wrong. It was good to see them all showing up at a major sporting event. But they\u2019d have been better off in a T-shirt and shorts in the back garden, soaking everything up at once, gripped by the dizzying crescendo of a unique day.</p> <p>It\u2019s not necessary to claim that a record-breaking sixth victory at Silverstone makes Lewis Hamilton the greatest grand prix driver of all time or that the first Wimbledon men\u2019s singles final to be decided by a fifth-set tie break was the greatest tennis match in history or that by fighting each other to the very end England and New Zealand had produced the greatest cricket match ever played. Probably none of those things is true. But we can be pretty certain that there has never been an all-round day quite like this one, when events followed each other in a way that otherwise happens only during an Olympic Games, with its formal and interlinked structure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Olympics was the comparison that also came to mind while observing the joy of the crowds at all three places. Seven years ago this month Britain became the sporting centre of the world when London hosted the Summer Games. Immoderate expenditure and matching inventiveness allowed the country to show its best side, starting with an opening ceremony in which Danny Boyle brilliantly reacquainted us with our history, our diversity and our moral assets. For two weeks we were enraptured not just by the athletes\u2019 achievements but by a comforting sense that we had recognised our better selves, despite the austerity measures newly imposed on British lives by the men occupying the best seats in the stadium.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ab39be7ee3251b022e7829b6b9f8681fb67d9e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ab39be7ee3251b022e7829b6b9f8681fb67d9e1/0_234_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England supporters enjoy the Cricket World Cup triumph in time-honoured fashion in the fountains of London\u2019s Trafalgar Square.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England supporters enjoy the Cricket World Cup triumph in time-honoured fashion in the fountains of London\u2019s Trafalgar Square.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Radburn/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All things pass, we told ourselves. The Camerons and Osbornes will fade into history but our real values and principles, ancient and modern, will endure. Look at Jess Ennis, a mixed race woman from Sheffield. Look at Bradley Wiggins, born in Ghent and now enthroned at Hampton Court Palace. Look at Mo Farah, a refugee from Mogadishu. The future is right there, enfolded in a union flag, and it wasn\u2019t formed on the playing fields of Eton. That\u2019s what we said as the cheers faded on the last of those wonderful summer evenings, before the daily grind resumed.</p> <p>One Olympic cycle later a truer picture of Britain\u2019s essential nature emerged through the result of the EU referendum, and Sunday\u2019s events took place against the backdrop of a nation more deeply divided than ever, readier to turn disagreement into hatred and anger into violence. In such an environment even the bliss of a first win for England in a Cricket World Cup final could not feel entirely unmixed.</p> <p>No response to that triumph was more self-revealing in its stupidity, ignorance and opportunism than that of Jacob Rees-Mogg, who took to Twitter to proclaim that \u201cwe clearly don\u2019t need Europe to win\u201d. There are three answers to that. First, \u201cwe\u201d don\u2019t need Europe to win the Eton wall game, either. Second, the Ryder Cup. Third, he seemed not to have noticed that the squad deemed worthy of his accolade contains a host of players with immigrant backgrounds, including men born in Dublin, Christchurch, Bridgetown and Durban, and with skin shades and cultural affiliations reflecting what anyone can see on a walk through the ordinary streets of Britain. They don\u2019t represent some utopian Rainbow Britain but they do represent the us that history has fashioned and which is under attack from those with a different agenda.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/15/england-winning-cricket-world-cup-moment-44-years-hurt\">Forty-four years of hurt made England\u2019s winning moment even sweeter | Tanya Aldred</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the participants the glow of that magical day will never fade. The rest of us can also cherish the memories and the sense of pride \u2013 not just in the prizes won in our name but in the knowledge that the stage and the audience proved worthy of the occasion. Hamilton and the England XI were inevitably cheered to the echo and beyond but Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, a Serb and a Swiss, could not have wished for a finer setting for their efforts or a warmer embrace from the crowd. It took all sorts, not least New Zealand\u2019s widely appreciated sportsmanship, to create that day of marvels, allowing us another glimpse of our better selves.

      "bodyText": "Bread and circuses, eh? A full house of 140,000 at Silverstone, Wimbledon packed for the men\u2019s final, the entire nation taking advantage of the free-to-air concession to follow the twists and turns of an unprecedented cricket showdown at a sold-out Lord\u2019s. Who, we asked ourselves, does this stuff better? And yet amid the unfolding delirium of Sunday\u2019s sporting cavalcade there were moments when it was impossible not to pause the action and ask what it means, in the times through which we are living, to find a few hours\u2019 relief by cheering a bunch of talented people hitting a ball or driving round in circles. Whoever and wherever you were, it was a glorious day. There may have been nothing quite like having a seat at Lord\u2019s as the astonishing climax to the World Cup final went through its various stages of escalating delirium. But the real place to be was in England\u2019s back garden, with family and friends and a big screen and a bucket full of iced drinks. Then, as an average sort of day was transformed by golden late-afternoon sunlight, you could watch and marvel at it all, surfing on one wave of emotion after another. The TV cameras captured the enthusiasm of all those crowds, from the grassy mounds to the royal box. But that\u2019s where Stormzy, Jeff Bezos, Sharron Davies, Daniel Craig, Seb Coe, Clare Foy, John Bercow and those nice Cambridges and Cumberbatches got it wrong. It was good to see them all showing up at a major sporting event. But they\u2019d have been better off in a T-shirt and shorts in the back garden, soaking everything up at once, gripped by the dizzying crescendo of a unique day. It\u2019s not necessary to claim that a record-breaking sixth victory at Silverstone makes Lewis Hamilton the greatest grand prix driver of all time or that the first Wimbledon men\u2019s singles final to be decided by a fifth-set tie break was the greatest tennis match in history or that by fighting each other to the very end England and New Zealand had produced the greatest cricket match ever played. Probably none of those things is true. But we can be pretty certain that there has never been an all-round day quite like this one, when events followed each other in a way that otherwise happens only during an Olympic Games, with its formal and interlinked structure. The Olympics was the comparison that also came to mind while observing the joy of the crowds at all three places. Seven years ago this month Britain became the sporting centre of the world when London hosted the Summer Games. Immoderate expenditure and matching inventiveness allowed the country to show its best side, starting with an opening ceremony in which Danny Boyle brilliantly reacquainted us with our history, our diversity and our moral assets. For two weeks we were enraptured not just by the athletes\u2019 achievements but by a comforting sense that we had recognised our better selves, despite the austerity measures newly imposed on British lives by the men occupying the best seats in the stadium. All things pass, we told ourselves. The Camerons and Osbornes will fade into history but our real values and principles, ancient and modern, will endure. Look at Jess Ennis, a mixed race woman from Sheffield. Look at Bradley Wiggins, born in Ghent and now enthroned at Hampton Court Palace. Look at Mo Farah, a refugee from Mogadishu. The future is right there, enfolded in a union flag, and it wasn\u2019t formed on the playing fields of Eton. That\u2019s what we said as the cheers faded on the last of those wonderful summer evenings, before the daily grind resumed. One Olympic cycle later a truer picture of Britain\u2019s essential nature emerged through the result of the EU referendum, and Sunday\u2019s events took place against the backdrop of a nation more deeply divided than ever, readier to turn disagreement into hatred and anger into violence. In such an environment even the bliss of a first win for England in a Cricket World Cup final could not feel entirely unmixed. No response to that triumph was more self-revealing in its stupidity, ignorance and opportunism than that of Jacob Rees-Mogg, who took to Twitter to proclaim that \u201cwe clearly don\u2019t need Europe to win\u201d. There are three answers to that. First, \u201cwe\u201d don\u2019t need Europe to win the Eton wall game, either. Second, the Ryder Cup. Third, he seemed not to have noticed that the squad deemed worthy of his accolade contains a host of players with immigrant backgrounds, including men born in Dublin, Christchurch, Bridgetown and Durban, and with skin shades and cultural affiliations reflecting what anyone can see on a walk through the ordinary streets of Britain. They don\u2019t represent some utopian Rainbow Britain but they do represent the us that history has fashioned and which is under attack from those with a different agenda. For the participants the glow of that magical day will never fade. The rest of us can also cherish the memories and the sense of pride \u2013 not just in the prizes won in our name but in the knowledge that the stage and the audience proved worthy of the occasion. Hamilton and the England XI were inevitably cheered to the echo and beyond but Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, a Serb and a Swiss, could not have wished for a finer setting for their efforts or a warmer embrace from the crowd. It took all sorts, not least New Zealand\u2019s widely appreciated sportsmanship, to create that day of marvels, allowing us another glimpse of our better selves. By the time the next one arrives the need might be even greater.",

      "bodyText": "England\u2019s cricket World Cup victory attracted a peak TV audience of 4.5 million people on Channel 4, as live international cricket returned to free-to-air television for the first time in 14 years. The figures peaked during the deciding super over when a combined total of 8 million were watching on Channel 4 or Sky\u2019s pay-TV channels. Around half that number tuned in for the entire match. The viewing figures were substantially smaller than those for England\u2019s run to the semi-finals of the women\u2019s football World Cup and coverage of Wimbledon on the BBC, raising concerns that cricket has lost out to other sports in the time since it was last on free-to-air TV. Almost all English cricket matches are now set to return behind Sky\u2019s paywall for the foreseeable future meaning any new fans won over by Ben Stokes\u2019s extraordinary batting performance will have to pay for a subscription if they want to watch this summer\u2019s Ashes series against Australia. Sky, which has televised all English cricket matches since 2005 in return for substantial investment in the sport, agreed to let Channel 4 show the final after the home team won their place in it. The pay-TV service, which has won plaudits for its presentation of the sport, faced sustained pressure in recent weeks over low viewing figures for World Cup matches. England\u2019s hosting of the tournament had been heralded as a great chance for the sport to create a new generation of fans. Cricket\u2019s return to free-to-air television was then hampered by its clash with both Wimbledon and the Formula One British Grand Prix. Channel 4 was forced to move its live cricket coverage to More4 for much of the afternoon to make way for the motor racing, losing a substantial number of viewers in the process. The BBC\u2019s parallel coverage of the Wimbledon men\u2019s singles final between Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic attracted a peak audience of 9.6 million and an average of 6 million on BBC One, beating England\u2019s victory in the cricket on both metrics. The official viewing figures, provided by overnights.tv, do not include people watching online streams of the match or those watching in pubs or other public spaces. Channel 4, which held the free-to-air rights for the cricket World Cup, has itself faced criticism after putting some highlights packages on air after midnight. The England and Wales Cricket Board pointed out that while the majority of international matches would remain on Sky, from next year the BBC has the rights to show two live men\u2019s Twenty20 matches a year.",

For MUNA, summer has jumped out. Number One Fan begins from the not-so-gloomy disposition of warbling Europop basslines, so silly as to immediately snap you from your stupor. The chorus is one that demands to be heard long after the sun goes down: <em>\u201cOh my god, I\u2019m your number one fan! So iconic, like, big, like, stan,\u201d</em> is fortunately a lyric as self-fulfilling as it is audacious.</p> <p>Number One Fan is a song about cancelling your self-consumed inner neuroses. If you\u2019re prone to those, you\u2019ll know the anxiety hits any time, and can be even worse during months of weddings, barbecues, beach excursions, trips to the zoo, etc. The forced organised \u201cfun!\u201d knows no bounds. So praise MUNA for this versatile smash, one so multi-purpose I can dance to it in the club, I can bump it in the supermarket, and I can pump it out the windows of an Uber X en route to any and all of the above, all the while serving myself a little self-help reminder to <em>just do you, honey</em>. <em>EB</em></p> <h2>Goldlink ft Tyler, the Creator and Jay Prince \u2013 U Say</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okDyllPhH2Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/okDyllPhH2Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There are some songs that are so clearly meant and created with the hotter months in mind, oozing a certain airiness that other songs lack. Goldlink, Tyler, the Creator and a barely audible Jay Prince did just that, when they teamed up to create and capture the quintessence of summer in U Say. From the DC native\u2019s bouncing album Diaspora, the song mixes several different styles of Afro music, including hip-hop, Afro beats and soft Latin jazz. The soft strum of the instrumental track juxtaposed with the harder bouncing beat binds to create a hypnotizing track, encouraging hip-swaying and proximity to palm fronds.</p> <p>While his Zulu Screams most definitely passes the car test, U Say enhances and ensorcells. Summer itself feels encapsulated in the song: ice-cream crawls, late-night dancing, daytime rooftop parties, and even lazy beach days. It reminds me of a good twist-out or chunky Senegalese twists I wear during the hotter months: beautiful, carefree and a mix of Afro culture. <em>DM</em></p> <h2>Carly Rae Jepsen \u2013 Want You In My Room</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELzgEvk31dk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ELzgEvk31dk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There may be no better time to catch feelings than the slow slide of hot summer evenings into sweet summer nights, a magic bottled in Want You In My Room, the fourth track from cult-feelings queen Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s Dedicated<em>. </em>The song slinks in like twilight, a breathy slow burn (\u201cDon\u2019t go, no, the night\u2019s not over\u201d) that tumbles into confession (\u201cI just wanna get a little bit closer\u201d). But all coyness melts in the triumphant chorus, a circle of Get Lucky-esque distortion and exuberant proclamations which channels the tension of <em>maybe</em> into here, now (\u201con the bed! / on the floor!\u201d) with all of summer\u2019s (zero) inhibitions (\u201cI don\u2019t care / any more!\u201d). Sliiiiide on through my window, she beckons, as if this is a realistic possibility and not the fantasy of mid-aughts teen dramas.</p> <p>Ultimately, it\u2019s a radiant saxophone solo that dances her off into the sunset. In classic CRJ fashion, fulfillment of desire is beside the point; it\u2019s the existence of it \u2013 the joy of feeling potential heat up the rooftop, the pool, the backyard barbecue, the season. <em>AH</em></p> <h2>Kevin Abstract \u2013 Crumble</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5xnDhifQ2o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B5xnDhifQ2o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There\u2019s late-summer sadness seeping through Kevin Abstract\u2019s early summer heart-squeezer Crumble, one of the standout tracks from his sophomore album Arizona Baby. It sees the queer rapper at his most vulnerable (\u201cI\u2019m tired of fucking crying and hiding behind a dummy\u201d he states in one of the song\u2019s most heartfelt reveals) as he wistfully looks back on his youth with a more mature perspective. The song matches him with gay YouTuber-turned-singer Ryan Beatty, who recently worked with Tyler, the Creator, as well as up-and-coming SoundCloud singer Dominic Fike and indie pop maestro Jack Antonoff. In Antonoff\u2019s crushing chorus, he sings about the desire to crumble outside of a loved one\u2019s window and the line has the same effect on the listener, gradually breaking us down with each repetition.</p> <p>Misty-eyed melancholy might not seem suited for the year\u2019s hottest season but there\u2019s an undeniable balminess to Crumble, a song suited for sadly recalling a lost love or a lost youth while the sun softly sets. <em>BL</em></p> <h2>Taylor Swift \u2013 You Need To Calm Down</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkk9gvTmCXY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Dkk9gvTmCXY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Queen of Pop has spoken. Redeeming herself after the underwhelming and saccharinely corny Me!, Taylor Swift has gifted the masses the hot weather anthem that is You Need to Calm Down. The hallmarks of such an honor are evident to even the most clogged ears: its singalong chorus, bright message, glistening synths and danceable beat all swirl together in shimmering summer excellence.</p> <p>That\u2019s not even to mention the thesis of the whole shebang, which is to promote equality and materializes into an on-the-nose Pride anthem that even shouts out Glaad and shouts down the homophobes. Whether or not it\u2019s <em>too</em> on the nose is up for debate, but even if it is: does it matter? While songs of summer\u2019s past glisten yet lack substance, You Need to Calm Down walks a delicate tightrope between the two, and the sweltering season is better for it. <em>RL</em></p> <h2>Rosal\u00eda and J Balvin \u2013 Con Altura</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7bfOZek9t4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p7bfOZek9t4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It\u2019s two years since Despacito ruled the summer, and Latin music shows no signs of relinquishing its seasonal grip. Last year, Cardi B, Bad Bunny and J Balvin clinched it with the slinky, trunk-rattling I Like It; the latter returns this year flanked by Spanish flamenco trap star Rosal\u00eda for a pricklier proposition than last summer\u2019s boogaloo. On Con Altura, the pair take a braggadocious ride over a stuttering dembow beat by El Guincho (who produced Rosal\u00eda\u2019s El Mal Querer) and Frank Dukes, admiring the spoils of their newfound success with equal parts awe and untamable ego. (British listeners may note an enjoyable similarity to another unexpected summer hit, Panjabi MC\u2019s Mundian To Bach Ke.) Totally commanding, infectious and guaranteed to be responsible for more than one slipped disc this summer. <em>LS</em></p> <h2>Dalex ft Sech, Rafa Pab\u00f6n, Cazzu, Feid, Khea and Lenny Tavarez \u2013 Pa Mi</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwsgCnBLL4A\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JwsgCnBLL4A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Taken from an album entitled Climaxxx, the cover of which features Puerto Rican pop star Dalex in the buff with a thoughtfully applied shadow hiding his presumably trimmed pubic hair, the messaging is clear: this is the record to play after you\u2019ve got lucky at your nearest beach resort\u2019s foam party. Pa M\u00ed is the standout and rightfully got the remix treatment, with a stream of new-school Latin stars offering their own verses. This kind of remix can be interminable, but the stunning beauty of the chorus \u2013 yearning but focused \u2013 means it never gets old. Of the universally good guest spots, the winner is Cazzu: a gothic Argentinian star (with 3.4 million Insta followers) whose delivery is gorgeously precise. It\u2019s the peak in a song that is almost overbearingly sensual, one that exudes the lambent heat of late summer. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2>(Sandy) Alex G \u2013 Gretel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcO-NPtj5BI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HcO-NPtj5BI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Gretel isn\u2019t a traditional \u201cget your single-use BBQ out \u2013 it\u2019s July\u201d sort is song, but the Philadelphian\u2019s creepy alt-folk conjures the earthy, wayward elements of childhood summers spent left to your own devices: exploring the darker, composty corners of gardens, finding a severed human finger near the train tracks, accidentally snapping a bird\u2019s beak and coming to terms with your own mortality for the first time. That sort of thing.</p> <p>Given his grunge and slacker roots, G\u2019s music tends to reside in a perpetual state of lazy summers anyway, and the video, full of crashing race cars and dream-like footage of G leading two small boys around a neon green field (perhaps some reference to Hansel and Gretel) only heightens the eerie nostalgia it makes you feel for a formative summer you\u2019ve never actually had.</p> <p>Quietly sinister. The antithesis of Get Lucky. But seasonally relevant nonetheless. After all, with every golden afternoon comes the looming prospect of winter on the horizon. Bring on the gloom. <em>HG</em></p> <h2><strong>R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy \u2013 Incapable</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H02BPY7vEms\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H02BPY7vEms?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Every year R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy seems to deliver a dancefloor care package which her dedicated fan base, and critics, mop up yet it always seems to evade a larger audience.

In 2014, there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/17/roisin-murphy-natural-become-muse-irish-singer-songwriter\">Mi Senti</a>, a selection of covers which paid homage to Italian pop. In 2019, Murphy has opted for more house, with a slower BPM than last time out and production from her pal Richard Barratt AKA DJ Parrot. \u201cWhen it came to the imagery, for some reason I wanted a huge perm,\u201d said Murphy of her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/may/21/hair-raising-the-return-of-the-perm\">imagined diva protagonist</a>, \u201ca character so untouched by the pain of heartbreak\u201d she dreamed her up with \u201chuge mounds of luxurious hair\u201d.

BL Taylor Swift \u2013 You Need To Calm Down Ladies and gentlemen, the Queen of Pop has spoken. Redeeming herself after the underwhelming and saccharinely corny Me!, Taylor Swift has gifted the masses the hot weather anthem that is You Need to Calm Down. The hallmarks of such an honor are evident to even the most clogged ears: its singalong chorus, bright message, glistening synths and danceable beat all swirl together in shimmering summer excellence. That\u2019s not even to mention the thesis of the whole shebang, which is to promote equality and materializes into an on-the-nose Pride anthem that even shouts out Glaad and shouts down the homophobes. Whether or not it\u2019s too on the nose is up for debate, but even if it is: does it matter? While songs of summer\u2019s past glisten yet lack substance, You Need to Calm Down walks a delicate tightrope between the two, and the sweltering season is better for it.

LS Dalex ft Sech, Rafa Pab\u00f6n, Cazzu, Feid, Khea and Lenny Tavarez \u2013 Pa Mi Taken from an album entitled Climaxxx, the cover of which features Puerto Rican pop star Dalex in the buff with a thoughtfully applied shadow hiding his presumably trimmed pubic hair, the messaging is clear: this is the record to play after you\u2019ve got lucky at your nearest beach resort\u2019s foam party. Pa M\u00ed is the standout and rightfully got the remix treatment, with a stream of new-school Latin stars offering their own verses. This kind of remix can be interminable, but the stunning beauty of the chorus \u2013 yearning but focused \u2013 means it never gets old. Of the universally good guest spots, the winner is Cazzu: a gothic Argentinian star (with 3.4 million Insta followers) whose delivery is gorgeously precise. It\u2019s the peak in a song that is almost overbearingly sensual, one that exudes the lambent heat of late summer. BBT (Sandy) Alex G \u2013 Gretel Gretel isn\u2019t a traditional \u201cget your single-use BBQ out \u2013 it\u2019s July\u201d sort is song, but the Philadelphian\u2019s creepy alt-folk conjures the earthy, wayward elements of childhood summers spent left to your own devices: exploring the darker, composty corners of gardens, finding a severed human finger near the train tracks, accidentally snapping a bird\u2019s beak and coming to terms with your own mortality for the first time. That sort of thing. Given his grunge and slacker roots, G\u2019s music tends to reside in a perpetual state of lazy summers anyway, and the video, full of crashing race cars and dream-like footage of G leading two small boys around a neon green field (perhaps some reference to Hansel and Gretel) only heightens the eerie nostalgia it makes you feel for a formative summer you\u2019ve never actually had. Quietly sinister. The antithesis of Get Lucky. But seasonally relevant nonetheless. After all, with every golden afternoon comes the looming prospect of winter on the horizon. Bring on the gloom. HG R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy \u2013 Incapable Every year R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy seems to deliver a dancefloor care package which her dedicated fan base, and critics, mop up yet it always seems to evade a larger audience. Last year there was her EP with house producer Maurice Fulton, which produced half a dozen dance-pop belters, including Plaything and the wonderfully sleazy Jacuzzi Rollercoaster. In 2014, there was Mi Senti, a selection of covers which paid homage to Italian pop. In 2019, Murphy has opted for more house, with a slower BPM than last time out and production from her pal Richard Barratt AKA DJ Parrot. \u201cWhen it came to the imagery, for some reason I wanted a huge perm,\u201d said Murphy of her imagined diva protagonist, \u201ca character so untouched by the pain of heartbreak\u201d she dreamed her up with \u201chuge mounds of luxurious hair\u201d. Get out your hairspray, forget your broken heart and put yourself in the very capable hands of Mrs Murphy. LB Lil Nas X \u2013 Old Town Road The largely unknown Atlantan\u2019s disruptive country-trap smash was controversially yanked off the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart after reaching No 19 when it dropped in December, but the ensuing racially tinged controversy (and TikTok ubiquity) helped power the remix with Billy Ray Cyrus to the top of the Hot 100 in April \u2013 where it\u2019s pitched camp for a record-pushing 14 weeks and counting, becoming a bona fide cultural phenomenon while topping the charts in 10 other countries. The strange alchemy on hand \u2013 Lil Nas X\u2019s easy southern twang cast against a YoungKio-produced beat mixing 808s, hi-hats and a moody banjo sampled from Nine Inch Nails\u2019 Ghosts I-IV (reportedly purchased for $30 from the Dutch producer\u2019s BeatStars shop) \u2013 is both mysterious and familiar, delivering a grand unifying theory of Georgia culture that will be in heavy rotation long after Labor Day. One of the most interesting and provocative pop songs in years. BAG",

We knew they were going to want to kill us \u2013 but it had to be done,\u201d says Moss. \u201cI was the one who pulled the noose even tighter. It was my idea that June puts her hand up, and she puts her foot up, so she almost gets in the van \u2026 and then she says that last line: \u2018Tell her her name is Nicole\u2019, and closes the door.

      "bodyText": "\u2018I have a very high tolerance for things that are dark and brutal,\u201d says Elisabeth Moss, cheerfully. That, you must conclude, is a fortuitous trait for the star of a series that has become a byword for bleakness. What she has a low tolerance for, however, are those who complain that The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is too traumatic to watch from the safety of the sofa. \u201cLook outside!\u201d she says. \u201cIf you can\u2019t face our show, how are you going to face what\u2019s actually happening out there in the real world? It\u2019s important to be able to hold that mirror up to society and try to get people to face what\u2019s going on before it\u2019s too late.\u201d We are deep into the award-winning dystopian drama\u2019s third season now, and the dark subject matter central to the story \u2013 women stripped of their rights, subjugated, enslaved and ranked according to their fertility \u2013 feels more horrifyingly relevant than ever. The first season \u2013 faithfully adapted from Margaret Atwood\u2019s seminal 1985 novel \u2013 launched a few turbulent months into Trump\u2019s presidency, with reproductive healthcare and immigration (among many other liberties) already in the crosshairs. \u201cOur rights are under threat in a way they have never been before. Or, certainly, that they haven\u2019t been in our lifetimes,\u201d Moss told me at the time. Season two landed in the midst of the #MeToo movement, itself in part a reaction to the installation as president of a man who had publicly boasted of sexual assault. Now, season three is playing out while access to abortion in the US is rapidly and dramatically dismantled; in May, an all-male state senate in Alabama passed a bill criminalising abortions, even in cases of rape and incest, while five more states \u2013 Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio, Mississippi and Kentucky \u2013 have voted to pass bills that ban abortion after six weeks. \u201cOne would hope this show is a real exaggeration,\u201d says Bradley Whitford, who plays the enigmatic Commander Lawrence, \u201cbut it gets a little too close to reality when you\u2019re living in a country where, in some places, you will be penalised more harshly if you are impregnated by a rapist and have an abortion than if you rape somebody.\u201d Moss, a longtime advocate for the women\u2019s health service Planned Parenthood, says even she has felt a dramatic awakening since the show started. \u201cIt happened to come along at a time when we were all woken up by things changing around us,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope people take this feeling of fear \u2013 this \u2018Oh, it\u2019s so relevant\u2019 and \u2018Oh, it\u2019s so scary\u2019 \u2013 and they put it into action. I hope it\u2019s not just clickbait. I hope people take that fear and use it to do something.\u201d The action some viewers have taken, however, is to simply switch off. Season two \u2013 the first to depart from Atwood\u2019s original material \u2013 was critiqued for descending too far into the darkness of the fictitious Gilead regime.

      "body": "<p>Is there anything more quintessentially British than the Grand Prix at Silverstone? A petrol-fuelled romp in the Midlands couched among country lanes and English villages, the 52-lap race is an unmissable fixture in the sporting summer. This weekend delivered excitement, nostalgia and glory, all wrapped in a neat carbon\u2011fibre package.</p> \n<p>The 10th round of the Formula One world championship faced stiff competition this year, with both Wimbledon and the Cricket World Cup scheduled for the same Sunday. Such a clash of commitments suggests that major sporting event planners should coordinate timetables; if not for viewing numbers, at least to ease the Fomo (fear of missing out) for fans. Silverstone has the magic combination of a terrific track, fervent supporters and a proud past. It is, after all, where the first World Championship Grand Prix was held in 1950 and in many ways the British race has stayed true to its roots.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/15/lewis-hamilton-f1-british-grand-prix-championship\">Lewis Hamilton fires warning to F1 rivals as championship lead extends</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For some fans the festival begins on Thursday or Friday, as streams of cars and caravans begin to fan out across fields in the area \u2013 a sign of the excitement to come. Gone, however, are the horror stories of gridlock and bogging of yesteryear, as effort has been invested into preparing the site and surrounding infrastructure for smooth traffic flows in and out of the venue.</p> \n<p>The committed fans who arrive early will spend hours meticulously putting up their tents and marquees, preparing their campsites for cosy habitation over the next few days. Fields turn into a city overnight, with music pouring out of mobile speakers, portable kitchen and dining tables on every tent avenue and shared open spaces aplenty. These are the fans who wake up at 4am on the Saturday and Sunday, queuing up as early as possible with picnic blankets and foldable chairs to make sure they nab the best viewing location on the track (Becketts, Stowe and Luffield are among the most sought\u2011after).</p> \n<p>Food truck vendors littered around the track start serving at 5am. There are a couple of vegetarian and vegan options available as well, a display of culinary inclusion. Not much halal meat, though, but one can\u2019t have it all.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Driving up, the track doesn\u2019t show itself immediately. The roads leading up to the circuit are quaint, winding, surrounded by shrub and woods reminiscent of the country described by Enid Blyton. As chirps of baby tawny owls are echoed by whispers of engines roaring, the circuit comes into view and the energy immediately shifts. Conversation takes on an animated babble, turning to race predictions, favourite drivers, tire selection strategy and lunch. </p> \n<p>The race did not disappoint. Valtteri Bottas taking pole position was a touch unexpected as Mercedes locked out the front row, Lewis Hamilton breathing down his teammate\u2019s neck. Although the safety car, appearing on lap 21 after Antonio Giovinazzi spun his Alfa Romeo, put a dampener on that exchange, it was a display of the race craft skills we don\u2019t always get the chance to see. Ultimately, however, it was Hamilton\u2019s one-stop pitting strategy compared to Bottas\u2019s two stops that gave him the edge.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/lewis-hamilton-wins-f1-british-grand-prix-record-sixth\">Lewis Hamilton wins F1 British Grand Prix for record sixth time</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc and Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen duelled hard for third place, with Red Bull\u2019s Pierre Gasly and Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel also occasionally in the mix. Verstappen had his pace, Leclerc had his craft, and it was those two up against each other, lap after lap, offering fans a battle for the ages. Even in the pits, they came in together on lap 13 and exited side by side, the Red Bull nosing ahead. Vettel running into the back of Verstappen gave Leclerc the opening he needed to win back third place. \u201cIt is the race I enjoyed most in my F1 career,\u201d Leclerc said.</p> \n<p>Hamilton walked away from Silverstone with his sixth victory at the track and well ahead of his competition on the world championship leaderboard. He was humble in victory, thanking his fans and exalting the support of his home grand prix. The support came out in droves but is not without its detractors, as is evident any time the five-times world champion dares to falter. When a question referencing the double standards levelled against Hamilton compared to other drivers over his national identity provoked defensiveness from fans and pundits alike, the underlying current of discomfort was laid bare.</p> \n<p>Silverstone is as British as it gets, and with that comes reflections of the anxieties the country is grappling with across the board. Sport is ultimately a reflection of its society, rather than an escape from it. F1 is no exception, no matter how fast they drive.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Is there anything more quintessentially British than the Grand Prix at Silverstone? A petrol-fuelled romp in the Midlands couched among country lanes and English villages, the 52-lap race is an unmissable fixture in the sporting summer. This weekend delivered excitement, nostalgia and glory, all wrapped in a neat carbon\u2011fibre package. The 10th round of the Formula One world championship faced stiff competition this year, with both Wimbledon and the Cricket World Cup scheduled for the same Sunday. Such a clash of commitments suggests that major sporting event planners should coordinate timetables; if not for viewing numbers, at least to ease the Fomo (fear of missing out) for fans. Silverstone has the magic combination of a terrific track, fervent supporters and a proud past. It is, after all, where the first World Championship Grand Prix was held in 1950 and in many ways the British race has stayed true to its roots. For some fans the festival begins on Thursday or Friday, as streams of cars and caravans begin to fan out across fields in the area \u2013 a sign of the excitement to come. Gone, however, are the horror stories of gridlock and bogging of yesteryear, as effort has been invested into preparing the site and surrounding infrastructure for smooth traffic flows in and out of the venue. The committed fans who arrive early will spend hours meticulously putting up their tents and marquees, preparing their campsites for cosy habitation over the next few days. Fields turn into a city overnight, with music pouring out of mobile speakers, portable kitchen and dining tables on every tent avenue and shared open spaces aplenty. These are the fans who wake up at 4am on the Saturday and Sunday, queuing up as early as possible with picnic blankets and foldable chairs to make sure they nab the best viewing location on the track (Becketts, Stowe and Luffield are among the most sought\u2011after). Food truck vendors littered around the track start serving at 5am. There are a couple of vegetarian and vegan options available as well, a display of culinary inclusion. Not much halal meat, though, but one can\u2019t have it all. Driving up, the track doesn\u2019t show itself immediately. The roads leading up to the circuit are quaint, winding, surrounded by shrub and woods reminiscent of the country described by Enid Blyton. As chirps of baby tawny owls are echoed by whispers of engines roaring, the circuit comes into view and the energy immediately shifts. Conversation takes on an animated babble, turning to race predictions, favourite drivers, tire selection strategy and lunch. The race did not disappoint. Valtteri Bottas taking pole position was a touch unexpected as Mercedes locked out the front row, Lewis Hamilton breathing down his teammate\u2019s neck. Although the safety car, appearing on lap 21 after Antonio Giovinazzi spun his Alfa Romeo, put a dampener on that exchange, it was a display of the race craft skills we don\u2019t always get the chance to see. Ultimately, however, it was Hamilton\u2019s one-stop pitting strategy compared to Bottas\u2019s two stops that gave him the edge. Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc and Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen duelled hard for third place, with Red Bull\u2019s Pierre Gasly and Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel also occasionally in the mix. Verstappen had his pace, Leclerc had his craft, and it was those two up against each other, lap after lap, offering fans a battle for the ages. Even in the pits, they came in together on lap 13 and exited side by side, the Red Bull nosing ahead. Vettel running into the back of Verstappen gave Leclerc the opening he needed to win back third place. \u201cIt is the race I enjoyed most in my F1 career,\u201d Leclerc said. Hamilton walked away from Silverstone with his sixth victory at the track and well ahead of his competition on the world championship leaderboard. He was humble in victory, thanking his fans and exalting the support of his home grand prix. The support came out in droves but is not without its detractors, as is evident any time the five-times world champion dares to falter. When a question referencing the double standards levelled against Hamilton compared to other drivers over his national identity provoked defensiveness from fans and pundits alike, the underlying current of discomfort was laid bare. Silverstone is as British as it gets, and with that comes reflections of the anxieties the country is grappling with across the board. Sport is ultimately a reflection of its society, rather than an escape from it. F1 is no exception, no matter how fast they drive.",

      "body": "<p>The American psychologist Francine Shapiro, who has died aged 71, devised the form of therapy known as eye movement desensitisation reprocessing (EMDR). Having started out as an English teacher, she summed up her life\u2019s work with William Blake\u2019s line: \u201cFor the eye altering alters all.\u201d</p> <p>EMDR, which involves making rapid eye movements to stimulate the brain, assists people in processing traumatic memories. It has helped millions worldwide, including many with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Shapiro overcame opposition to make it a mainstream therapy, after its efficacy had been demonstrated in more than 40 randomised controlled trials. It is now practised in around 30 countries and endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), the NHS and many other bodies.</p> <p>While working in New York in the late 1970s, Shapiro was diagnosed with breast cancer. After recovering, she sold her possessions and crossed the country in a camper van.</p> <p>Once she reached California, she settled in the tiny rural community of Sea Ranch, on the coast north of San Francisco. A succession of jobs led to her teaching a course in communication at <a href=\"http://www.sjsu.edu/\" title=\"\">San Jos\u00e9 State University</a>.</p> <p>She had become interested in health, especially in the interaction between mind and body, and on a walk in May 1987 noticed her eyes moving rapidly from side to side, while at the same time disturbing thoughts in her head became less intrusive. She said: \u201cThe thoughts weren\u2019t as bothersome.

      "bodyText": "The American psychologist Francine Shapiro, who has died aged 71, devised the form of therapy known as eye movement desensitisation reprocessing (EMDR). Having started out as an English teacher, she summed up her life\u2019s work with William Blake\u2019s line: \u201cFor the eye altering alters all.\u201d EMDR, which involves making rapid eye movements to stimulate the brain, assists people in processing traumatic memories. It has helped millions worldwide, including many with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Shapiro overcame opposition to make it a mainstream therapy, after its efficacy had been demonstrated in more than 40 randomised controlled trials. It is now practised in around 30 countries and endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), the NHS and many other bodies. While working in New York in the late 1970s, Shapiro was diagnosed with breast cancer. After recovering, she sold her possessions and crossed the country in a camper van. Once she reached California, she settled in the tiny rural community of Sea Ranch, on the coast north of San Francisco. A succession of jobs led to her teaching a course in communication at San Jos\u00e9 State University. She had become interested in health, especially in the interaction between mind and body, and on a walk in May 1987 noticed her eyes moving rapidly from side to side, while at the same time disturbing thoughts in her head became less intrusive. She said: \u201cThe thoughts weren\u2019t as bothersome. I wanted to see if it would work if it was deliberate, so I brought up something that bothered me, moved my eyes in the same way and saw the same thing happening.\u201d The eye movements\u2019 effect became the subject of a PhD undertaken at the Californian School of Professional Psychology, San Diego, and Shapiro found that it was just as therapeutic for Vietnam veterans plagued with traumatic memories. Speaking about one man, she said: \u201cThe memory had haunted him for 20 years. Seeing it disappear was just wonderful.\u201d Shapiro structured her therapy into a rigorous eight-phase programme that could be taught to others. In 1988, concerned about the effects of 40 years\u2019 war on people\u2019s mental health, she moved to Israel and gave workshops, as she also did in the US. Later that year she gained her PhD, and in 1989 published a study in the Journal of Traumatic Stress. The EMDR \u201cbible\u201d \u2013 Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing: Basic Principles, Protocols and Procedures \u2013 followed in 1995. That year, too, she received a phone call asking for help in the aftermath of the Oklahoma bombing, which killed 168 people and traumatised thousands more. The result was the EMDR Humanitarian Assistance Program. There are now over 60 \u201ctrauma recovery networks\u201d with practitioners offering free EMDR to people affected by disasters. Early on, Shapiro was mortified to learn that someone had been harmed by EMDR administered by a hypnotist with no training in the therapy. She insisted that, to be accredited, practitioners had to take part in an approved workshop rather than learning it informally from other people or from an article. It was also important for research purposes that practitioners followed standard protocols. However, her insistence on proper training led to accusations of profiteering.

How would you do it?\u2019,\u201d says Helen. \u201cIt was on the second date that it started to be a bit more: \u2018Why shouldn\u2019t we do it?\u2019 We weren\u2019t happy with our jobs, and we had no responsibilities to hold us back.\u201d</p> <p>After four weeks they were a couple, and after five months they moved in together, mainly to save money. They sold everything worth selling, and stopped spending. Mike was working long hours as a trainee solicitor, but took an evening job in a restaurant. Helen worked in a medical lab and transcribed medical notes in the evenings. In November 2016, Mike proposed, and in April 2017, they embarked on their round-the-world cycle ride.

Is she stressed? She\u2019s saying we can go on, but does she mean it?\u201d</p> <p>And they saw each other during extreme moments. Cycling across Australia \u2013 in 40C heat, into a headwind that meant they couldn\u2019t travel more than six miles an hour \u2013 was the most brutal time, physically and mentally. \u201cFor weeks on end, nothing changed,\u201d says Helen. \u201cWe both reacted very differently to release that stress.\u201d</p> <p>Helen cried every day; Mike tended to bottle up his emotions, but, after a minor disagreement, had a meltdown. \u201cIt\u2019s probably quite a rare thing to learn about a partner,\u201d says Helen. \u201cI guess not many people experience that kind of extreme to know how the other person would react.\u201d</p> <p>Moving on to the US, they cycled from San Diego to Yosemite national park, where they got married. \u201cI think by then we\u2019d done a year and about 12,000 miles,\u201d says Mike. \u201cWe were like: \u2018We\u2019ll be fine; we\u2019ll still love each other enough to get married.\u2019\u201d Their parents and a couple of friends flew out, then Mike and Helen carried on.

Tailster uses a network of 26,000 self-employed pet carers across the UK, which it connects with customers via an app that offers GPS tracking of dog walks, real time photos and free insurance. The UK\u2019s biggest pets retailer will offer Tailster\u2019s services to its 4.4 million loyalty scheme members as part of its aim to fight off competition from online competitors, including Amazon, by generating half its revenues from services, up from about a third today. The market is growing fast as the under-40s splash cash on pets, which they increasingly see as family members. Pets at Home shares have recovered in recent months as trading improved after profits took a hit from a restructuring of its vets business.

      "body": "<p>The first pair of Democratic presidential primary debates showed how wide open the field is. Former vice-president Joe Biden came in with a comfortable lead, but stumbled during the debates and has <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/democratic-debate-poll/\">dropped in the polls since.</a></p> <p>California senator Kamala Harris emerged the victor after the debate, confronting Biden on his past chummy relations with segregationist senators and vehement opposition to busing policies meant to integrate public schools. According to<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/02/kamala-harris-iowa-polls-2020-election-1394937\"> one poll, </a>she\u2019s now within two points of him.</p> <p>Joe Biden had a couple things going for him: he was connected to a popular Obama administration and he is still widely perceived as being electable. For stalwart Democratic voters, preventing a second term for Trump and an ever-rightward moving Republican party is a key priority.</p> <p>Biden might have stood out with his relatively conservative stances on healthcare, the environment, financial regulations and other issues that the Democratic base cared about \u2013 but at least he seemed like a safe bet to take on Trump. But now with the former vice-president crumbling under debate pressure and committing a seemingly endless string of gaffes, his electability may now be in question.</p> <p>The Biden team is constantly talking about \u201cObama-Biden\u201d accomplishments, trying to inexorably tie him to the first black president\u2019s legacy, but the more people find out about his own record, the more they\u2019re turned off by it. The same will be true of Kamala Harris, a candidate who says all the right things on the debate stage, is surging in the polls, but will soon find out that positive attention may soon turn into negative scrutiny.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Harris is talking about financial industry abuses, but she\u2019s doing fundraisers with a Wells Fargo executive</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Harris is talking about financial industry abuses, but she\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-wells-fargo-miguel-bustos_n_5d1545fde4b07f6ca57ab47e\">doing fundraisers </a>with a Wells Fargo executive. Though often glibly compared to Obama, Harris\u2019s policy triangulations, donor-base ties, and questionable political past are all reminiscent of Hillary Clinton. Take her stance on what was once seemingly her strongest policy stances. Harris was an initial endorser of Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2017 healthcare bill, which would have set up a Medicare for All, single-payer system. Such a plan would get rid of private insurance middlemen, and improve health outcomes and efficiency across the country. \u201cLet\u2019s eliminate all of that. Let\u2019s move on,\u201d she said at a January town hall.</p> <p>Discussing her mother\u2019s battle with colon cancer, Harris <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/opinion/sunday/kamala-harris-affordable-care-act-medicare.html\">declared</a> that \u201chealthcare should be a right.\u201d</p> <p>When candidates were asked during the debate whether they would \u201cabolish private insurance in favor of a government-run plan\u201d, she joined Bernie Sanders in raising her hand. That\u2019s all fine and good, a brave stance that could have been followed up with an explanation telling millions of curious Americans that they can still keep seeing their regular doctors, only in our future universal healthcare system they no longer will have to deal with insurance companies and the accompanying hefty deductible and premium payments.</p> <p>Instead, she beat a hasty retreat. The morning after the debate, she said she had misunderstood the question and certainly believed the private insurance would continue to play a role providing supplementary coverage. In other words, she would keep around the same companies responsible for our failed healthcare system and allow them to rally their forces to undermine a Medicare for All plan. (<a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2019/07/02/majority-backs-medicare-for-all-replacing-private-plans-if-preferred-providers-stay/\">Most Americans </a>favor getting rid of private insurance, when told they can keep their doctors.)</p> <p>It\u2019s no wonder that likely Democratic voters see Bernie Sanders as the best candidate to handle health policy \u2013 agree or disagree, he\u2019s consistent, and has been standing firm for single-payer as others vacillate. Why trust newcomers to progressive stances over someone who has been saying the same thing for decades?</p> <p>Part of Harris\u2019s dilemma must stem from the fact that she sees that her party\u2019s voters are moving leftward, and sees Biden\u2019s centrist vulnerabilities, but is at the same time reliant on far-from-progressive campaign donors. A <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/16/us/politics/2020-democratic-donors-wall-street.html?module=inline\">recent</a> New York Times headline captures the situation well: \u201cWall Street Donors Are Swooning for Mayor Pete. (And They Like Biden and Harris, Too.)\u201d</p> <p>Harris is talking about financial industry abuses, but she\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-wells-fargo-miguel-bustos_n_5d1545fde4b07f6ca57ab47e\">doing fundraisers </a>with a Wells Fargo executive, Miguel Bustos, implicated in the company\u2019s fake accounts scandal. When it comes time to take on big banking interests, is it unreasonable to assume that she\u2019ll be less willing to challenge the sector than, say, Senator Warren?</p> <p>And let\u2019s not forget about racial justice, an issue Harris expertly used to contest Biden\u2019s record. But what will happen when people start to pay closer attention to her history as California attorney general. Harris can talk about her past as a young black girl who personally benefited from school integration. But what about the young black people she sent to prison for drug violations? What about the poor mothers trying to get by in a society that gives them no support that <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/08/kamala-harris-trump-obama-california-attorney-general\">Harris threatened to jail and fine </a>if their kids didn\u2019t show up on time to school?</p> <p>Some political evolutions are genuine, and Harris\u2019s \u201claw-and-order\u201d past wasn\u2019t out of place in the Democratic party at the time. But that old wisdom is now being called into question. It\u2019s hard to imagine that a party tacking to the left in an increasingly polarized country is about to elect a criminal prosecutor as its nominee.</p> <p>For now, Sanders is still among the frontrunners but has some ground to make up.

      "bodyText": "The first pair of Democratic presidential primary debates showed how wide open the field is. Former vice-president Joe Biden came in with a comfortable lead, but stumbled during the debates and has dropped in the polls since. California senator Kamala Harris emerged the victor after the debate, confronting Biden on his past chummy relations with segregationist senators and vehement opposition to busing policies meant to integrate public schools. According to one poll, she\u2019s now within two points of him. Joe Biden had a couple things going for him: he was connected to a popular Obama administration and he is still widely perceived as being electable. For stalwart Democratic voters, preventing a second term for Trump and an ever-rightward moving Republican party is a key priority. Biden might have stood out with his relatively conservative stances on healthcare, the environment, financial regulations and other issues that the Democratic base cared about \u2013 but at least he seemed like a safe bet to take on Trump. But now with the former vice-president crumbling under debate pressure and committing a seemingly endless string of gaffes, his electability may now be in question. The Biden team is constantly talking about \u201cObama-Biden\u201d accomplishments, trying to inexorably tie him to the first black president\u2019s legacy, but the more people find out about his own record, the more they\u2019re turned off by it. The same will be true of Kamala Harris, a candidate who says all the right things on the debate stage, is surging in the polls, but will soon find out that positive attention may soon turn into negative scrutiny. Harris is talking about financial industry abuses, but she\u2019s doing fundraisers with a Wells Fargo executive. Though often glibly compared to Obama, Harris\u2019s policy triangulations, donor-base ties, and questionable political past are all reminiscent of Hillary Clinton. Take her stance on what was once seemingly her strongest policy stances. Harris was an initial endorser of Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2017 healthcare bill, which would have set up a Medicare for All, single-payer system. Such a plan would get rid of private insurance middlemen, and improve health outcomes and efficiency across the country. \u201cLet\u2019s eliminate all of that. Let\u2019s move on,\u201d she said at a January town hall. Discussing her mother\u2019s battle with colon cancer, Harris declared that \u201chealthcare should be a right.\u201d When candidates were asked during the debate whether they would \u201cabolish private insurance in favor of a government-run plan\u201d, she joined Bernie Sanders in raising her hand. That\u2019s all fine and good, a brave stance that could have been followed up with an explanation telling millions of curious Americans that they can still keep seeing their regular doctors, only in our future universal healthcare system they no longer will have to deal with insurance companies and the accompanying hefty deductible and premium payments. Instead, she beat a hasty retreat. The morning after the debate, she said she had misunderstood the question and certainly believed the private insurance would continue to play a role providing supplementary coverage. In other words, she would keep around the same companies responsible for our failed healthcare system and allow them to rally their forces to undermine a Medicare for All plan. (Most Americans favor getting rid of private insurance, when told they can keep their doctors.) It\u2019s no wonder that likely Democratic voters see Bernie Sanders as the best candidate to handle health policy \u2013 agree or disagree, he\u2019s consistent, and has been standing firm for single-payer as others vacillate. Why trust newcomers to progressive stances over someone who has been saying the same thing for decades? Part of Harris\u2019s dilemma must stem from the fact that she sees that her party\u2019s voters are moving leftward, and sees Biden\u2019s centrist vulnerabilities, but is at the same time reliant on far-from-progressive campaign donors. A recent New York Times headline captures the situation well: \u201cWall Street Donors Are Swooning for Mayor Pete. (And They Like Biden and Harris, Too.)\u201d Harris is talking about financial industry abuses, but she\u2019s doing fundraisers with a Wells Fargo executive, Miguel Bustos, implicated in the company\u2019s fake accounts scandal. When it comes time to take on big banking interests, is it unreasonable to assume that she\u2019ll be less willing to challenge the sector than, say, Senator Warren? And let\u2019s not forget about racial justice, an issue Harris expertly used to contest Biden\u2019s record. But what will happen when people start to pay closer attention to her history as California attorney general. Harris can talk about her past as a young black girl who personally benefited from school integration. But what about the young black people she sent to prison for drug violations? What about the poor mothers trying to get by in a society that gives them no support that Harris threatened to jail and fine if their kids didn\u2019t show up on time to school? Some political evolutions are genuine, and Harris\u2019s \u201claw-and-order\u201d past wasn\u2019t out of place in the Democratic party at the time. But that old wisdom is now being called into question. It\u2019s hard to imagine that a party tacking to the left in an increasingly polarized country is about to elect a criminal prosecutor as its nominee. For now, Sanders is still among the frontrunners but has some ground to make up. His debate performance was mediocre, and he needs to appeal better to older voters still in the Biden camp. But by having a record that matches his rhetoric and by avoiding monied interests, he\u2019s showing that campaigns can be run on a very different basis than Harris is running hers. Bernie Sanders raised $24m in the second quarter of 2019. The workers that donated to him the most were teachers. His largest sum came from Walmart workers. That shouldn\u2019t be a surprise \u2013 when other candidates were holding lavish fundraisers, Sanders was raising hell at a Walmart shareholder meeting, denouncing the Walton family\u2019s greed and calling for the company to pay a living wage to its employees. That\u2019s how you break from a stale establishment consensus. That\u2019s how you actually show Americans that you\u2019re different and that you care. That\u2019s the type of angry and earnest politics that can beat President Trump. Kamala Harris isn\u2019t just not leftwing enough to be the Democratic party\u2019s nominee, she\u2019s also not bold enough to win a presidential election and bring about the change we desperately need.

WHO Europe is calling for a crackdown on the high levels of sugar in the diet of babies fed on commercially available foods, warning that their first teeth may suffer and they are at risk of developing a preference for sweet foods, which may lead to overweight and obesity-related disease in adulthood. It also says sugar-laden baby foods are being inappropriately marketed for babies under the age of six months, even though the WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding up to that age.

      "body": "<p>Look, I get it. The headlines wrote themselves last week as more Change UK debris <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/heidi-allen-launches-remain-alliance-oppose-brexit\" title=\"\">reformed as the Independents</a>. Which faction was definitely, absolutely, fighting on as a party, and which bit was refusing to establish one? Was this the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/12/monty-pythons-life-of-brian-review\" title=\"\">Peoples\u2019 Front of Judea</a>, or the Judean Peoples\u2019 Front? Who got custody of Sarah Wollaston?</p> <p>It feels like some time ago, but for one short period back in the spring, it looked as though the formation of the Independent Group might just catalyse the unravelling of both parties of government. As one of the key instigators of the plan, I can tell you there was only one real metric of success that first week: could we get to the end of it without becoming a punchline? That we pulled that off was a testament to the desire of millions of people, feeling as politically homeless as the MPs that jumped, for something hopeful.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After last week\u2019s revelations, you know everything you now need to about your leader</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We all know what happened next. The formation of the political party, Change UK, and its subsequent rather small and imperfectly formed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/04/change-uk-poised-to-lose-at-least-half-its-mps-heidi-allen-chuka-umunna-lib-dems\" title=\"\">electoral showing</a> meant that moment passed almost as soon as it came.</p> <p>But take a step back and honestly assess the bigger picture: huge political forces, surging through a parliament that cannot meet the enormity of the challenge it faces, are still present. A Labour leadership that is incapable of dealing with antisemitism, propped up by MPs who hope the British public will do what they will not, and prevent them from getting into No 10. A Tory party that will select a prime minister who will tank their reputation for economic competence in a bid to deliver Brexit. The fracturing of electoral coalitions, ages old, which has led to four parties (including one that did not exist even six months ago) bobbing around in the polling doldrums at around 20% each.</p> <p>Nothing can be done, the moderately minded MPs of both legacy parties say, look at what Change UK did and take heed. Our failure is used as the proof point that something new can\u2019t emerge. And yet: in many respects, the case for a proper realignment is stronger than when we left our parties.</p> <p>I shoulder my share of the blame for soiling the pitch. To rush to establish a political party, as just 11 MPs, was an act of hubris. That logo! The <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39907963\" title=\"\">bus</a>! We took the kicking that we deserved, especially when our desire to stand in the EU elections seemed destined to split the remain vote. But to use our (predictably) poor showing as an excuse for inaction, is surely the most cynical response of all.</p> <p>We were never going to be able to provide a compelling, centre-ground, future-focused electoral offer on our own. The act of leaving our parties was the beginning of something, not an end in itself. But others still need to face up to their own dilemma in representing parties they believe are unfit for office.</p> <p>So \u2013 to the real point of this missive. To my former Labour colleagues (for the Tories\u2019 moment of reckoning will come in the autumn) let me say this: Don\u2019t let Change UK put you off from acting.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/labour-bosses-accused-of-undermining-fight-against-antisemitism-bbc-panorama\" title=\"\">last week\u2019s revelations</a>, you know everything you now need to about your leader. He isn\u2019t going to change: the shutting down of democratic processes and debate; his instincts on national security; the vacuum of leadership on Brexit; the stain of anti-Jewish racism in the party and his lack of interest in getting a grip. Truthfully, all this was visible the last time you <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36647458\" title=\"\">passed a vote of no confidence</a> in his leadership by a margin of four-to-one.</p> <p>Only two things have changed: his grip on the machinery of the party (insurmountably tighter) and his proximity to Downing Street (undeniably closer). The final foxhole that the moderate Labour MP will sink themselves into is \u201che\u2019s unelectable, so it doesn\u2019t matter\u201d. Even if this were the case, it should matter. But I think that assessment is also catastrophically wrong. This was the prevailing wisdom last time around, before Labour went on to gain seats and deny the Tories a majority.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/14/end-the-antisemitism-soap-opera-emily-thornberry-tells-labour\">End the antisemitism soap opera, Emily Thornberry tells Labour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If all you can come up with is stay and fight, you\u2019re actually going to need to do both.

Today\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/29/how-does-labour-appoint-a-leader\" title=\"\">threshold</a> is 52 MPs and MEPs, and the window for a challenge is closing.

      "bodyText": "Look, I get it. The headlines wrote themselves last week as more Change UK debris reformed as the Independents. Which faction was definitely, absolutely, fighting on as a party, and which bit was refusing to establish one? Was this the Peoples\u2019 Front of Judea, or the Judean Peoples\u2019 Front? Who got custody of Sarah Wollaston? It feels like some time ago, but for one short period back in the spring, it looked as though the formation of the Independent Group might just catalyse the unravelling of both parties of government. As one of the key instigators of the plan, I can tell you there was only one real metric of success that first week: could we get to the end of it without becoming a punchline? That we pulled that off was a testament to the desire of millions of people, feeling as politically homeless as the MPs that jumped, for something hopeful. We all know what happened next. The formation of the political party, Change UK, and its subsequent rather small and imperfectly formed electoral showing meant that moment passed almost as soon as it came. But take a step back and honestly assess the bigger picture: huge political forces, surging through a parliament that cannot meet the enormity of the challenge it faces, are still present. A Labour leadership that is incapable of dealing with antisemitism, propped up by MPs who hope the British public will do what they will not, and prevent them from getting into No 10. A Tory party that will select a prime minister who will tank their reputation for economic competence in a bid to deliver Brexit. The fracturing of electoral coalitions, ages old, which has led to four parties (including one that did not exist even six months ago) bobbing around in the polling doldrums at around 20% each. Nothing can be done, the moderately minded MPs of both legacy parties say, look at what Change UK did and take heed. Our failure is used as the proof point that something new can\u2019t emerge. And yet: in many respects, the case for a proper realignment is stronger than when we left our parties. I shoulder my share of the blame for soiling the pitch. To rush to establish a political party, as just 11 MPs, was an act of hubris. That logo! The bus! We took the kicking that we deserved, especially when our desire to stand in the EU elections seemed destined to split the remain vote. But to use our (predictably) poor showing as an excuse for inaction, is surely the most cynical response of all. We were never going to be able to provide a compelling, centre-ground, future-focused electoral offer on our own. The act of leaving our parties was the beginning of something, not an end in itself. But others still need to face up to their own dilemma in representing parties they believe are unfit for office. So \u2013 to the real point of this missive. To my former Labour colleagues (for the Tories\u2019 moment of reckoning will come in the autumn) let me say this: Don\u2019t let Change UK put you off from acting. After last week\u2019s revelations, you know everything you now need to about your leader. He isn\u2019t going to change: the shutting down of democratic processes and debate; his instincts on national security; the vacuum of leadership on Brexit; the stain of anti-Jewish racism in the party and his lack of interest in getting a grip. Truthfully, all this was visible the last time you passed a vote of no confidence in his leadership by a margin of four-to-one. Only two things have changed: his grip on the machinery of the party (insurmountably tighter) and his proximity to Downing Street (undeniably closer). The final foxhole that the moderate Labour MP will sink themselves into is \u201che\u2019s unelectable, so it doesn\u2019t matter\u201d. Even if this were the case, it should matter. But I think that assessment is also catastrophically wrong. This was the prevailing wisdom last time around, before Labour went on to gain seats and deny the Tories a majority. If all you can come up with is stay and fight, you\u2019re actually going to need to do both. In 2016, the Parliamentary Labour party delivered 172 votes to challenge Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. Today\u2019s threshold is 52 MPs and MEPs, and the window for a challenge is closing. If you don\u2019t act now, you will be heading for a speculative autumn election, and campaigning to make a man you believe is unfit to lead your party the leader of our country. There are just 10 days to go before parliament slumps into its long summer \u2013 if you can get one in five of your colleagues to support a challenge to the leader of the opposition, you must act now. And if you can\u2019t clear even that low bar, then at least be honest with yourself \u2013 the fight is lost. All you\u2019re doing is staying and propping him up. History is not just shaped by action, but by inaction as well. \u2022 Gavin Shuker is the MP for Luton South and a member of the Independents \u2022 This article was amended on 15 July 2019 to clarify that the writer is arguing that antisemitism is an issue in the Labour party rather than the Labour leadership",

In leaked letters to the leaders of two of the EU parliament\u2019s main political groups, Ursula von der Leyen, who was nominated two weeks ago by the heads of state and government for the top EU post, has sought to win over critical left-leaning MEPs at the risk of alienating some on the right. The German defence minister\u2019s candidacy is facing opposition from the Social Democrats (SPD) in her own country, the greens and the hard left, among others, in the vote on Tuesday evening in which she needs to secure an absolute majority to become the first ever female commission president. Some are opposed to Von der Leyen on the grounds that she is not one of the spitzenkandidaten, or lead candidates, who campaigned ahead of May\u2019s European elections to head up the EU\u2019s executive branch. Her patchy record as a defence minister has also been raised by the SPD in a dossier circulated among MEPs as a reason why Von der Leyen is \u201can inadequate and unsuitable candidate\u201d to lead the commission for the next five years. Von der Leyen, a close ally of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who has the backing of the centre-right European People\u2019s party, will make a speech to the European parliament on Tuesday morning before MEPs cast their vote in the early evening but it is far from clear that she will be able to secure the backing of the 374 parliamentarians needed for her to take the post from 1 November.

Von der Leyen\u2019s selection, after 50 hours of negotiations among the 28 leaders, was just one part of a package in which candidates were also chosen as presidents of the European council and European Central Bank, in which political affiliation, geography and gender had to be balanced. Sources said an emergency summit for 23 July was being planned in case of her rejection. If Von der Leyen passed the 374 threshold but failed to receive the backing of 400 MEPs there would be questions over her ability to lead the EU\u2019s policy agenda given the fragility of her majority. In letters to the Socialists and Democrats and the liberal group, Renew Europe, sent on Monday and obtained by the Guardian, Von der Leyen has pledged to give parliament a role in initiating legislation and says she will push forward on stalled progressive policies on climate change, wages and gender equality. She has committed to setting \u201cquotas on gender balance on company boards\u201d, a policy first proposed by the commission in 2012, and to establishing a \u201clegal instrument to ensure that every worker in our union has a fair minimum wage that allows them a decent living in the country they work in\u201d. On climate change, Von der Leyen has said the EU needs to be more ambitious on its 2030 target to cut emissions within the bloc by at least 40% compared with 1990 levels, by raising the aim to at least 50% and providing a plan for a 55% cut. She has backed the proposal from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for a \u201ccarbon border tax\u201d which would hit companies that want to trade in the EU but are based in countries that do not live up to the bloc\u2019s environmental standards. Von der Leyen, 60, who has previously spoken of her support for the idea of a \u201cUnited States of Europe\u201d, has also called for greater burden sharing when it comes to immigration, in a thinly veiled criticism of the failure of some central and eastern European states to take in asylum seekers. On Brexit she insists that the current withdrawal agreement \u2013 described as \u201cdefunct\u201d by the likely next UK prime minister, Boris Johnson \u2013 is the \u201cbest and only deal possible for an orderly withdrawal\u201d. On an extension of the UK\u2019s membership beyond 31 October, she says she would be in support \u201cif good reasons are provided\u201d. Von der Leyen says in her letters that she hopes the \u201csnapshot\u201d on her positions, some of which are retreads of previous proposals from the commission, will reassure her critics, although there is a risk of putting off MEPs within the more Eurosceptic and rightwing European Conservatives and Reformists group, in which Poland\u2019s Law and Justice is the largest party. Portugal\u2019s socialist prime minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa tweeted that Von der Leyen\u2019s letter contained sufficient reassurance for left-wing MEPs to give her their support, describing them as \u201cpositive commitments\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Human nature hates a balance. It craves a victor and a vanquished. In yesterday\u2019s Cricket World Cup final, not a wafer separated the England and New Zealand teams. They tied. The sporting solution would be for both captains to admit the fact and shake hands. But the money, the chauvinism, the howls from the gallery, were more powerful. Kipling\u2019s \u201ctwin imposters\u201d, triumph and disaster, had to be set on a pedestal and honoured with what amounted to a coin toss, the \u201cmost boundaries\u201d rule. Cue mass hysteria in England and mass misery in New Zealand. Cricket had gone the way of football\u2019s penalty shootouts. There is no denying that even the mildest patriot feels pride in victory for the home team \u2013 or in the case of cricket endearingly for the game\u2019s \u201ccountry of origin\u201d. The chase is exciting and success goes deep into group identity. It is briefly and harmlessly heart-warming. It is curiously less an issue when the victor is not a team but an individual, as in Lewis Hamilton\u2019s F1 British Grand Prix triumph also at the weekend, or when Novac Djokovic beats Roger Federer in another epic encounter at Wimbledon \u2013 which perhaps also should have been an honourable tie. In all these cases, we can thank sport for taking our minds off troubled times and driving politics from the front page. George Orwell worried at the role of team sports in the national psyche.

Rather than travel from from A to B, as many as one in eight \u201cdrivers\u201d are using their rental cars to grab forty winks, catch up on work or even brush up their language skills, according to industry surveys. The unusual habits came to light after Orix Auto found a number of its 230,000 registered users were not driving their rented vehicles, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported. Other rental firms noticed similar anomalies in their customers\u2019 mileage records and approached them hoping to get to the bottom of the mystery. Times24, which has more than 1.2 million registered users, found some clients napped, worked or even used their rented vehicles as storage space for personal belongings when nearby regular lockers were full. The Asahi quoted one respondent, a company worker in his early 30s, as saying: \u201cI rented a car to eat a boxed meal that I bought at a convenience store because I couldn\u2019t find anywhere else to have lunch.\u201d The newspaper cited the ease with which cars could be reserved online, noting that Times24 cars cost as little as 400 yen (\u00a32.95) for half an hour and were available for collection from more than 12,000 locations across Japan. NTT Docomo, which operates a similar service, found in a 2018 survey of 400 customers that one in eight did not rent cars to drive, with most of the non-motoring respondents saying they used them to sleep in or to talk on the phone to family, friends and business clients. Some preferred to take advantage of the peace and quiet to watch TV or practise their singing or spoken English. \u201cCars can be used as a private space,\u201d a Docomo official told the Asahi. \u201cPeople used our vehicles in more ways than we expected.\u201d Orix appeared to disapprove of people using its vehicles for anything other than driving, and reminded customers of the environmental harm caused by leaving engines running to power the air conditioning or heating while they snoozed or sang karaoke. \u201cMotorists should shut off their engines when they\u2019re not driving, and we do not recommend that our customers rent vehicles for purposes other than traveling,\u201d an Orix official said, according to the newspaper. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s best for our cars to be used for driving.\u201d Orix Auto is one of several companies that allow registered users to reserve cars online and unlock their chosen vehicle with a prepaid card.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of demonstrators have called on Israel\u2019s new education minister to resign after the far-right politician said he supported gay conversion \u201ctherapy\u201d and had even attempted it himself. Ministers and other politicians also condemned Rafi Peretz, a former chief military rabbi who heads a religious nationalist party, who was asked by local Channel 12 news over the weekend whether he believed he could convert gay people to heterosexuality. \u201cI think you can,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you that I have a deep knowledge of education, and I have done it too.\u201d He said he had once worked with a student who had told him he was gay, whom he had tried to help \u201cunderstand himself well and then decide on his own\u201d. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he had spoken to Peretz, \u201cwho clarified his remarks and stressed the Israeli education system will continue to accept all of Israel\u2019s children as they are\u201d. \u201cThe education minister\u2019s remarks about the gay community are not acceptable and do not reflect the stance of the government I head,\u201d he said in a statement. The justice minister, Amir Ohana, the country\u2019s first gay cabinet member, said: \u201cSexual orientation does not require therapy nor conversion. Preconceived notions and ignorance require therapy and conversion.\u201d Following the outcry, Peretz later said his words had been distorted. \u201cI did not say I support conversion therapy,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. So-called conversion therapy has been widely discredited as unscientific and damaging. One recent survey found attempts to change someone\u2019s sexual orientation led to high levels of mental health problems including suicide attempts, self-harm and eating disorders. Stringent anti-discrimination laws protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in Israel, and hard-fought efforts for equality mean gay people can serve openly in the military and have adoption rights. Tel Aviv, where hundreds demonstrated against Peretz after his remarks were broadcast, boasts a global reputation as a gay-friendly travel destination and holds a popular annual Pride parade. LGBT activists, however, warn against complacency when same-sex marriage remains illegal, and homophobia and transphobia are widespread, especially in sections of the country\u2019s conservative Jewish and Muslim communities. Netanyahu has publicly promoted LGBT rights while at the same time forging alliances with intolerant political factions. Last year he voted against surrogacy for gay fathers, a proposed law that had angered his ultra-Orthodox allies. The prime minister brought Peretz\u2019s Union of Right Wing Parties into his coalition after 9 April elections in an effort to form a majority government. The attempt ultimately failed, and a second round of voting is due in September. Peretz, popular with Israeli settlers, has also been accused of anti-Arab racism and in the same interview called for Israel to annex the occupied West Bank but deny Palestinians the right to vote. He caused a separate outrage this month over reported comments in which he compared intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews to a second Holocaust. Demonstrators at the Tel Aviv protest carried signs calling him a \u201chomophobic racist\u201d. Agence France-Presse contributed to this report",

The Squad responds to Trump: \u2018This is what racism looks like\u2019 The four progressive Democratic congresswomen known as \u201cthe Squad\u201d have responded to a racist attack by Donald Trump, who told the group on Twitter on Sunday to \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came\u201d. Trump claimed they \u201coriginally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe\u201d. In fact, Ilhan Omar is the only one of the four who was born abroad. Ayanna Pressley, the African-American representative from Massachusetts, who was born in Cincinnati, said: \u201cThis is what racism looks like.\u201d Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, who was born in Detroit to Palestinian immigrants, said Trump \u201cneeds to be impeached\u201d. Team sheet. The other two members of \u201cthe Squad\u201d are New York\u2019s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who was born not far from Trump in New York City and comes from a Puerto Rican family, and Omar, who was born in Somalia and arrived in the US aged nine. Immigration raids. Trump claimed on Sunday that the Texas migrant detention centre visited by the vice-president, Mike Pence, last week was \u201cclean but crowded\u201d, as planned immigration raids caused fear and protests across the US. Beto says he is \u2018beneficiary\u2019 of family\u2019s slaveholder past As he campaigns for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Beto O\u2019Rourke has stated clearly that America\u2019s legacy of slavery must be \u201crepaired \u2026 through telling, learning and sharing\u201d.

Lawyers for the financier and sex offender say home detention, electronic monitoring and the bond on his $77m New York mansion would prevent him leaving the country, but prosecutors have said Epstein is prepared to flee and that he has funnelled hundreds of thousands of dollars to potential witnesses in what federal prosecutors say is an attempt to influence them. Hark the Herald. After the 2008 plea deal that Epstein struck with Alex Acosta in Florida, the US media largely whitewashed his story \u2013 with a single, honourable exception: the Miami Herald. Activists plan Prime Day protests and Amazon boycott Monday is Amazon\u2019s annual Prime Day, the e-commerce behemoth\u2019s arbitrary annual sale, which last year made the company more than $4bn. However, the date is also a rallying point for activists, immigrants and Amazon employees, who have promoted a boycott and planned demonstrations against the firm in at least seven US cities to protest against its working conditions and the use of its technology to facilitate the Trump administration\u2019s deportation policy. Swiftian nightmare. Part of the Prime Day \u201ccelebrations\u201d was a concert broadcast on Amazon\u2019s streaming service featuring artists such as Taylor Swift and Dua Lipa. \u201cIf you want a vision of the future, imagine Taylor Swift in a tasselled rainbow stiletto, stamping on a human face \u2013 for ever,\u201d writes Joel Golby. Crib sheet Tropical Storm Barry only briefly achieved hurricane status as it reached the Gulf Coast states on Saturday, sparing New Orleans the worst but causing floods and power outages elsewhere in the region. The killings of up to 30 women and children in retaliatory tribal violence in Papua New Guinea\u2019s rural highlands constitute the \u201cworst payback killing\u201d in the country\u2019s history, its police minister has said. A plane carrying parachutists in northern Sweden crashed on Storsandsk\u00e4r island shortly after takeoff on Sunday, killing all nine people onboard. Witnesses reportedly saw some skydivers attempting to jump from the plane before the impact. While Daniel Craig will return as James Bond for the 25th film in the franchise, it has been reported that his 007 codename has been reassigned to a character played by the black British actor Lashana Lynch. Must-reads Can our cities survive the e-scooter scourge? They\u2019re cheaper than cabs, less effort than a bike and more convenient than the bus. But as the number of e-scooter accidents increases, a backlash against this tech-driven, eco-friendly transport option is growing, as James Tapper reports from Copenhagen. Assisted dying is on the rise \u2013 but where? The rates of euthanasia, assisted dying and assisted suicide are on the increase, with new countries and jurisdictions legalising the practice \u2013 including in the US. But what is the difference between the methods, and under what circumstances are they permitted? Nicola Davis explains. The real Boris Johnson The man most likely to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister once conspired to have a journalist beaten up, switched political parties solely to win an election and, as a young reporter, helped create a distorted view of the EU that his biographer, Sonia Purnell, says has dogged the UK\u2019s relationship with Europe ever since.

Opinion Trump\u2019s attacks on four American congresswomen suggest the only person in this story who has truly failed to integrate into American society is Trump himself, says Richard Wolffe. Trump is unfortunately correct when he says their government is \u201cthe worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all).\u201d Because it\u2019s his own government and it barely functions.

Meanwhile, the women\u2019s champion, Simona Halep, has her sights set on the 2020 Olympics. England won the Cricket World Cup on home turf on Sunday with a thrilling, photo-finish win over New Zealand at Lord\u2019s that observers have described as the greatest one-day game ever played.

      "bodyText": "Tensions in the Middle East could pose an existential threat unless the Iran nuclear deal is maintained, Jeremy Hunt will tell EU foreign ministers in his starkest warning since the regional crisis escalated two months ago. Arriving in Brussels on Monday, the UK foreign secretary said the agreement \u201cisn\u2019t dead yet\u201d, but warned that if Tehran acquired nuclear weapons, other countries in the region would too, leading to a \u201cvery toxic and dangerous situation\u201d. His intervention is part of a European effort to preserve the landmark deal, which was abandoned unilaterally by the US a year ago, leading to an accelerating reciprocal withdrawal by Iran. \u201cIran is still a good year away from developing a nuclear weapon,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cWe think there is still some closing but small window to keep the deal alive.\u201d He said the EU was prepared to launch \u201ca proper joint investigation\u201d into Iranian breaches of the deal, following Tehran\u2019s recent announcements that it would start enriching uranium beyond agreed limits. \u201cWhat we are looking for is to give Iran a way out of this so that they can get back into compliance with the nuclear deal,\u201d he said. The foreign secretary, who is trailing Boris Johnson in the race to become UK prime minister, downplayed a rift with the US over policy on Iran. Those differences were manifest in leaked cables of the outgoing British ambassador to Washington, Sir Kim Darroch, who wrote that the US president, Donald Trump, scuppered the deal to spite his predecessor, Barack Obama, in an act of \u201cdiplomatic vandalism\u201d. \u201cWe have different views as to how we keep the region denuclearised, but we have very open channels of communication on that,\u201d Hunt said. Hunt has tried to de-escalate the situation by saying an Iranian-owned oil tanker seized by the British off Gibraltar 10 days ago might be released if Tehran promised the ship\u2019s owners would abandon plans to unload its oil in Syria. The EU has imposed a ban on oil sales to Damascus. Hunt made the offer in a phone call with the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, on Saturday. But Zarif said afterwards that Iran should be entitled to sell oil to any country it wished, and claimed the UK seizure of the ship, Grace 1, was an act of piracy. Various Iranian government sources said the tanker was not bound for Syria, but Tehran is desperate for revenue from oil sales. Hunt is due to tell his European counterparts: \u201cThe Middle East is already one of the most unstable regions in the world, but if the different parties were armed with nuclear weapons, it would represent an existential threat to mankind. I will do everything in my power to prevent that from happening.\u201d France, Germany and the UK \u2013 the three European signatories to the nuclear deal \u2013 issued another joint statement ahead of the meeting urging Iran to come back into compliance. \u201cThe risks are such that it is necessary for all stakeholders to pause and consider the possible consequences of their actions,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe believe that the time has come to act responsibly and to look for ways to stop the escalation of tension and resume dialogue. \u201cWe are concerned by the risk that the nuclear deal further unravels under the strain of sanctions imposed by the United States and following Iran\u2019s decision to no longer implement several of the central provisions of the agreement.\u201d Iran first breached the nuclear deal by overstepping the agreed limits on its low enriched uranium stockpile and then by surpassing the level at which the uranium can be enriched. Neither step in itself puts Iran close to securing a nuclear bomb. The EU has yet to put the two Iranian decisions into the dispute mechanism of the joint comprehensive plan of action, as the nuclear deal signed in 2015 is known, but it must be close to doing so. In a repetition of Tehran\u2019s position, the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, said in a televised speech on Sunday: \u201cWe have always believed in talks \u2026 if they lift sanctions, end the imposed economic pressure and return to the deal.\u201d Zarif is due to visit New York this week for a meeting at the UN, even though a fortnight ago the US said it would be imposing sanctions on him personally, a threat Washington has so far not carried out. It is understood he has been granted a US visa to travel to New York. Zarif gave no hope of an early release for the British-Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, saying: \u201cThe arrest and trial of these individuals were based on completely legal procedures, and the British government is expected to respect the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\u201d",

By the time it landed back at No 10, Edward Heath was apparently \u201cunable to identify a sufficiently public spot \u2026 aesthetically suitable\u201d for the display, according to records seen by Desplat. The dust spent several years in a Downing Street cupboard, to be rediscovered by accident in 1979, during Margaret Thatcher\u2019s tenure. An offer of a loan to the Science Museum was declined in 1985, on the grounds that the museum had plenty of other moon rocks and \u201cit was not really a very exciting exhibit\u201d. American space success came after the Soviets had launched Sputnik 2 in November 1957, with the dog Laika, a stray Moscow mongrel, on board, though she died in orbit. In April 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first man to orbit around Earth, returning a hero. When Gagarin visited the UK in July 1961, while much of Germany was still under Soviet occupation, such was the rapturous UK welcome that the British ambassador to West Germany, Sir Christopher Steel, reported: \u201cThe average German finds it alarming that the British, who are supposed to be reserved and politically mature, should rave over a Bolshevik on a propaganda mission, even if he is a hero.\u201d The then prime minister, Harold Macmillan, noted: \u201cI think Sir C Steel might point out to the Germans that Gagarin\u2019s reception was nothing like that which the little dog would have got.\u201d",

A story conjured up by some twisted sadist laughing hysterically in a mirror-lined attic, first lining up hope then scattering it with despair before lacing it with farce. If you were a 10-year-old for that first men\u2019s World Cup in 1975, watching with a scorecard in one hand and a Tizer in another, you will be 54 now. In the intervening period five teams have lifted the trophy, with one of them winning five times \u2013 you know which. Another side had made the final three times but never won \u2013 until now. Oh yes.</p> <p>How we have suffered with them over the years, growing steadily saggier and more broken as they stumbled from competition to competition, morphing from comb-overs to highlighted dilettantes with beery bellies, from tortured souls to today\u2019s designer-bearded super athletes.</p> <p>In truth the World Cup became a kind of sitting jinx. Something best approached with existential despair and abandoned, shortly afterwards, in the same way. England would enter the tournament with natural optimism, sometimes on the back of a long tour, sometimes (Ian Botham) on the back of a panto run, with a team picked from musing on an envelope \u2013 all the while waiting to see what strange and brilliant inventions the rest of the world had been working on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the first few tournaments, fans could be forgiven some optimism; England were runners-up three times in the first five. But then bathos set in, in three of the next six, they fell out in the opening round.</p> <p>In 1975, in whites and over 60 overs, England managed three huge victories before being speared by Gary Gilmour in the semi-final. Four years later they got to the final and, after watching Viv Richards explode a century, Geoff Boycott and Mike Brearley carefully fashioned 129 in 38 overs.</p> <p>In 1983 they were pipped at the post in the semi-final again, this time by India on a slow boil. Then the World Cup went walkabout. In 1987 a promising final run chase crashed when Mike Gatting took that fateful fancy to Allan Border. In 1992, another final, against Pakistan. Derek Pringle still remembers two lbw shouts against Javed Miandad being turned down: \u201cAllah smile on me today,\u201d he told Pringle in the dressing-room afterwards, patting his leg.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-win-cricket-world-cup-and-for-once-the-nation-really-was-watching\">England win a World Cup \u2026\u00a0and for once the nation really was watching | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By 1996 a Sanath Jayasuriya-inspired Sri Lanka were easing past a plodding England in the quarter-finals.

      "bodyText": "Whoever chewed that umbrella handle watching the Demon Spofforth in 1882 was an amateur. Where were you when Jason Roy reviewed that lbw? What about when Joe Root swished at his second consecutive ball? Did you doubt Jos Buttler, figuring he had reached his zenith against Pakistan, suspect Ben Stokes was due a failure? What about when Trent Boult\u2019s heel touched the boundary markers? When England needed 15 off the last over \u2013 still doubting? What about after the six? The overthrow? Did you hear that Jofra Archer had never conceded 16 in a one-day international over? Did you laugh? Was doubt your friend until the very end? Congratulations you are a true-(baby)-blue England supporter. You are also a World Cup winner! It was an apt conclusion to England\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup story, from Stokes to Ian Blackwell. A story conjured up by some twisted sadist laughing hysterically in a mirror-lined attic, first lining up hope then scattering it with despair before lacing it with farce. If you were a 10-year-old for that first men\u2019s World Cup in 1975, watching with a scorecard in one hand and a Tizer in another, you will be 54 now. In the intervening period five teams have lifted the trophy, with one of them winning five times \u2013 you know which. Another side had made the final three times but never won \u2013 until now. Oh yes. How we have suffered with them over the years, growing steadily saggier and more broken as they stumbled from competition to competition, morphing from comb-overs to highlighted dilettantes with beery bellies, from tortured souls to today\u2019s designer-bearded super athletes. In truth the World Cup became a kind of sitting jinx. Something best approached with existential despair and abandoned, shortly afterwards, in the same way. England would enter the tournament with natural optimism, sometimes on the back of a long tour, sometimes (Ian Botham) on the back of a panto run, with a team picked from musing on an envelope \u2013 all the while waiting to see what strange and brilliant inventions the rest of the world had been working on. For the first few tournaments, fans could be forgiven some optimism; England were runners-up three times in the first five. But then bathos set in, in three of the next six, they fell out in the opening round. In 1975, in whites and over 60 overs, England managed three huge victories before being speared by Gary Gilmour in the semi-final. Four years later they got to the final and, after watching Viv Richards explode a century, Geoff Boycott and Mike Brearley carefully fashioned 129 in 38 overs. In 1983 they were pipped at the post in the semi-final again, this time by India on a slow boil. Then the World Cup went walkabout. In 1987 a promising final run chase crashed when Mike Gatting took that fateful fancy to Allan Border. In 1992, another final, against Pakistan. Derek Pringle still remembers two lbw shouts against Javed Miandad being turned down: \u201cAllah smile on me today,\u201d he told Pringle in the dressing-room afterwards, patting his leg. By 1996 a Sanath Jayasuriya-inspired Sri Lanka were easing past a plodding England in the quarter-finals. In 1999, the last time the World Cup was held in this country, a risible set of events starting with soggy fireworks at Lord\u2019s finished with an early exit at Edgbaston. Fan ennui set in. The 2000s can be summed up in a single world. Misery. All culminating in the nadir of 2015; England endured a World Cup where everything they touched turned to soup. But from that, the metamorphosis, inspired by fearless, sportsmanlike New Zealand, this tournament\u2019s awesome runners-up. Eoin Morgan and coach Trevor Bayliss brought together a likeable, brilliant band of brothers and force-fed them confidence. For four years they notched up victory after victory until, like robins learning to trust the slippered lady scattering breadcrumbs, we too began to believe. So when, at the height of their powers, they stumbled last month against Pakistan and Sri Lanka, we trusted them. Hah! I don\u2019t think so. We laid down the coverlet in the darkened room. \u201cSunday is not a day to shy away from,\u201d Morgan said on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s a day to look forward to.\u201d How we scoffed. How wrong we were. Ye god Eoin! Thank you.",

Almost 20,000km from the action, New Zealanders were enduring.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt feels too familiar,\u201d said one punter at a Nelson bar as the wickets fell during the Black Caps\u2019 innings. \u201cLike we are better than this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Towards the last few overs, an impromptu sweepstake was organised to predict the score that New Zealand would be defending.

They might finally rid the ghosts of the 1992 World Cup semi-final, or the 2015 final.</p> \n<p>There were moments of brilliance when the punters who had found bars hosting the match threw their hands up in ecstasy.

Then, those hands covered heads in agony. They would not soon forget that Stokes was born in New Zealand.</p> \n<p>\u201cYeah, that was a bit of shame, eh,\u201d said the Black Caps\u2019 captain, Kane Williamson, of the ricochet incident. \u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s the game we play, those things happen from time to time.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was typically understated. Kane was calm, Kane was collected.

Twitter users suggested their picks of potential batsmen who should represent New Zealand.</p> \n<p>Grant Elliott, who hit a six off the final ball of the 2015 semi final to send the Black Caps to the final, was put forward. Stephen Donald, the accidental All Blacks\u2019 hero, who kicked a winning penalty to win the rugby World Cup final in 2011, was another option.</p> \n<p>Instead it was Martin Guptill and Jimmy Neesham, who managed to tie the score but not win the game. The natural order of disappointment was restored.</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern joked to Radio New Zealand that she had been \u201ctraumatised\u201d by the experience. \u201cBut regardless of that final outcome I just feel incredibly proud of the Black Caps, and I hope every New Zealander does because they played remarkable cricket,\u201d she added.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz6GGRtg8QP/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "They emerged tired and emotional in the predawn light. They shuffled from living room couches or from the New Zealand bars lucky enough to organise short-notice liquor licences. Then, they went back to their Monday mornings. No teacher or manager in the whole country would be naive enough to believe them if they said they had come down with the flu. They would have to wear their decision to stay up all night and watch the most thrilling cricket World Cup final ever played. If there was ever to be more cruel scheduling for a nation\u2019s productivity it would be this game against England \u2013 starting at 10pm New Zealand time, ending at 6.30am. It was all the more cruel for the result. Almost 20,000km from the action, New Zealanders were enduring. \u201cIt feels too familiar,\u201d said one punter at a Nelson bar as the wickets fell during the Black Caps\u2019 innings. \u201cLike we are better than this.\u201d Towards the last few overs, an impromptu sweepstake was organised to predict the score that New Zealand would be defending. They were all woeful. But the population dared to believe the disappointment that had permeated the history of this team might finally be shrugged off. They might finally rid the ghosts of the 1992 World Cup semi-final, or the 2015 final. There were moments of brilliance when the punters who had found bars hosting the match threw their hands up in ecstasy. There was also the moment when Jimmy Neesham\u2019s throw hit Ben Stokes\u2019s bat and ricocheted over the boundary for a total of six runs in England\u2019s final over. Then, those hands covered heads in agony. They would not soon forget that Stokes was born in New Zealand. \u201cYeah, that was a bit of shame, eh,\u201d said the Black Caps\u2019 captain, Kane Williamson, of the ricochet incident. \u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s the game we play, those things happen from time to time.\u201d It was typically understated. Kane was calm, Kane was collected. However, his fellow countrymen and women watching back home complained about having a simultaneous cardiac arrest or breaking down in panic attacks. And then it came down to one super over and 16 runs to win. \u201cI\u2019m not sure there has ever been a more dramatic moment in sporting history in New Zealand,\u201d said the commentator Ian Smith. Most simply didn\u2019t know what a super over was. Twitter users suggested their picks of potential batsmen who should represent New Zealand. Grant Elliott, who hit a six off the final ball of the 2015 semi final to send the Black Caps to the final, was put forward. Stephen Donald, the accidental All Blacks\u2019 hero, who kicked a winning penalty to win the rugby World Cup final in 2011, was another option. Instead it was Martin Guptill and Jimmy Neesham, who managed to tie the score but not win the game. The natural order of disappointment was restored. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern joked to Radio New Zealand that she had been \u201ctraumatised\u201d by the experience. \u201cBut regardless of that final outcome I just feel incredibly proud of the Black Caps, and I hope every New Zealander does because they played remarkable cricket,\u201d she added. Kiwis went on Twitter either to congratulate England on a game well played or call for an independent inquiry into the moments which, in their view, robbed New Zealand of the win. The double tragedy was not lost on New Zealanders who then were forced to endure a sleep-deprived, honest day\u2019s work. There was only a meagre consolation, as one Twitter user put it. \u201cThere\u2019s always the All Blacks, eh.\u201d",

Morris\u2019s rejection of Victorian civilisation and \u201cprogress\u201d via romantic escape-routes through classical, Norse and medieval mythology confronts without challenging its own enervation.

      "bodyText": "Apology, from The Earthly Paradise Of Heaven or Hell I have no power to sing, I cannot ease the burden of your fears, Or make quick-coming death a little thing, Or bring again the pleasure of past years, Nor for my words shall ye forget your tears, Or hope again for aught that I can say, The idle singer of an empty day. But rather, when aweary of your mirth From full hearts still unsatisfied ye sigh, And, feeling kindly unto all the earth, Grudge every minute as it passes by, Made the more mindful that the sweet days die \u2013 Remember me a little then, I pray, The idle singer of an empty day. The heavy trouble, the bewildering care That weighs us down who live and earn our bread, These idle verses have no power to bear; So let me sing of names remembered, Because they, living not, can ne\u2019er be dead, Or long time take their memory quite away From us poor singers of an empty day. Dreamer of dreams, born out of my due time, Why should I strive to set the crooked straight? Let it suffice me that my murmuring rhyme Beats with light wing against the ivory gate, Telling a tale not too importunate To those who in the sleepy region stay, Lull\u2019d by the singer of an empty day. Folk say, a wizard to a northern king At Christmas-tide such wondrous things did show, That through one window men beheld the spring, And through another saw the summer glow, And through a third the fruited vines a-row, While still, unheard, but in its wonted way, Pip\u2019d the drear wind of that December day. So with this Earthly Paradise it is, If ye will read aright, and pardon me, Who strive to build a shadowy isle of bliss Midmost the beating of the steely sea, Where toss\u2019d about all hearts of men must be; Whose ravening monsters mighty men shall slay, Not the poor singer of an empty day. Although still a relatively young man when, between 1868 and 1870, William Morris published the three books of The Earthly Paradise, the work is haunted by intimations of mortality. Morris\u2019s rejection of Victorian civilisation and \u201cprogress\u201d via romantic escape-routes through classical, Norse and medieval mythology confronts without challenging its own enervation. In later years as a \u201cpractical\u201d and more hopeful socialist Morris purportedly dismissed the entire work, saying that the best thing about it was the title.

      "bodyText": "Climate change is affecting everything, even cinema. It used to be that horror movies were for winter, when the nights were drawing in and summer blockbusters were in hibernation. Now the genre is a year-round proposition. It used to be that you released your horror movie in Halloween and called it something like Halloween. Now you can release a horror movie in midsummer, and call it \u2026 Midsommar. In the past few months, we\u2019ve been getting more than a horror movie a week. In UK cinemas you currently have the choice of Midsommar, Child\u2019s Play, In Fabric, Brightburn and \u2013 joining them this week \u2013 Annabelle Comes Home and The Dead Don\u2019t Die, with Welsh folk-horror tale Gwen coming on Friday. And there is a whole summer of horror yet to come. It\u2019s enough to make you want to stay in and watch Stranger Things. You could put all this down to global cultural anxiety about the unprecedentedly scary times we live in, but the reason is probably more prosaic than that.

      "body": "<p>One day two months ago I woke up to thousands of abusive messages on Turkish social media, many of them generated by bots and trolls. Sentences had been plucked from one of my novels, <em>The Gaze,</em> and were being circulated by people demanding fiction writers be put on trial for \u201cobscenity\u201d. My new novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/16/10-minutes-38-seconds-in-this-strange-world-by-elif-shafak-book-review\" title=\"\"><em>10 Minutes </em><em>38 Seconds in </em><em>This Strange World</em></a>,<em> </em>was also targeted. Both books explore difficult subjects \u2013 sexual harassment, gender violence and child abuse \u2013 and I was far from the only writer targeted in this way. Soon the hysteria turned into a kind of digital lynching of Turkish authors who had even slightly touched on similar issues in their novels and short stories.</p> <p>I received a distressed call from my Turkish publisher the same week, informing me that civilian police officers had come to the office demanding to see a number of books. Not only my fiction but titles by Duygu Asena, a leading feminist who died in 2006. The books were taken to the prosecutor\u2019s office to be investigated.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Much has been said about the anti-liberal nature of authoritarian populism, but little about anti-intellectualism and anti-feminism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/turkey-coup-attempt-military-ankara-istanbul\" title=\"\">attempted coup</a> of 2016, 29<strong> </strong>publishing houses have been closed by decree, and 135,000 books have been banned from public libraries, including those by Louis Althusser and N\u00e2zim Hikmet, Turkey\u2019s greatest poet. A prosecutor has accused Baruch Spinoza and Albert Camus of being members of a terrorist organisation. Much has been said about the anti-liberal nature of authoritarian populism, but relatively little about two other features concomitant with its rise: anti-intellectualism and anti-feminism. Authoritarian populism likes to divide society into two camps: the pure people versus the corrupt elite. Writers, poets, journalists and scholars are often associated with the latter group. In the populist imagination, being elite has nothing to do with economic power or social status. It is about values. In this way, a university assistant who cannot afford a house in the city and has to commute for hours every day but happens to have progressive ideas can be labelled \u201celite\u201d, while a hedge fund manager will be called \u201ca man of the people\u201d if he sponsors populist nationalistic movements.</p> <p>The people are romanticised as pure and innocent. The deputy rector of a newly established university in Turkey, B\u00fclent Ari, claimed on TV: \u201cI\u2019d rather trust ignorant people who have not attended university or better yet, not even attended primary school \u2026 because their minds are pure.\u201d Saying he was unhappy to see literacy rates going up, he claimed that people who had higher education and were more cultured also had blurred minds and couldn\u2019t think straight. \u201cIf Erdo\u011fan leaves it will be a catastrophe,\u201d he added. Afterwards, he was promoted by the government to the Council of Higher Education.</p> <p>There is a clear animosity towards intellectuals under President Erdo\u011fan\u2019s AKP government. More than 7,300 academics have been dismissed via emergency state decrees. Around 700 scholars have been criminally charged for signing a peace petition. They have lost their jobs and been blacklisted. Some have been arrested, others have had travel bans imposed on them or had their passports confiscated. Mehmet Fatih Tra\u015f, a university assistant who had signed the peace petition and was then fired, killed himself. Professor \u015eebnem Korur Fincanci, chair of the Human Rights Foundation, and Ay\u015fe G\u00fcl Alt\u0131nay, a professor of gender and women\u2019s studies, were both given two-year prison sentences. Professor F\u00fcsun \u00dcstel, one of Turkey\u2019s leading academics on nationalism and identity, is in prison.</p> <p>It is equally hard for female journalists. Nurcan Baysal had police knocking on her door in the middle of the night. Baysal is one of the most important voices writing about the traumas of Yazidi and Kurdish women, and she was put on trial for her articles. Ayla Albayrak from the Wall Street Journal was charged with \u201cterrorist propaganda\u201d after penning an article about what was transpiring in the Kurdish-majority south-east. She was sentenced in absentia. Article 19 called the decision \u201can unprecedented verdict for a reporter of a foreign media outlet\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Like intellectuals, feminists are accused of being 'pawns of the west' and 'rootless cosmopolitans'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The rhetoric of anti-intellectualism goes hand in hand with anti-feminism. \u201cYou [feminists] have nothing to do with our religion or our civilisation,\u201d said Erdo\u011fan. Like intellectuals, feminists are accused of being \u201cpawns of the west\u201d and \u201crootless cosmopolitans\u201d. Women in opposition parties are targeted ruthlessly. Canan Kaftanc\u0131o\u011flu, the provincial chair of the Republican People\u2019s Party, played a major role in the electoral victory of the twice elected mayor of Istanbul, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/23/erdogan-faces-scrutiny-once-more-as-istanbul-goes-back-to-the-polls\" title=\"\">Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu</a>. Today Kaftanc\u0131o\u011flu is under vicious attack by pro-government papers and social media channels. Last week Istanbul prosecutors demanded she be imprisoned for writing a series of tweets. She is accused of insulting the president and spreading terrorist propaganda. In response she tweeted: \u201cThere is something clear: they are afraid of women, of women who do not mince their words and are brave.

Last month, for the fifth time, the Pride Parade in Istanbul was banned and dispersed with rubber bullets, tear gas and police violence. This is the kind of Europe authoritarian populists are trying to create: an anti-intellectual, anti-feminist, anti-LGBT and anti-abortion rights Europe. In Hungary, the government has banned gender and women\u2019s studies, with the assertion: \u201cWe do not consider it acceptable to talk about socially constructed genders, rather than biological sexes.\u201d Prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s policy of giving tax cuts to mothers who bear more children resembles Erdo\u011fan\u2019s drive to encourage Turkish women to have bigger families. \u201cHave not just three, but five children,\u201d Erdo\u011fan told Turks in Europe in 2017. Meanwhile the Polish health ministry has put out a video urging citizens to procreate: \u201cIf you ever want to be a parent, follow the example of rabbits.\u201d Morning after pills are no longer available over the counter in Poland and Polish abortion law remains one of the strictest across Europe. In Warsaw 14 women were beaten and prosecuted for opening a banner that said \u201cStop Fascism\u201d. In Spain, the Vox Movement hired a bus with a picture of Hitler on it and a caption underneath that said: #StopFeminazis.</p> <p>Gender is an important part of this new narrative. If women can be convinced to return to traditional values, the population will increase and majority-minority ratios will be as they used to be. Demographic changes are a primary concern for populist nationalists. If white populations continue to remain as the majority, nationalism will feel more secure. There will also be less need for immigrant workers coming from abroad. It is not a coincidence that anti-immigration rhetoric is entwined with a growing anti-feminist rhetoric.</p> <p>In 2006, after I wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/aug/04/society1\" title=\"\"><em>The Bastard of Istanbul</em></a><em> </em>\u2013 a novel about a Turkish and Armenian-American family \u2013 I was put on trial for \u201cinsulting Turkishness\u201d. The words of several of my Armenian fictional characters were used as \u201cevidence\u201d by the prosecutors. As a result, my Turkish lawyer had to defend not only me but also my characters. I wish I could say that Turkey has made progress in human rights and freedom of speech since then, but I am afraid it has been the opposite.</p> <p>No country is immune to the rise of populist nationalism. As liberal democratic values continue to be endangered, we storytellers are now facing unexpected challenges. Doris Lessing once said that literature was analysis after the event. But there might be times when literature has to become analysis during the event. Paradoxically, at a time when truth is under attack, writers might need to defend fiction more loudly. In the age of anger, tribalism and apathy, we need stories of connectivity, humanism and empathy. In the face of binary oppositions, we need to promote a more nuanced way of thinking. Wherever there is a decline in democracy we will see an increase in censorship and intolerance. Today, more than ever before, literature has to be not only about stories but also about silences and the silenced. It has to become a sanctuary for the disempowered and the marginalised across the world.</p>",

It has to become a sanctuary for the disempowered and the marginalised across the world.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump used racist language on Sunday to attack four progressive Democratic congresswomen, telling them to \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came\u201d. The US president did not name his targets, but the attack was directed at a group of liberal congresswoman who have had a run-in with the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and who are sometimes referred to as the \u201csquad\u201d: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. Only Omar, who is from Somalia, was not born in America. Pressley is African American, Tlaib was born to Palestinian immigrants and Ocasio-Cortez comes from a New York-Puerto Rican family. Tlaib responded by saying Trump \u201cneeds to be impeached\u201d. Ocasio-Cortez said: \u201cThe country I \u2018come from\u2019, and the country we all swear to, is the United States.\u201d Omar called Trump \u201cthe worst, most corrupt and inept president we have ever seen\u201d. Pressley said: \u201cThis is what racism looks like. We are what democracy looks like.\u201d Bernie Sanders was among others who called the attack racist. \u201cWhen I call the president a racist, this is what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d the Vermont senator wrote on Twitter. Justin Amash, a Michigan congressman who left the Republican party over his opposition to Trump, called the remarks \u201cracist and disgusting\u201d. Trump responded to the outcry on Twitter on Sunday evening, saying it was \u201csad to see the Democrats sticking up for people who speak so badly of our country\u201d. Earlier Nihad Awad, national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said: \u201cIf Trump shouted the same thing at a Muslim woman wearing hijab in a Walmart, he might be arrested.\u201d The congresswomen targeted by the president have been engaged in a dispute with Pelosi over the humanitarian crisis at the southern border and her reluctance to begin impeachment proceedings. Ocasio-Cortez told the Washington Post that Pelosi\u2019s \u201cexplicit singling out of newly elected women of color\u201d was \u201coutright disrespectful\u201d. On Friday Trump defended Pelosi, saying: \u201cShe is not a racist.\u201d In tweets on Sunday, the president wrote that it was \u201cso interesting to see \u2018progressive\u2019 Democrat congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful nation on earth, how our government is to be run. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime[-]infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done. These places need your help badly, you can\u2019t leave fast enough. I\u2019m sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!\u201d Pelosi responded by saying Trump had shown that his plan to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d had \u201calways been about making America white again\u201d. The California senator Kamala Harris said Trump\u2019s comments were \u201cabsolutely racist and un-American\u201d. The presidential trolling may have been meant as a distraction from immigration raids that were due in major cities on Sunday. It is far from the first time Trump has been accused of holding racist views. He launched his political career with false claims that Barack Obama was not born in the US and his presidential campaign with the claim many Mexicans were \u201crapists\u201d. Last year during a White House meeting he wondered why the US was admitting migrants from \u201cshithole countries\u201d like Haiti, El Salvador and several African nations. On CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday, Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, was asked whether Trump\u2019s tweets \u201cfeed into this impression that the president is racist and is pushing a racist agenda\u201d. Cuccinelli said the tweets were examples of \u201crhetoric for the presidential race\u201d. All the congresswomen have emerged as key voices in a Democratic party split over how to beat Trump at the polls. Omar was born in Somalia and came to the US at 12 after a spell in a refugee camp. Elected to Congress in November as one of its first two Muslim women, she has emerged as a hate figure for Fox News hosts and Trump\u2019s hard-right support. Tlaib, the other Muslim woman in Congress, was born in Detroit. Pressley was born in Cincinnati. Ocasio-Cortez was born in New York. Trump has regularly attacked Omar and ridiculed Ocasio-Cortez, although a new book does contain expressions seemingly signalling respect for the New Yorker. The Texas congressman Lloyd Doggett said on Twitter Trump\u2019s attack was \u201cracism pure and simple\u201d but perhaps unwittingly echoed attacks on Pelosi when he said the president \u201cfears the power of these strong, effective, American women of color\u201d. Sanders told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press Pelosi was being \u201ca little bit\u201d too tough on the congresswomen and said: \u201cYou cannot ignore the young people of this country, who are passionate about economic and racial and social and environmental justice.\u201d On Sunday Tlaib was the first of the targeted women to respond to Trump. \u201cWant a response to a lawless [and] complete failure of a president?\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe is the crisis. His dangerous ideology is the crisis. He needs to be impeached.\u201d Omar, Pressley and Ocasio-Cortez followed, the last with a lengthy rebuke. \u201cYou are angry because you don\u2019t believe in an America where I represent New York 14, where the good people of Minnesota elected [Omar], where [Tlaib] fights for Michigan families, where [Pressley] champions little girls in Boston,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou are angry because you can\u2019t conceive of an America that includes us. You rely on a frightened America for your plunder.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Federal police wanted to fingerprint two ABC journalists involved in a series of stories about Australia\u2019s special forces allegedly carrying out unlawful killings in Afghanistan. The letter from the Australian federal police to journalists Dan Oakes and Sam Clark was emailed on 1 April \u2013 two months before AFP officers raided the ABC\u2019s Sydney headquarters seeking leaked documents relating to the stories. The ABC said the email stated the AFP was \u201crequesting your consent to a forensic procedure being the copying of your finger and palm prints\u201d, with the two journalists being suspects in relation to three alleged offences. Veteran ABC journalist John Lyons also reported that police were also poised to raid the headquarters of News Corp, in Holt Street, Sydney, but backed off following the backlash over the raids on the ABC and journalist Annika Smethurst. The ABC declined to comment further on Monday, beyond confirming the AFP request had been received. The revelation followed a report in the Sydney Morning Herald that said the AFP had sought from the travel details of Oakes from Qantas. The federal attorney general, Christian Porter, has previously said journalists were not the subject of \u201cpresent investigations\u201d and expressed his reluctance to authorise the prosecution of journalists. But he has since distanced himself from those comments, saying they were made with the limited information available to him at the time. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, was last week pressed by media chiefs to drop any police action against ABC journalists. But he said on Friday that no one was above the law. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got top secret documents and they\u2019ve been leaked, it is an offence under the law,\u201d Dutton said on Channel Nine. \u201cNobody is above the law and the police have a job to do under the law.\u201d The ABC\u2019s managing director, David Anderson, has asked for the investigation to be dropped and is pursuing legal action to declare the search warrant involved in the raid invalid. It is also seeking a permanent injunction stopping the AFP accessing the electronic files removed from Ultimo on a sealed USB stick. Former military lawyer David McBride has been committed to stand trial charged with theft of commonwealth property, three counts of breaching the Defence Act and unauthorised disclosure of information. The Australian Federal Police Association in June backed the professionalism and integrity of the officers involved in carrying out the search warrant. But the raids on the ABC have prompted worldwide condemnation. Last week, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney described the raids as an example of how limits on press freedom were also occurring in democratic nations. \u201cWhat happens in a country like Australia or the UK or the US will be looked at by every other leader in the world and potentially be used as an excuse to clamp down even further on journalists,\u201d she said. The parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security has begun an inquiry into the impact of the exercise of law enforcement and intelligence powers on the freedom of the press. Submissions to the inquiry close on 26 July and it is due to report in October. McBride is one of a series of whistleblowers currently facing imprisonment for their actions. Intelligence officer Witness K and his lawyer Bernard Collaery are facing jail time for their actions in helping expose an illegal spy operation on Timor-Leste, while tax office whistleblower Richard Boyle is in court for speaking out about the aggressive tactics used against small businesses and individual taxpayers.",

Here are some of the most recent deals involving Sports Direct, including the acquisition of large stakes in other retailers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>House of Fraser</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The department store has been struggling since Sports Direct bought 58 sites out of administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/10/house-of-fraser-calls-in-administrators-as-rescue-talks-fail\">for \u00a390m in August 2018</a>, with Dundrum in Ireland acquired later. It now trades from 55 sites, with Hull, Altrincham and Birkenhead set to close. The branch at Lakeside in Thurrock, Essex, is under review as owner Intu plans a housing development. Several more stores are expected to close after Christmas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Evans Cycles</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The specialist bicycle retailer trades from 56 stores after Sports Direct bought 62 stores out of administration in October 2018.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Sofa.com</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The online furniture retailer was bought out of administration in February 2019. The retailer has nine showrooms and trades in 12 House of Frasers, up from eight on acquisition.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Game Digital</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Currently finalising a takeover bid that values the retailer and gaming arena group at just over \u00a352m. The company, which has 274 stores in the UK and 269 in Spain, and 21 gaming arenas, is set to delist later this summer.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>OTHER INVESTMENTS</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Goals Soccer Centre</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Sports Direct owns an 18.9% stake that cost about \u00a315m to build up but is now worth \u00a33.9m. Shares in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/18/goals-soccer-centres-hires-advisers-potential-sale-mike-ashley\">five-a-side pitch operator</a>, which has 49 sites, were suspended in March and it is considering a sale as discussions continue with tax authorities over an unpaid VAT bill. The company was worth \u00a320.5m when shares were suspended but has debts of about \u00a329m.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>French Connection</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Sports Direct has spent \u00a310.4m on a 27% stake in the fashion chain, which is currently worth \u00a39.8m. French Connection has been considering a sale since October 2018 after a period of poor trading. The fashion retailer has said sales at established stores fell 6.8% last year, when it made a pre-tax loss of \u00a39.3m. The results of a strategic review are not expected until September.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Findel</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Mike Ashley\u2019s group has invested nearly \u00a363m building up a 37.8% stake in the online retailer, which is now worth \u00a379m. But Findel\u2019s board recently advised investors to reject a low-ball offer from Sports Direct for the rest of the shares it did not own, which would have valued the company at \u00a3140m.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Debenhams</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Sports Direct spent more than \u00a3150m on building up a near-30% stake in the 165-strong department store chain, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/09/debenhams-is-taken-over-by-lenders-mike-ashley-loses-sta\">collapsed into administration in April</a>.

      "bodyText": "The Conservative party can only succeed if it\u2019s in the centre ground of British politics and offers an antidote to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s hard-left Labour party. We must be seen as the party of opportunity, as we were when I was a working-class teenager growing up in Rotherham. Yet the current Conservative party leadership battle \u2013 a candidate from Eton pitting himself against one from Charterhouse \u2013 makes us look like the party of privilege. When I was education secretary, I saw first-hand how privilege bias is hardwired into our education system and then beyond into business and careers. Any party committed to equality of opportunity should be determined to change this. That means decisive action from the incoming prime minister, tackling the privilege hoarding we have built into society. We should take immediate action via a social mobility emergency budget, followed by wider steps to address the systemic privilege bias that means opportunity tends to flow to those who already have it. An emergency budget should target the country\u2019s social mobility cold spots with extra education support, announce a reform of student finance and the reintroduction of maintenance grants. It could introduce an opportunity capital fund to provide capital to a new generation so they can pursue more opportunities. It\u2019s perverse just to lend them finance for a degree but not for other opportunities, such as an apprenticeship, training or starting a business.

      "body": "<p>Louise set herself two New Year\u2019s resolutions for 2019: to start yoga, and to keep a journal. She did better than most people, sticking to both for five months. About six weeks ago, however, she recognised something was off. \u201cDuring May, I noticed all I kept writing was how lethargic, below average or ill I was feeling.\u201d</p> <p>Writing in her journal in the first week of June, the 30-year-old from Nottinghamshire wondered if hitting the six-month mark and \u201cthe downwards slope to winter\u201d was taking its toll. \u201cI was ready to brush it off as irrational,\u201d she said, \u201cuntil I saw this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis\u201d was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/25/could-you-be-suffering-from-mid-year-burnout\" title=\"\">a Guardian callout on \u201cmid-year burnout\u201d</a>, asking readers to assess their moods and energy levels at this point in 2019 \u2013 were they tracking upwards with the mercury? Or were the longer, warmer days not having the positive impact they usually did?</p> <p>It was undeniably, as one reader said, \u201ca self-selecting sample answering a leading question\u201d \u2013 but many more saw the words: \u201cCould you be suffering from mid-year burnout?\u201d and responded with an unequivocal yes. Their responses, mostly submitted on condition of anonymity, told of sleep disrupted by lighter evenings, of unusually bad hay fever, of illnesses still lingering after months.</p> <p>Readers wrote of feeling as if they could fall asleep standing up, of waking with a racing heart or clouded mind, of having lost their energy, appetite or libido. They felt stretched too thin, in and out of work. They would go on holiday and spend all day in bed \u2013 or come back from holiday and find the positive effects gone after a couple of days. They were regularly surprised to find themselves irritable or tearful. Many said it was as if the joy had been sucked from life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is some psychological significance to the midway point of the year, as a logical opportunity to take stock</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some were people whose existence was threatened \u2013 by debt, poor physical and mental health, underemployment, austerity, hate crimes or insecure work and housing. But even those who should have been thriving, or at least broadly fine, reported an apparent groundswell of malaise.</p> <p>For every reader who scoffed at the premise of mid-year burnout (\u201ca trendy tag for tiredness. What the hell has the calendar got to do with this?\u201d), there were many like Charlotte, a 47-year-old from East Sussex. \u201cI wake up in the morning and think, did I get drunk last night?\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd then I remember, no, this is just what normal feels like now. I\u2019m just tired and moody all the time.\u201d</p> <p>I understood, because I felt the same way. Summer was typically the season when everything just flowed, when longer days and warmer nights seemed to make it easier to balance life and work, while making the life part effortlessly more fun.</p> <p>Not this year, though. This year Lana Del Rey\u2019s seven-year-old Summertime Sadness re-entered the US iTunes chart (\u201cIs everyone OK?\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chuuzus/status/1146435317626527744\" title=\"\">fretted a viral tweet</a>). Though I love my job, have no children or mortgage, am in good health and have taken regular holidays, by June it felt as if I was already out of fuel when I thought I\u2019d only just stopped to fill up. The thought of another six months of running on empty seemed both impossible and inevitable.</p> <p>Gina, 33, from Kent, knew just how I felt. \u201cThe weekends don\u2019t seem to bring respite at the moment,\u201d she wrote. She and her husband were both \u201cunusually tired and in need of a holiday this year\u201d, despite a good work-life balance and holiday allowance. \u201cI don\u2019t think you would know from looking at us that we feel burned out \u2013 we are very active, busy people, with wholesome leisure activities and an active social life. But it all feels like too much.\u201d</p> <p>There were obvious, numerous and very real reasons why people might be struggling. This was different (and, of course, incomparable, in terms of stakes or urgency): fatigue, felt both at a gut and bodily level, and in the atmosphere. Rob, 53, from The Hague, described himself standing in the shower each morning, yawning. He ached to take some time off, \u201cto do nothing but just be\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s like I lifted my head and it\u2019s June already \u2013 how did that happen? It was Christmas a few weeks ago, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>There is some psychological significance to the midway point of the year, as a logical opportunity to take stock. People may be reminded of the optimism that they felt in the new year, or the goals that they set and are now no closer to achieving. \u201cI think all the prospects of possible change die down, and it just becomes a slog towards the end so you can start afresh,\u201d said Louise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"21954dd2046604a12d1706fbe5fbc816560995d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21954dd2046604a12d1706fbe5fbc816560995d6/0_258_5256_3154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young woman looking tired while waiting at a tram stop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Some readers attributed their low mood and energy levels to the news cycle.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Klubovy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Parents (and teachers) find themselves beset with demands for end-of-term events such as sports days and performances. \u201cIt is like a race to get to the finish line at home and work,\u201d said a 42-year-old mother of two working in higher education in Worcester. \u201cIt is worse than December by some distance as there is only a long summer of juggling childcare and work commitments as a reward.\u201d</p> <p>As in the runup to Christmas, social calendars also tend to fill up in summer \u2013 and the assumption of a lighter workload and a break is not always borne out. \u201cIt seems that it\u2019s not only the onslaught of work, with various people off on holidays and clients wanting everything, even on a Sunday, but the birthdays, parties, gigs, all at once,\u201d said Robert, 35, from Manchester. \u201cIt sounds like I\u2019m being ungrateful. I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m just utterly drained.\u201d</p> <p>Chris, 53, from Hampshire, had been \u201calarmed and a bit puzzled\u201d by his lack of energy, even though he ate well and liked his job. He had been thinking of going to see his GP. Many readers did reach for a medical explanation. An early start to pollen season (confirmed by the Met Office) had caused hay fever sufferers \u2013 thought to number up to 30% of adults in the UK \u2013 to experience symptoms earlier in the year than usual. The greater light, heat and humidity could also disrupt sleep and body clocks, increasing tiredness and irritability.</p> <p>Some readers floated the possibility of seasonal affective disorder, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/30/sad-winter-depression-seasonal-affective-disorder\" title=\"\">said to affect around 6%</a> of the UK population. Though it is typically associated with autumn and winter, there is a summertime variant with similar depressive symptoms, when too much sunlight results in reduced melatonin production, affecting the body\u2019s circadian rhythm. Joanne, 37, from Surrey, likened it to \u201cwalking through treacle \u2026 like a low-level flu that only goes away mid-September\u201d.</p> <p>Other readers attributed their low mood and energy levels to the news cycle. Jan, 38, from Edinburgh, said the expectations of picnics, barbecues and socialising were \u201cemotionally incongruous\u201d with the climate emergency, Trump, the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and \u201cthe Tory leadership nonsense\u201d: \u201cThis year more than ever, I want to hide from the world.\u201d</p> <p>Many readers were holding out for autumn, winter, September, November, Christmas \u2013 a point in the not-too-distant future when this low ebb would pass, like bad weather. I thought I understood why. It was the same reason that I\u2019d classified my own desperation as being of the mid-year. It was that the alternative was too grim to consider: that this threadbare feeling wasn\u2019t seasonal, tied to longer, warmer days \u2013 but our new basal temperature.</p> <p>But Dr Natasha Bijlani, a consultant psychiatrist at the Priory hospital in Roehampton, south-west London, says that is exactly right. \u201cI am sceptical about there being such a thing as mid-year burnout. We do know that there are high levels of burnout in our society in general; I think it\u2019s reaching epidemic levels. If you asked people the question in April or September, you could say it was the three-quarter-year burnout.\u201d</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t dismiss the issue; rather, it casts it as catastrophic. Any discussion of burnout is valuable when so many people are suffering in silence, says Bijlani. \u201cIt allows people to be aware of all the time, not just in the middle of the year.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/21/how-burnout-became-a-sinister-and-insidious-epidemic\">How burnout became a sinister and insidious epidemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/burn-out/en/\" title=\"\">clarified in May</a> that it does not consider burnout a medical issue; rather, it understands it to be an \u201coccupational phenomenon\u201d resulting from chronic and unmanaged workplace stress. It \u201cshould not be applied to describe experiences in other areas of life\u201d.</p> <p>Definitions serve a purpose \u2013 especially when classification as a medical condition paves the way for treatment by medication. But for many, the suggestion that feelings about work can be restricted to \u201cthe occupational context\u201d will provoke hollow laughter.</p> <p>Readers wrote, with no small desperation, of the impossibility of keeping their job separate from other areas of their life. A 38-year-old public servant said her husband was supportive, their jobs were rewarding and meaningful, their four children \u201cthriving\u201d \u2013 but she was hanging on by a thread. \u201cMy husband is exhausted with work too, and every day we say, \u2018We can do this \u2013 just keep swimming.\u2019 Some days it feels like everything is in its place and this is working; other days \u2013 like today \u2013 it feels like the wheels are coming off.\u201d</p> <p>The fix is not as straightforward as taking time off when that can create more work in the leadup, and another pile on your return (while those who remain take up the slack). Londoner Claire, 35, used to work 60-hour weeks, only able to catch up on sleep and laundry at the weekend. \u201cIt always got worse in summer \u2013 the bosses would take the full six weeks off work and come back all refreshed, while my \u2018holiday\u2019 was the August bank holiday weekend, when I\u2019d go to visit family and I\u2019d crash out from exhaustion.\u201d</p> <p>Bijlani sees only the most severe cases of burnout at the Priory, but she lays the blame with a culture that frames overwork as the norm, and the technology that facilitates it. She urges people to observe strict limits on work, and to put themselves first: if that sounds indulgent, she says, it\u2019s only more evidence of the ridiculous state we\u2019re in. Work-life balance should be for everyone, not just those at the tops of their fields. \u201cI\u2019ve had people come in and say, \u2018It\u2019s all right for the CEO to do that, but I can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d says Bijlani. \u201cIt needs to filter down.\u201d</p> <p>Siobhan Murray, a resilience coach, psychotherapist and author of The Burnout Solution, says the pressure is built into society \u2013 from millennials who have had their worth eroded by competitive but unpaid internships and unstable work (\u201cBy the time they\u2019re into their late 20s, they\u2019re already burned out\u201d) to thirtysomethings racing to achieve the \u201cbizarre goal\u201d of retiring by 40.</p> <p>Others took on more obligations, such as caring for their elderly parents, without thinking to let go of others, only realising they were overcommitted when they reached breaking point. Of Murray\u2019s 12 current clients, more than half had been signed off work with burnout on their doctors\u2019 orders \u2013 some for as long as two months. \u201cThere are degrees of burnout,\u201d she says, \u201cand the average Guardian reader isn\u2019t necessarily at that high end where they\u2019re being signed off or going to the Priory \u2013 but they could fast be approaching it.\u201d</p> <p>The discovery that a long-awaited getaway may not be as restorative as you had hoped can be a dismal wake-up call. Shorter, more regular holidays throughout the year can help \u2013 she suggests taking a week off every three months.</p> <p>We can dream of the introduction of a universal basic income or four-day working week \u2013 but for as long as burnout is the baseline of society, Murray says individuals must be realistic about the demands on their time. She recommends a regular \u201clife audit\u201d, reassessing commitments or goals to prioritise those that matter. \u201cYou can\u2019t hit a gym class in the morning <em>and</em> be a parent <em>and</em> travel with your job <em>and</em> see your friends because there are not enough hours in the day. We spring clean our houses; we have to get into the habit of doing that with our selves and our lives.\u201d</p> <p>A more balanced schedule \u2013 grounded in individual priorities and realistic expectations, and protected against every attempt to undermine it \u2013 may enable us to feel more in control of our lives, says Murray. \u201cIt\u2019s about being able to get into bed every night and say: \u2018OK, this didn\u2019t work, but this did, so you know what, I did a good job today.\u2019\u201d More openness about the pressures that many of us are under can help us realise that we are not alone, and seek help when we reach breaking point. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of personal failing to burnout, but it\u2019s not,\u201d says Murray. \u201cSometimes we just need to be able to say: \u2018I\u2019m not coping.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The people who have successfully safeguarded themselves against burnout have learned to go easy on themselves, and they have defined personal boundaries that they defend against everything the world is going to throw at them. \u201cI can guarantee that those are not people who are never going to get burned out and who just have it all sorted,\u201d says Murray. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who have actually experienced it, and know what they have to pull back on in order to be able to live.\u201d And not just until the autumn.</p> <p><em>All names except Murray and Bijlani</em><em> have been changed</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Louise set herself two New Year\u2019s resolutions for 2019: to start yoga, and to keep a journal. She did better than most people, sticking to both for five months. About six weeks ago, however, she recognised something was off. \u201cDuring May, I noticed all I kept writing was how lethargic, below average or ill I was feeling.\u201d Writing in her journal in the first week of June, the 30-year-old from Nottinghamshire wondered if hitting the six-month mark and \u201cthe downwards slope to winter\u201d was taking its toll. \u201cI was ready to brush it off as irrational,\u201d she said, \u201cuntil I saw this.\u201d \u201cThis\u201d was a Guardian callout on \u201cmid-year burnout\u201d, asking readers to assess their moods and energy levels at this point in 2019 \u2013 were they tracking upwards with the mercury? Or were the longer, warmer days not having the positive impact they usually did? It was undeniably, as one reader said, \u201ca self-selecting sample answering a leading question\u201d \u2013 but many more saw the words: \u201cCould you be suffering from mid-year burnout?\u201d and responded with an unequivocal yes. Their responses, mostly submitted on condition of anonymity, told of sleep disrupted by lighter evenings, of unusually bad hay fever, of illnesses still lingering after months. Readers wrote of feeling as if they could fall asleep standing up, of waking with a racing heart or clouded mind, of having lost their energy, appetite or libido. They felt stretched too thin, in and out of work. They would go on holiday and spend all day in bed \u2013 or come back from holiday and find the positive effects gone after a couple of days. They were regularly surprised to find themselves irritable or tearful. Many said it was as if the joy had been sucked from life. Some were people whose existence was threatened \u2013 by debt, poor physical and mental health, underemployment, austerity, hate crimes or insecure work and housing. But even those who should have been thriving, or at least broadly fine, reported an apparent groundswell of malaise. For every reader who scoffed at the premise of mid-year burnout (\u201ca trendy tag for tiredness. What the hell has the calendar got to do with this?\u201d), there were many like Charlotte, a 47-year-old from East Sussex. \u201cI wake up in the morning and think, did I get drunk last night?\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd then I remember, no, this is just what normal feels like now. I\u2019m just tired and moody all the time.\u201d I understood, because I felt the same way. Summer was typically the season when everything just flowed, when longer days and warmer nights seemed to make it easier to balance life and work, while making the life part effortlessly more fun. Not this year, though. This year Lana Del Rey\u2019s seven-year-old Summertime Sadness re-entered the US iTunes chart (\u201cIs everyone OK?\u201d fretted a viral tweet). Though I love my job, have no children or mortgage, am in good health and have taken regular holidays, by June it felt as if I was already out of fuel when I thought I\u2019d only just stopped to fill up. The thought of another six months of running on empty seemed both impossible and inevitable. Gina, 33, from Kent, knew just how I felt. \u201cThe weekends don\u2019t seem to bring respite at the moment,\u201d she wrote. She and her husband were both \u201cunusually tired and in need of a holiday this year\u201d, despite a good work-life balance and holiday allowance. \u201cI don\u2019t think you would know from looking at us that we feel burned out \u2013 we are very active, busy people, with wholesome leisure activities and an active social life. But it all feels like too much.\u201d There were obvious, numerous and very real reasons why people might be struggling. This was different (and, of course, incomparable, in terms of stakes or urgency): fatigue, felt both at a gut and bodily level, and in the atmosphere. Rob, 53, from The Hague, described himself standing in the shower each morning, yawning. He ached to take some time off, \u201cto do nothing but just be\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s like I lifted my head and it\u2019s June already \u2013 how did that happen? It was Christmas a few weeks ago, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d There is some psychological significance to the midway point of the year, as a logical opportunity to take stock. People may be reminded of the optimism that they felt in the new year, or the goals that they set and are now no closer to achieving. \u201cI think all the prospects of possible change die down, and it just becomes a slog towards the end so you can start afresh,\u201d said Louise. Parents (and teachers) find themselves beset with demands for end-of-term events such as sports days and performances. \u201cIt is like a race to get to the finish line at home and work,\u201d said a 42-year-old mother of two working in higher education in Worcester. \u201cIt is worse than December by some distance as there is only a long summer of juggling childcare and work commitments as a reward.\u201d As in the runup to Christmas, social calendars also tend to fill up in summer \u2013 and the assumption of a lighter workload and a break is not always borne out. \u201cIt seems that it\u2019s not only the onslaught of work, with various people off on holidays and clients wanting everything, even on a Sunday, but the birthdays, parties, gigs, all at once,\u201d said Robert, 35, from Manchester. \u201cIt sounds like I\u2019m being ungrateful. I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m just utterly drained.\u201d Chris, 53, from Hampshire, had been \u201calarmed and a bit puzzled\u201d by his lack of energy, even though he ate well and liked his job. He had been thinking of going to see his GP. Many readers did reach for a medical explanation. An early start to pollen season (confirmed by the Met Office) had caused hay fever sufferers \u2013 thought to number up to 30% of adults in the UK \u2013 to experience symptoms earlier in the year than usual. The greater light, heat and humidity could also disrupt sleep and body clocks, increasing tiredness and irritability. Some readers floated the possibility of seasonal affective disorder, said to affect around 6% of the UK population. Though it is typically associated with autumn and winter, there is a summertime variant with similar depressive symptoms, when too much sunlight results in reduced melatonin production, affecting the body\u2019s circadian rhythm. Joanne, 37, from Surrey, likened it to \u201cwalking through treacle \u2026 like a low-level flu that only goes away mid-September\u201d. Other readers attributed their low mood and energy levels to the news cycle. Jan, 38, from Edinburgh, said the expectations of picnics, barbecues and socialising were \u201cemotionally incongruous\u201d with the climate emergency, Trump, the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and \u201cthe Tory leadership nonsense\u201d: \u201cThis year more than ever, I want to hide from the world.\u201d Many readers were holding out for autumn, winter, September, November, Christmas \u2013 a point in the not-too-distant future when this low ebb would pass, like bad weather. I thought I understood why. It was the same reason that I\u2019d classified my own desperation as being of the mid-year. It was that the alternative was too grim to consider: that this threadbare feeling wasn\u2019t seasonal, tied to longer, warmer days \u2013 but our new basal temperature. But Dr Natasha Bijlani, a consultant psychiatrist at the Priory hospital in Roehampton, south-west London, says that is exactly right. \u201cI am sceptical about there being such a thing as mid-year burnout. We do know that there are high levels of burnout in our society in general; I think it\u2019s reaching epidemic levels. If you asked people the question in April or September, you could say it was the three-quarter-year burnout.\u201d That doesn\u2019t dismiss the issue; rather, it casts it as catastrophic. Any discussion of burnout is valuable when so many people are suffering in silence, says Bijlani. \u201cIt allows people to be aware of all the time, not just in the middle of the year.\u201d The World Health Organization clarified in May that it does not consider burnout a medical issue; rather, it understands it to be an \u201coccupational phenomenon\u201d resulting from chronic and unmanaged workplace stress. It \u201cshould not be applied to describe experiences in other areas of life\u201d. Definitions serve a purpose \u2013 especially when classification as a medical condition paves the way for treatment by medication. But for many, the suggestion that feelings about work can be restricted to \u201cthe occupational context\u201d will provoke hollow laughter. Readers wrote, with no small desperation, of the impossibility of keeping their job separate from other areas of their life. A 38-year-old public servant said her husband was supportive, their jobs were rewarding and meaningful, their four children \u201cthriving\u201d \u2013 but she was hanging on by a thread. \u201cMy husband is exhausted with work too, and every day we say, \u2018We can do this \u2013 just keep swimming.\u2019 Some days it feels like everything is in its place and this is working; other days \u2013 like today \u2013 it feels like the wheels are coming off.\u201d The fix is not as straightforward as taking time off when that can create more work in the leadup, and another pile on your return (while those who remain take up the slack). Londoner Claire, 35, used to work 60-hour weeks, only able to catch up on sleep and laundry at the weekend. \u201cIt always got worse in summer \u2013 the bosses would take the full six weeks off work and come back all refreshed, while my \u2018holiday\u2019 was the August bank holiday weekend, when I\u2019d go to visit family and I\u2019d crash out from exhaustion.\u201d Bijlani sees only the most severe cases of burnout at the Priory, but she lays the blame with a culture that frames overwork as the norm, and the technology that facilitates it. She urges people to observe strict limits on work, and to put themselves first: if that sounds indulgent, she says, it\u2019s only more evidence of the ridiculous state we\u2019re in. Work-life balance should be for everyone, not just those at the tops of their fields. \u201cI\u2019ve had people come in and say, \u2018It\u2019s all right for the CEO to do that, but I can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d says Bijlani. \u201cIt needs to filter down.\u201d Siobhan Murray, a resilience coach, psychotherapist and author of The Burnout Solution, says the pressure is built into society \u2013 from millennials who have had their worth eroded by competitive but unpaid internships and unstable work (\u201cBy the time they\u2019re into their late 20s, they\u2019re already burned out\u201d) to thirtysomethings racing to achieve the \u201cbizarre goal\u201d of retiring by 40. Others took on more obligations, such as caring for their elderly parents, without thinking to let go of others, only realising they were overcommitted when they reached breaking point. Of Murray\u2019s 12 current clients, more than half had been signed off work with burnout on their doctors\u2019 orders \u2013 some for as long as two months. \u201cThere are degrees of burnout,\u201d she says, \u201cand the average Guardian reader isn\u2019t necessarily at that high end where they\u2019re being signed off or going to the Priory \u2013 but they could fast be approaching it.\u201d The discovery that a long-awaited getaway may not be as restorative as you had hoped can be a dismal wake-up call. Shorter, more regular holidays throughout the year can help \u2013 she suggests taking a week off every three months. We can dream of the introduction of a universal basic income or four-day working week \u2013 but for as long as burnout is the baseline of society, Murray says individuals must be realistic about the demands on their time. She recommends a regular \u201clife audit\u201d, reassessing commitments or goals to prioritise those that matter. \u201cYou can\u2019t hit a gym class in the morning and be a parent and travel with your job and see your friends because there are not enough hours in the day. We spring clean our houses; we have to get into the habit of doing that with our selves and our lives.\u201d A more balanced schedule \u2013 grounded in individual priorities and realistic expectations, and protected against every attempt to undermine it \u2013 may enable us to feel more in control of our lives, says Murray. \u201cIt\u2019s about being able to get into bed every night and say: \u2018OK, this didn\u2019t work, but this did, so you know what, I did a good job today.\u2019\u201d More openness about the pressures that many of us are under can help us realise that we are not alone, and seek help when we reach breaking point. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of personal failing to burnout, but it\u2019s not,\u201d says Murray. \u201cSometimes we just need to be able to say: \u2018I\u2019m not coping.\u2019\u201d The people who have successfully safeguarded themselves against burnout have learned to go easy on themselves, and they have defined personal boundaries that they defend against everything the world is going to throw at them. \u201cI can guarantee that those are not people who are never going to get burned out and who just have it all sorted,\u201d says Murray. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who have actually experienced it, and know what they have to pull back on in order to be able to live.\u201d And not just until the autumn. All names except Murray and Bijlani have been changed",

The French Professional Football League (LFP) said it would also breach L. 222-17 of the Sports Code, which stipulates that only players and clubs are allowed to pay an agent. \u201cA club president therefore can not, personally, directly fulfil the payment of commission to an agent,\u201d it added in a statement.</p> <p>The confidential letter, written in Arabic, also suggests that Khelaifi gave inaccurate information to Renaud Van Ruymbeke, a French judge who is an investigative magistrate, when he told him he did not have authority to sign. He told the judge: \u201cI did not have the signature \u2013 I could not order any expense\u201d for Oryx QSI in 2011. However, the letter was written on Oryx QSI notepaper and signed by Nasser.</p> <p>The letter is included as an PDF sent by email in a large tranche of documents seen by the Guardian and Mediapart. Information in the letter has been supplemented by documents from Football Leaks, obtained by the German news magazine Der Spiegel.</p> <p>It appears to describe an operation ordered by the current emir of Qatar, which aims to pay \u2013 through Khelaifi and the company Oryx QSI \u2013 an undisclosed commission to an agent.</p> <p>The letter, apparently from Khelaifi, is addressed to \u201cHis Excellency Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa Al Thani, Chief of Staff of His Highness the Crown Prince\u201d, and includes the subject line: \u201cCommission of the agent in charge of the player Javier Pastore and expenses of the company Oryx QSI.\u201d</p> <p>In the letter Khelaifi writes that his letter is \u201cbased on verbal instructions given by His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, heir to the throne, may God protect and conserve him, regarding the payment of the commission due to the agent in charge of the player Javier Pastore amounting to 2 million euros (2,000,000) in exchange for his transfer from the Italian club of Palermo to Paris Saint Germain, in addition to the expenses of Oryx QSI, amounting to US $200,000 (two hundred thousand US dollars).\u201d</p> <p>Details of where to make the payments are then given, before Khelaifi adds: \u201cWe thank you for your help and cooperation with us. Please accept, Your Excellency, the expression of my respect.\u201d</p> <p>Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani succeeded his father as emir of Qatar in 2013.</p> <p>When contacted by the Guardian with detailed questions, Khelaifi\u2019s lawyers initially responded by saying that the states leading the blockade of Qatar \u2013 which includes Saudi Arabia, UAE and their allies \u2013 had circulated \u201ca huge amount of misleading information and fabricated documentation purportedly referring to the State of Qatar and the activities of various of its citizens\u201d.</p> <p>They added: \u201cIn these circumstances \u2026 our client cannot admit either the authenticity of the material you have described but refused to provide \u2026 or the various conclusions you seek to draw from this.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian and Mediapart offered precise information allowing Khelaifi to find the email regarding Pastore in his mailbox, as well as an English translation of the typed letter in the attachment.</p> <p>On Monday evening, after publication of this story, lawyers for Khelaifi said that the document had been forged. \u201cOur client will be filing a criminal complaint for forgery and use of forgery in France.\u201d</p> <p>Representatives for both Thanis refused to comment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b061da9ca024d2bb023a0c4b6efe2c205eb6d521\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b061da9ca024d2bb023a0c4b6efe2c205eb6d521/750_51_2321_1393/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Javier Pastore played for PSG from 2011 to 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Javier Pastore played for PSG from 2011 to 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Berry/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Khelaifi has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/23/paris-saint-germain-football-president-nasser-al-khelaifi-faces-corruption-inquiry\">received a preliminary charge of \u201cactive corruption\u201d</a> as part of an inquiry into the bidding process for the 2017 and 2019 World Athletics Championships. During the bid a payment of $3.5m payment was made from Oryx to the marketing executive Papa Massata Diack which the French authorities suspect was a bribe.</p> <p>Pastore\u2019s agent Marcelo Simonian said he \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d the company Oryx QSI and that he did not negotiate the transfer of Pastore with Khelaifi. \u201cWith Nasser, we speak, we shake hands,\u201d he added. \u201cBut the negotiation was done by phone with Leonardo [the sporting director of PSG].\u201d</p> <p>Simonian held 50% of the player\u2019s economic rights under third-party ownership and was therefore entitled to half of the \u20ac40m transfer fee excluding bonuses \u2013 although he is still in dispute with Palermo over the payment.</p> <p>The Argentinian was also representing Palermo in the deal although, under the French and international rules prohibiting an agent to represent several parties in the same operation, he was not allowed to be paid by PSG for the transfer.</p> <p>However, confidential documents from Football Leaks appear to show that on 15 September 2011, a month after the transfer, a colleague of Simonian contacted the French lawyer Emmanuel Moulin about the Pastore deal \u2013 and asked him to get in touch with PSG to claim an amount which the club owed to Simonian. Football Leaks documents also suggest that Simonian was informed of this request.</p> <p>According to those documents, an employee of Moulin\u2019s law firm contacted Simonian and his acquaintance the next day, to tell them that Moulin had been in touch with PSG and that the club had confirmed that the payment was made.

      "bodyText": "Nasser al-Khelaifi, the president of Paris Saint-Germain, appears to have sought payments for an agent which could have violated transfer regulations, and to have given inaccurate information to a French judge, according to leaked documents.

The French Professional Football League (LFP) said it would also breach L. 222-17 of the Sports Code, which stipulates that only players and clubs are allowed to pay an agent. \u201cA club president therefore can not, personally, directly fulfil the payment of commission to an agent,\u201d it added in a statement. The confidential letter, written in Arabic, also suggests that Khelaifi gave inaccurate information to Renaud Van Ruymbeke, a French judge who is an investigative magistrate, when he told him he did not have authority to sign. He told the judge: \u201cI did not have the signature \u2013 I could not order any expense\u201d for Oryx QSI in 2011. However, the letter was written on Oryx QSI notepaper and signed by Nasser. The letter is included as an PDF sent by email in a large tranche of documents seen by the Guardian and Mediapart. Information in the letter has been supplemented by documents from Football Leaks, obtained by the German news magazine Der Spiegel. It appears to describe an operation ordered by the current emir of Qatar, which aims to pay \u2013 through Khelaifi and the company Oryx QSI \u2013 an undisclosed commission to an agent. The letter, apparently from Khelaifi, is addressed to \u201cHis Excellency Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa Al Thani, Chief of Staff of His Highness the Crown Prince\u201d, and includes the subject line: \u201cCommission of the agent in charge of the player Javier Pastore and expenses of the company Oryx QSI.\u201d In the letter Khelaifi writes that his letter is \u201cbased on verbal instructions given by His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, heir to the throne, may God protect and conserve him, regarding the payment of the commission due to the agent in charge of the player Javier Pastore amounting to 2 million euros (2,000,000) in exchange for his transfer from the Italian club of Palermo to Paris Saint Germain, in addition to the expenses of Oryx QSI, amounting to US $200,000 (two hundred thousand US dollars).\u201d Details of where to make the payments are then given, before Khelaifi adds: \u201cWe thank you for your help and cooperation with us. Please accept, Your Excellency, the expression of my respect.\u201d Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani succeeded his father as emir of Qatar in 2013. When contacted by the Guardian with detailed questions, Khelaifi\u2019s lawyers initially responded by saying that the states leading the blockade of Qatar \u2013 which includes Saudi Arabia, UAE and their allies \u2013 had circulated \u201ca huge amount of misleading information and fabricated documentation purportedly referring to the State of Qatar and the activities of various of its citizens\u201d. They added: \u201cIn these circumstances \u2026 our client cannot admit either the authenticity of the material you have described but refused to provide \u2026 or the various conclusions you seek to draw from this.\u201d The Guardian and Mediapart offered precise information allowing Khelaifi to find the email regarding Pastore in his mailbox, as well as an English translation of the typed letter in the attachment. On Monday evening, after publication of this story, lawyers for Khelaifi said that the document had been forged. \u201cOur client will be filing a criminal complaint for forgery and use of forgery in France.\u201d Representatives for both Thanis refused to comment. Khelaifi has received a preliminary charge of \u201cactive corruption\u201d as part of an inquiry into the bidding process for the 2017 and 2019 World Athletics Championships. During the bid a payment of $3.5m payment was made from Oryx to the marketing executive Papa Massata Diack which the French authorities suspect was a bribe. Pastore\u2019s agent Marcelo Simonian said he \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d the company Oryx QSI and that he did not negotiate the transfer of Pastore with Khelaifi. \u201cWith Nasser, we speak, we shake hands,\u201d he added. \u201cBut the negotiation was done by phone with Leonardo [the sporting director of PSG].\u201d Simonian held 50% of the player\u2019s economic rights under third-party ownership and was therefore entitled to half of the \u20ac40m transfer fee excluding bonuses \u2013 although he is still in dispute with Palermo over the payment. The Argentinian was also representing Palermo in the deal although, under the French and international rules prohibiting an agent to represent several parties in the same operation, he was not allowed to be paid by PSG for the transfer. However, confidential documents from Football Leaks appear to show that on 15 September 2011, a month after the transfer, a colleague of Simonian contacted the French lawyer Emmanuel Moulin about the Pastore deal \u2013 and asked him to get in touch with PSG to claim an amount which the club owed to Simonian. Football Leaks documents also suggest that Simonian was informed of this request. According to those documents, an employee of Moulin\u2019s law firm contacted Simonian and his acquaintance the next day, to tell them that Moulin had been in touch with PSG and that the club had confirmed that the payment was made. There was no indication of the sum involved. Presented with this information, Simonian any denied any wrongdoing. \u201cMaybe you have misread or badly translated,\u201d he replied. He said he did \u201cnot remember\u201d such an exchange, adding that he \u201cnever asked PSG to be paid\u201d regarding the transfer of Pastore. \u201cNeither me nor Emmanuel Moulin have received any commission on the transfer of Pastore. Zero,\u201d he added. \u201cI could not receive a commission because I was the co-owner of the player.\u201d Moulin declined to comment on the request for payment to PSG. But he rejected \u201cwith the utmost vigour\u201d that there had been any wrongdoing or compliance issues regarding Pastore\u2019s transfer or in the way it was reported to French football authorities. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 July after a further response from Khelaifi\u2019s lawyers.",

      "bodyText": "Labor is urging the Coalition to boost the Newstart payment after the government bowed to public pressure to lift the income of almost 700,000 aged pensioners by changing the deeming rate. Following the government\u2019s announcement on Sunday to lower the deeming rates used to calculate pension income, the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the Coalition needed to shift its focus to the \u201cinadequate\u201d Newstart benefit. The call comes as the Australian Council of Social Service launches a \u201craise the rate\u201d campaign to lobby MPs to immediately lift the single rate of Newstart, youth allowance and other related payments by at least $75 per week. \u201cThe ball is in the government\u2019s court, and we call on the government to take into account the well-founded and well-motivated concerns which have been raised by a number of groups now about Newstart and its inadequacy,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cWe call on them to respond in good faith and in good time to these concerns, which have been rightly and understandably raised for some time now, including by the Labor party.\u201d While declining to nominate a dollar figure for the proposed increase, Chalmers said the government needed to take up Labor\u2019s pre-election pledge for a review into the Newstart payment, given action was needed \u201cright now\u201d. \u201cBecause there are such big dollars involved in any changes to Newstart, and because we\u2019re talking about interactions with other payments in the social security system, and other programs provided by government, it\u2019s important that you factor all of that in,\u201d he said. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cThat task is best done by government. We had intended really by now to have a review up and running, which relied heavily on the agencies of government and other external bodies to make sure that we got it right.\u201d The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said the government was focused on helping people into jobs but acknowledged people were \u201cdoing it tough\u201d. \u201cI am very conscious of the struggle that many people have when they are living off welfare,\u201d Frydenberg said. \u201cOur focus for the people on Newstart is helping to create the environment where they get a job, because that is the best thing you can do for someone who is on Newstart, helping them into the workforce.\u201d He said that more than 90% of people on Newstart received support from another benefit, such as a parenting payment or rent assistance, and two-thirds of people on the payment found a job within 12 months. \u201cPeople are doing it tough out there, and we are very conscious of that,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time the focus for the government is on responsible economic management reducing their overall tax burden, creating jobs, rewarding effort and encouraging aspiration.\u201d The social services minister, Anne Ruston, said the government had no plans to boost the Newstart payment. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably heard it a million times and you\u2019re going to hear it a million again \u2013 the best form of welfare is a job,\u201d Ruston told Sky News. The government\u2019s resistance to lifting the Newstart payment comes after a Deloitte Access Economics report last year found a $75-a-week increase to Newstart would lead to a boost in consumer spending, and create more than 10,000 jobs. The report said that increasing the incomes of more than 700,000 people by $10.71 a day would cost the federal budget $3.3bn a year. Unlike the pension, the Newstart payment is linked to prices rather than wages and, since 1994, when the unemployment benefit was last increased in \u201creal terms\u201d, wages have grown 40% faster than prices.",

They dismissed the cultural sensitivities and safety concerns. \u201cWe\u2019re going to close down Bondi Beach because there are some people that have drowned?\u201d Hanson said. \u201cHow ridiculous is that? \u201cI can\u2019t see the cultural sensitivity when people have been climbing the rock for all these years, and all of a sudden they want to shut it down? I don\u2019t get it, I really don\u2019t get it, and how are they going to pay back the Australian taxpayer?\u201d Price argued people should be able to climb the rock because we \u201cgo on the outside of the Harbour Bridge\u201d and go diving on the Great Barrier Reef. Today\u2019s executive producer, Steven Burling, rejected comparisons to the notorious all-white stolen generations segment on Sunrise, which breached broadcasting codes for accuracy and provoked serious contempt on the basis of race. \u201cThese are white holidaymakers going there and being seen as disrespectful as opposed to Indigenous Australians and whether or not they are stolen,\u201d Burling told Guardian Australia. \u201cWhatever your personal views on these senators [who appear on Today], clearly they resonate with a large proportion of Australia and they are articulating a whack of mainstream Australia\u2019s views. But they are also challenged when they are on, they don\u2019t get an easy ride.\u201d Burling said Boney had a chance to express her view as a Gamilaroi woman in a segment on Today Extra, a morning show that follows Today. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Indigenous people having some sort of say over what happened on their lands, they\u2019re sacred sites,\u201d Boney said hours after the Hanson segment. \u201cThe thing about [Uluru] is it is so sacred to them every time someone gets injured or hurt or has to be airlifted out ... it hurts them and they say that the ancestors mourn the loss of those people. They are not doing it to be nasty or protective of themselves, they are doing it to protect others.\u201d Co-hosts Boney and David Campbell and two guests, Shelly Horton and John Mangos, all condemned Hanson\u2019s views.",

      "body": "<p>Shamefully perhaps, I\u2019d never heard of \u201cmum-shaming\u201d until I read that Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, was being trolled on Instagram for not holding her new baby correctly. When I Googled it, the top stories were all of Meghan holding baby Archie in the Sun, the Express and the Daily Mirror.</p> <p>Although these \u201ccruel trolls\u201d were largely anonymous, they were widely quoted by the papers. One, according to the Mirror, wrote: \u201cWhy can\u2019t she hold the baby properly after two months? Clearly the nanny looks after him most of the time.\u201d</p> <p>It seems fair to say that the relationship between the American actor who married Prince Harry and the press has reached new lows.</p> <p>Although there were already signs that the media had fallen out of love with Markle earlier this year, she hasn\u2019t even been awarded the usual sympathy afforded to new mothers.</p> <p>In the past week, the papers have used a \u201cbody language expert\u201d to confirm the antagonism between Meghan and her sister-in-law. They were \u201ctwo mothers wrapped up and lost in their own worlds,\u201d said the \u201cexpert\u201d as if that were unusual, rather than a sign that they were looking after a newborn and three young children.</p> <p>Then there was the fact that Meghan wore jeans to Wimbledon and asked security to stop people taking pictures. At the heart of these disputes is the desire of both Harry and Meghan to keep as much of their lives private as possible and to keep control of their image. The decision to refuse to let the media in on Archie\u2019s christening \u2013 thus denying the media lucrative pictures of godparents holding the latest member of the Royal family \u2013 led to howls of press outrage.</p> <p>At the fulcrum, or perhaps nadir, of any Meghan criticism is usually Piers Morgan, who last week wrote a \u201c10-point guide to becoming a popular princess\u201d (and no, I\u2019m not making this up). \u201cAll you need to do to help charities is turn up, shake hands, smile, empathise and listen,\u201d he noted, extolling the virtues of a generation of Royals that did just that and would never dream of working in film.</p> <p>Although the coverage of this 37-year-old woman with a career and life of her own has been intolerable at times, the young royals are playing a dangerous game if they think they can cut out the media completely. This becomes apparent when the public purse is called on for exceptional circumstances which, unlike weddings, none of us see.</p> <p>In a country where so many of its citizens live in substandard housing they will never own, the cost of housing the royals is the most obvious story of this kind. As one former Royal insider said, \u201cthere has never been a popular refurbishment story\u201d. The \u00a3369m refit of Buckingham Palace agreed in 2016 caused some outrage even though they stressed the importance of the historic building and it came as the country needed some pomp-and-glory ballast.</p> <p>And so we come to the outrage over the cost of the refurbishment of the new Sussex residence in the grounds of Windsor castle. Accounts revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/26/harry-meghan-refurb-royals-home-improvements\" title=\"\">\u00a32.4m of tax</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/26/harry-meghan-refurb-royals-home-improvements\" title=\"\">payers\u2019 money</a> had been spent turning five properties back to a single home. Although the press officers stressed the need to modernise the plumbing, there were rumours of designers and a \u00a35,000 copper bath.</p> <p>Talk to anyone who has worked for the royal family and they say it\u2019s ludicrous to suggest that Meghan and Harry can pop into Ikea to decorate their first home.

      "bodyText": "Shamefully perhaps, I\u2019d never heard of \u201cmum-shaming\u201d until I read that Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, was being trolled on Instagram for not holding her new baby correctly. When I Googled it, the top stories were all of Meghan holding baby Archie in the Sun, the Express and the Daily Mirror. Although these \u201ccruel trolls\u201d were largely anonymous, they were widely quoted by the papers. One, according to the Mirror, wrote: \u201cWhy can\u2019t she hold the baby properly after two months? Clearly the nanny looks after him most of the time.\u201d It seems fair to say that the relationship between the American actor who married Prince Harry and the press has reached new lows. Although there were already signs that the media had fallen out of love with Markle earlier this year, she hasn\u2019t even been awarded the usual sympathy afforded to new mothers. In the past week, the papers have used a \u201cbody language expert\u201d to confirm the antagonism between Meghan and her sister-in-law. They were \u201ctwo mothers wrapped up and lost in their own worlds,\u201d said the \u201cexpert\u201d as if that were unusual, rather than a sign that they were looking after a newborn and three young children. Then there was the fact that Meghan wore jeans to Wimbledon and asked security to stop people taking pictures. At the heart of these disputes is the desire of both Harry and Meghan to keep as much of their lives private as possible and to keep control of their image. The decision to refuse to let the media in on Archie\u2019s christening \u2013 thus denying the media lucrative pictures of godparents holding the latest member of the Royal family \u2013 led to howls of press outrage. At the fulcrum, or perhaps nadir, of any Meghan criticism is usually Piers Morgan, who last week wrote a \u201c10-point guide to becoming a popular princess\u201d (and no, I\u2019m not making this up). \u201cAll you need to do to help charities is turn up, shake hands, smile, empathise and listen,\u201d he noted, extolling the virtues of a generation of Royals that did just that and would never dream of working in film. Although the coverage of this 37-year-old woman with a career and life of her own has been intolerable at times, the young royals are playing a dangerous game if they think they can cut out the media completely. This becomes apparent when the public purse is called on for exceptional circumstances which, unlike weddings, none of us see. In a country where so many of its citizens live in substandard housing they will never own, the cost of housing the royals is the most obvious story of this kind. As one former Royal insider said, \u201cthere has never been a popular refurbishment story\u201d. The \u00a3369m refit of Buckingham Palace agreed in 2016 caused some outrage even though they stressed the importance of the historic building and it came as the country needed some pomp-and-glory ballast. And so we come to the outrage over the cost of the refurbishment of the new Sussex residence in the grounds of Windsor castle. Accounts revealed that \u00a32.4m of taxpayers\u2019 money had been spent turning five properties back to a single home. Although the press officers stressed the need to modernise the plumbing, there were rumours of designers and a \u00a35,000 copper bath. Talk to anyone who has worked for the royal family and they say it\u2019s ludicrous to suggest that Meghan and Harry can pop into Ikea to decorate their first home. This argument suggests that complaints over spending a lot on a house is ridiculous when you tot up the amount spent on the entire royal family, tourism revenues or no. Which is a dangerous way to go for monarchists, of course. Stories like the one that appeared in Business Insider last year detailing the 13 royals living in Kensington Palace at the very least remind UK taxpayers of quite how many royals there are. Harry has tried to circumvent the tabloid press and both he and Meghan must wonder how an industry in decline for much of the past 20 years can still hold such sway. But, as public servants, there are different rules of engagement. The media treatment of Meghan highlights some of its worst cruelties, yet a truly private life can only be enjoyed by those not paid for by the state. Although the monarchy is having a bit of a moment with a nonagenarian as head of state, goodwill can be lost in the time it takes to choose a Farrow &amp; Ball paint colour.",

Tlass was not just the tennis partner of the shy ophthalmologist who was presiding over the greatest crisis of the Arab spring; they were close, indeed intimate, family friends. Tlass had been alarmed by Assad\u2019s brutal crackdown since protests erupted in the southern city of Daraa in March 2011: young people inspired by the historic changes taking place in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya called for dignity, freedom and the overthrow of their own oppressive regime.

Assad\u2019s reaction to Daraa, advised by his younger brother Maher and cousin Hafez Makhlouf, was to double down on repression. Crucially, he also released hundreds of Islamists who had previously been encouraged to fight the post-Saddam Hussein US occupation of Iraq, but were imprisoned when they returned home. The result was that the slogan \u201cselmiya\u201d (peacefully) was drowned out by the blast of jihadist suicide bombings (some faked by the regime) and barrel bomb attacks. In the early days, there was debate in western capitals about how Assad would respond: one clue was that his accession in 2000 had been followed by a short-lived \u201cDamascus spring\u201d. Talk of reform was in the air then, though it was largely about economic liberalisation for the privileged and did not impinge on the \u201cbarrier of fear\u201d maintained by different branches of the ubiquitous mukhabarat secret police.

It will be even stronger when the drink is ready,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Her husband, Salem al-Azouq, a man in his mid-40s, is out picking in the small field behind his house, which is filled with roses of the same shade.</p> <p>\u201cThere was nothing here when we came five years ago. It looked like that,\u201d he says, pointing to the wheat plantations on either side of the plot.</p> <p>It is six years now since they came to Lebanon, and five years since they moved to the makeshift house at the edge of the plantation. Before that, they were in a refugee camp, like many of the 1 to 2 million Syrians in the country.</p> <p>Al-Azouq works quickly and with ease. He only picks large buds, leaving the smaller ones for later. Now, during the season, he harvests two or three times a week, preferably in the early morning.</p> <p>\u201cThat is the best time. The rose is still asleep, holding on to its fragrance,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2664f14464c51b687d5066ab2a2e95d0dba1d23e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2664f14464c51b687d5066ab2a2e95d0dba1d23e/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Salem al-Azouq picks roses at his planation in the Bekaa valley, Lebanon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Salem al-Azouq picks roses at his planation in the Bekaa valley, Lebanon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alia Haju</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Behind his back, in the far distance, lies the mountain range separating Lebanon from Syria. Al-Azouq\u2019s home village is beyond those mountains, in a farming area near Damascus.</p> <p>He started coming to Lebanon in 2006 for seasonal work, just like hundreds of thousands of other Syrians. It was always in cultivation: roses and trees were his speciality. Then, the war came. The couple, with their small twin daughters and baby son, fled.</p> <p>\u201cWe had just spent all our savings on building a house. Nothing is left of it now. You don\u2019t even hear birds singing in our village today,\u201d says al-Azouq.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"444fc20e1ea99fddbb561a30894482771bd5036d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/444fc20e1ea99fddbb561a30894482771bd5036d/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ahmad stands near his father Salem al-Zarda as he picks roses at his rose planation in the Bekaa valley, Lebanon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two-year-old Ahmad stands near his father as he picks roses at his planation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alia Haju</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His youngest son, two-year-old Ahmad, follows his father through the field. When they pass by a tap and buckets being filled up, he stops to play with the water. Al-Azouq points to the different things he grows: red and white roses for people\u2019s gardens, trees about to bear fruit, rosemary, basil and lavender. But the star is a bright pink rose with a fragrant smell, the one he was picking earlier.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the sultani, the best kind of rose. No other has the same strong flavour,\u201d he says.</p> <p>For the rose growers of Lebanon and Syria (lands that gave name to the Damascus rose, cherished by Shakespeare, the Babylonians and ancient Egyptians), this is what ultimately matters. Most of their roses go into making one of the most significant culinary products in the region: rose water.</p> <p>This scented liquid, still produced with the same distillation technique that 11th-century medical scholar Ibn Sina invented, is used in a range of Middle Eastern recipes. Lebanese and Syrians add it to their cheese dessert kanafeh, as well as their date cookies and syrupy baklava. Turks and Iranians flavour ice cream and Turkish delight with it; Indians their lassi.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3580f6ae43a0bc5fca1c22234200529c19fcbb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3580f6ae43a0bc5fca1c22234200529c19fcbb8/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nahla al-Zarda pours a rose drink, inside her kitchen at their rose planation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nahla al-Zarda pours a rose drink inside her kitchen at their rose planation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alia Haju</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sweets aside, rose water has always had an important place in folk medicine as well, and is used for ailments including digestive issues, high blood pressure and insomnia.</p> <p>\u201cFor us, it is part of our tradition of mouneh, preserving food for the winter.

      "bodyText": "When the plastic bucket is filled with roses, Nahla al-Zarda takes it into the kitchen, where she separates the petals from the buds. She soaks them in boiling water, which blushes pink. \u201cI love this colour. It will be even stronger when the drink is ready,\u201d she says. Her husband, Salem al-Azouq, a man in his mid-40s, is out picking in the small field behind his house, which is filled with roses of the same shade. \u201cThere was nothing here when we came five years ago. It looked like that,\u201d he says, pointing to the wheat plantations on either side of the plot. It is six years now since they came to Lebanon, and five years since they moved to the makeshift house at the edge of the plantation. Before that, they were in a refugee camp, like many of the 1 to 2 million Syrians in the country. Al-Azouq works quickly and with ease. He only picks large buds, leaving the smaller ones for later. Now, during the season, he harvests two or three times a week, preferably in the early morning. \u201cThat is the best time. The rose is still asleep, holding on to its fragrance,\u201d he says. Behind his back, in the far distance, lies the mountain range separating Lebanon from Syria. Al-Azouq\u2019s home village is beyond those mountains, in a farming area near Damascus. He started coming to Lebanon in 2006 for seasonal work, just like hundreds of thousands of other Syrians. It was always in cultivation: roses and trees were his speciality. Then, the war came. The couple, with their small twin daughters and baby son, fled. \u201cWe had just spent all our savings on building a house. Nothing is left of it now. You don\u2019t even hear birds singing in our village today,\u201d says al-Azouq. His youngest son, two-year-old Ahmad, follows his father through the field. When they pass by a tap and buckets being filled up, he stops to play with the water. Al-Azouq points to the different things he grows: red and white roses for people\u2019s gardens, trees about to bear fruit, rosemary, basil and lavender. But the star is a bright pink rose with a fragrant smell, the one he was picking earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s the sultani, the best kind of rose. No other has the same strong flavour,\u201d he says. For the rose growers of Lebanon and Syria (lands that gave name to the Damascus rose, cherished by Shakespeare, the Babylonians and ancient Egyptians), this is what ultimately matters. Most of their roses go into making one of the most significant culinary products in the region: rose water. This scented liquid, still produced with the same distillation technique that 11th-century medical scholar Ibn Sina invented, is used in a range of Middle Eastern recipes. Lebanese and Syrians add it to their cheese dessert kanafeh, as well as their date cookies and syrupy baklava. Turks and Iranians flavour ice cream and Turkish delight with it; Indians their lassi. Sweets aside, rose water has always had an important place in folk medicine as well, and is used for ailments including digestive issues, high blood pressure and insomnia. \u201cFor us, it is part of our tradition of mouneh, preserving food for the winter. This is how we capture the flavours of the season,\u201d says Lebanese food writer Barbara Massaad. The couple do not produce rose water themselves \u2013 they do not have the equipment, and al-Azouq\u2019s expertise lies in cultivation and growing. They sell to others in Lebanon doing distillation, both in the Bekaa Valley and on the coast. Salem al-Zarda scatters rose petals inside a greenhouse, to dry them for use in a herbal tea mixture Despite the history that Lebanon shares with Syria, and the many family ties that cut across the border, anti-Syrian attitudes have been growing in the country. Refugee settlements have been raided and families evicted, and municipalities have imposed curfews on Syrians. \u201cFamilies are not allowed to leave the camps without a permit, not even to buy water or see the doctor,\u201d says Doha Adi from the organisation Sawa for Development and Aid. After several years of extending great hospitality to Syrian refugees, Lebanon has been struggling with an economic crisis and foreign minister Gebran Bassil recently made anti-refugee statements on Twitter and in speeches. \u201cThis way, people are steered towards blaming refugees for their worries, even when they have nothing to do with it,\u201d says Adi. Nahla al-Zarda washes rose petals in her kitchen to make a rose drink Cultivating roses, al-Azouq and al-Zarda work in one of only three sectors legally open for Syrians: agriculture, construction and waste management. They pay rent for their land, as all refugees do, including the majority of those living in camps. \u201cThe flowers we grow are from Syria. We brought seeds with us when we left,\u201d says al-Azouq.

Tapping into that sentiment afforded Hopper and the trailblazers who\u2019d follow his example their own version of the liberty he first prized without romanticizing. After all, as Wyatt mumbles around a lonely campfire, they blew it. Back in the real world beyond the frame, Hopper blew it too, parlaying the film\u2019s popularity into his wrongfully maligned and slowly reclaimed follow-up The Last Movie, a financial failure that killed his career as a director for the rest of the \u201970s. But for the summer of Easy Rider, he and his crew could live like their own biker gang, roving around and seeing what there is to see. For a film-maker, a workable budget might as well be a tube of coke money, and final cut rights feel a lot like freedom.",

A good spot in the actual city is <strong>L\u00e5ngholmsbadet</strong>, a small beach on the north shore of L\u00e5ngholmen Island, where you can swim, relax on the sand or lawns, and there are plenty of places for a coffee or a meal. There used to be a prison here, which has now been converted into a <a href=\"https://langholmen.com/en/hotell/\" title=\"\">hotel and hoste</a><a href=\"https://langholmen.com/en/hotell/\" title=\"\">l</a> (doubles from \u00a348 room-only). A few hundred metres to the west of the beach you can dive from the rocks at <strong>Klippbadet</strong>.

Several companies offer short guided tours and longer trips. A steamboat ride is a good choice: the <strong>SS Blid\u00f6sund</strong>, built in 1910 navigates the outer archipelago, while the slightly older <strong>Mariefred</strong> travels on Lake M\u00e4laren, in the north-east of the city. Blid\u00f6sund is also used for special tours to the more distant islands.<br>\u2022 <em>SS Blid\u00f6sund </em><em>from \u00a315 return, </em><em><a href=\"http://www.blidosundsbolaget.se\" title=\"\">blidosundsbolaget.se</a>; Mariefred </em><em>from \u00a37.20 return, <a href=\"http://www.mariefred.info\" title=\"\">mariefred.info</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Newer Nordic cuisine</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bff76b6e60b3200f5f36a0ee387797cb85a0abe3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bff76b6e60b3200f5f36a0ee387797cb85a0abe3/0_966_2358_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"TV chef Niklaus Ekstedt has gone back to basics in his latest Stockholm restaurant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>At <strong>Ekstedt</strong>, a fine-dining restaurant in the city centre, all the cooking is done with fire: in a fire pit, a wood-fired oven, wood stove and smokers. The chef/owner, Niklas Ekstedt, uses these 19th-century cooking techniques to create his version of new Nordic cuisine, with dishes such as hay-infused sweetbreads and salsify, birch-fired lamb with ramson capers, and flamed rhubarb. The wine selection is exciting and the service splendid. It\u2019s not cheap, of course (the four-course tasting menu is \u00a378), but it\u2019s worth it for the changing aromas and the interplay of flavours and textures.<br>\u2022 <em>Humleg\u00e5rdsgatan 17, Subway \u00d6stermalmstorg,</em> <em><a href=\"https://ekstedt.nu\" title=\"\">ekstedt.nu</a></em></p> <h2>Street food</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07c9d117c01cb00a12bca84145af8e0f87627f98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07c9d117c01cb00a12bca84145af8e0f87627f98/0_28_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customer at the snack bar with sale of freshly fried herring at Sodermalmstorg in Stockholm.MJDMP6 Stockholm, Sweden - July 10, 2016: Customer at the snack bar with sale of freshly fried herring at Sodermalmstorg in Stockholm.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a crucial difference between Atlantic and Baltic herrings.

It is also the one used to make famously stinky <em>surstr\u00f6mming</em> \u2013 maybe the world\u2019s foulest smelling fermented fish, mostly eaten by people in the north of the country. A better introduction to the world of Baltic herring is the kiosk at <strong>Kornhamnstorg</strong> in the old town, where it\u2019s eaten fried on crisp bread \u2013 traditional poor man\u2019s food that has become fast food (\u00a33.50-\u00a37.50). Another Swedish street delicacy is <em>tunnbr\u00f6dsrulle</em>: sausages wrapped in a soft flatbread with mashed potatoes and \u2013 ta-da! \u2013 shrimp salad.

The queues are sometimes long but the quality is very good, whether you\u2019re buying matured Swedish cheese, Finnish liquorice, merguez, duck fat, veal kidneys or the special fermented Swedish sausage <em>isterband</em>.

One of the best is <strong>Centralbadet</strong>, which dates back to 1904 and retains its elegant <em>Jugend</em> (art nouveau) style. It is quiet, clean and spacious, decorated in shades of blue and purple, and you can relax in various pools, in dry and wet saunas, a steam bath or Jacuzzi, and also enjoy a beer or light meal. <br>\u2022 <em>Session \u00a324, including gym and spa, Drottninggatan 88, Subway H\u00f6torget, <a href=\"https://www.centralbadet.se/english/\" title=\"\">centralbadet.se</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Old-school dining</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e372044159f1895797bedfaf4ec5ebe6ca89cfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e372044159f1895797bedfaf4ec5ebe6ca89cfd/0_43_1962_1961/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tennstopet, Stockholm, Sweden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For traditional Swedish food in an old-fashioned setting, <strong>Tennstopet</strong> has it all: atmosphere, white linen, veteran waitresses and classic Swedish cuisine, including pickled herring, toast with shrimps and whitefish roe, pork and onion, and home-baked Swedish <em>sm\u00e5kakor</em> (small cookies).The daily-changing set lunch is \u00a311. It\u2019s famous as a haunt for spies, diplomats, actors, journalists and writers. The menu varies according to season, with special theme weeks like crayfish and surstr\u00f6mming in August, a goose supper in late autumn, hare in winter and a crow dinner (yes, really) in spring.

      "bodyText": "City swimming The Stockholm archipelago is surrounded by clean waters, so the wild bathing opportunities are numerous. A good spot in the actual city is L\u00e5ngholmsbadet, a small beach on the north shore of L\u00e5ngholmen Island, where you can swim, relax on the sand or lawns, and there are plenty of places for a coffee or a meal. There used to be a prison here, which has now been converted into a hotel and hostel (doubles from \u00a348 room-only). A few hundred metres to the west of the beach you can dive from the rocks at Klippbadet. On the way to the island, check out the hipster area around Hornstull, with its tattoo studios, cosy bars, restaurants and trendy barbers. \u2022 Subway Hornstull Steamboat rides Stockholm\u2019s archipelago is made up of around 24,000 islands, so a boat trip is definitely a good idea. Several companies offer short guided tours and longer trips. A steamboat ride is a good choice: the SS Blid\u00f6sund, built in 1910 navigates the outer archipelago, while the slightly older Mariefred travels on Lake M\u00e4laren, in the north-east of the city. Blid\u00f6sund is also used for special tours to the more distant islands. \u2022 SS Blid\u00f6sund from \u00a315 return, blidosundsbolaget.se; Mariefred from \u00a37.20 return, mariefred.info Newer Nordic cuisine At Ekstedt, a fine-dining restaurant in the city centre, all the cooking is done with fire: in a fire pit, a wood-fired oven, wood stove and smokers. The chef/owner, Niklas Ekstedt, uses these 19th-century cooking techniques to create his version of new Nordic cuisine, with dishes such as hay-infused sweetbreads and salsify, birch-fired lamb with ramson capers, and flamed rhubarb. The wine selection is exciting and the service splendid. It\u2019s not cheap, of course (the four-course tasting menu is \u00a378), but it\u2019s worth it for the changing aromas and the interplay of flavours and textures. \u2022 Humleg\u00e5rdsgatan 17, Subway \u00d6stermalmstorg, ekstedt.nu Street food There\u2019s a crucial difference between Atlantic and Baltic herrings. The latter is smaller and leaner, but also more complex in flavour. It is also the one used to make famously stinky surstr\u00f6mming \u2013 maybe the world\u2019s foulest smelling fermented fish, mostly eaten by people in the north of the country. A better introduction to the world of Baltic herring is the kiosk at Kornhamnstorg in the old town, where it\u2019s eaten fried on crisp bread \u2013 traditional poor man\u2019s food that has become fast food (\u00a33.50-\u00a37.50). Another Swedish street delicacy is tunnbr\u00f6dsrulle: sausages wrapped in a soft flatbread with mashed potatoes and \u2013 ta-da! \u2013 shrimp salad. Unforgettable, whether you like it or not. \u2022 Kornhamnstorg 4, Subway Gamla Food market Stockholm has three major indoor food markets, and H\u00f6torgshallen is the most down to earth, inexpensive and varied: as well as traditional Swedish sellers, there are foods from Latin America, North Africa, Finland, Central Europe and the Middle East. The queues are sometimes long but the quality is very good, whether you\u2019re buying matured Swedish cheese, Finnish liquorice, merguez, duck fat, veal kidneys or the special fermented Swedish sausage isterband. The sellers outside on H\u00f6torget Square have good mushrooms and berries, too. \u2022 Sergelgatan 29, Subway H\u00f6torget, hotorgshallen.se Cultural hub The centre of Stockholm doesn\u2019t have the canals and green parks that are abundant elsewhere in the capital, but it has its own late-modernist charm. Kulturhuset is a friendly five-storey fusion of library, theatre, cinema, art gallery, cafe, tourist information and culture centre. Here, chess geeks, cinephiles, children, pensioners and sightseers all gather under the same roof \u2013 a good starting point for a visit. On the top floor is the Panorama cafe, with views of the city and decent sandwiches and salads. \u2022 kulturhusetstadsteatern.se Swedish sauna In Sweden, the sauna is a big thing. People mostly take saunas at home, but there are quite a few public bathing houses, known as bastu (Swedish for \u201csweat bathing\u201d). One of the best is Centralbadet, which dates back to 1904 and retains its elegant Jugend (art nouveau) style. It is quiet, clean and spacious, decorated in shades of blue and purple, and you can relax in various pools, in dry and wet saunas, a steam bath or Jacuzzi, and also enjoy a beer or light meal. \u2022 Session \u00a324, including gym and spa, Drottninggatan 88, Subway H\u00f6torget, centralbadet.se Old-school dining For traditional Swedish food in an old-fashioned setting, Tennstopet has it all: atmosphere, white linen, veteran waitresses and classic Swedish cuisine, including pickled herring, toast with shrimps and whitefish roe, pork and onion, and home-baked Swedish sm\u00e5kakor (small cookies).The daily-changing set lunch is \u00a311. It\u2019s famous as a haunt for spies, diplomats, actors, journalists and writers. The menu varies according to season, with special theme weeks like crayfish and surstr\u00f6mming in August, a goose supper in late autumn, hare in winter and a crow dinner (yes, really) in spring. On the walls hang paintings by the many artists who have dined here over the past century and more. \u2022 Dalagatan 50, Subway Odenplan, tennstopet.se Grave matters Swedes love nature and tranquility and there\u2019s nowhere better to get a sense of this than walking among the trees, graves, chapels and woodlands of the Skogskyrkog\u00e5rden cemetery.

      "bodyText": "EU citizens who have been in the UK for fewer than five years and apply to remain in the UK after Brexit face further uncertainty because of a flaw in the Home Office phone app, it has emerged. A 31-year-old Swedish engineer who has applied to stay in Britain after Brexit discovered the defect in the app when he tried to convert his pre-settled status to settled status last week. Hugo Nilsson came to the UK in July 2014 and would have been eligible for full settled status this month, but was so anxious about his future in the country that he jumped at the chance to try to secure his rights as soon as he could. When the Home Office opened the national scheme for EU citizen residency rights in April, he applied for what is known as \u201cpre-settled status\u201d, a legal status created by the Home Office for those who have been in the country for fewer than five years but envisage remaining for longer. \u201cI applied in April. I didn\u2019t want to wait until July for full settled status just for peace of mind,\u201d said Nilsson. But when he reached his fifth anniversary on 5 July this year, \u201cthe computer said no\u201d and he was told that it was not technically possible to apply to convert his pre-settled status into settled status. \u201cI phoned the helpline and asked to speak to the supervisor of the team, and I was told they had not rolled out the functionality yet. I asked them when they would be doing that, and they said they did not know,\u201d he said. He said he felt the Home Office technology had now inadvertently derailed his plans to apply for citizenship in August, which would cement his status in the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit. \u201cI feel that they knew this when they launched the app and they should have had a warning saying, \u2018If you think you will be eligible for settled status shortly, you should hold off applying for settled status as you won\u2019t be able to convert it,\u201d said Nilsson. The Home Office admitted the existence of the flaw, but said it hoped the functionality would be available within weeks. \u201cMr Nilsson is one of almost 700,000 people who have already secured status through the EU Settlement Scheme. From the end of July, it will be possible for people with pre-settled status to convert to settled status as soon as they become eligible,\u201d said a spokesman. It is not the first technical flaw in the app. The Home Office had to admit it would only work on Android phones and not iPhones when a pilot scheme was launched last August. Apple is making the technology available to the Home Office this autumn to rectify this. Nilsson acknowledges the achievements of the Home Office in getting a new immigration app up and running in the short time it had, but said it should have communicated the shortcomings to applicants from the beginning. He also thinks the customer service centre should have been informed of the timeline and not just said they \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d when the functionality to convert status would be available.",

      "bodyText": "US campaigners who oppose the birth control pill have promoted a menstruation tracking app in \u201cthe most vulnerable communities\u201d in rural Nigeria with the backing of the Catholic church, the Guardian has learned. Prominent anti-abortion campaigners in New York developed and funded the Femm app, which collects intimate information about women\u2019s sex lives and sows doubt about hormonal birth control methods. The app has been downloaded more than 400,000 times globally, according to its developers, and appears to be the first ideologically aligned fertility tracking app. But leaders of the organization are also promoting the app and teaching the \u201cFemm methods\u201d of natural family planning in places such as rural Nigeria, where women are at high risk of HIV infection, child marriage and sexual violence. The Catholic church\u2019s diplomatic arm, the permanent observer mission of the Holy See at the United Nations, has promoted the Femm foundation and its app in speeches and events at the UN headquarters in New York. Femm also received a $100,000 grant from the Papal Foundation. Video footage uncovered by the Guardian shows a UN event called Affirming the Human Dignity of Rural Women and Girls through Healthcare and Education, where Femm\u2019s chief executive, Anna Halpine, described the company\u2019s work in Nigeria. The event at the UN Commission on the Status of Women was co-sponsored by the Holy See in March 2018. Halpine showed footage of Femm-trained teachers from an organization called Doctor\u2019s Health Initiative (DHI) speaking at what appeared to be a camp for displaced people in Nigeria. The footage shown at the UN side event showed DHI\u2019s employees teaching women about natural family planning methods. Femm promotes its app as a way to help women \u201cavoid or achieve\u201d pregnancy without hormonal birth control, by tracking their ovulation to determine their most fertile days of the month. However, the app offers no information on its efficacy, and the methods do not protect against sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV. Natural family planning methods have an up to 33% failure rate per 100 women per year, according to the most recent review in the journal Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology. Nigerian women are among the world\u2019s most vulnerable to maternal mortality, HIV infection, sexual violence, forced child marriage and genital mutilation. Abortion is illegal in Nigeria under almost all circumstances. These laws are \u201ca major contributor to the country\u2019s high levels of maternal death\u201d, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Halpine was introduced at the event by Archbishop Bernardito Auza, the permanent observerer of the Holy See to the United Nations, who said: \u201cVarious contemporary approaches to what is referred to as sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights do not respect this full dignity of the woman. \u201cThere is another way, a way in line with her dignity, a way that treats femininity in all its aspects as a gift rather than an imperfection, a disease, or a curse \u2026 Femm is a method that does just this.

At the event, Halpine told an audience that the Femm Foundation offered reproductive health education in \u201cthe most vulnerable communities in rural Nigeria\u201d, including in camps for people displaced by the Boko Haram terror group. DHI describes itself as a non-profit organization working in displaced persons camps in places such as Edo state in southern Nigeria, and Femm describes DHI as a \u201cpartner\u201d. DHI opposes abortion and birth control, according to the group\u2019s posts on social media. As recently as March 2019, DHI members marched in Lagos with signs reading, \u201cDon\u2019t use contraceptive, drug abuse is dangerous\u201d and \u201cAbortion is murder\u201d, according to video footage. The group did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian. The side event appears to be part of an ongoing relationship with the Catholic church, which co-sponsored an earlier event with Femm in 2016 called Investing to Expand Reproductive Health Programming. Reproductive rights groups in Nigeria called Femm\u2019s activities \u201cdisappointing and worrisome\u201d, and said the information it distributes falls in line with common myths about birth control and contraception. \u201cWe can\u2019t just say this app is just dealing with fertility,\u201d said Olabukunola Williams, executive director of Education as a Vaccine, a leading health and education non-profit. \u201cIt\u2019s dealing with the fact we\u2019re not providing accurate information [to women] about decision-making power.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just an app \u2013 it\u2019s feeding into more ways to deny power to young girls and young women,\u201d said Williams. In a statement, Halpine said Femm \u201cworks to ensure that women can know how their bodies work, and have access to health and fertility education to choose the options that work best for them. \u201cFemm is international, and cultivates partnerships and talent with researchers, providers, health educators and others in many countries around the world.\u201d The Roman Catholic church teaches that artificial contraception is a sin. More than 87% of Americans believe it is morally acceptable or not a moral issue, according to a 2016 Pew Research report. Modern birth control methods are used worldwide, are safe and effective, and were developed by a Catholic physician. Halpine is also founder and former CEO of World Youth Alliance, an anti-abortion organization whose work has often been cited by anti-abortion factions at the United Nations headquarters over the past two decades. An adviser to World Youth Alliance was recently appointed to the Trump administration\u2019s Commission on Unalienable Human Rights. Mary Ann Glendon is a prominent anti-abortion campaigner who has advised World Youth Alliance for years. \u201cPart of the way the Holy See exerts this influence is by using these organizations, like C-Fam, like this app organization, like World Youth Alliance,\u201d said Amanda Ussak, an expert in international Catholic relations at Catholics for Choice. Ussak said non-profits affiliated with the Holy See often use, \u201ctheir exact talking points, their exact language, to make it seem more widely accepted\u201d. \u201cMany women can\u2019t even control their sex lives,\u201d said Ussak.

      "bodyText": "Going to the hammam was once a beloved ritual for Aleppo resident Atef Shikhouni and his friends. Recalling the boisterous, joyful experience, the 55-year-old wrote: \u201cHere is a man shouting, \u2018Where is the soap?\u2019 while another one is asking for the shampoo and a third wants someone to rub his back. It becomes very noisy. After spending some time in the sauna, it is time for the \u2018rubbing man\u2019. He uses a rough loofah to rub my body mercilessly and I pray it will end without any damage.\u201d But that was before the outbreak of war in Syria. \u201cToday, the bath is cold and has no soul,\u201d the sports teacher wrote in February 2017, shortly after the worst of the fighting in Aleppo had ended. \u201cCruel are our days, exactly like our bath today.\u201d During the fierce four-year battle for the city, which ended in late 2016, the eastern, formerly rebel-held side was devastated by bombing. As the war in Syria appears to be nearing some kind of end there is much talk of reconstruction. But it\u2019s not just buildings and infrastructure that need to be rehabilitated, it\u2019s also the historical and cultural ties that once held together now fractured communities. Citizens from the northern city of Aleppo, including Shikhouni, have taken it upon themselves to salvage their heritage: they\u2019ve created a closed Facebook group where more than 52,000 Aleppians of different faiths and ethnicities share memories of their traditions and way of life before the war. \u201cI am afraid that we will lose a lot of tradition and vocabulary because of the immigration,\u201d says the group\u2019s head administrator, Souha Chaban, referring to the thousands of people who have left Aleppo since the Syrian war broke out in 2011. For example, lots of craftspeople have now left the country, Chaban explains.The 55-year-old mother-of-three no longer lives in Aleppo herself, having moved to Abu Dhabi with her family in 2006, and many of the group\u2019s members are living outside of the country. \u201cBut the Facebook group is a very good place because it has members all around the world who are here for two reasons: one, to give their knowledge, and two, to keep in touch with their heritage and their memories of the country.\u201d The Encyclopedia of Popular Aleppian Proverbs group began life, unsurprisingly, as a place where people from Aleppo could post local proverbs \u2013 of which there are many. But in the five-and-a-half years since the group was created it has evolved against the backdrop of the war to become a fount of knowledge on all aspects of the city\u2019s verbal heritage and beyond. One member recently posted about a 75-year-old laundry that has survived the war while another shared the steps he went through to obtain a student visa for Italy in the 1960s. Topics suggested for discussion have included a special head cloth worn by some of Aleppo\u2019s older men to different terms for a dustpan. Chaban, a former French teacher and the virtual neighbourhood\u2019s unofficial (and unpaid) archivist-in-chief, spends about 10 hours a day diligently documenting and categorising the information shared on the group. There are now more than 100 files on everything from local recipes and crafts to fashion and the city\u2019s hammam culture. Fawzi Shamsi, 35, a long-time member of the group who lives in Aleppo\u2019s western Halab Al Jadeedah (New Aleppo) neighbourhood, says: \u201cThe Facebook group [has] made us more connected to the city. People [who left] are really dreaming of getting back to Aleppo. So at least there\u2019s a kind of attachment to that place, a feeling that their soul is still there.\u201d Once a key stop on the ancient Silk Road trading network, Aleppo has a rich history \u2013 something that is reflected in both its famed cuisine and the distinctive local dialect.

      "body": "<p>Late in 2017, an <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/tabathaleggett/singers-only-british-millennials-knew-ever-existed\" title=\"\">article appeared on Buzzfeed</a> with the headline: \u201c33 Singers That Only Exist in the Mind of British Millennials\u201d. At No 9 was Kate Nash, the mid-noughties MySpace sensation who had a huge hit with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryH5cga0yUI\" title=\"\">Foundations</a> and went on to win best British female at the Brits. The article explained: \u201cShe was the cute vintage-dress-wearing girl we all wanted to be back in 2007. Presumably these days she\u2019s wearing baggy jumpers and DMs, but who knows?\u201d</p> <p>The article touched a nerve with Nash. Not long before it was published, she had been having a teeth-gnashing, snot-in-the-hair breakdown in Death Valley, California. Dropped by her label, in dispute with her manager, she was left bankrupt, broken, wailing at the \u201cwankers\u201d in the music industry. \u201cThis is a matter of life and death to me because making music keeps me alive \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/25/q-and-a-kate-nash-music-industry-has-killed-a-lot-of-people\" title=\"\">being in the music industry has almost killed me</a>,\u201d as she put it.</p> <p>That moment is captured in the documentary <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07ctstz\" title=\"\">Underestimate the Girl</a>, which went up on the BBC3 iPlayer channel at the end of June and has won Nash a wave of support. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve really loved is seeing my fans being really emotional about it,\u201d she says. \u201cMusicians have been messaging me saying: \u2018Oh my God, I was in tears watching this, the same thing happened to me.\u2019 I think a lot of musicians are in this same situation.\u201d</p> <p>I meet Nash at her favourite vegan cafe in Hackney, east London. She wears her red hair in bunches as she did in the MySpace days \u2013 but the slouchy sweatpants, vest top and toned physique suggest a new steeliness. That is partly due to her training regime for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2017/jun/22/glow-review-a-riotous-portrayal-of-the-piledriving-world-of-womens-wrestling\" title=\"\">Glow</a>, the Netflix wrestling comedy that has helped her recent career move into acting. But it also reflects someone who has learned their lessons the hard way.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryH5cga0yUI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ryH5cga0yUI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Nash stresses that the documentary was never supposed to be so raw. She was approached by the director Amy Goldstein after a performance at Coachella in 2014, when Nash was spending her own money touring the punky songs from her self-released album <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17787-kate-nash-girl-talk/\" title=\"\">Girl Talk</a>. The intention was to make an upbeat, vaguely empowering story about a kooky English musician moving to Los Angeles and making a comeback. It became a kind of millennial female version of the Bros documentary, with Nash forced into ever more humiliating compromises to make her music. But the \u201cshit really hit the fan\u201d when she discovered that what money she had managed to scrape together had been spent, leading to a total breakdown in her relationship with her new manager, Gary Marella.<strong> </strong>\u201cI guess I just decided to keep filming because I felt like it was a really important story to tell,\u201d she says. While it is a personal story, it has a wider resonance, capturing the collapse of the music industry.</p> <p>Now 32, Nash was signed to Polydor when she was 17, in the wake of Lily Allen\u2019s MySpace success. She recorded her first songs in her bedroom in Harrow, north London after a broken foot put paid to her job at Nando\u2019s and her fresh-faced eclecticism earned her a young and dedicated fanbase. When I ask who she was influenced by, she ranges freely among Celine Dion, the Spice Girls, Nirvana, Misteeq, the Beatles and UK garage, before alighting on the Buzzcocks. \u201cThey were the band I first got into that helped me write songs. I was like: \u2018A-ha! You can just talk about working in River Island or whatever.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>MySpace, she reckons, represented a brief window in musical history when teenagers genuinely took control. \u201cIt was kids putting music on their pages, other kids listening to songs over and over, people from the labels messaging people like me. MySpace was so punk. That\u2019s probably why it got shut down \u2013 the industry was like, this can\u2019t happen because we\u2019re not in control.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2401549eda8923650826c18ebf8e81810a86fc62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2401549eda8923650826c18ebf8e81810a86fc62/0_131_2992_1796/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nash in Glow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nash in Glow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erica Parise/Netflix/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But her success was wildly disorienting and she signed her record deal in a state of extreme anxiety. \u201cMy mum was like: \u2018Look, if you don\u2019t want to do it, we can just get on the tube, go home and go to Pizza Express and forget about it.\u2019 And she meant it. But afterwards, my manager at the time said to her: \u2018Well played.\u2019 And my mum was like: \u2018Excuse me? I\u2019m not playing my own child!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But everyone else was playing her. Polydor worked her relentlessly: she toured for two years straight and ended up having panic attacks. Meanwhile, the tabloids were experimenting with their own new business model; stories about Nash having a pimple (or similar) made regular appearances in sidebars of shame. Nash is amazed that she had no pastoral care whatsoever. \u201cArtists often have mental health issues. And their lifestyles are unstable because of all the travelling and the media commentary on their lives. Now I\u2019m like: \u2018How were all these 40-year-old men hanging out with me and happy to profit from me and not concerned about my health in any way?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>After her second album flopped, Nash began channelling her rage into her music. In 2012, she uploaded a thrashy new track called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIB3YCGihp0\" title=\"\">Under-Estimate the Girl</a> and was duly dropped by her label. NME\u2019s headline was: <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/kate-nash-has-committed-career-suicide-and-it-sounds-amazing-768356\" title=\"\">\u2018Kate Nash has committed career suicide \u2013 and it sounds amazing.\u2019</a> She maintains it was the best thing she ever did.

      "bodyText": "Late in 2017, an article appeared on Buzzfeed with the headline: \u201c33 Singers That Only Exist in the Mind of British Millennials\u201d. At No 9 was Kate Nash, the mid-noughties MySpace sensation who had a huge hit with Foundations and went on to win best British female at the Brits. The article explained: \u201cShe was the cute vintage-dress-wearing girl we all wanted to be back in 2007. Presumably these days she\u2019s wearing baggy jumpers and DMs, but who knows?\u201d The article touched a nerve with Nash. Not long before it was published, she had been having a teeth-gnashing, snot-in-the-hair breakdown in Death Valley, California. Dropped by her label, in dispute with her manager, she was left bankrupt, broken, wailing at the \u201cwankers\u201d in the music industry. \u201cThis is a matter of life and death to me because making music keeps me alive \u2013 and being in the music industry has almost killed me,\u201d as she put it. That moment is captured in the documentary Underestimate the Girl, which went up on the BBC3 iPlayer channel at the end of June and has won Nash a wave of support. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve really loved is seeing my fans being really emotional about it,\u201d she says. \u201cMusicians have been messaging me saying: \u2018Oh my God, I was in tears watching this, the same thing happened to me.\u2019 I think a lot of musicians are in this same situation.\u201d I meet Nash at her favourite vegan cafe in Hackney, east London. She wears her red hair in bunches as she did in the MySpace days \u2013 but the slouchy sweatpants, vest top and toned physique suggest a new steeliness. That is partly due to her training regime for Glow, the Netflix wrestling comedy that has helped her recent career move into acting. But it also reflects someone who has learned their lessons the hard way. Nash stresses that the documentary was never supposed to be so raw. She was approached by the director Amy Goldstein after a performance at Coachella in 2014, when Nash was spending her own money touring the punky songs from her self-released album Girl Talk. The intention was to make an upbeat, vaguely empowering story about a kooky English musician moving to Los Angeles and making a comeback. It became a kind of millennial female version of the Bros documentary, with Nash forced into ever more humiliating compromises to make her music. But the \u201cshit really hit the fan\u201d when she discovered that what money she had managed to scrape together had been spent, leading to a total breakdown in her relationship with her new manager, Gary Marella. \u201cI guess I just decided to keep filming because I felt like it was a really important story to tell,\u201d she says. While it is a personal story, it has a wider resonance, capturing the collapse of the music industry. Now 32, Nash was signed to Polydor when she was 17, in the wake of Lily Allen\u2019s MySpace success. She recorded her first songs in her bedroom in Harrow, north London after a broken foot put paid to her job at Nando\u2019s and her fresh-faced eclecticism earned her a young and dedicated fanbase. When I ask who she was influenced by, she ranges freely among Celine Dion, the Spice Girls, Nirvana, Misteeq, the Beatles and UK garage, before alighting on the Buzzcocks. \u201cThey were the band I first got into that helped me write songs. I was like: \u2018A-ha! You can just talk about working in River Island or whatever.\u2019\u201d MySpace, she reckons, represented a brief window in musical history when teenagers genuinely took control. \u201cIt was kids putting music on their pages, other kids listening to songs over and over, people from the labels messaging people like me. MySpace was so punk. That\u2019s probably why it got shut down \u2013 the industry was like, this can\u2019t happen because we\u2019re not in control.\u201d But her success was wildly disorienting and she signed her record deal in a state of extreme anxiety. \u201cMy mum was like: \u2018Look, if you don\u2019t want to do it, we can just get on the tube, go home and go to Pizza Express and forget about it.\u2019 And she meant it. But afterwards, my manager at the time said to her: \u2018Well played.\u2019 And my mum was like: \u2018Excuse me? I\u2019m not playing my own child!\u2019\u201d But everyone else was playing her. Polydor worked her relentlessly: she toured for two years straight and ended up having panic attacks. Meanwhile, the tabloids were experimenting with their own new business model; stories about Nash having a pimple (or similar) made regular appearances in sidebars of shame. Nash is amazed that she had no pastoral care whatsoever. \u201cArtists often have mental health issues. And their lifestyles are unstable because of all the travelling and the media commentary on their lives. Now I\u2019m like: \u2018How were all these 40-year-old men hanging out with me and happy to profit from me and not concerned about my health in any way?\u2019\u201d After her second album flopped, Nash began channelling her rage into her music. In 2012, she uploaded a thrashy new track called Under-Estimate the Girl and was duly dropped by her label. NME\u2019s headline was: \u2018Kate Nash has committed career suicide \u2013 and it sounds amazing.\u2019 She maintains it was the best thing she ever did. But it is one thing finding your voice, and another making money from it, as she discovered when she moved to LA. This is where the documentary picks up the story \u2013 and at times, it all becomes a little cringe-making, especially when Nash starts rapping. There is an excruciating scene at an advertising agency, where Marella persuades Nash to perform a lunchtime gig in the hope of securing some influencer cash. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thing I was doing all the time,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIf you\u2019re on an indie label, you\u2019re not getting enough money.

      "bodyText": "The searing desert sun had brought the early afternoon temperature close to 100F (38C) but, inside, the rooms were an ambient 72, the beds neatly spaced and the walls decorated with crepe paper flowers and drawings of home or the Stars &amp; Stripes. This is the Trump administration\u2019s newest detention center for children who have crossed the US-Mexico border and been apprehended by border patrol. The health department-controlled facility has been open for less than two weeks, in the remote, tiny town of Carrizo Springs, Texas. It\u2019s a far cry from the sordid scenes of overcrowding, dirt and hunger emerging recently from shocked legal experts and even the government\u2019s own inspectors who had toured Customs and Border Protection (CBP) stations. Officials are keen to show off the new center, last week offering up to three media tours a day. When the Guardian visited last Thursday, just under 200 teens aged 13 to 17 were held there, most from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, who had either entered the US alone or been separated from the adults who accompanied them across the border, and they had all been transferred from other facilities. The total number of children will grow to 1,300 over the coming weeks, all housed in what the government terms a \u201ctemporary emergency influx facility\u201d. Carrizo Springs is one of two of these controversial entities \u2013 the other, in Homestead, Florida, had become the target of 2020 Democratic candidates\u2019 ire in June \u2013 which are run by private companies or non-profits under federal contract. Advocates say they are not subject to the same rules and oversight as government-run centers, while activists say they are less shelter-like, more prison-like. In contrast to images and reports from CBP stations, where children and adults are detained after first crossing the border, the Carrizo Springs facility is run by the not-for-profit Baptist Child and Family Services (BCFS) and is conspicuously clean and bright. It was recently refurbished from an old camp that accommodated men working in the local oil and gas production industries. Deep in rural Texas, it\u2019s a 2.5-hour drive from San Antonio. There were telephones for the children to call relatives or immigration lawyers. Also medical and mental health services and English lessons; there was easy access to showers, soap, toothpaste and toothbrushes, beds and real blankets. This was all in sharp contrast to the border patrol stations that have failed to cater for an influx of families, including children and babies. At a hearing on Capitol Hill last Friday, the Democratic representative Rashida Tlaib, in impassioned testimony, said: \u201cWe have a crisis on our border \u2013 it is one of morality.\u201d The sprawling Carrizo Springs compound has a high perimeter fence topped with barbed wire. \u201cPeople say this is a detention center because the kids aren\u2019t \u2018free to go\u2019, but where would they go?\u201d Kevin Dinnin, BCFS\u2019s president and CEO, said. He had said earlier that week: \u201cI hate this mission \u2026 the only reason we do it is to keep the kids out of the border patrol jail cells,\u201d the Washington Post reported. And, apparently, away from non-government hazards, too. \u201cTo \u2018free the kids\u2019 is child abuse because of human trafficking,\u201d Dinnin told the Guardian, without elucidating further. Mark Weber, a spokesman for the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, said the Trump administration was committed to getting children out as quickly as possible. \u201cOur number one goal is to unify them with their sponsor and while that\u2019s happening we\u2019re providing them with a quality education,\u201d he said. Donald Trump has railed against releasing migrants. Amid strain on US systems, he and Vice-President Mike Pence blame the Democrats. Systemwide, Weber said releasing teenagers from federal facilities was taking 93 days in November 2018. After removing a fingerprint requirement for sponsors\u2019 households, which was discouraging US-based relatives, who may be undocumented, from coming forward to claim the children while they navigate the court process, the time dropped to 45 days. Teens at Carrizo Springs enjoy religious services, regular meals, soccer and basketball, officials asserted. Visiting media are banned from using recording devices or cameras, or interacting with the children. Those visible from some distance appeared clean and calm. Their true emotions, details of their pasts, treacherous journeys from troubled Central America and within the US and their uncertain future were impossible to discern. Carrizo Springs is a quiet town of 5,800 residents, leery of newcomers. Some speaking anonymously said residents have an \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d perspective on the center, yet worried these \u201cforeign children\u201d would run amok and create havoc in town. Claudia McDaniel, publisher of the Carrizo Springs Javelin newspaper, said: \u201cNobody wants kids to be held. I guess everybody\u2019s like, \u2018They need to go back home.

      "body": "<p>Her name has largely slipped through the gaps of art history, and those who do know her work may associate her primarily with magic and the occult \u2013 but, with the acquisition of a huge archive, Tate is hoping that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/sep/25/angels-of-anarchy-review\">the artist </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/sep/25/angels-of-anarchy-review\">Ithell Colquhoun</a> will finally get the credit and recognition she deserves as a major figure in British surrealism.</p> <p>Tate has announced that more than 5,000 sketches, drawings, and commercial artworks by Colquhoun have been transferred to it by the National Trust.</p> <p>Her name and reputation is little known but it deserves to be, said Tate archivist Adrian Glew. \u201cShe had very few solo exhibitions \u2026 that\u2019s why this collection is so amazing \u2013 it is going to be a re-evaluation of her whole career because there is so much in the collection.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a86c768cc3a931d5ef5bb30913918c5810391ebe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a86c768cc3a931d5ef5bb30913918c5810391ebe/0_0_4185_6047/692.jpg\" alt=\"A work by Ithell Colquhoun from the 5,000-item archive.\" width=\"692\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A work by Ithell Colquhoun from the 5,000-item archive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Cowling/\u00a9 Tate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Colquhoun was born in 1906 and, as sketchbooks in the archive show, was a talented artist from a young age. She studied at the Cheltenham School of Arts and Crafts and the Slade in London, after which she moved to Paris and discovered, to her joy, the world of surrealism.</p> <p>She also had a life-long preoccupation with magic, mythology and the occult. Her reluctance to give up that interest created tensions with other artists, and she left the British Surrealist group in 1940.</p> <p>But, as the archive shows, she was a prodigious and inventive surrealist all her life.</p> <p>There are many examples of the diverse number of techniques she used in her art, such as <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/f/fumage\">fumage</a>, the process of using a candle to make abstract shapes on the paper; and <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/d/decalcomania\">de</a><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/d/decalcomania\">calcomania</a>, which involved folding paint within the paper.</p> <p>The collection provides a complete record of her experiments with surrealist automatism, a method where the artist surrenders artistic control over the process.</p> <p>Glew said the acquisition provided \u201cthe most comprehensive collection of examples of surrealistic techniques we have now in the archive\u201d.</p> <p>Colquhoun lived for much of her life in an unheated house in Cornwall. When she died in 1988, she left her occult work to Tate, and the rest of her artistic belongings to the National Trust.</p> <p>Glew said it made much more sense for both to be together as one archive, so that previously divided items illuminating her ideas and practice can be seen in one place.</p> <p>The archive from the National Trust, for example, includes an early sketch she made for her <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/colquhoun-scylla-t02140\">1938 painting Scylla, which is on display at Tate Britain</a>. It is a surreal seascape, but also an image of the artist\u2019s view while looking down at her legs in the bath. The Trust has also given Tate some of Colquhoun\u2019s paintings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4618bdcf13f73fae8fb964502cad5f2b1d37197\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4618bdcf13f73fae8fb964502cad5f2b1d37197/0_0_4764_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An example of Ithell Colquhoun\u2019s work using the decalcomania technique.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"940\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An example of Ithell Colquhoun\u2019s work using the decalcomania technique.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Cowling/\u00a9 Tate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>David Taylor, head curator of paintings and sculpture at the National Trust, said he took great pride from the transfer. \u201cAs well as Colquhoun being better represented at Tate, the great public benefit of this collaboration between our two organisations is that new generations of scholars and visitors alike will be able to discover and appreciate this important British surrealist.\u201d</p> <p>Ann Gallagher, director of Tate\u2019s British art collection, said she was delighted, calling Colquhoun \u201cone of the key figures of British surrealism\u201d.</p> <p>More than 67,000 items in the Tate archive are digitised and Glew said the hope was to add Colquhoun\u2019s items to that number and, in turn, prompt a greater interest and knowledge of the artist.</p> <p>\u201cWe estimate that there are around 5,000 items, which makes it the largest study collection relating to one artist in the archive,\u201d he added.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Her name has largely slipped through the gaps of art history, and those who do know her work may associate her primarily with magic and the occult \u2013 but, with the acquisition of a huge archive, Tate is hoping that the artist Ithell Colquhoun will finally get the credit and recognition she deserves as a major figure in British surrealism. Tate has announced that more than 5,000 sketches, drawings, and commercial artworks by Colquhoun have been transferred to it by the National Trust. Her name and reputation is little known but it deserves to be, said Tate archivist Adrian Glew. \u201cShe had very few solo exhibitions \u2026 that\u2019s why this collection is so amazing \u2013 it is going to be a re-evaluation of her whole career because there is so much in the collection.\u201d Colquhoun was born in 1906 and, as sketchbooks in the archive show, was a talented artist from a young age. She studied at the Cheltenham School of Arts and Crafts and the Slade in London, after which she moved to Paris and discovered, to her joy, the world of surrealism. She also had a life-long preoccupation with magic, mythology and the occult. Her reluctance to give up that interest created tensions with other artists, and she left the British Surrealist group in 1940. But, as the archive shows, she was a prodigious and inventive surrealist all her life. There are many examples of the diverse number of techniques she used in her art, such as fumage, the process of using a candle to make abstract shapes on the paper; and decalcomania, which involved folding paint within the paper. The collection provides a complete record of her experiments with surrealist automatism, a method where the artist surrenders artistic control over the process. Glew said the acquisition provided \u201cthe most comprehensive collection of examples of surrealistic techniques we have now in the archive\u201d. Colquhoun lived for much of her life in an unheated house in Cornwall. When she died in 1988, she left her occult work to Tate, and the rest of her artistic belongings to the National Trust. Glew said it made much more sense for both to be together as one archive, so that previously divided items illuminating her ideas and practice can be seen in one place. The archive from the National Trust, for example, includes an early sketch she made for her 1938 painting Scylla, which is on display at Tate Britain. It is a surreal seascape, but also an image of the artist\u2019s view while looking down at her legs in the bath. The Trust has also given Tate some of Colquhoun\u2019s paintings. David Taylor, head curator of paintings and sculpture at the National Trust, said he took great pride from the transfer. \u201cAs well as Colquhoun being better represented at Tate, the great public benefit of this collaboration between our two organisations is that new generations of scholars and visitors alike will be able to discover and appreciate this important British surrealist.\u201d Ann Gallagher, director of Tate\u2019s British art collection, said she was delighted, calling Colquhoun \u201cone of the key figures of British surrealism\u201d. More than 67,000 items in the Tate archive are digitised and Glew said the hope was to add Colquhoun\u2019s items to that number and, in turn, prompt a greater interest and knowledge of the artist. \u201cWe estimate that there are around 5,000 items, which makes it the largest study collection relating to one artist in the archive,\u201d he added.",

Where do I put my feet? How hard do I thumb the accelerator? And how on earth am I meant to indicate left and press the brake with my left hand at the same time?</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t take long to start gliding, even if I don\u2019t feel very swanlike, or to notice that people in Denmark have found all sorts of less conventional ways to use e-scooters since they were introduced in January. Couple after couple perch together, heels of their feet barely balancing on the footplate. A traveller presses his suitcase between his knees while he crosses the junction near Tivoli Gardens. Two teenagers dart along the footpath outside the city\u2019s central station, nipping between pedestrians.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a guy sitting on a suitcase using it as a scooter chair,\u201d said Jesper Hemmingsen, a researcher at the <a href=\"https://www.sikkertrafik.dk/\" title=\"\">Danish council for road safety</a>, the RST. \u201cI\u2019ve seen parents delivering their children to school, a child standing at the front and their parents steering. It\u2019s an easy way to get there, but it\u2019s not a safe way. I\u2019ve seen parents hire scooters for their kids to give them something to do. People treat them like toys. But they have no protection.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past 18 months, it feels as though e-scooters have taken over many of the world\u2019s cities. Scooter share firms have staked claims in more than 100 cities worldwide. Lime and Bird (from the US) and Voi, Circ, Flash and Tier (from Europe), are start-ups dripping with venture capital backing, attempting to create and carve up a market that is changing cityscapes everywhere.</p> <p>But piles of scooters discarded by the roadside, a worrying number of injuries and even some road deaths have provoked a growing backlash in some places.</p> <p>Those dangers were underscored recently when Emily Hartridge, a 35-year-old YouTuber and TV presenter, was killed while riding an e-scooter in Battersea, south-west London, after a collision with a lorry at a roundabout. Last month Paris \u2013 the e-scooter hub of Europe, with an estimated 20,000 <em>trottinettes</em> on the streets \u2013 saw its first fatality after a young man was hit by a truck.</p> <p>So are e-scooters a vital new part of modern, eco-friendly urban transport, or are they a risky and unnecessary fad, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/18/welcome-watch-or-ban-how-should-cities-deal-with-electric-scooters\" title=\"\">pushed by tech investors</a> desperate to disrupt the status quo?

The police and road safety council are assessing the impact of the seven scooter firms and 7,000 scooters that have arrived since the Danish government introduced a trial period on 17 January.</p> <p>Pedestrians complain about scooters strewn across pavements and that they are a hazard for blind people and wheelchair users, as well as other anti-social behaviour: one young man rode an e-scooter through the aisles of a Netto supermarket in Odense seven times in one day.</p> <p>Walking around the Danish capital with Hemmingsen, it\u2019s clear that the city\u2019s road network is much more friendly to e-scooter riders than London.

      "bodyText": "Most of the people riding electric scooters around Copenhagen glide like swans, bodies motionless and serene with heads tilted into the sunshine. I am the ugly duckling, wobbling and jerking while I struggle to figure out exactly how this two-wheeled contraption works. Where do I put my feet? How hard do I thumb the accelerator? And how on earth am I meant to indicate left and press the brake with my left hand at the same time? It doesn\u2019t take long to start gliding, even if I don\u2019t feel very swanlike, or to notice that people in Denmark have found all sorts of less conventional ways to use e-scooters since they were introduced in January. Couple after couple perch together, heels of their feet barely balancing on the footplate. A traveller presses his suitcase between his knees while he crosses the junction near Tivoli Gardens. Two teenagers dart along the footpath outside the city\u2019s central station, nipping between pedestrians. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a guy sitting on a suitcase using it as a scooter chair,\u201d said Jesper Hemmingsen, a researcher at the Danish council for road safety, the RST. \u201cI\u2019ve seen parents delivering their children to school, a child standing at the front and their parents steering. It\u2019s an easy way to get there, but it\u2019s not a safe way. I\u2019ve seen parents hire scooters for their kids to give them something to do. People treat them like toys. But they have no protection.\u201d Over the past 18 months, it feels as though e-scooters have taken over many of the world\u2019s cities. Scooter share firms have staked claims in more than 100 cities worldwide. Lime and Bird (from the US) and Voi, Circ, Flash and Tier (from Europe), are start-ups dripping with venture capital backing, attempting to create and carve up a market that is changing cityscapes everywhere. But piles of scooters discarded by the roadside, a worrying number of injuries and even some road deaths have provoked a growing backlash in some places. Those dangers were underscored recently when Emily Hartridge, a 35-year-old YouTuber and TV presenter, was killed while riding an e-scooter in Battersea, south-west London, after a collision with a lorry at a roundabout. Last month Paris \u2013 the e-scooter hub of Europe, with an estimated 20,000 trottinettes on the streets \u2013 saw its first fatality after a young man was hit by a truck. So are e-scooters a vital new part of modern, eco-friendly urban transport, or are they a risky and unnecessary fad, pushed by tech investors desperate to disrupt the status quo? And what can people in the UK, where the use of e-scooters remains illegal on both roads and pavements \u2013 despite the rise in models for sale in shops \u2013 learn from the experience of other European cities? Copenhagen, where e-scooters arrived nearly six months ago, is well-placed to answer this question. The police and road safety council are assessing the impact of the seven scooter firms and 7,000 scooters that have arrived since the Danish government introduced a trial period on 17 January. Pedestrians complain about scooters strewn across pavements and that they are a hazard for blind people and wheelchair users, as well as other anti-social behaviour: one young man rode an e-scooter through the aisles of a Netto supermarket in Odense seven times in one day. Walking around the Danish capital with Hemmingsen, it\u2019s clear that the city\u2019s road network is much more friendly to e-scooter riders than London. The reason is the Danes\u2019 love of cycling. \u201cIn Denmark you\u2019re born, you\u2019re potty trained, then you cycle,\u201d Hemmingsen said. \u201cCopenhagen is the second most bicycled city after Amsterdam \u2013 we cycle 1.4 million km every day.\u201d Only 3% of people here don\u2019t ride bikes every day. The city is flat, which helps, but more importantly there are miles and miles of wide roads with dedicated cycle lanes, usually raised and separated from car traffic with a kerb. No one has to compete for space. A scooter shouldn\u2019t need to be anywhere near a lorry. But the road safety council is still worried about a growing number of injuries. \u201cAt the moment we have an assumption that it\u2019s the same level of injuries for e-scooters as for cyclists,\u201d Hemmingsen said, mentioning a recent study by two casualty departments in Copenhagen that found an average of about two injuries a day. About 800 cyclists a year are seriously injured. Copenhagen police are also acting. After running an information campaign, senior officers mounted an operation against drink-riders earlier this month, posting officers around the city centre. In one night last weekend, 24 e-scooter riders were stopped on suspicion of riding while over the legal alcohol limit, and four more for some form of narcotic intoxication, superintendent Allan Teddy Wadsworth-Hansen said. They face fines of up to 2,000 krone (\u00a3240). One of the motorcycle officers standing in Frederiksborggade, a main route into the heart of Copenhagen\u2019s night life, stopped one rider and breathalysed him. Then a second arrived who had also been drinking. \u201cWhile he\u2019s still trying to process the first one, a third e-scooter turns up with two people on it,\u201d Wadsworth-Hansen said. \u201cWhen they see the police, they try to slow down. The woman on the back falls off \u2013 she wasn\u2019t hurt seriously \u2013 and the driver turns out to be driving under the influence of alcohol.

      "body": "<h2><strong>What\u2019s the difference between euthanasia, assisted dying and assisted suicide?</strong></h2> <p>\u201cThe main difference between euthanasia and assisted suicide is who performs the final, fatal act,\u201d said Richard Huxtable, professor of medical ethics and law at the University of Bristol.</p> <p>Euthanasia refers to active steps taken to end someone\u2019s life to stop their suffering and the \u201cfinal deed\u201d is undertaken by someone other than the individual, for example a doctor. If the person concerned has requested this, it falls under the term \u201cvoluntary euthanasia\u201d.</p> <p>Assisted suicide is about helping someone to take their own life at their request \u2013 in other words the final deed is undertaken by the person themselves. Assisted dying can be used to mean both euthanasia, generally voluntary, and assisted suicide; however, some campaign groups use it to refer only to assisted suicide of terminally ill people.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the dilemmas we have in these ongoing debates is how people use the various phrases,\u201d says Huxtable. Most, but not all, jurisdictions that allow some form of euthanasia or assisted suicide require the involvement of medical professionals.</p> <p>Palliative sedation, in which people can request to be kept <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/28/france-adopts-sedated-dying-law-as-compromise-on-euthanasia\" title=\"\">under deep sedation</a> until they die, is allowed in many countries, including the Netherlands and France \u2013 is not euthanasia.</p> <h2><strong>Which countries permit any of these variants?</strong></h2> <p>The Netherlands and Switzerland are the most well known, and Belgium considered perhaps the most liberal, but several other jurisdictions allow some form of euthanasia or assisted suicide. That said, permitted circumstances differ considerably.</p> <p>In the Netherlands both euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal if the patient is enduring unbearable suffering and there is no prospect of improvement. Anyone from the age of 12 can request this, but parental consent is required if a child is under 16. There are a number of checks and balances, including that doctors must consult with at least one other, independent doctor on whether patient meets the necessary criteria.</p> <p>Belgium, Luxembourg, Canada and Colombia also allow both euthanasia and assisted suicide, although there are differences \u2013 for example only terminal patients can request it in Colombia, while Belgium has no age restriction for children (although they must have a terminal illness).</p> <p>Assisted suicide is more widely available than euthanasia. Among the places where people can choose to end their life this way are Switzerland and a number of US states including California, Colorado, Hawaii, New Jersey, Oregon, Washington state, Vermont and the District of Columbia. Laws permitting assisted suicide came into force in the <a href=\"https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsociety%2F2017%2Fnov%2F23%2Fcrossing-the-threshold-victoria-makes-history-with-assisted-dying-law&amp;data=01%7C01%7Cpenney.lewis%40kcl.ac.uk%7Cd4b2918f03464567613a08d6f65b361d%7C8370cf1416f34c16b83c724071654356%7C0&amp;sdata=asChmd0ZY3hz3xPJJG%2FFAuL2XXUo1mKj4SVNV9spyqU%3D&amp;reserved=0\" title=\"Original URL: https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/23/crossing-the-threshold-victoria-makes-history-with-assisted-dying-law. Click or tap if you trust this link.\">Australian state of Victoria</a> last month.</p> <p>Again, the exact circumstances in which assisted suicide is allowed vary, with some jurisdictions \u2013 Oregon and Vermont \u2013 only allowing it in the case of terminal illness. For some places it is permitted not because laws have been passed, but because laws do not prohibit it. For example <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1125125/\" title=\"\">in Switzerland</a> it is an offence to assist a suicide if it is done with selfish motives. \u201cThe result of that is there is this growth of not-for-profit organisations,\u201d says Prof Penney Lewis, an expert on the law around end-of-life care at King\u2019s College London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1H1Nr6sR_XGnpamEdu0hPjuCt2Mpu7opFaFyKpIMgvKs\" data-alt=\"table\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1H1Nr6sR_XGnpamEdu0hPjuCt2Mpu7opFaFyKpIMgvKs\">table</a> </figure>  <p>Other countries, <a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12244205\" title=\"\">including New Zealand</a>, are considering legalising some form of euthanasia.</p> <h2> <strong>What\u2019s the situation in the UK?</strong></h2> <p>Euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal.

      "bodyText": "What\u2019s the difference between euthanasia, assisted dying and assisted suicide? \u201cThe main difference between euthanasia and assisted suicide is who performs the final, fatal act,\u201d said Richard Huxtable, professor of medical ethics and law at the University of Bristol. Euthanasia refers to active steps taken to end someone\u2019s life to stop their suffering and the \u201cfinal deed\u201d is undertaken by someone other than the individual, for example a doctor. If the person concerned has requested this, it falls under the term \u201cvoluntary euthanasia\u201d. Assisted suicide is about helping someone to take their own life at their request \u2013 in other words the final deed is undertaken by the person themselves. Assisted dying can be used to mean both euthanasia, generally voluntary, and assisted suicide; however, some campaign groups use it to refer only to assisted suicide of terminally ill people. \u201cOne of the dilemmas we have in these ongoing debates is how people use the various phrases,\u201d says Huxtable. Most, but not all, jurisdictions that allow some form of euthanasia or assisted suicide require the involvement of medical professionals. Palliative sedation, in which people can request to be kept under deep sedation until they die, is allowed in many countries, including the Netherlands and France \u2013 is not euthanasia. Which countries permit any of these variants? The Netherlands and Switzerland are the most well known, and Belgium considered perhaps the most liberal, but several other jurisdictions allow some form of euthanasia or assisted suicide. That said, permitted circumstances differ considerably. In the Netherlands both euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal if the patient is enduring unbearable suffering and there is no prospect of improvement. Anyone from the age of 12 can request this, but parental consent is required if a child is under 16. There are a number of checks and balances, including that doctors must consult with at least one other, independent doctor on whether patient meets the necessary criteria. Belgium, Luxembourg, Canada and Colombia also allow both euthanasia and assisted suicide, although there are differences \u2013 for example only terminal patients can request it in Colombia, while Belgium has no age restriction for children (although they must have a terminal illness). Assisted suicide is more widely available than euthanasia. Among the places where people can choose to end their life this way are Switzerland and a number of US states including California, Colorado, Hawaii, New Jersey, Oregon, Washington state, Vermont and the District of Columbia. Laws permitting assisted suicide came into force in the Australian state of Victoria last month. Again, the exact circumstances in which assisted suicide is allowed vary, with some jurisdictions \u2013 Oregon and Vermont \u2013 only allowing it in the case of terminal illness. For some places it is permitted not because laws have been passed, but because laws do not prohibit it. For example in Switzerland it is an offence to assist a suicide if it is done with selfish motives. \u201cThe result of that is there is this growth of not-for-profit organisations,\u201d says Prof Penney Lewis, an expert on the law around end-of-life care at King\u2019s College London. Other countries, including New Zealand, are considering legalising some form of euthanasia. What\u2019s the situation in the UK? Euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal. Euthanasia can lead to a murder charge and assisted suicide could result in a sentence of up to 14 years in prison. That said, anonymous surveys suggest euthanasia does occur in the UK \u2013 but it is very rare. A study published in 2009 using responses from more than 3,700 medical professionals suggested 0.2% of deaths involve voluntary euthanasia and 0.3% involved euthanasia without explicit patient request \u2013 no assisted suicide was recorded. It is not normally illegal for a patient to be given treatment to relieve distress that could indirectly shorten life \u2013 but this is not euthanasia. It is already legal in the UK for patients to refuse treatment, even if that could shorten their life, and for medical care to be withdrawn by doctors in certain cases, for example where a patient is in a vegetative state and will not recover (sometimes controversially called passive euthanasia). How many people undergo euthanasia or assisted suicide? Total figures from around the world are hard to collate. Figures from Switzerland show that the numbers of those living in the country who underwent assisted suicide rose from 187 in 2003 to 965 in 2015. According to the 2017 Regional Euthanasia Review Committees (RTE), in the Netherlands there were 6,585 cases of voluntary euthanasia or assisted suicide \u2013 4.4% of the total number of deaths. About 96% of cases involved euthanasia, with less than 4% assisted suicide, and the largest proportion of cases involved people with cancer. Agnes van der Heide, professor of decision-making and care at the end of life at the Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, says the reason euthanasia is more common than assisted suicide in the Netherlands is multifaceted. Doctors may feel that by performing the deed themselves they can have more control over dosages and the time the procedure takes. \u201cPatients are often in a very advanced stage of their disease where it is practically difficult if not impossible to drink the lethal drink they have to take when they chose for assistance in suicide,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt is a very bitter-tasting drink and it is quite an effort to drink it until the end,\u201d she added. There might also be an element of viewing the act as a medical procedure and hence preferring a physician to do the job. Lewis says the vast majority of people do not end their lives by euthanasia even if they can. \u201cThere is far more withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, even in jurisdictions that permit euthanasia,\u201d she says. What happened in the case of the Dutch teenager Noa Pothoven? Noa Pothoven, who was 17, died last month \u2013 she had anorexia and severe depression. At first media reports suggested she had been \u201clegally euthanised\u201d, but later reports said it was unclear how she died, with her friends releasing a comment saying that she died after she stopped eating and drinking. Van der Heide said that while she could not comment on Pothoven\u2019s case, it is possible for minors over the age of 12 to seek euthanasia or assisted suicide in the Netherlands, under certain conditions. Has there been suicide tourism? In some places, yes. According to van der Heide, while suicide tourism is not formally forbidden in the Netherlands, physicians must work with the patient to establish that they meet certain criteria. \u201cI think if a physician would provide euthanasia to a patient he doesn\u2019t know then it is very likely that the regional committee would have a problem with that,\u201d she says. However, people do travel to Switzerland for assisted suicide. According to statistics from Dignitas, 221 people travelled to the country for this purpose in 2018, 87 of whom were from Germany, 31 from France and 24 from the UK. What does the public think about euthanasia and assisted suicide? It depends a bit on the question you ask. A recent poll conducted by the National Centre for Social Research for MDMD found that 93% of people in the UK approved of, or wouldn\u2019t rule out, doctor-assisted suicide if the person is terminally ill. The British Social Attitudes survey, published in 2017, sheds light on views about voluntary euthanasia, showing that people generally support the idea of doctors ending the life of a terminally ill person who requests it (78%), but that there is less support for a close relative doing the job (39%).

Do you talk passionately about female advancement in public while quietly squashing the careers of the women under you? Or are you a true champion? It is easy to identify the latter: women who have worked for them sing their praises for the rest of their lives. And whatever else you may think of Theresa May, she is a true champion of women.

He did not like anyone knowing what he was up to, where he was, or even whom he was talking to. He locked the door to his room in the office, for instance, and also kept the office answerphone under lock and key so I could not listen to messages. In just three weeks this frankly bizarre and troubled man looks set to hold the keys to No 10 and have access to the nuclear codes. He might have in large part created this mess but he is certainly not qualified to fix it. \u2022 Sonia Purnell is the author of Just Boris: A Tale of Blond Ambition",

The victory by the never-seen-before margin of \u201cboundaries scored\u201d came after the two teams were tied at the end of their respective 50 over innings and a penalty shootout-style super over also failed to separate them. The thrilling climax sent most of the 30,000 fans at the home of cricket into paroxysms of delight and the scenes of joy were mirrored across the country as celebrations spilled from homes and pubs and into the streets. Eoin Morgan, England\u2019s captain, said it was \u201cthe most incredible game of cricket\u201d, and admitted that there had been nothing between the two sides. \u201cI\u2019m pretty lost for words.

You could not make this up. There has never been anything like this,\u201d the 88-year-old said. Thousands had gathered under blue skies in front of a big screen in Trafalgar Square to watch the final, which was England\u2019s fourth attempt to win the biggest prize in the sport after failures at the last hurdle in 1979, 1987 and 1992. Jonny Bennett, 26, from St Albans, watched the match in the square and joined in the celebrations afterwards at The Admiralty pub. \u201cThe relief and the sheer joy is incredible.

However, Jacob Rees-Mogg attempted to make political capital from the victory with an off-key tweet saying that \u201cwe clearly don\u2019t need Europe to win\u201d. It was quickly pointed out that England did actually need Europe to win \u2013 in the form of Morgan, who is Irish. The actor Adil Ray went a step further by rejoicing in the diversity of the England team which, along with Morgan, also features players of West Indian, Pakistani and South African descent. \u201cThis is England and it feels bloody fantastic,\u201d he said.

Away from politics, Gary Lineker tweeted: \u201cNever seen anything like that\u2026 Cricket is coming home\u201d. Morgan paid tribute to \u201csuperhuman\u201d man of the match Ben Stokes, who managed to bludgeon 15 runs from the final over of normal play to bring the scores level, a tally that included a bizarre, ricocheted six.

The Times opts for a wraparound style front and back page with a beautiful image of the dramatic moment when Jos Buttler runs out Martin Guptill to seal the win. The Telegraph features a huge picture of the England players lifting the trophy with the headline, \u201cWho said cricket was boring?\u201d. The most popular headline of the day is \u201cChampagne super over\u201d, a cunning pun combining the victory celebrations and the unprecedented format of the finale which is used by the Mirror, the Star, the Metro and \u2013 more surprisingly \u2013 the FT. The Daily Mail goes it alone with a picture of Ben Stokes kissing his wife, Clare, above a headline which reads: \u201cKiss that says: we\u2019re on top of the world.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The brutal deaths of about 30 women and children in Papua New Guinea\u2019s highlands amount to the \u201cworst payback killing\u201d in the country\u2019s history, the police minister has said. Bryan Kramer made the declaration after visiting Hela province, where 16 people were slaughtered by rival clansmen who the prime minister, James Marape, described as \u201cwarlords\u201d. The motive for the massacre was unclear last week, and the total death toll from a series of attacks had also varied, according to reports. Following a one-day trip to the area, Kramer said it appeared warring clans had taken the rare step of targeting women and children after the elderly mother of a tribe leader was killed in an earlier raid. He described \u201cthe horrific killing of 23 women ([two] of whom were pregnant) and [nine] children\u201d as the \u201cworst payback killing in our country\u2019s history\u201d. While tribal violence is a long-standing issue in the area, attacks on women and children were essentially unprecedented, authorities and locals have said. In a statement on Facebook, Kramer said he was told the most recent outbreak of violence centred around the warring Oi Kiru and Libe tribes. A key Libe clansman was killed in June, sparking a revenge attack in which six Oi Kiru members died, including the mother of the clan\u2019s leader, he said, adding that it was the \u201cfirst killing of an elderly mother\u201d. Kramer said high-powered rifles were then used in a payback killing at a small village, Peta, in which three women and three children were killed. That led to the worst single incident, with a group of young men raiding the Karida village in the early hours last Monday, using machetes to kill nine women and seven children. Two of the women were pregnant, Kramer said. Philip Pimua, the officer in charge of the Karida sub-health centre, previously told the Guardian the victims were \u201ccut into pieces\u201d. \u201cSome had body parts we couldn\u2019t recognise which one is which one, only the faces we can recognise, but legs, hands\u2026\u201d Those responsible had reportedly fled the province, Kramer said, while the Karida locals had said they would not retaliate following his visit to the area. \u201cHigh-level discussions on a strategic deployment action plan with the use of drone technology and satellite surveillance, will be used to track and apprehend those on the run,\u201d he said. \u201cAn intelligence unit will also be established to gather information from the community.\u201d The Marape government sent in the defence force in response to the escalating violence last week, while the United Nations called for an immediate intervention to bring the perpetrators to justice. Describing the Karida massacre last week as \u201cone of the saddest day of my life\u201d, Marape vowed to use the \u201cstrongest measures in law\u201d to punish the perpetrators.

      "body": "<p>The Indigenous people of this land are used to white lies.</p> <p>History, if you don\u2019t re-interpret it, as many have, to render the colonial experience of this continent benignly, tells us that.</p> <p>After 65,000-plus years of Indigenous habitation the white men came bearing gifts and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2018/jul/23/when-celebrating-captain-cook-lets-remember-the-advice-he-ignored\">orders (ignored) to show amity and respect sovereignty</a>. Instead, mouthing friendship, they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/the-killing-times\">gifted strychnine-laced loaves, massacred the custodians and took their land and children</a>, compelled by their fallacious racially superior self-belief to empire-build.</p> <p>They gave scarcely a thought to treaties of the type that had defined negotiated relations between colonisers and other First Nations people. So <a href=\"https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/mabo-decision\">terra nullius (another laughable fallacy that endured for two centuries) it was</a>.</p> <p>The 1901 white Australian federation was built on that colonial land theft and mass murder. The constitution, founding document of that settler state, written by \u201cfounding fathers\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2009/november/1330478364/tony-roberts/brutal-truth\">some stained with Aboriginal blood</a>, was adopted without deference to Indigenous sentiment or referral.</p> <p>The first business of the new federal parliament, with its racially discriminatory constitution, was<a href=\"https://archive.homeaffairs.gov.au/about/corporate/information/fact-sheets/08abolition\"> the equally racist white Australia policy</a>, its last vestiges extant until barely 50 years ago.</p> <p>The WAP is gone. Racism against Indigenous people still underscores their relations with our federal, state and territory political institutions (from the parliaments and executives to the bureaucracies and judiciaries). Meanwhile, the federation\u2019s exclusionary symbols and interpretations of supposedly nation-defining historical moments, from the flag and Anzac and Australia Day to the anthem \u2013 <em><a href=\"https://www.pmc.gov.au/government/australian-national-anthem\">For we are young and free</a></em>!<em> </em>\u2013 pervade politics and culture in defiance of Indigenous sentiment and sensibility.</p> <p>A new parliament last week was supposed to bring new hope. Hope that the politicians would rally to allow the constitution to afford Indigenous people recognition \u2013 not just some token words acknowledging countless millennia of Aboriginal custodianship but an entrenched representative \u201cvoice\u201d to the legislature as expressed <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/explainer-why-300-indigenous-leaders-are-meeting-at-uluru-this-week-77955\">by the 2017 Uluru meeting</a>.</p> <p>Here were the powerful white men on both sides of politics, seeming to agree that it was time to meaningfully change the constitution consistent with the request to the Australian people (never its politicians, mind) in the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Time, that is, to let Indigenous people into it in a meaningful way with an enshrined \u201cvoice\u201d \u2013 a body that would parse legislation affecting Indigenous people, as per <a href=\"https://www.referendumcouncil.org.au/sites/default/files/2017-05/Uluru_Statement_From_The_Heart_0.PDF\">the Uluru statement</a> that what was needed was a voice, treaty and truth telling.</p> <p>Enter Ken Wyatt, the new minister for Indigenous Australians and an Aboriginal man in a party that has done little, since the days of John Howard but play the most cynical politics on the \u201crecognition\u201d issue. Ahead of his Naidoc Week speech in Canberra last week, the brief went out he\u2019d be announcing a referendum on recognition. Would he go further and recommend the referendum consider enshrining the voice in the constitution? \u2013 the favoured, meaningful option of black and white supporters of constitutional change.</p> <p>Wyatt\u2019s address was many things: <a href=\"https://www.kenwyatt.com.au/ministerial-news-indigenous-australians/2019/7/10/transcript-national-press-club-address-walking-in-partnership-to-effect-change\">dignified, composed, personal</a>. It was also artfully politically ambiguous and underscored by a realpolitik that meant he veered clear of mentioning in his speech any prospect of constitutionally entrenching the voice. His message in the speech and in answers to questions that followed was: there would be a referendum on recognition, if possible, but that the voice might be legislated only.</p> <p>And he wanted time \u2013 although so much time has already elapsed with so little advancement.</p> <p>Wyatt seemed to leave the question of treaties to the states and truth-telling (about the poisoned loaves, the cordite and cold steel, the massacres, the stolen children and the legacy of it all) not to a formal national process, but to communities who\u2019ve already been doing that for many decades.</p> <p>Despite this the prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/morrison-to-veto-voice-as-part-of-constitution/news-story/c9753bbe3595470032ac7fa95636931e\">Scott Morrison, still felt the need to signal furiously</a> that any understanding that a constitutionally-embedded voice might be put to a referendum was wrong. Can the feral, noxious Right of the Coalition parties that also stripped Malcolm Turnbull of credibility on Indigenous issues hear the PM? those \u201csources close to\u201d him (read press secretaries under strict instruction), might\u2019ve said.</p> <p>What seems to be on offer, though it\u2019s now kind of impossible to tell, is the idea of a legislated advisory body \u2013 not like what Uluru told Australia it needed.</p> <p>The voice is a hostage \u2013 perhaps now already a victim \u2013 of Coalition internal politics. It is, perhaps foremost, a casualty of an acute absence of human empathy from a governing class that views and records Indigenous needs and aspiration through a cage-fight of (mostly non-Aboriginal) political short-term-ism, with its addiction to media- and ideological-management.</p> <p>And didn\u2019t all this flush the liars out in force again last week! Senior Liberals and Nationals have been lying their tonsils out since Uluru with the false claim that the \u201cvoice\u201d is a third parliamentary chamber.</p> <p>Barnaby Joyce, that great sage of Australian sentiment, did it within 24 hours of the Uluru Statement. Turnbull (weak as weak on recognition) and Morrison have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2017/oct/27/the-whole-recognition-process-has-a-deep-colonial-resonance\">both deliberately miscast the voice as another chamber</a>. Peter Dutton replayed the lie last week. As did many others, including Joyce and Craig Kelly, a predictably reliable echo of the basest reactionary rhetoric.</p> <p>Kelly, among others, feared recognition could be racially divisive \u2013 \u201ca reverse form of what South Africa was a few years ago\u201d. It was breathtaking, craven, race-baiting \u2013 political discourse at its most nauseating. Which is quite something.

      "bodyText": "The Indigenous people of this land are used to white lies. History, if you don\u2019t re-interpret it, as many have, to render the colonial experience of this continent benignly, tells us that. After 65,000-plus years of Indigenous habitation the white men came bearing gifts and orders (ignored) to show amity and respect sovereignty. Instead, mouthing friendship, they gifted strychnine-laced loaves, massacred the custodians and took their land and children, compelled by their fallacious racially superior self-belief to empire-build. They gave scarcely a thought to treaties of the type that had defined negotiated relations between colonisers and other First Nations people. So terra nullius (another laughable fallacy that endured for two centuries) it was. The 1901 white Australian federation was built on that colonial land theft and mass murder. The constitution, founding document of that settler state, written by \u201cfounding fathers\u201d, some stained with Aboriginal blood, was adopted without deference to Indigenous sentiment or referral. The first business of the new federal parliament, with its racially discriminatory constitution, was the equally racist white Australia policy, its last vestiges extant until barely 50 years ago. The WAP is gone. Racism against Indigenous people still underscores their relations with our federal, state and territory political institutions (from the parliaments and executives to the bureaucracies and judiciaries). Meanwhile, the federation\u2019s exclusionary symbols and interpretations of supposedly nation-defining historical moments, from the flag and Anzac and Australia Day to the anthem \u2013 For we are young and free! \u2013 pervade politics and culture in defiance of Indigenous sentiment and sensibility. A new parliament last week was supposed to bring new hope. Hope that the politicians would rally to allow the constitution to afford Indigenous people recognition \u2013 not just some token words acknowledging countless millennia of Aboriginal custodianship but an entrenched representative \u201cvoice\u201d to the legislature as expressed by the 2017 Uluru meeting. Here were the powerful white men on both sides of politics, seeming to agree that it was time to meaningfully change the constitution consistent with the request to the Australian people (never its politicians, mind) in the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Time, that is, to let Indigenous people into it in a meaningful way with an enshrined \u201cvoice\u201d \u2013 a body that would parse legislation affecting Indigenous people, as per the Uluru statement that what was needed was a voice, treaty and truth telling. Enter Ken Wyatt, the new minister for Indigenous Australians and an Aboriginal man in a party that has done little, since the days of John Howard but play the most cynical politics on the \u201crecognition\u201d issue. Ahead of his Naidoc Week speech in Canberra last week, the brief went out he\u2019d be announcing a referendum on recognition. Would he go further and recommend the referendum consider enshrining the voice in the constitution? \u2013 the favoured, meaningful option of black and white supporters of constitutional change. Wyatt\u2019s address was many things: dignified, composed, personal. It was also artfully politically ambiguous and underscored by a realpolitik that meant he veered clear of mentioning in his speech any prospect of constitutionally entrenching the voice. His message in the speech and in answers to questions that followed was: there would be a referendum on recognition, if possible, but that the voice might be legislated only. And he wanted time \u2013 although so much time has already elapsed with so little advancement. Wyatt seemed to leave the question of treaties to the states and truth-telling (about the poisoned loaves, the cordite and cold steel, the massacres, the stolen children and the legacy of it all) not to a formal national process, but to communities who\u2019ve already been doing that for many decades. Despite this the prime minister, Scott Morrison, still felt the need to signal furiously that any understanding that a constitutionally-embedded voice might be put to a referendum was wrong. Can the feral, noxious Right of the Coalition parties that also stripped Malcolm Turnbull of credibility on Indigenous issues hear the PM? those \u201csources close to\u201d him (read press secretaries under strict instruction), might\u2019ve said. What seems to be on offer, though it\u2019s now kind of impossible to tell, is the idea of a legislated advisory body \u2013 not like what Uluru told Australia it needed. The voice is a hostage \u2013 perhaps now already a victim \u2013 of Coalition internal politics. It is, perhaps foremost, a casualty of an acute absence of human empathy from a governing class that views and records Indigenous needs and aspiration through a cage-fight of (mostly non-Aboriginal) political short-term-ism, with its addiction to media- and ideological-management. And didn\u2019t all this flush the liars out in force again last week! Senior Liberals and Nationals have been lying their tonsils out since Uluru with the false claim that the \u201cvoice\u201d is a third parliamentary chamber. Barnaby Joyce, that great sage of Australian sentiment, did it within 24 hours of the Uluru Statement. Turnbull (weak as weak on recognition) and Morrison have both deliberately miscast the voice as another chamber. Peter Dutton replayed the lie last week. As did many others, including Joyce and Craig Kelly, a predictably reliable echo of the basest reactionary rhetoric. Kelly, among others, feared recognition could be racially divisive \u2013 \u201ca reverse form of what South Africa was a few years ago\u201d. It was breathtaking, craven, race-baiting \u2013 political discourse at its most nauseating. Which is quite something. But for many Indigenous Australians and the more ardent supporters of their rights it was even more egregious still \u2013 and part of a historical continuum of white lies. In 2018 the historian Mark McKenna wrote a Quarterly Essay, Moment of Truth \u2013 History and Australia\u2019s future, about the imperative of altering our racist constitution and of the need for Australia to redefine itself, consistent with the offer from Uluru, to reflect Indigenous continental antiquity. I\u2019ll choose the considered historical-, over the hot political-, take on this one. McKenna watched carefully last week. The government\u2019s behaviour was, he says, \u201chistorically consistent with the approach taken by so many federal governments in the past \u2013 great promises but little return\u201d. McKenna says: \u201cThe conservatives\u2019 arguments \u2013 we don\u2019t want race placed in the constitution, we\u2019re all equal, no special treatment etcetera \u2013 is blind to the historical reality that we have an exclusionary and racist constitution which was drawn up without even once consulting Indigenous Australians. And they go on with their holier than thou equality rhetoric. They just can\u2019t see, or they refuse to accept the perspective of those whose land was taken from them without treaty, compensation or consent. They refuse to understand what it\u2019s like when you\u2019re on the outside looking in.\u201d There it is again \u2013 the empathy gap and the denial of historical truths. So, now we head towards 2020 and the 250th anniversary of James Cook\u2019s landing, to be marked with many millions of dollars of public commemorative spending, including the circumnavigation of a replica HMS Endeavour and a new $50m monument to Cook in Morrison\u2019s electorate. Meanwhile, the lazy acceptance of a trope of Australian nationhood forged through Anzac, is further entrenched as a re-elected government pushes ahead with plans for a $500m Australian War Memorial expansion. These days the war memorial, with giant banners on the roads leading to its entrances, advertises itself with the anthemic line: For We Are Young And Free. Another lie. How do those from the oldest continuous civilisation on earth feel about that? Those in power don\u2019t really need to ask. For they know the answer. They just choose to ignore the voice.

Notes and observations Last week\u2019s episode might have featured a scene in which Madeline threw her ice-cream at Mary Louise, but it was cut. Either Big Little Lies has found its boundaries, or they\u2019re taking a stand against food waste. Though I cannot imagine any court in the land would let Celeste cross-examine Mary Louise, given the circumstances, I cannot wait for their showdown next week. Desserts not welcome. \u201cCan we kill her?\u201d Not the usual response to a doctor\u2019s \u201cAny questions?\u201d Joseph\u2019s wife\u2019s attempted seduction of Ed \u2013 so we know he didn\u2019t have the affair, yet \u2013 made me laugh out loud. \u201cI keep both a masturbation diary and a bucket list. You made both.\u201d Let\u2019s hope her iCloud never gets hacked. The beach-side meeting, when Bonnie and Madeline argued, made me think briefly of The Craft. Ziggy told Mary Louise that Jane had bought a gun. Will the children of Monterey ever keep anything to themselves? Renata gives her nanny-diddling husband the dressing-down of his life, and sadly, he can no longer afford the \u201cstress management\u201d to deal with it. Playlist As Jane drove to Corey\u2019s, expecting him to be an undercover cop, she listened to the briefest snippet of electroclash anthem Rippin Kittin, by Golden Boy with Miss Kittin. When Ed had his tentative cafe dalliance, Placebo\u2019s cover of Running Up That Hill played in the background, while in her car, Madeline played Ann Peebles\u2019 Until You Came Into My Life. Mary Louise drowned out Jane\u2019s furious pleading with Roy Orbison\u2019s It\u2019s Over, which also saw out the closing credits. The sweet scene of Madeline re-wooing Ed in her wedding dress revealed that he chose Patti Smith\u2019s cover of Everybody Wants to Rule the World for their big day. Bonnie\u2019s daughter said goodbye to her grandmother (presumably) with Elizabeth Cotten\u2019s Shake Sugaree. Quote of the week \u201cWhat I see is a woman who\u2019s struggling. Who isn\u2019t?\u201d Jane sticks up for Celeste, even if it\u2019s howled into Roy Orbison playing at volume.",

It was only my second time at Lord\u2019s - the first was on a freezing wet day in April a few years before, where I was one of about six people in the ground watching Middlesex eke out what felt like 100 runs in a full day\u2019s play. This couldn\u2019t have been more different: a hot day, ground absolutely packed, and the best team in the world about to win a third successive world cup. For a South African who had never before seen international cricket, it was absolutely sensational to be there, to see these impossible heroes, whom I\u2019d only ever read about, in the flesh. I was as stunned as everyone else when Kapil Dev pulled off a miracle and propelled India to the title - I had thought West Indies absolutely invincible - a lesson in the fact that the best can lose. Since SA\u2019s ignominious departure from this tournament, I\u2019m backing England to win the damn cup already.

Do you sense a but coming? \u201cBut in the game before that run started, England were <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10718/scorecard/1031429/england-vs-south-africa-3rd-odi-sa-tour-of-england-2017\">20 for six</a> v South Africa.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d2ae0bb8f08cf92bb76f838\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-14T08:02:37.642Z\">9.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Morning everyone. </strong>So, today\u2019s the big day. It\u2019s the men\u2019s singles final at Wimbledon. It\u2019s the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. It\u2019s even, as I discovered driving home last night, <a href=\"http://www.rockinghamvillage.co.uk/news/2019/Dogs2019.pdf\">the Dog Show in Rockingham</a>. But then all those things happen every year. In St John\u2019s Wood, London, just round the corner from the Beatles\u2019 zebra crossing, something is happening that hasn\u2019t happened for 27 years. ENGLAND ARE IN THE CRICKET WORLD CUP FINAL. </p> \n  <p>It was in 1992, in Melbourne, that England last appeared in this fixture. They bowled well enough against Imran Khan\u2019s Pakistan, and had the game under control, until Wasim Akram destroyed them with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XUqZbajy3I\">two balls of the greatest reverse swing you will ever goggle at in disbelief</a>. To find England in a World Cup final in England, you have to wind the videotape of life back even further, to 1979. Yes, it\u2019s 40 years since these hosts last made it to their own party. To remember that day, you have to be middle-aged now; to have reported it, you have to be a pensioner.</p> \n  <p>Breaking news: there is another team in this match, and they come trailing no such melancholy stats. New Zealand have reached their second successive World Cup final. But they do have their own version of 30 years of hurt, because they\u2019ve been eternal bridesmaids. They have made it to Lord\u2019s today by an unlikely route, starting sturdily, then losing three games in a row, including one against England. But they are over-achievers, they\u2019re under less pressure than England, they have a strong attack, and the weather \u2013 wet this morning, due to be grey all day \u2013 could hardly be making them feel more at home. The British bookies have England as favourites; if anything, I\u2019d have them as slight outsiders.<br></p> \n  <p>Play starts at 10.30am, British \u201csummer\u201d time.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"528835f81905da8dd82c833226397a44d28756db\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/528835f81905da8dd82c833226397a44d28756db/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MCC members wait in the rain to be allowed in.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MCC members wait in the rain to be allowed in.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-14T09:38:18.386Z\">at 10.38am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d291c9e8f08cf92bb76efbd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-12T23:50:27.008Z\">12.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Pre-preamble</strong></p> \n  <p>Tim will be here shortly.

      "bodyText": "England have won the World Cup. It feels good to write those words and to soak in the outpouring of joy that comes with their thrilling victory over New Zealand. So let\u2019s try to sum up: England are world champions after tying with New Zealand on 241 each after their respective 50 overs. They both scored 15 in the super-over shootout \u2013 but England won thanks to hitting more boundaries in their 50 overs. It is England\u2019s first ever Cricket World Cup and follows final defeats in 1979, 1987 and 1992. Ben Stokes was England\u2019s hero with the bat after he bludgeoned 15 from the final over of the regular innings, including a bizarre six by way of four overthrows. He was made man of the match. England\u2019s captain Eoin Morgan said: \u201cIt\u2019s been an absolutely incredible journey ... I still can\u2019t quite believe it.\u201d New Zealand\u2019s captain Kane Williamson, who was made player of the tournament, said: \u201cJust gutted ... There\u2019s a lot of disappointment.\u201d Barney Ronay celebrates England\u2019s victory as the culmination of four years of planning after a disastrous defeat to the Kiwis in 2015. And Andy Bull reckons it was the greatest game ever played. And that\u2019s it from me. Thanks so much for reading \u2013 and thanks to Rob S, Tim and Rob B for their efforts earlier. None of my words can do justice to such a momentous and dramatic day\u2019s cricket. So maybe just watch some of the action here: Here\u2019s another video to savour (or to endure if you\u2019re watching in New Zealand) covering England\u2019s slightly shaky route to the final. And some more ... Anyway, to borrow from Barry Davies, frankly who cares? It\u2019s all about England today, so let\u2019s just say, for the sake of argument, that this is the best game ever. (And of course, New Zealand played an amazing part and were bloody unlucky.) The front pages look good. Several papers have managed their own tie with a Champagne Super Over headline. The Guardian\u2019s head of UK news, Owen Gibson, guessed right on the Sun\u2019s headline (back page at least). The claims for Sunday\u2019s final to be the greatest game of one-day cricket ever played are stacking up. It\u2019s hard to beat the super over format for drama but the game\u2019s answer to the penalty shootout is always going to be quite rare. The 1999 semi-final between Australia and South Africa was tied and has to be rank alongside this final. The two best teams in the competition were deadlocked, with the Australians going through because they had beaten the Proteas earlier in the tournament. The climax of the semi \u2013 like Sunday\u2019s final \u2013 came with a run out, albeit one of the most comic in cricketing history. Another way that Rees-Mogg might have looked at the England win was this run down of the multicultural mix of the team and concluded that it says a lot about what is great about Britain. Who says sport and politics don\u2019t mix? Just when you\u2019re enjoying England\u2019s historic win, Jacob Rees-Mogg pops up to spoil the fun by claiming it as a triumph for Brexit (or something like that). His tweet that England \u201cdon\u2019t need Europe to win\u201d misses the point on a number of levels, not least that England\u2019s captain is Irish. And he\u2019s not the backstop either. Elliott Kime has written it up for your further reading. You can relive the win by watching our video here ... How about this stat? Not that surprising in some ways, but deeply satisfying all the same. Long live cricket! What a way to hand over the blog. Thanks Rob. This is Martin Farrer taking over in Sydney where the first full day of England\u2019s reign as world champions is just beginning. I had a traumatic night following the match, having fallen asleep towards the end of New Zealand\u2019s innings, then going to bed and waking up again to read on the blog that Stokes was single-handedly trying to drag England over the line. I managed to get up and watch the last over and super overs. Suffice to say I couldn\u2019t get back to sleep after that ... And with that I\u2019ll hand you over to the capable hands of Martin Farrer. Goodbye and thanks for sharing your thoughts. I can\u2019t summarise better than this email from Abhijato Sensarma \u2026 This was the most poetic final fixture in the history of cricket; the match had the most skilful cricket ever seen; we witnessed the most thrilling tie, twice; everyone experienced the most cathartic emotions at the end of it. Needless to say, this was the greatest ODI match of all time. Cheers to everyone involved in playing, covering and following this tournament. Long live cricket! Our man in Nelson reckons the Kiwis are taking the defeat quite well \u2026 Was this the greatest day of simultaneous live sport in the history of Britain? A few frazzled brains in Guardian towers would attest to that. \u201cToday should go down as an absolutely historic, mental, mind-boggling day,\u201d writes Kanishk Srinivasan. \u201cNot just in cricket, but all sporting history. I was watching the Wimbledon finals on my phone and this insane game on my laptop simultaneously. And England needed two runs from that last ball EXACTLY AS DJOKOVIC AND FEDERER WERE TAKING IT IN TO A TIEBREAK. I couldn\u2019t breathe, and I was pulling my hair out, and frantically deciding which one deserves my primary attention. At the end of the day, I had to go take a 20-minute walk just to settle my nerves. That being said, well played England, and New Zealand absolutely deserved it as much as England (if not that teeny tiny bit more).\u201d Amid all the euphoria, Simon Thomas has taken a moment to remember the late, great Dan Lucas. \u201cTell you what, Rob,\u201d he writes. \u201cOur much loved OBO guy, Dan Lucas would have loved this. And would have described it brilliantly. Miss you, Dan.\u201d We all miss you Dan, and we\u2019ll never forget you mate. The Queen is on Twitter, and tweeting her congratulations to the glorious champions \u2026 Theresa May is dancing again. It must be a momentous day \u2026 Even the suits behind the Cricket World Cup are in jovial spirits tonight \u2026 \u201cMyself, my three daughters and cricket mad hubby \u2026 all of us die-hard Pakistan fans \u2026. are currently in Paris where everyone is obsessed with some tournament called Wimbledon,\u201d writes Natasha Shoaib. \u201cWalking around Le Marais on Bastille day we wandered into an English pub for a pit stop during the final 10 overs, put on data and followed ball by ball commentary online. As neutrals we were supporting the Kiwis and were on the edge of our seats for the last hour of the match. What an incredible match and fitting end to one of the most exciting cricket world cups ever. The Kiwis have won our hearts \u2026 I will still wear my Pak green team shirt \u2026 but am getting the name \u201cWilliamson\u201d put on the back!\u201d Kane Williamson was given a standing ovation as he left his press conference after the final, his dignity in defeat a lesson to us all. \u201cJust one of those things,\u201d was his take on a loss as unfortunate as you can imagine. His reaction to learning he had been named player of the tournament summed him up \u2026 Kane, we salute you \u2026 The sun was out when England won the World Cup. It had just emerged from behind the freckles of white cloud and was shining low through the bright blue over the Grand Stand. The shadows stretched over the grass all the way to the wicket, the flags licked in the evening breeze, the pavilion glowed soft terracotta. The old place looked pretty as a picture, exactly how we see it in winter, when we are thinking back on the games we saw and the games we played in the long, warm days of summer. For the 11 men in this England team, the thousands in the ground, the millions watching on TV, that is how they will always see it in their minds in years to come when they talk about this match: the greatest World Cup final; heck, maybe even the greatest game of one-day cricket ever played. Where better for England\u2019s transgenerational trauma to end than the home of cricket, writes Andy Bull. Read his full story here. Jason Roy has a simple take on the day\u2019s proceedings \u2026 Graeme Swann, unsurprisingly, was more loquacious \u2026 \u201cWhat the bloody hell just happened?\u201d writes Guy Hornsby. \u201cI started the match in London, ended it up in Manchester, and I still can\u2019t get my head around what went down. I don\u2019t think I was even that tense when my daughter was born. I shed a tear \u2013 of relief \u2013 at the end, because I couldn\u2019t take another ball. Then I forgot we actually won. And that\u2019s first the first cricket game my two-year old daughter has ever watched. So tough on the Black Caps, but my god we DID IT. Thanks to all the OBOers and Guardian writers. It\u2019s been magic because of all of you. I may need a week off work. These guys have the Ashes in a few weeks.\u201d Some of the emails from our loyal OBO community have been almost as good as the cricket today. The tales from far flung corners, the camaraderie and the pure love of the game have been quite something. Stephen Wilcox encapsulates the drama in three short sentences. \u201cWe left our B&amp;B in Ravenna with England guaranteed losers,\u201d he writes. \u201cAt the end of the street we passed someone in a restaurant saying 3 from 2. And getting back after eating \u2013 this is worthy of an epic.\u201d Great pub quiz question alert? What have Mark Wood and the Charlton brothers got in common? Guardian man Richard Jolly has the answer \u2026 This was a match full of incredible moments, but for anyone who missed the greatest of all in the history of England cricket, here it is \u2026 Brendon McCullum knows what it\u2019s like to lose a World Cup final, and he reckons New Zealand will be just fine after this devastating defeat\u2026 They\u2019ve got a wonderful leader in Kane Williamson and a great squad around them but you know, our country is going to be so proud of these guys and what they\u2019ve done. Thanks Rob, and I join you just as Ian Botham is having his say on a wonderful game \u2026 What great finale. Both sides had a dip in the middle in the tournament but came back and picked themselves up for a final. You couldn\u2019t have asked for a better final. Congratulations to England but spare a thought for those Kiwis 12,000 miles away. It\u2019s a long journey home when you come that close buy ultimately it wasn\u2019t their day. We\u2019ll keep the blog going for a while. Nobody leaves here until somebody explains what the hell just happened. Rob Bleaney is going to take over, because I am the personification of wibble. Thanks for your company and emails - not just today but throughout the tournament. Bye! \u201cOn a flight from Boston to Tokyo - the flight attendant made me shut down my phone when England needed 3 from 2 balls,\u201d says Mike Fowler. \u201cTook 10 minutes to acquire flaky inflight Internet, by which time I assumed it would all be over. Lived the super overs with your text and texts from friends back home. I think they were lining up a sky marshall to deal with me when I started cheering....\u201d \u201cYeah, okay,\u201d says Geoff Wignall, \u201cbut The Hundred will soon put all this in the shade.\u201d New Zealand made 241 for eight England were all out for 241 The match was tied, which meant it went to a super over England scored 15 in the super over New Zealand scored 15 in their super over, which meant the super over was also tied England won the World Cup on a technicality That technicality, specifically, was that they hit more boundaries than New Zealand England have won the World Cup Have you read Vic Marks\u2019 report from Lord\u2019s? Good. Read it again. And again. The England players are emotionally naked. Eoin Morgan has admitted to doubts that England would qualify, Joe Root has described the sheer misery he experienced in the dressing-room, Ben Stokes has just sworn on Sky. After four years, the masks have come off, and it\u2019s quite touching to see. \u201cEven though I know what happens, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to watch the highlights of that,\u201d says Samuel Honywill. \u201cEver. That was Edgbaston 2005 x 100. Feel awful for the Black Caps, who were just about the better team on the day. But England deserve that; for picking themselves up by the bootstraps after 2015, for being the most thrilling ODI side for the last four years, for salvaging their campaign in such confident fashion after those defeats to Australia and Sri Lanka left it on the rocks. Jofra, Jos, Ben, Eoin. Amazing.\u201d Here\u2019s Jofra Archer \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing feeling. They\u2019re a great bunch of guys \u2013 I don\u2019t think I\u2019d like to share this with any other people right now. Never in my wildest dreams did I think this would happen. Even last night, I couldn\u2019t really get to sleep. When I got hit for six in the super over I thought it wasn\u2019t coming home. We got there in the end, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d It\u2019s an old question, but somebody should ask it of Ben Stokes: who writes your scripts? \u201cI\u2019m at Nowlan Park in Kilkenny, Ireland,\u201d says Lucy Openshaw. \u201cNeil Young\u2019s on stage, cricket\u2019s on my phone. Sorry Neil.\u201d The crowd are singing \u2018cricket\u2019s coming home\u2019. And it did \u2013 but bloody hell, it could have done with a better sat-nav. Jason Roy speaks \u201cSpeechless, buddy. Speechless. We\u2019re gonna party well tonight \u2013 but we\u2019ll be in before 12, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Here\u2019s Eoin Morgan, the England captain \u201cJeez. I\u2019d like to offer commiserations to Kane and his team. I thought today was a hard-hard-fought game on a tough wicket. We find it hard to play on pitches like that, but it was all about getting over the line. Towards the end I was being cooled down by Liam Plunkett, which isn\u2019t a good sign! We\u2019re just delighted we\u2019re lifting the trophy today. \u201cThere are a lot of people who\u2019ve been involved along the way who aren\u2019t in the changing-room today: giys like Andrew Strauss, Paul Farbrace, David Willey, Sam Billings and others. It\u2019s been an incredible amount of hard work, and it\u2019s all worth it for this.\u201d Here\u2019s Kane Williamson again, this time in his role as captain. \u201cWe wanted to bat first if we won the toss. We felt runs on the board would be challenging. We may have liked another 10-20 but in a World Cup final, we thought 240-250 might be enough. It was a fantastic game of cricket. For it to go down to the last ball \u2013 and then the last ball of the next little match \u2013 is tough. But credit to England. There are a lot of positives for us. \u201cThat [Stokes\u2019s accidental boundary] was a little bit of a shame, wasn\u2019t it? You just hope it doesn\u2019t happen at moments like that. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t meant to be for us.\u201d The Player of the Tournament is Kane Williamson \u201cCongratulations to England. They\u2019ve had a fantastic campaign and they deserved the victory. It\u2019s been challenging; the pitches have been different to what we expected. There weren\u2019t many 300+ scores. I\u2019d like to thank our side for the fight and heart they showed to get us this far. It just wasn\u2019t meant to be today. The guys are shattered; it\u2019s devastating.\u201d Jofra Archer is yet to regain his cool. I was pretty sure I was going to bowl [in the super over] but I had to check with Morgs\u2026my heart is still racing. I would have been surprised if we didn\u2019t win, especially with this man around [points to Stokes] A clearly desolate Jimmy Neesham speaks but is sportsmanship embodied. It stings, obviously. The ball didn\u2019t bounce our way. Credit to the way Jos and Stokesey rode it out. Another day it might have fallen our way. In a few years we will look back and say it was a really good experience. We scrapped like hell for every 50-50 ball\u2026I\u2019d like to say I was happy for England but it would take a couple of hours to say that. The Player of the Match is Ben Stokes \u201cOn trail bikes in the Canadian Rockies,\u201d says John Cameron, \u201cstopping every over to check in. Our hearts were in our mouths. And we are a Kiwi/English husband and wife!\u201d The true spirit of the OBO. The player of the match is Ben Stokes, who was in bits about half an hour ago. As were millions of cricket lovers. Ben Stokes, the hero of the hour, speaks. I am pretty lost for words. All the hard work to get here and be world champions, it\u2019s an amazing feeling. Playing against New Zealand is always a good event, they are good lads. I will be apologising to Kane for the rest of my life [re: the overthrow for the six]\u2026It was written in the stars to happen for us. \u201cI love Ben Stokes,\u201d says Tony Batt, \u201cand Jofra is the name of the next-born in my family, male or female.\u201d I like it, especially the female bit. \u201cBut you\u2019ve gotta feel for the Kiwis. Taking it like men is probably not on the approved list but R.E.S.P.E.C.T. and big love for such a game. WOW!\u201d Joe Root speaks with that shy smile of his. The pressure was on. It was almost written in the stars for Ben and his family, the pressure he\u2019s been through. Liam Plunkett goes all 1980s footballer. What a day, what a finish. Hats off to the Kiwis boys. It\u2019s not sunk in yet. I am over the moon. It felt like it was going to happen for us. \u201cI\u2019m getting my T-Shirt ready,\u201d says Neville Bourke. \u201cHave you noticed how we only win the cricket World Cup under an IRISH captain?\u201d Jos Buttler speaks \u2026 It\u2019s unbelievable. I thought I\u2019d seen everything in cricket but that game was just amazing. I don\u2019t know what happened out there at the end. Just incredible. Jonny Bairstow is speechless \u2026 What a spectacle, what an atmosphere. I\u2019m just lost for words mate. But the winners are \u2013 and I cannot believe I\u2019m typing this \u2013 England. They have won their first World Cup in the wackiest of circumstances: always behind when they batted, at times paralysed by the slow pitch, yet dragged over the line by (primarily) three players. Jos Buttler, with his silky strokeplay and icy nerve. Ben Stokes, with his bloodymindedness and determination to atone for allowing a World Twenty20 final to end with four sixes. And Jofra Archer, with his preternatural calm in the Super Over: he\u2019s gone from new boy to Atlas in three months. But hang on \u2013 three is not enough. Let\u2019s not forget Chris Woakes, superb with the new ball, or Liam Plunkett, who showed his usual mastery in the middle overs when Kane Williamson was threatening to take control. Or Mark Wood, who bowled at 95mph and had to run that last run with Stokes. Or Roy and Bairstow, who powered England to the final with all those hundred partnerships. Or Adil Rashid, who took crucial wickets in the semi against Australia. Or Joe Root, who was one of the batsmen of the tournament, if not on song today. Or Moeen Ali, who was in the first XI at the start of this World Cup and probably deserved to be at the end. Or, above all, Eoin Morgan \u2013 the boss, the visionary, the driver of a revolution that has ended in triumph. New Zealand would have been worthy winners. They certainly don\u2019t deserve to be nearly men yet again, beaten finalists for the second time in a row, following all those semis down the decades. What they lack in charisma, they more than make up by being cool, calm and civilised. They kept their heads, they bounced back from three successive defeats, they were brave enough to bat first and canny enough to defend a modest total, yet again. They were even sporting enough to signal six, themselves, when Trent Boult fell over the sponge trying to catch Ben Stokes\u2019s first big hit. Thanks Rob (you played a blinder). What an ending. It hardly matters who won. That was an epic, a drama in God knows how many acts. It was the greatest cricket World Cup final there has been, by a mile. That\u2019s it. Ben Stokes, the biggest superhero of them all, is in tears. New Zealand have taken the defeat - if we can even call it that - with astonishing dignity. I am an absolute mess, so I\u2019m going to hand over to Tim de Lisle for the reaction. That last hour was the most excruciating privilege of my career. Thanks for your company and emails. England have won the World Cup. I think. Archer is on his knees, almost in tears. I cannot begin to imagine what New Zealand are going through. They deserve to win, unquestionably, but were beaten in circumstances that would have been beyond Hunter S Thompson on acid, never mind your average scriptwriter. And that, ladies, is goodnight. Cricket has nothing left to offer and will now cease to exist as a sport. That is the most amazing game I have ever seen in my life. Jos Buttler ran Martin Guptill out by inches and set off on a lap of honour. ENGLAND HAVE WON THE WORLD CUP! If New Zealand score one off the last ball, England win because they hit more boundaries in the match. Super Over, ball 5: New Zealand 14-0 (need 16 to win the World Cup) A single! New Zealand need two off the last ball. Martin Guptill needs two off the last ball. What sick, exhilarating hell is this? Super Over, ball 4: New Zealand 13-0 (need 16 to win the World Cup) Two more! New Zealand need three to win the World Cup! Super Over, ball 3: New Zealand 11-0 (need 16 to win the World Cup) Two more runs after a misfield! New Zealand are almost there. Super Over, ball 2: New Zealand 9-0 (need 16 to win the World Cup) Neesham has smacked Archer over midwicket for a huge six!!! Super Over, ball 1: New Zealand 3-0 (need 16 to win the World Cup) A brilliant yorker is crunched for two. Super Over, ball 0: New Zealand 1-0 (need 16 to win the World Cup) Archer goes around the wicket to Neesham \u2013 and it\u2019s an off-side wide! \u201cThis,\u201d says Carl Rosman, \u201chad better not go to an underarm, eh?\u201d \u201cArcher has never conceded 16 off an ODI over,\u201d says my colleague Tim de Lisle, \u201cbut then he\u2019s never had to do it under this pressure.\u201d The New Zealand batsmen are Martin Guptill and Jimmy Neesham. Guptill, who has had a dog of a tournament with the bat, could become the biggest hero in the history of the World Cup. And that\u2019s why he gets paid the big bucks There are unconfirmed reports that Jofra Archer no longer has a resting heart rate. If New Zealand score 15, England will win the World Cup. Imagine if they won the World Cup after a tie in a Super Over. New Zealand deserve to win this game. For all the supersupersuperheroism of Ben Stokes, England have had all kinds of luck today. This, truly, has been a unique game of sport. Super Over, ball 6: England 15-0 Buttler hammers Boult over midwicket for four! England have got 15 off the Super Over. New Zealand need 16 to win the World Cup. Please don\u2019t ask me what happens if they score 15. Super Over, ball 5: England 10-0 A superb yorker is pushed for two by Buttler. \u201cCan John Withington pls send me 6 numbers between 1 and 60?\u201d says Matthew Parker. Super Over, ball 4: England 9-0 Jofra Archer is warming up. He\u2019ll bowl the Super Over. Stokes gets a single into the covers. Super Over, ball 3: England 8-0 Stokes drags Boult through midwicket for four! Super Over, ball 2: England 4-0 Buttler crashes Boult into the leg side \u2013 but it\u2019s only a single. Super Over, ball 1: England 3-0 Stokes slices it to third man for three! Trent Boult will bowl the Super Over Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler are walking out for the Super Over. I\u2019d imagine Jason Roy is the third batsman, but it\u2019s probably unwise to assume too much after this bonkers final. \u201cIt\u2019s 5.21am in New Zealand,\u201d says Rebecca Caroe, \u201cand much of the country is awake and going to be late for work this Monday...\u201d It\u2019s a national holiday, in nature if not name. Anyone know if Costa Coffee are hiring? I can\u2019t do this any more. I have no idea why England are batting first, but they are. Those are the regulations. Each team has three batsmen, and if they lose two wickets that\u2019s the end of the Super Over. England will bat first in the Super Over. Stokes is beyond exhausted. He played an amazing innings, 84 not out from 98 balls, and has been through dozens of emotions in the last 10 seconds alone. New Zealand\u2019s fielding, under unimaginable pressure, was sensational. And Stokes\u2019s accidental six was, in context, one of the most bizarre things I\u2019ve ever seen. Wood came back for a second, to win the World Cup, but Boult held his nerve to collect the throw and break the stumps. England got one, which means the scores are level. England 241 all out. WICKET! England 241 all out (Wood run out 0) I do not believe this! England need one for a Super Over, two to win, Stokes is on strike. What torture is this? Stokes rests on his haunches, trying to summon the energy for one last boundary. He is spent, completely spent. New Zealand are taking an age to set the field. Here comes Boult, and Stokes drives it for one - but Rashid is run out! The laws are non-negotiable, but that is astonishingly harsh on New Zealand. 49.4 overs: England 239-8 (need 3 from 2 balls to win) No way! No way! Stokes has got another six runs in amazing circumstances. He slid to make a second, and the throw hit his bat and went for four more! Astonishing! I have never seen anything like that in all my life. Stokes put his hands up to apologise straight away, but it\u2019s six. That is unbelievably harsh on New Zealand. 49.3 overs: England 233-8 (need 9 from 3 balls to win) Stokes clouts it over midwicket for six! 49.2 overs: England 227-7 (need 15 from 4 balls to win) Stokes can only drive a wide yorker straight to the fielder. This is sensational bowling! 49.1 overs: England 227-7 (need 15 from 5 balls to win) Stokes turns down a single from the first ball. He\u2019s entering Brathwaite territory. 49 overs: England 227-8 (need 15 from 6 balls to win) Jimmy Neesham bowls Archer with a magnificent slower ball. England, or rather Ben Stokes, needs 15 from Trent Boult\u2019s final over to win the World Cup. Is it too real for ya? Cleaned him up! 48.5 overs: England 227-7 (need 15 from 7 balls to win) Stokes takes a single. Archer wanted two but Stokes sent him back. 48.4 overs: England 226-7 (need 16 from 8 balls to win) Oh my days! Stokes clouts a slower ball to cow corner, where Boult takes a great catch \u2013 and then steps on the rope! It\u2019s six runs! Plunkett boffs Neesham to long off, where Boult takes a calm catch. England need 22 from 9 balls. New Zealand are this close. 48.1 overs: England 219-6 (need 23 from 11 balls to win) Jimmy Neesham takes the penultimate over. Plunkett heaves him into the leg side for a single. 48 overs: England 218-6 (need 24 from 12 balls to win) A single. Plunkett keeps the strike, England need two a ball and Stokes looks utterly shattered. 47.5 overs: England 216-6 (need 25 from 13 balls to win) Plunkett hits an attempted yorker down the ground for two, with a shattered Stokes almost run out as he grimaces back for the second. 47.4 overs: England 215-6 (need 27 from 14 balls to win) Plunkett muscles Boult towards wide long on for a couple and then misses an attempted pull. I SAID DON\u2019T PANIC. 47.2 overs: England 213-6 (Stokes 62, Plunkett 4) A single. England need 29 off 16. The rest of the country needs gin. I\u2019ll be honest, right now I\u2019d even consider having it without Fever Tree tonic. 47.1 overs: England 212-6 (Stokes 61, Plunkett 4) Trent Boult will bowl two of the last three overs, with Jimmy Neesham presumably taking the 49th. Stokes hammers Boult\u2019s first ball through midwicket for four! 47 overs: England 208-6 (Stokes 57, Plunkett 4) Plunkett bashes Ferguson for four before being duped by a superb slower ball that bounces over the stumps. The outstanding Ferguson ends with figures of 10-0-50-3. England need 34 from 18 balls. 46.4 overs: England 204-6 (Stokes 57, Plunkett 0) Two dot balls from Ferguson to Plunkett! The net is closing around England. The New Zealand bowlers\u2019s lack of clammyhandedness is staggering. 46.2 overs: England 204-6 (Stokes 57, Plunkett 0) The batsmen crossed while that ball was in outer space, and Stokes waves the next ball for a single. England need 38 from 22. Liam Plunkett has the highest strike rate in the whole tournament; boy do England need a 10-ball 17 now. \u201cThe final act of the Great Stokes Redemption Arc?\u201d begs Matt Dony. I mean, I know technically he put a question mark, but I can read between lines. 46.1 overs: Woakes tried to clout Ferguson over the leg side and top-edged it miles in the air. Tom Latham\u2019s entire career flashed before him as he backpedalled, but eventually he took the catch. Lockie Ferguson might be the player of the match - he\u2019s taken three wickets and a magnificent catch to get rid of Eoin Morgan. Woakes is out! 46 overs: England 203-5 (Stokes 56, Woakes 2) Stokes plays a brilliant stroke, smacking Neesham wristily through midwicket for four! 45.4 overs: England 198-5 (Stokes 52, Woakes 1) A single to deep cover. England need 44 from 26 balls. 45.3 overs: England 197-5 (Stokes 51, Woakes 1) A dot ball from Neesham to Stokes. He is getting so frustrated with his inability to middle the ball, or in that case lay a bat on it. 45.2 overs: England 197-5 (Stokes 51, Woakes 1) Woakes drives Neesham for a single. England are in trouble here; they need 45 from 28. 45th over: England 196-5 (Stokes 51, Woakes 0) We always talk about the effect of scoreboard pressure on batsmen, as if bowling in a situation like this is the easiest thing in the world. As somebody who can barely feel his fingers - and I only have to describe the action - I\u2019m in awe of how well New Zealand have bowled. \u201cFancy a drink, Rob?\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cI\u2019ve got three dozen cans of Relentless in the fridge, I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s good for the nerves.\u201d You think this is funny? Jos Buttler has gone! He sliced Ferguson miles in the air towards the point boundary, where the substitute Tim Southee ran in to take a superb low catch. Buttler played gloriously for his 59, but I suspect he takes England\u2019s chances through the Long Room with him. Jos Buttler is out! 44th over: England 189-4 (Stokes 50, Buttler 53) Buttler drives Boult over extra-cover for four to bring up an immense half-century from 53 balls, and then Stokes drives a yorker for a single to reach an unyielding fifty of his own from 81 balls. Boult has got his yorker going now, and the last ball of the over is a gem that Buttler just manages to dig out. England need 53 from 36 balls. \u201cIt\u2019s not the despair, Bob,\u201d says Alex Netherton. \u201cIt\u2019s the crushing sense of inevitable defeat and self-hatred.\u201d 43rd over: England 183-4 (Stokes 49, Buttler 48) Buttler premeditates a lap for two off Ferguson. That was an extraordinary shot, because it was a slower ball and he had to wait before guiding it past leg stump. Seven from the over - five singles and a two. England need 59 from 42 balls. That is a big ask on this pitch. It\u2019s Buttler or bust, I think. 42nd over: England 177-4 (Stokes 47, Buttler 44) The Win Predictor has England at 69 per cent. But the Win Predictor hasn\u2019t lived through the last 44 years. Nor have I, but let\u2019s not split hairs. Neesham knocks Stokes off his feet with a superb yorker. Stokes just managed to get his bat down in time. But he\u2019s struggling to find the middle of that bat, and there are only four runs from the over. Stokes has 47 from 77 balls, Buttler 44 from 48. \u201cI can\u2019t deal with this any more,\u201d says Shaun Bowler. \u201cIt\u2019s 4 a.m. in the Solomon Islands. I\u2019m going to go to sleep for the last 10 overs and wake up to a New Zealand victory.\u201d I can\u2019t decide, from that message, whether you are an England or New Zealand fan. 41st over: England 171-4 (Stokes 44, Buttler 43) Stokes has been nowhere near as fluent as Buttler, although he does look comfortable at the crease. For now he needs to give Buttler the strike at every opportunity. New Zealand need a wicket, by hook or by crook. Ferguson beats Buttler with a blistering bouncer; Buttler shaped to hook and then pulled out at the last minute. The run rate is becoming an issue for England: they need 69 from 54 balls. England need 72 runs from 60 balls 40th over: England 170-4 (Stokes 43, Buttler 42) Matt Henry returns to bowl his final over. Both teams know one wicket will give the Win Predictor an existential crisis \u2013 and Henry almost gets it with a slower ball that lifts viciously to beat Stokes\u2019 provisional cut stroke. After four singles, Buttler premeditates a brilliant ramp for four off Henry\u2019s last delivery. Henry finishes with 10-2-40-1; there are lies, damned lies and bowling figures. 39th over: England 162-4 (Stokes 41, Buttler 36) Stokes drags a short ball from Ferguson through midwicket for four. He didn\u2019t time it but it ran away to the boundary. These two have played ever so well, with a lot of intelligence, and they need 80 from the last 11 overs. \u201cMy son has gone to work now,\u201d says Adam Roberts. \u201cApparently, on Thursday a huge row broke out about what to have on in the staff canteen, cricket or tennis. Both are pretty tense right now.\u201d Sounds like they might have some live boxing on as well. 38th over: England 156-4 (Stokes 36, Buttler 35) Stokes, on the charge, inside edges Neesham just past his leg stump for a couple of runs. Win or lose, England have had the luck today. Buttler chips Neesham\u2019s slower ball whence it came for four; it wasn\u2019t far away from Neesham, who stretched to his right in his follow through, but it was ultimately safe. It\u2019s a reflection of this tricky pitch that Stokes and Buttler have hit only five boundaries between them. \u201cHas anyone yet suggested the tie and Super Over?\u201d asks John Withington. \u201cThe cricket equivalent of the penalty shootout. I wonder if teams have a ready-made plan. I\u2019d presume Archer would bowl and Roy would bat with Buttler?\u201d You are a vile, twisted man. 37th over: England 149-4 (Stokes 33, Buttler 31) Ferguson returns to the attack. Buttler slaps a cut for four off the first ball, prompting huge cheers from a crowd who are really getting into their alcohol this match now. Buttler is duped by a slower one next up, but it lands safely on the off side. Beautiful bowling from Ferguson, whose raw pace sometimes obscures a very smart cricket brain. Six from the over; England need 93 from 78 balls. \u201cRob,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cTV pictures earlier made it look like Joe Root is watching forlornly on his own from the (very) naughty step ...\u201d There won\u2019t be any Bob Willis impersonations if England lose, that\u2019s for sure. 36th over: England 143-4 (Stokes 32, Buttler 26) \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Anthony, Paul and Rasputin. \u201cWe\u2019re sitting out a sweltering Venetian evening in the attic. Panicked by a shout when I popped to the kitchen, but it was merely a gondolier signalling a left turn. We may have to seek solace in a Bastille Day bash. Vive la France.\u201d Henry angled a full delivery into Buttler, who fell over towards the off side as he flicked around his front pad. Kumar Dharmasena gave it not out so New Zealand went upstairs, but the angle from wide on the crease was taking it past leg stump. It was missing leg stump. This is closer than I thought. This is huge. I reckon it\u2019ll be umpire\u2019s call, but it\u2019s close. 35th over: England 141-4 (Stokes 31, Buttler 25) Stokes survives a run-out chance off the first ball after drinks. It was a poor throw from Neesham at backward point, with Stokes well short of his ground. That is one of four singles from Santner\u2019s over. England are handling him with care, for now. \u201cIt brings a tear to the eye,\u201d says Phil Sawyer, \u201cto think that across the country young children, perhaps seeing cricket for the first time, are currently listening to their elders explain, \u2018This? This stomach clenching fear? This nauseating tension? This heartbreaking contemplation that once again we might be so near yet so far? This. This is what we\u2019ve been talking about. This.... is watching the England cricket team. You\u2019re welcome.\u2019\u201d 34th over: England 137-4 (Stokes 29, Buttler 23) Matt Henry, who bowled a sensational seven-over spell at the start of the innings, replaces Trent Boult. Stokes hits his first three balls for two and then checks a slower ball in the air but wide of cover. That brings up a determined and composed fifty partnership from 65 balls. The over ends with Stokes getting a leading edge that falls just short of Henry, diving forward in his follow through. Sheesh it\u2019s tense. England need 105 from 96 balls, and it\u2019s time for the last Powerade Hydration Break. I wish it was a Highland Park Hydration break, at least in this office. \u201cGive the thinly veiled snide comments about NZ, the pitch (at age 6 we\u2019re taught that it\u2019s the same for both sides) etc. a rest pal,\u201d writes Buck Satan II. \u201cYou can support England inside but report on a sporting event at least vaguely impartially, like a journalist rather than a fan blogger.\u201d It\u2019s a blog, dear Buck, not a judicial review. 33rd over: England 129-4 (Stokes 22, Buttler 22) \u201cI feel you are letting Morgan off a little lightly,\u201d says Jonathan McKinley. \u201c\u2018Just picking the wrong option\u2019 is not what you would hope for in a captain with his experience at this stage of a World Cup final.\u201d I can barely feel my fingers and I\u2019m only typing about a World Cup final, so I\u2019ve some sympathy for those who make mistakes while playing in one. 32nd over: England 126-4 (Stokes 21, Buttler 21) Buttler cuts Boult this far wide of the flying Guptill at backward point. That would have been the catch of the millennium. Instead the ball raced away for Buttler\u2019s first boundary. Both batsmen have 21 \u2013 Buttler from 22 balls, Stokes from 43. \u201cTouch of the Brian McMillan in de Grandhomme\u2019s bowling,\u201d says Lee Calvert, \u201cbut he looks less likely to chin you over a late-night scotch than big Brian did.\u201d Or walk into the dressing-room wielding a gun. 31st over: England 119-4 (Stokes 20, Buttler 15) The left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner comes into the attack for the first time, and goes straight round the wicket to Buttler. That\u2019s how he dismissed him at Durham, from memory. Santner is a crafty, subtle spinner, against whom liberties are not always wise, so England settle for four low-risk singles. \u201cHey Rob,\u201d says Honor Harger. \u201cHonor (usually from Singapore, currently at Lord\u2019s). This is a really grand, but tense affair here. Lots of the Indian supporters have switched to Kiwi supporters (thankfully - we needed the help) and the English supporters are jovial but nervous. Cracking atmosphere. So, we are side on so a bit hard to tell. But what\u2019s your verdict on the pitch?\u201d It\u2019s tricky, isn\u2019t it. If you say it\u2019s not good enough it sounds like sour grapes, and there\u2019s probably an element of that. But I\u2019m not sure any ODI, never mind a World Cup final, should be played on the kind of pitch that makes you wish England had included Darren Stevens in their squad. 30th over: England 115-4 (Stokes 18, Buttler 13) Boult replaces Neesham. It\u2019s quite simple: if he strikes in this spell, New Zealand will almost certainly win the World Cup. Stokes and especially Buttler are batting pretty well - but they are really struggling to hit boundaries. New Zealand\u2019s mundane rotation of the strike looks like it could be decisive. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says Phil Withall. \u201cIt\u2019s two in the morning. I have red wine, I\u2019m eating bananas and I have a young child taking my place in my bed. Worst of all this game is panning out just as I suspected it would. I had a feeling New Zealand had the capability to make things challenging for England and that seems to be the case. In a way I\u2019m rather comfortable with the situation, not happy but comfortable.\u201d 29th over: England 111-4 (Stokes 16, Buttler 11) Buttler almost falls to consecutive deliveries from de Grandhomme! The first went through the gate and bounced over the stumps; the second was sliced high in the air and landed just short of third man. de Grandhomme ends a remarkable, surreal spell with figures of 10-2-25-1. 28th over: England 106-4 (Stokes 16, Buttler 9) Buttler has started his innings with authority and intent. The problem is that, because he is rotating the strike so much better than Stokes, he is only facing one or two balls an over. Stokes has had enough of failing to pierce the field; he charges Neesham and smears the ball straight back down the ground for four. England need 136 from 132 balls. \u201cWhat was Morgan thinking?\u201d says Spencer Francis. \u201cAnd how was Root so flustered? Never expected that from Root.\u201d I doubt he expected him from himself, either. Morgan had to do something, because England were going nowhere; he just picked the wrong option. 27th over: England 98-4 (Stokes 10, Buttler 7) The demon de Grandhomme almost grabs another wicket, with Stokes check-driving just short of mid-on. He bowls a maiden to Stokes, which gives him figures of 9-2-22-1. It\u2019s like Dibbly, Dobbly and Wobbly, the three tortoises of the apocalypse from 1992, never went away. The pitch is not good enough but New Zealand - for the second time in the knockout stages - have used it admirably. 26th over: England 98-4 (Stokes 10, Buttler 7) Buttler has started busily, the first England player to rotate strike from the off, and has seven from five balls.. Stokes is playing more carefully, trying to take the game deep, and has 10 from 24. Five from Neesham\u2019s over, during which the required rate sneaked above a run a ball for the first time. Thanks Tim, hello everyone. So, who fancies a knighthood? If England are to win the World Cup, Ben Stokes or Jos Buttler will have to play a career-defining innings. At the moment, New Zealand \u2013 who have bowled exceptionally on a helpful pitch \u2013 are putting England to sleep. Eoin Morgan\u2019s team are peerless front-runners; they aren\u2019t so good at coming from behind on awkward pitches, especially when there is no tomorrow. We\u2019ve said it a few times in this tournament, but this, truly, is the real quiz. And the answer is not Fray Bentos. 25th over: England 93-4 (Stokes 7, Buttler 5) Buttler, who is so adaptable, has decided to play with his wrists rather than his long handle, working the ball into the gaps. And at last, the win predictor has noticed that NZ are doing quite well here \u2013 it gives them 50pc, to England\u2019s 48. I\u2019d say 80-20. That\u2019s the halfway stage, England still need 149 off 150 balls, they\u2019ve got a longer tail than usual... Cometh the hour, cometh Rob Smyth. Thanks for your company. 24th over: England 89-4 (Stokes 5, Buttler 3) England\u2019s hopes rest on the shoulders of Jos Buttler, who hasn\u2019t batted much lately. He starts calmly, pushing to leg for two, and into the covers for one. As Morgan played that upper cut, he yelled \u201cNo!\u201d, and not because he didn\u2019t want to run. \u201cThe England batting,\u201d says Richard Graveling, \u201cis defeating the object of transmitting the final on free-to-air. How can a nation be inspired if they\u2019re watching it from behind the sofa?\u201d Morgan upper-cuts, the cover sweeper races in to take a diving catch, they\u2019re checking it upstairs but that is out. Great play from NZ, and England are right on the ropes. 23rd over: England 86-3 (Morgan 9, Stokes 5) England keep on charging de Grandhomme, as if it will suddenly start to work. And, to be fair, it does, as Stokes plays a controlled pull for four. The keeper, Latham, responds by calling for a helmet and coming up to the stumps. Pinned to the crease, Stokes can only block. It\u2019s cat-and-mouse and, as in all the best cartoons, the mouse is winning. 22nd over: England 82-3 (Morgan 9, Stokes 1) Kane Williamson comes across as a nice guy, but that won\u2019t stop him going for the kill. He gives Ferguson a wide slip and a deep gully for Morgan, encouraging him to bang it in. Morgan ducks a bouncer and gets a graze on the helmet. Most of the scoring is now being done by extras: two leg byes, four wides as a bouncer sails over the keeper. And here\u2019s an email from Rob Smyth, of all people. \u201cDeath by de Grandhomme in a World Cup final. How miserable.\u201d 21st over: England 75-3 (Morgan 9, Stokes 1) Stokes comes down the pitch to de Grandhomme and swishes at thin air. Then he stays in his crease and cuts at thin air. The second batch of ten overs brought only 34 runs for the loss of two big wickets. 20th over: England 73-3 (Morgan 8, Stokes 1) Bairstow had just emerged from a quiet spell with a handsome cover drive, played on the up. But this isn\u2019t his sort of pitch and it got him in the end. So England have their two left-handers together, and they\u2019ve got a rebuilding job to do. Gone!!! That inside edge again \u2013 it\u2019s third time unlucky as Bairstow\u2019s Harrow squirt goes onto the stumps. Are England choking? 19th over: England 66-2 (Bairstow 32, Morgan 7) Morgan, typically, has a plan: get busy. He has seven off 11 balls, which is a silent reproach to poor old Root. The win predictor is still giving England 76 per cent, and I\u2019m still saying you should cut that in half. 18th over: England 63-2 (Bairstow 32, Morgan 4) Morgan stays legside, in the manner Kevin Pietersen doesn\u2019t approve of, and it gets him two as he pokes to third man and runs hard. When the going gets tough, the tough get running. 17th over: England 60-2 (Bairstow 32, Morgan 1) Well bowled de Grandhomme, who has 1-9 off four overs. Just when you thought the dibbly-dobbler had gone out of fashion... Root ended up with a double whammy, a low score off a load of balls (29). But Morgan deflects his first delivery for a neat single. That\u2019s as good as it gets for England at the moment. Mid-17th over: England 59-2 (Bairstow 32, Morgan 0) And that\u2019s drinks, with Morgan yet to face a ball, and England exactly where the New Zealanders want them to be. This is tense as hell. Another big one! Root was so frustrated that he charged de Grandhomme and missed, then slashed from the crease and got a nick. And Kane Williamson slips back into the driving seat. 16th over: England 59-1 (Bairstow 32, Root 7) Henry takes his sweater, and a bow, with the formidable figures of 7-2-22-1. Lockie Ferguson comes on and tests both batsmen with his signature mix of the full and the short. When Joe Root plays a pull, it\u2019s well stopped by Martin Guptill, prowling at short fine leg. And here\u2019s Simon Mcmahon. \u201cThis is going to be incredibly tense, isn\u2019t it? I suspect, deep down, England fans would not want it any other way. A finish similar to the dramatic France v Germany European Cricket Federation Nations Cup final in 1997 would not surprise me. Or else England will romp home by 7 wickets. Either way, it\u2019s Bastille Day, so a glass of champagne later could be in order...\u201d 15th over: England 56-1 (Bairstow 31, Root 6) More fluency, at least from the scoreboard operator, as the batsmen find ways of getting some singles and a two off de Bigman. But Root still has a strike rate of 24 today \u2013 six off 25 balls. England are not out of the woods yet. 14th over: England 51-1 (Bairstow 29, Root 3) Just when you are wondering if England plan on winning this match by Wednesday, Bairstow breaks the spell \u2013 and Henry\u2019s sequence of 17 dots \u2013 with a whip through midwicket. And then he gets away with another Harrow drive, which brings another four, and that\u2019s England\u2019s fifty off 83 balls. Old school. \u201cYour past comes back to haunt you,\u201d says the latest email subject line, darkly. It\u2019s from Richard Rees Jones. \u201cThis World Cup final is all very well, but I still haven\u2019t forgiven you for the scathing review you gave Gary Numan\u2019s \u2018Warriors\u2019 album in Smash Hits in 1983.\u201d I plead guilty. 13th over: England 42-1 (Bairstow 20, Root 3) The scoreboard operator awakes with a jerk as Bairstow tucks for a single and Root follows suit, making room by doing a little dance towards mid-off. The keeper, Latham, could put a stop to that by standing up to de Grandhomme. 12th over: England 39-1 (Bairstow 18, Root 2) England usually go dot-dash. Right now they\u2019re going dot-dot-dot ad infinitum. That\u2019s the third maiden in a row, and the second from Henry, who has the Test-match figures of 6-1-13-1. Root has faced 19 balls and managed two singles. But he\u2019s still there. 11th over: England 39-1 (Bairstow 18, Root 2) Williamson makes his first bowling change, replacing Boult with the medium pace of Colin de Grandhomme \u2013 who bowls a maiden but drops Bairstow. That went straight into his midriff and seemed perfectly catchable. Can Bairstow make NZ pay for it? 10th over: England 39-1 (Bairstow 18, Root 2) Now even Root plays an air shot outside off, as Henry curls another one down the hill. That\u2019s a maiden, so Henry has 5-1-13-1: no big-match nerves for him. The win predictor is giving England 84 per cent; I give them about 44. An email arrives headed \u201c6th over voodoo chickens\u201d, which can only happen to an OBOer. \u201cIn old-school voodoo (voudoun),\u201d says John Starbuck, \u201cthe chickens don\u2019t come home to roost, they get their heads chopped off instead. If you\u2019re making supernatural bargains, you have to get the details right, or it all goes demon-shaped.\u201d 9th over: England 39-1 (Bairstow 18, Root 2) Bairstow isn\u2019t fully himself yet, but he does manage a shovel-pull for four off Boult. \u201cDear Mr d,\u201d says Adam Roberts. \u201cCan we have the Henry who bowled against the Windies back, please?\u201d 8th over: England 34-1 (Bairstow 14, Root 1) Root is already being thoroughly Rootish: a good leave, a nice back-foot push under the eyes, and then, when the scoreboard needs a nudge, a quick-footed dab into the covers to get off the mark. If he can get twice as many as Williamson did, that should do the trick. But when Bairstow takes over, Henry beats him with a textbook outseamer. Here\u2019s Geoff Wignall, emailing before the wicket. \u201cI\u2019d like to dissent,\u201d he says, \u201cfrom the notion that the first ten overs will be necessarily crucial. Obviously, Roy and Bairstow could decide the outcome quite quickly, but might this be a day and a pitch for knocking the ball around and accumulating a nice steady five or six an over? In which case England do have the players for job in Root and the middle order - Stokes, Buttler and Woakes. No worries.\u201d Geoff, I wish I was as cool as you. 7th over: England 33-1 (Bairstow 14, Root 0) Boult continues and Bairstow beats that bespoke legside field for the first time, by playing an on-drive that\u2019s closer to the umpire than he would normally go. Boult now has 0-21 from four overs, when he could easily have 2-10. 6th over: England 28-1 (Bairstow 10, Root 0) So Henry strikes, keeping his nerve after Roy had driven him for four. England badly need Joe Root to get his usual solid start. Rob would like to see Stokes coming in next, and so would I, but I doubt Morgan will demote himself in case it looks too angsty. In other news, I\u2019d been wondering where Brian Withington had got to, and here he is. \u201cNot sure my nerves can withstand much more of this,\u201d he says. \u201cI made a Faustian bargain earlier in the tournament for England to lose a classic nailbiter to NZ in the final as long as we beat India and NZ and then Australia in the semi-finals. Was later praying that Australia would win the group and render said bargain null and void, but I fear voodoo chickens may inevitably be coming home to roost now.\u201d The breakthrough! And it\u2019s the wicket NZ most wanted. Henry runs one down the hill and Roy gets a regulation nick, well held low down by Latham. 5th over: England 240-0 (Roy 13, Bairstow 10) Kane Williamson has a bespoke field for Bairstow, with three men at midwicket, the middle one deeper than the other two. This has stopped two boundaries so far, but now, at last, Bairstow finds his mojo, creaming Boult through the covers. He enjoys it so much, he does it again. \u201cGood morning everyone,\u201d says Adam Roberts, \u201c(still morning here in Cayman). \u2018Who needs Federer and Djokovic?\u2019 [3rd over] I\u2019m trying to juggle the two.\u201d 4th over: England 16-0 (Roy 13, Bairstow 2) More astringency from Henry, and Bairstow\u2019s second run, like his first, comes off the edge \u2013 a more orthodox one, a low squirt to third man. Roy, who is in no mood to be dominated, gives Henry the charge, looking for a six, but only gets a chip for two. No wickets yet, but NZ are on top. 3rd over: England 12-0 (Roy 10, Bairstow 1) Boult puts a small blot on his copybook with a wide, but then tests Bairstow to the limits with his inswing. Going for a cover drive, Bairstow manages only an inside edge to get off the mark in the strealiest way known to man. Roy is then cut in half by an inswinger, before going for a dance and playing a superb cover push for four. This is riveting. Who needs Federer and Djokovic? \u201cGood afternoon Tim.\u201d Good afternoon, Damian Clarke. \u201cAs an inveterate nailbiter at the best of times, I\u2019m watching telly, and typing this wearing my welding gauntlets. They don\u2019t taste very nice.\u201d 2nd over: England 5-0 (Roy 5, Bairstow 0) Matt Henry is on the money too. Roy plays outside his nip-backer, then inside his leg-cutter. After nine balls that have been pretty much unplayable, Roy looks to assert himself by taking a step forward. He middles this one, and the next on the back foot, but both are dots. Finally he gets a half-volley and straight-drives for four. That\u2019s great temperament from Roy, and mostly great bowling from Henry. 1st over: England 1-0 (Roy 1, Bairstow 0) Boult, watching the big screen, does the biggest eye-roll ever seen from someone who\u2019s not a teenager. But he doesn\u2019t lose his cool, or his line, or his length. That\u2019s a fine first over, with the only run coming off a thick outside edge. The duel is on. Umpire\u2019s call! And a nation goes phew. For LBW. Full, swinging yorker \u2013 a great ball, but Erasmus said no. Looks out. Bairstow and Roy have reeled off four century partnerships in a row. They surely can\u2019t do it again. Thanks Rob and afternoon everyone. This game seems beautifully poised. Last time NZ were in a World Cup final, four years ago, they batted first and made only 183 all out, so 241 is a big step forward. Last time England were in one, 27 years ago, they batted second and made 227 all out. So those omens point to an NZ win. But England bowled well and will feel they can do this. So much rests on the first ten overs, the battle between the excellent Roy and Bairstow and the equally excellent Boult and Henry. Stand by for a dual duel. \u201cThe good news, from a Kiwi perspective, is that there are fewer than 11 people in England that truly believe that England can chase 242 on a slowish pitch to win a World Cup final,\u201d says Grant Marjoribanks. \u201cThe bad news is that six of them are in the English top order.\u201d That was a very solid performance in the field from England, with Liam Plunkett extremely good, but New Zealand scrapped admirably to post their usual competitive total. The first ten overs, when Trent Boult and Matt Henry take on Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow, are likely to decide whether New Zealand or England will the World Cup. Since you asked, I think England are favourites - but not by much. Please join Tim de Lisle in 25 minutes for the start of the run chase. Bye! 50th over: New Zealand 241-8 (Santner 5, Boult 1) Archer\u2019s last over is a gem, full of deception, and New Zealand can only grab three runs from it. England need 242 to win the World Cup. Henry is cleaned up by a full toss from Archer, and there are three balls remaining. 49th over: New Zealand 238-7 (Santner 4, Henry 4) Woakes apologises after bowling an accidental beamer at Santner, which means a free hit for New Zealand. Santner can\u2019t take advantage of that, missing a heave at a loopy slower ball, but Henry ends an excellent over for New Zealand - 13 from it - by launching his first ball to cow corner for a one-bouncer four. That\u2019s a brilliant shot. Latham clunks a low full toss straight to the substitute Vince at mid-off. No celebration from Woakes, who is still annoyed that the previous delivery turned past Buttler for four wides. That was an important innings from Latham, who scored 47 from 56 balls. 48th over: New Zealand 225-6 (Latham 47, Santner 2) This feels like a competitive score for New Zealand on a slightly sluggish pitch, though it\u2019s contingent on Trent Boult and Matt Henry taking wickets with the new ball. Those first 10 overs of the England innings could redefine squeaky-bum time. New Zealand are struggling to hit boundaries \u2013 just one since the 39th over \u2013 but they have been good at picking up singles off most deliveries. They take five more from Archer\u2019s ninth over. New Zealand are on course for a New Zealand total. 47th over: New Zealand 220-6 (Latham 44, Santner 0) Vince is on the field because Mark Wood went off with what looks like a side strain. Colin de Grandhomme is put of his misery by Chris Woakes. It was a slower ball that took a leading edge and spooned to the substitute James Vince at mid-off. de Grandhomme, such a dangerous hitter, goes for a miserable 28-ball 16. 46th over: New Zealand 214-5 (Latham 41, de Grandhomme 13) Latham found a bit of form against England at Chester-le-Street, even though the game had long gone, and he has taken that into today. de Grandhomme, meanwhile, is pinned for the umpteenth time by Archer. He is struggling to get bat on ball, never mind middle it, and Archer finishes the over with three consecutive dot balls. de Grandhomme has 13 from 25 balls. He might well be the difference between a target of 225 and 255 - but not in the way we expected. \u201cI haven\u2019t picked up a bat in four years and foolishly agreed to play in a one-off, get-the-band-back-together match in deepest, darkest Kent (at an admittedly very picturesque ground),\u201d says OIiver Smiddy. \u201cSo instead of watching the cricket I\u2019m padded up, waiting to go in and scratch around horribly for a few overs before holing out to cover. Sad.\u201d 45th over: New Zealand 211-5 (Latham 39, de Grandhomme 12) Latham misses a lusty swipe across the line at Wood - but he nails the next ball into the crowd at cow corner. That was a beautiful stroke, an almost nonchalant pick up for six. de Grandhomme then survives a run-out referral after a smart bit of work from Buttler. Wood finishes with 10-1-49-1. This is getting exquisitely tense, although don\u2019t quote on me on the exquisite part. \u201cVery much enjoyed Mr. de Lisle\u2019s terrific, heart-touching piece on attending the 1975 final,\u201d says Mac Millings. \u201cMy first time attending an international cricket match was the \u201883 final. I was 11, and probably still have my scorecard tucked away somewhere. Chief memories: a West Indian fan behind me and my family, yelling, \u2018Vivian Richards! Show \u2018em you are the Master Blaster!\u2019 every couple of minutes, until circumstances - and Madan Lal - dictated that he had to stop; and my mother (no aficionada) asking why both teams were wearing the same colour, and where the commentary was.\u201d 44th over: New Zealand 204-5 (Latham 32, de Grandhomme 12) de Grandhomme has become a bit of a punchbag for the England bowlers. He is hit on the back twice by slower bouncers from Archer, and inbetween he mistimes a cut stroke just short of Stokes in the covers. But there are also three wides in Archer\u2019s over, which takes New Zealand past 200. Although it feels like England have controlled the game since the 20th over, New Zealand are inching towards a really handy score. We\u2019ve said it a few times at this tournament - almost every game - but the first 10 overs of the England innings will probably decide this match. \u201cPermission to profess my manly adoration for Liam Plunkett, Rob?\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cThis is the zenith of a late-blossoming career phase, doing the hard yards so we don\u2019t have to. It seems like he\u2019s been around for ever. He\u2019s easing my nerves by at least 2.9%, down to the mid-nineties.\u201d 43rd over: New Zealand 196-5 (Latham 29, de Grandhomme 12) A bouncer from Wood hits de Grandhomme on the back and flies away for four leg byes. Although de Grandhomme has started scratchily, he\u2019s such a dangerous hitter that England will take nothing for granted. He could be the difference between a target of 225 and 255. \u201cI am spending the afternoon on duty at Cape Cornwall Coastwatch hut, on the edge of the cliff overlooking the Atlantic,\u201d writes Constance Moore. \u201cCan\u2019t listen to TMS because I need to hear calls on the radio from shipping or coastguard, so will be depending on your updates when I have a moment to spare! Most glorious view in the world does make up for it...\u201d 42nd over: New Zealand 186-5 (Latham 27, de Grandhomme 8) de Grandhomme is fine to continue. Five from Archer\u2019s over - four singles and a wide. 41.3 overs: New Zealand 183-5 (Latham 26, de Grandhomme 7) Jofra Archer returns to the attack and hits de Grandhomme on the helmet with a fine bouncer. In fact, de Grandhomme top-edged an attempted hook onto his helmet, from where it looped just past backward point. There will be a break in play while de Grandhomme receives treatment. \u201cI am on a quest to become the first(?) family to appear on OBO during a tournament,\u201d says Anand. \u201cIs it a thing? Perhaps an OBO honours board? My son, Advaith, who has just turned 7 has been introduced to cricket during this tournament. A proud moment as a father happened when he decided that he would rather play yard cricket with me that go out to eat at his favourite restaurant. When he isn\u2019t supporting his favourite team, India, he wants to save his favourite planet.\u201d Hello Advaith! Also, would you like to be our prime minister? 41st over: New Zealand 181-5 (Latham 25, de Grandhomme 6) We\u2019re into the last ten overs. A run a ball would take New Zealand to 239, and they know how to defend that. Plunkett, bowling his final over, slips a fine delivery past de Grandhomme\u2019s outside edge. He ends a superb spell with figures of 10-0-42-3. \u201cHey Rob,\u201d says Ronan. \u201cThere\u2019s a fair few of us in Cologne watching the game in Barney Vallely\u2019s Irish pub in the Old Town. Should be a good atmosphere when we come into bat. You can let David Horn know.\u201d 40th over: New Zealand 179-5 (Latham 24, de Grandhomme 5) \u201cBit closer to home, I\u2019m sat in a pub In Uphall, nr Edinburgh,\u201d says Marc Greenhalgh. \u201cThree screens showing three different sports: golf to the left of me, horse racing and F1 to the right, here I am, stuck in the middle with you. It\u2019s like the World Cup final isn\u2019t even happening.\u201d In philosophical terms, I don\u2019t think it is. 39th over: New Zealand 173-5 (Latham 23, de Grandhomme 0) If you have a problem in the middle overs, if no one else can help, and if you can find him, maybe you can hire Liam Plunkett. That was an Andrex-soft dismissal from Neesham, who had been playing so well. He tried to drive Plunkett over mid-on but clodhopped it straight to Root. It might have been a slower ball, I\u2019m not quite sure. Either way, Plunkett has three wickets. Plunkett has done it again! 38th over: New Zealand 165-4 (Latham 22, Neesham 12) Neesham\u2019s timing must be infectious. Latham has started to find the sweet spot, too, and he push-drives Wood beautifully through extra cover for four. New Zealand are moving doggedly towards a workable score. \u201cMy daughter Daisy has decided enough is enough,\u201d says Dave Childs, \u201cand we are now watching Sooty instead of the most important cricket game in 14 years.\u201d Did you put ideas in her head by saying the New Zealand batsmen should use the sweep against Rashid? 37th over: New Zealand 159-4 (Latham 17, Neesham 11) Liam Plunkett replaces Ben Stokes. It was going to be Archer, but then he or Morgan changed their mind. Plunkett drops short to Latham, who picks him up sweetly towards long leg for a one-bounce for. \u201cHi Rob, this is stupid,\u201d says David Horn, cutting urgently to the chase. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to ditch the family for a day of our vacation and am now wandering around a foreign city that is mostly closed, looking for The Cricket. Any of your readers know Cologne better than me and can help me out?\u201d 36th over: New Zealand 153-4 (Latham 12, Neesham 10) Neesham has timed the ball gloriously since coming to the crease, much better than anyone else today. He pings a drive off Wood that is stopped by Morgan at extra cover and then nails a pull that is superbly stopped by the diving Woakes on the midwicket boundary. That saved three runs, and the run that Neesham did get is the only one from the over. Wood, like Plunkett, has bowled a much better second spell after switching ends. \u201cGary Naylor is right to acknowledge Sky\u2019s investment but why is this topic still being discussed in binary all-or-nothing terms?\u201d writes our own Ali Martin. \u201cMost people surely accept the sport won\u2019t return to terrestrial TV full time ... but that doesn\u2019t mean a better balance can\u2019t still be struck between revenue and reach. Even the ECB now acknowledge the need for this, if the next rights deal is anything to go by (collective revulsion/trepidation about The Hundred notwithstanding).\u201d 35th over: New Zealand 152-4 (Latham 12, Neesham 9) Neesham gets off the mark with a superb shot, flicking Stokes wristily through midwicket for four. Even the deranged boundary-riding beast Bairstow couldn\u2019t stop it. That\u2019s the first boundary since the 20th over - and he pulls another through mid-on two balls later. That\u2019s excellent, testicular batting from one of the more impressive characters at this World Cup. Thanks for all your emails, which I\u2019m trying to read between balls/overs/pangs of the purest fear. \u201cHello Rob!\u201d says Georgina Stickels. \u201cThis Aussie is joining you from southern Senegal. They\u2019re all football mad here (and Senegal is playing in the Afcon final later, so no wonder!) so no telly for me. SO pleased you chaps are online. Am gunning for NZ obviously: hoping they can regroup. Kia kaha, Aotearoa!\u201d 34th over: New Zealand 141-4 (Latham 11, Neesham 0) Taylor and New Zealand were hard done by: replays show the ball from Wood was just bouncing over the stumps. THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULDN\u2019T PLAY SILLY BUGGERS WITH YOUR TEAM\u2019S REVIEW, PART 4369123423523425310. Wood, meanwhile, completes a wicket maiden by zipping one past Jimmy Neesham\u2019s outside edge. \u201cIndifference to the World Cup?\u201d sniffs Alasdair Brooks. \u201cForget Berlin; forget the mountains of northern Vietnam. Try an archaeology museum on the outskirts of Cairo; the indifference here is so total that my lovely Egyptian colleagues are indifferent to the possibility that there might be something towards which they might target their indifference.\u201d That looked slightly high, but Marais Erasmus gave it out. Taylor pushed around a sharp delivery from Wood that came back to hit him on the pad. The line was fine; we haven\u2019t seen a replay that shows whether it was bouncing over the stumps. I suspect it was, just. Mark Wood strikes with the first ball of a new spell - and New Zealand can\u2019t review it! 33rd over: New Zealand 141-3 (Taylor 15, Latham 11) An outside edge from Latham flies safely to third man for a single. Both sides are jockeying for position ahead of the death overs, and despite losing Williamson I think New Zealand will be happy enough with their position. 32nd over: New Zealand 134-3 (Taylor 13, Latham 9) More low-risk milking of Rashid; four from the over. New Zealand have played Rashid pretty well, because although he has only conceded one boundary, he is still going at five an over. \u201cCrossing the Strait of Gibraltar,\u201d says Emiel de Bont. \u201cA friend whom I have been trying to take an interest in cricket, texts me to ask if Test matches are like qualifiers for the World Cup. Where to begin...\u201d With an early Christmas gift? 31st over: New Zealand 130-3 (Taylor 11, Latham 7) Stokes replaces Plunkett, who has three overs up his sleeve. Latham is beaten, trying to cut a ball that trampolines from a length. New Zealand haven\u2019t hit a boundary since the 20th over, although they do manage four singles off Stokes. Time for drinks. \u201cRob,\u201d says Mac Millings. \u201cI have The Fear, Rob, expressed here in my all-time Fear XI: Andrew Stress Sunil Gavaskarred For Life Dennis Something\u2019s Definitely Amiss Sir Garfield Can\u2019t Watch This Sobers Rohan Kanhai Use the Facilities, Because I\u2019m Peeing My Rishabh Pants Bert Fearmonger Terror Alderman Nerves Hughes Tino Distressed Is it Cowardly to Pray for Ray Illingworth? \u201cOBO by Timorous de Lisle\u201d 30th over: New Zealand 126-3 (Taylor 9, Latham 5) A lucky escape for Taylor. He charged Rashid, got nowhere near the pitch but managed to get a bottom-edge that bounced over the keeper Buttler. Had it not done so, Buttler would have had a simple stumping chance. \u201cAfternoon Rob!\u201d says Rob Wolf Petersen. \u201cI hope you\u2019re in fine fettle. This is only going to go one way, isn\u2019t it? New Zealand 261-7, England 113 all out. During the presentation, Williamson will explain that the team\u2019s analyses deduced that a score in the region of 260 wins 70 percent of matches. Then he\u2019ll pull off his rubber face mask to reveal the cackling, maniacal visage of Peter Moores.\u201d 29th over: New Zealand 123-3 (Taylor 8, Latham 3) Latham almost joins Nicholls in dragging Latham back onto the stumps. Thankfully for him it hit the pad and landed safely. But it\u2019s another good over from Plunkett, with just a single from the last ball. Since he switched to the Nursery End, Plunkett has figures of 4-0-7-2. Pick those out! \u201cThe emailers you have lauding the return of live cricket to free-to-air channels understand that those same channels do not want live cricket, will not invest the time and money to present the game properly in all formats around the world and are shamelessly cherry picking one of the few matches they do want today?\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cAnyone who grew up in the 70s and 80s should thank Sky for what they do for the cricket fan. And as for kids being inspired by blanket free-to-air coverage, how\u2019s that working out with the tennis these last few decades?\u201d 28th over: New Zealand 122-3 (Taylor 8, Latham 2) Four singles from Rashid\u2019s sixth over. It\u2019s so hard to know what a good score is, because the pressure of a World Cup final runchase could scramble the Win Predictor, never mind the brains of the batsmen. I suspect New Zealand would be very happy with anything above 250. \u201cAfternoon Rob, afternoon everybody,\u201d says John Withington. \u201cI\u2019m wondering if anybody out there has the data to confirm my suspicion that reviewing every decisions by umpire Dharmasena is statistically as sound a strategy as any other.\u201d He has looked out of form at this tournament, hasn\u2019t he? Mind you, the performances of Marais Erasmus suggest that, for some umpires, form is permanent. 27th over: New Zealand 118-3 (Taylor 6, Latham 0) Nicholls played an excellent innings and will feel a bit unfortunate, as that ball could easily have gone away for four. \u201cYou think no-one cares in Berlin?\u201d sniffs Kevin Rodgers. \u201cI\u2019m in the mountains of northern Vietnam getting OBO with a dodgiest Wi-fi imaginable. Surrounding indifference is total; regardless, nails are being destroyed.\u201d Liam Plunkett has done it again! Nicholls tried to drive a fullish delivery that straightened just enough to take the inside edge and fly back onto the stumps. Plunkett\u2019s second spell - two for six from 2.5 overs - has dragged England right back into the game. Arise Sir Liam. 26th over: New Zealand 114-2 (Nicholls 52, Taylor 5) Nicholls drives Rashid down the ground for a single to reach a fine, purposeful half-century from 71 balls. Both batsmen are using their feet against Rashid, although at this stage they are only looking to drive him down the ground for a single. 25th over: New Zealand 109-2 (Nicholls 49, Taylor 3) Taylor will take a few overs to get his eye in, knowing he can make up for lost time later in the innings. His one attacking stroke in that Plunkett over is a play-and-miss at a wide slower ball. Taylor is New Zealand\u2019s second best batsman, with daylight either side, so England would love to pick him up early on. Plunkett is into his work now; his figures in this spell at 2-0-2-1. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says James Lane, \u201cor evening here in Australia. I wasn\u2019t planning on watching this, but is it sneakily turning into the kind of game that, at 1am, you groan as you realise you just have to watch to the bitter end? Plus, if England go down, your patented brand of sadomasochism is exactly what\u2019s required.\u201d That\u2019s the nicest thing anyone\u2019s ever said about me. 24th over: New Zealand 108-2 (Nicholls 48, Taylor 3) Nicholls edges Rashid\u2019s googly for a single. It was a safe shot, with no slip in place. Rashid (4-0-23-0) doesn\u2019t look at his best, although I said that at the same stage of the semi-final, and then he took three lovely wickets. \u201cIt\u2019s been a wild ride, sir,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cWe seek catharsis; we shall find it today. We seek a new name on the trophy; we shall find it today. We seek redemption; we shall find it today. Hearts have been broken and fairytales have come true along the way. A million emotions have been felt throughout this journey, but now that we\u2019re at the end there\u2019s nothing much left to say. Whoever wins the final will deserve to. And that, Mr Smyth, should be our greatest joy.\u201d What did you have for breakfast? Professional curiosity. 23rd over: New Zealand 103-2 (Nicholls 46, Taylor 0) In this tournament, Liam Plunkett has dismissed, among others, Virat Kohli, Kane Williamson, Chris Gayle, Quinton de Kock and Old Father Time. \u201cGood morning Rob,\u201d says Shannon Campbell. \u201cI\u2019m here in Berlin following the final and this German metropolis oozes indifference at my nervous excitement. Friends want to go for walks, in forests! Have they no idea?! No they don\u2019t. Do they understand? No they don\u2019t! Would they willingly smash up their BMW for a ticket to a German World Cup football qualifier against Niue, yes they would! The OBO is a refuge in this hedonistic land, an oasis of sanity where hopefully the Black Caps can prevail and we can, in future, get more than a two-Test series every 12 years against one of the big three.\u201d I\u2019m surprised there isn\u2019t \u2013 at the very least \u2013 an ironic love of cricket. Berlin is losing its edge. With England in increasingly urgent need of a wicket, Morgan turned to his trusty middle-overs winkler. And he picked up the big wicket with his fourth ball. Williamson drove outside off stump at a cross-seam delivery and got the thinnest edge through to Buttler. Kumar Dharmasena gave it not out but England reviewed instantly, and Ultra-Edge backed them up. Kane Williamson is out! Liam Plunkett. Liam bloody Plunkett has done it again! England are certain this is out. 22nd over: New Zealand 101-1 (Nicholls 45, Williamson 30) Nicholls is looking to join the list of unlikely World Cup final matchwinners, which includes Collis King, Gautam Gambhir, Mike Veletta, Madan Lal and Steve Bucknor. He steals a single off Rashid to bring up the hundred, one of four from the over. This has been such a calm, mature partnership. England need to make something happen, which is usually a job for Ben Stokes. 21st over: New Zealand 97-1 (Nicholls 43, Williamson 28) Williamson drives Wood sweetly through extra cover, and Bairstow charges round the boundary as if world peace depends on him saving a solitary run. That\u2019s precisely what he does with a typically zealous sprawl. New Zealand are controlling the game at the moment; the last eight overs have yielded 51 runs. Thanks Tim, hello everyone. You thought it was going to be easy, didn\u2019t you? Where have you been these last four decades? If England are going to win the World Cup, they will have to come from behind in the match for the first time at this tournament. New Zealand have moved stealthily into a good position, while England\u2019s bowlers, Chris Woakes excepted, have been slightly flat. They need a wicket pretty soon, ideally Williamson. 20th over: New Zealand 91-1 (Nicholls 40, Williamson 24) This is getting ominous for England supporters. Williamson lofts the first ball of Rashid\u2019s second over for four, picking his spot beautifully, and then sweeps for the first time to pick up two more. That\u2019s it from me for the moment: over to the ever-excellent Rob Smyth. 19th over: New Zealand 84-1 (Nicholls 40, Williamson 17) After going for a cheap four as Nicholls glides to wide third man, Wood finds a good riposte with a bouncer that is fended uncertainly and a length ball that beats the outside edge. Wood is a much improved bowler. But NZ are still on top. 18th over: New Zealand 77-1 (Nicholls 35, Williamson 15) Here is Adil Rashid, who bowled so well against Australia. Nicholls is looking to sweep him, Williamson to drive \u2013 first on the ground to long-off, where Joe Root saves a second, then in the air over midwicket. Impressive intent from both batsmen. A worrying tweet from Lord\u2019s. \u201cThe atmosphere is a disaster,\u201d says Richard Vale, \u201centirely because of the way tickets were allocated. Is anyone in the press going to comment on that?\u201d Good observation, but it seems a little early to sniff a conspiracy of silence. 17th over: New Zealand 70-1 (Nicholls 33, Williamson 10) A better over from Wood, but Williamson dabs a single into the leg side to reach double figures off 32 balls. \u201cHello from wet West London,\u201d says Anna Durrance-Bagale. \u201cI was trying to explain the rules of cricket to my husband - he just kept asking \u2018 yes but who\u2019s winning?\u2019 (on a par with \u2018why are they wearing pyjamas?\u2019). Big sigh - I give up.\u201d Love it. 16th over: New Zealand 68-1 (Nicholls 32, Williamson 9) Plunkett goes for another four, first ball, as Nicholls pulls one of those bang-it-in balls of his. More significantly, Stokes hurts himself trying to make a diving save on the square-leg boundary. Is that a strained calf or a touch of cramp? Plunkett shapes up for the rest of the over, but he has 3-0-19-0 and it\u2019s surely time for Rashid or Stokes, assuming the calf\u2019s OK. 15th over: New Zealand 63-1 (Nicholls 27, Williamson 9) Woakes finally takes his sweater, with the very Woakesian figures of 7-0-19-1. Mark Wood comes on and promptly beats Williamson outside off with his extra pace, but the over is patchy \u2013 there\u2019s a wide, a juicy full toss which Williamson can only push back to the bowler, and a bouncer that\u2019s too easy to glove away for four. That\u2019s drinks, and although England started strongly, NZ are now in the driving seat. 14th over: New Zealand 55-1 (Nicholls 27, Williamson 4) A few singles off Plunkett, and then a four as Nicholls easily finds the gap with his tuck behind square. It\u2019s great to have Plunkett here, this man whose first World Cup was in 2007 and who hasn\u2019t been on the losing side yet in the World Cup of 2019, but I\u2019m baffled as to why Morgan has him on now, when the ball is still moving for the pitch-it-up merchants. 13th over: New Zealand 47-1 (Nicholls 21, Williamson 2) Morgan decides to give a seventh over to Woakes, who has a shout for LBW against Williamson \u2013 too high, but a fine delivery, jagging back up the hill. Williamson has two runs from 21 balls, but that won\u2019t worry him, nor should it. The man who batted No.3 in the first innings of the first World Cup final at Lord\u2019s, Rohan Kanhai of West Indies, was scoreless for 11 overs, and still finished on the winning side. An email from Mike Sansom. \u201cBombing along the road from General Santos to Cotabato in Mindanao Philippines,\u201d says Mike Sansom, \u201calthough that is probably the wrong verb given recent conflicts and this is New People\u2019s Army Country. Talking of New People\u2019s Army, go Black Caps and Aotearoa.\u201d 12th over: New Zealand 46-1 (Nicholls 21, Williamson 2) A bowling change at last, and just when you\u2019re expecting Mark Wood or Ben Stokes \u2013 or even Adil Rashid, as Williamson is mortal against leg spin \u2013 on comes Liam Plunkett. Is Morgan a little too keen to get funky? Or feeling suddenly wary? No slips, and Nicholls visibly relaxes, taking three twos. 11th over: New Zealand 40-1 (Nicholls 15, Williamson 2) Three unusual things in this over: Woakes bowls a wide to Williamson, and a long hop to Nicholls, who cuts for four. And Williamson shows signs of impatience, cutting one that\u2019s too close, and getting away with a single through the vacant third slip. Even after a poor over by his standards, Woakes has figures of 6-0-18-1. In the first Powerplay, there were 44 dots. \u201cWatching the game live on TV,\u201d says Matt Sowrey, \u201cbut it would be wrong to desert the always free-to-air OBO that has given me so much pleasure (and heartache) over the years.\u201d Pleasure and heartache, that\u2019s our secret sauce. 10th over: New Zealand 33-1 (Nicholls 10, Williamson 1) Williamson is off the mark! With a dab to silly mid-on off Archer. And the Powerplay ends, with the power nicely balanced: England have bowled well and removed a man who can score 200 on his day, but NZ will be happy to have laid a foundation. \u201cI suspect if Williamson gets out to Archer now,\u201d says Emma John on Twitter, \u201cthis is going to be a terrible game. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m actually rooting for him to stay in right now. What is happening to me?\u201d 9th over: New Zealand 31-1 (Nicholls 10, Williamson 0) Now that Guptill has gone, Nicholls is getting twitchy. He plays and misses with a carve at a wideish one from Woakes, then takes a run that\u2019s too tight and would be out if Roy had hit from mid-off. Only ten runs off the past five overs: this is every bit as absorbing as a World Cup final should be. 8th over: New Zealand 30-1 (Nicholls 9, Williamson 0) Williamson plays and misses! At Archer, who isn\u2019t going to let a mere slope stop him seaming it away towards those slips. \u201cMorning Tim!\u201d Morning Ryan Dunne. \u201cMan, Sunday mornings on Channel 4 haven\u2019t been this exciting since the days when Dawson\u2019s Creek was on.\u201d 7th over: New Zealand 29-1 (Nicholls 7, Williamson 0) So Morgan attacks his opposite number, and leaves a great big gap on the leg side, but Williamson isn\u2019t tempted. He leaves his first ball, calm as ever; leaves the second too; defends the third, with those soft hands of his; and decides at the last second to leave the last. We have a contest. Three slips for Kane Williamson. This is a big moment. \u201cIs it cowardly to pray for rain?\u201d asks Tony Batt, in an email from before the wicket fell. \u201cHi Tim, c\u2019mon England. I\u2019m combining a work-life balance that lets me stay in the studio all-day today mostly to avoid chores and gain brownie points. i may even open the presentation i\u2019m supposed to be working on if this partnership goes on any longer.\u201d Got him! Just deserts for Woakes, a shame for Guptill who was blasting his way back to form, and a double blow for NZ, who lose their review. Woakes again. This one looks out... 6th over: New Zealand 28-0 (Guptill 19, Nicholls 7) Nasser Hussain has spotted that there are two different kinds of opening going on here. Guptill is having a go; Nicholls (7 off 19) is looking to see off the new ball and cash in later. Modernism meets tradition. 5th over: New Zealand 24-0 (Guptill 18, Nicholls 4) After that big over for the batsmen, Woakes restores order by conceding only two singles. A force by Nicholls is smartly stopped by Stokes, who has replaced Jason Roy at backward point. The cameras are spotting famous faces in the crowd. Theresa May, with her husband Philip. Mike Gatting, with Mike Brearley behind him. Both Mikes captained England in a World Cup final. Gatt got out to a reverse sweep in 1987; Brears made a fifty but used up an awful lot of overs in 1979. Can another Middlesex batsman, Eoin Morgan, do any better? 4th over: New Zealand 22-0 (Guptill 17, Nicholls 3) Guptill has decided that if you\u2019re in a bad trot, you might as well whack it. He upper-cuts Archer, flirting with disaster as Rashid lurks at third man, but getting a six. And then he comes down the track again and hits a drop-kick for four. Nothing wrong with his temperament. 3rd over: New Zealand 10-0 (Guptill 6, Nicholls 2) Nicholls does two things right, calling for that review and then getting off the mark with a regulation nudge. But the ball is moving around for both the bowlers. Good toss to lose. \u201cWatching, listening, reading,\u201d says Peter Gibbs in Selsey, \u201cbut not necessarily in that order. Mum\u2019s one pleasure is cricket, so we have to pay for it anyway but this is how I do things normally. I for one will not desert you Tim./fellow OBOers.\u201d That\u2019s the spirit. All the best to your mum. It was a great ball, except that it was going over middle and off. What a good review. To Woakes. Straight enough, back pad, maybe a touch high? 2nd over: New Zealand 8-0 (Guptill 6, Nicholls 0) Jofra Archer thinks he\u2019s got Guptill! Caught behind. It looks out for all the world, but Marais Erasmus says no, and he\u2019s spot on \u2013 the ball, a gorgeous lifter going up the slope, took the outside edge of the trousers. \u201cMy first OBO email,\u201d says Matthew Kentridge, \u201cmoved by your great (and poignant) piece in the Observer about going to the 1975 WC final. I went to the final in 1983. I was 19, a student in Johannesburg. Landed at Heathrow early on Saturday 25 June and went straight to Lord\u2019s with my dad. It was only my second time at Lord\u2019s - the first was on a freezing wet day in April a few years before, where I was one of about six people in the ground watching Middlesex eke out what felt like 100 runs in a full day\u2019s play. This couldn\u2019t have been more different: a hot day, ground absolutely packed, and the best team in the world about to win a third successive world cup. For a South African who had never before seen international cricket, it was absolutely sensational to be there, to see these impossible heroes, whom I\u2019d only ever read about, in the flesh. I was as stunned as everyone else when Kapil Dev pulled off a miracle and propelled India to the title - I had thought West Indies absolutely invincible - a lesson in the fact that the best can lose. Since SA\u2019s ignominious departure from this tournament, I\u2019m backing England to win the damn cup already. Let\u2019s hope Kane Williamson doesn\u2019t do a Kapil Dev today.\u201d Little-known fact about Matthew Kentridge: he\u2019s my next-door neighbour. 1st over: New Zealand 5-0 (Guptill 4, Nicholls 0) Woakes finds his line after that one aberration. Guptill, an explosive player who has been a damp squib lately, tries going down the track, but mistimes his shot and gets no run. Next ball, staying in his crease, he fends uppishly and gets four to Ben Stokes\u2019s left. \u201cIs this the little bit of luck you need?\u201d asks Brendon McCullum. There\u2019s some swing for Woakes. He has a wonderful record at Lord\u2019s, but bowled too short here against Australia the other day. With a wide, from Chris Woakes, of all people \u2013 Mr Immaculate. Martin Guptill throws the kitchen sink at it and misses. \u201cEngland fan joining from Norway,\u201d says Brendan Large. \u201cAbsolutely bricking it...we finally have the best team and that makes me more nervous about the outcome! Have to say that if we do have to lose the NZ team seem a nice bunch of chaps who deserve a bit more credit than they seem to get. \u201cWatching from local fire station in Tasmania,\u201d says George Shufflebottom. \u201cWeather as English as it gets, pouring with rain. Ironically, struggling to light a fire.\u201d The anthems are under way, NZ going first. The cameras find plenty of black shirts in the crowd, which is good to see. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying in cricket,\u201d says Rob Eastaway, author of What Is a Googly?, on Twitter. \u201c\u2018That was a good toss to lose.\u2019 A nice bit of game theory. I reckon Eoin Morgan will be happy not to have had to make a decision in these cloudy conditions.\u201d Agreed. If there\u2019s one thing we know about OBO readers, it\u2019s that you\u2019re a cosmpolitan bunch. \u201cKiwis (actually Scottish) tuning in,\u201d says Jane MacDonald, \u201cbut from Croatia not Wellington.\u201d I\u2019m baffled already, but I like it. \u201cWill be OBOing it all day as we would if we were at home. A bit torn between supporting a very entertaining exciting England or the Kiwi boys \u2013 just hoping for an exciting match. Keep up the good OBO work (Marina Hyde declined obviously) and loving The Spin pod.\u201d Quite agree \u2013 I was a guest on Thursday evening and saw for myself how good Emma John and her producer Geoff Jein are at it. They\u2019ve done something in weeks which often takes years, and established a distinctive tone of voice, all sharp-witted levity. Also, I got to witness the most Guardian thing ever. Emma and her guests sit round a table with some tiny plastic cricketers playing on a green baize pitch. The set, dug out of Geoff Jein\u2019s attic, was missing a ball, so Emma made one, using a dried chickpea and some red nail varnish. NZ readers in the house! \u201cTuning in from Wellington,\u201d says Tom Middlemiss. \u201cIt may be a Sunday night but work tomorrow be damned! Now I\u2019ll have to stay up way past midnight to see the first 6 Kiwi wickets - then set alarm for 0300 to hear Roy/Bairstow smash the total in the first 25 overs. We\u2019ll see but excited all the same!!!!\u201d So it\u2019s not just England fans who are prone to reflex pessimism. \u201cGrant here,\u201d says Grant Marjoribanks, \u201ccurrently flying from Doha to Sydney, the only time I\u2019ve ever been grateful for inflight wifi. Loved your piece on the first World Cup final, so poignant.\u201d Ah, thanks. \u201cI know today means a lot to you and I respect that, but to be honest I want NZ to win so badly it hurts.\u201d Sports fans, eh. We\u2019re all mad. Both teams are unchanged, as Jonny Bairstow, who tweaked a groin muscle in the semi-final, has been passed fit. Spare a thought for Moeen Ali, an integral part of this England team for the past four years, now squeezed out by the rapid rise of Archer and the enduring efficiency of Plunkett. England 1 Jason Roy, 2 Jonny Bairstow, 3 Joe Root, 4 Eoin Morgan (capt), 5 Ben Stokes, 6 Jos Buttler (wkt), 7 Chris Woakes, 8 Liam Plunkett, 9 Adil Rashid, 10 Jofra Archer, 11 Mark Wood. New Zealand 1 Martin Guptill, 2 Henry Nicholls, 3 Kane Williamson (capt), 4 Ross Taylor, 5 Tom Latham (wkt), 6 Colin de Grandhomme, 7 Jimmy Neesham, 8 Lockie Ferguson, 9 Mitchell Santner, 10 Matt Henry, 11 Trent Boult. And they will bat, Kane Wiliamson says. Recent history is on their side, but the weather may well help the bowlers early on. \u201cJoining you from Australia,\u201d says Dr Tim. \u201cSupporting England. Don\u2019t fret about the drop in traffic for the OBO. I\u2019ve had Channel 9 on the telly, TMS special on the phone, via the ABC Listen app and the OBO. Aren\u2019t we lucky in Oz, having all this UK content freely available!\u201d It must be early evening there \u2013 are you staying up for the whole game? And I wonder if we have anyone tuning in from New Zealand, where it\u2019s already 9.10pm. \u201cI\u2019ll not desert Guardian OBO,\u201d says Andrew Harrison, \u201cjust because there\u2019s (miraculously) a live stream available here in Japan. Hoping neither Boult nor Henry will do a Gary Gilmour on us. Pitch looks a bit green.\u201d Yes, let\u2019s hope neither side starts with a collapse. While we wait for this delayed toss \u2013 the drama! \u2013 let\u2019s have some emails and tweets. \u201cI\u2019ve been considering,\u201d says Tom van der Gucht, \u201cwhether I ought to watch the cricket on Channel 4 rather than on Sky. Partially to relive the glory years of the 2005 Ashes in the hope that, somehow, where I watch it empowers the team due to the quantum interconnectivity of everything, or something... But also, if it gets mega viewing figures it might hasten a return for more cricket on terrestrial TV, apart from the bloody Hundred.\u201d And here\u2019s Kim Thonger. \u201cI have a hypothetical question. If, say, one of the two captains noticed a butterfly\u2019s wing had come very close to the coin in mid-air, and had perhaps touched it very faintly and altered its flight, and perhaps the outcome, could he ask for a review?\u201d And here\u2019s Gary Naylor. \u201cI expect England to win.\u201d What? Are you mad, Gary? Not for thinking it, but for saying it. \u201cFor once, they have copied what other successful nations do in all sports and turned up for the final with the better players. No guarantees of course, but it does make a change.\u201d Yes, England do have more firepower with the bat. But this NZ attack can win matches, especially under thick cloud. More breaking news: the toss has been delayed by a quarter of an hour (to 10.15am), and so has the start (to 10.45). There was a sharp downpour this morning, and the groundstaff need a bit more time to dry the coin. Only in England. If you\u2019re on Instagram, there\u2019s a memorable post by Brendon McCullum. He\u2019s put the photo of the two captains up \u2013 the one currently sitting at the top of this page, with Kane Williamson looking suddenly camp. And he\u2019s captioned it: \u201cTwo very fine gentlemen. Much love for them both.\u201d This is, in a small way, a lovely piece of writing. The first sentence expresses cricket\u2019s traditional values, and could have been written at any time in the past century. The second could only have been written in the past decade or so, as men have belatedly got a bit better at showing their feelings. The two sentences together are strikingly even-handed, which reflects the fact that McCullum\u2019s influence lies behind both captains. He was Williamson\u2019s predecessor and mentor \u2013 though Williamson is his own man, with his own style, less gung-ho and more pragmatic. And he has also been Eoin Morgan\u2019s inspiration. Morgan\u2019s England, with their buccaneering irreverence, are more like McCullum\u2019s New Zealand than Williamson\u2019s New Zealand are. McCullum is the daddy \u2013 of both sides. And the prize for the first email of the day \u2013 or the first not sent by Rob \u2013 goes to Simon McMahon. \u201cMorning Tim.\u201d Morning Simon. \u201cA strange feeling of calm has descended over me this morning, at least compared to last Thursday before the semi-final. I don\u2019t know whether this is a good or a bad thing. Probably bad. Anyway, whatever happens today I think both teams can be proud of their World Cup campaigns, and let\u2019s hope cricket is the winner. Yeah, right. COME ON ENGLAND!!! BRING IT HOME, BOYS!!!\u201d It\u2019s the eternal struggle, isn\u2019t it: between the kid in us and the grown-up, the desperate fan and the rueful spectator. At the risk of being too me-me-me, I\u2019ve touched on this today in a piece for The Observer about going to the first World Cup final as a boy. In the UK, the final will be shown not just on Sky Sports, as ever, but on Channel 4, as cricket returns to terrestrial television (albeit for one day only) for the first time since the famous summer of 2005. This is great news for the English game, which is in grave danger of becoming a middle-class ghetto. But it\u2019s bloody awful news for the amalgamated union of live bloggers. There\u2019s every chance that our UK traffic will plummet. So if you\u2019re reading now, or planning to have two screens on in the modern manner, do send us an email saying where you are and what you think. Rob Smyth will be along later, but is he putting his feet up in the meantime? He is not. \u201cThe last five ODIs at Lord\u2019s, including four games in this tournament, have been won by the team batting first,\u201d he writes. Do you sense a but coming? \u201cBut in the game before that run started, England were 20 for six v South Africa.\u201d Morning everyone. So, today\u2019s the big day. It\u2019s the men\u2019s singles final at Wimbledon. It\u2019s the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. It\u2019s even, as I discovered driving home last night, the Dog Show in Rockingham. But then all those things happen every year. In St John\u2019s Wood, London, just round the corner from the Beatles\u2019 zebra crossing, something is happening that hasn\u2019t happened for 27 years. ENGLAND ARE IN THE CRICKET WORLD CUP FINAL. It was in 1992, in Melbourne, that England last appeared in this fixture. They bowled well enough against Imran Khan\u2019s Pakistan, and had the game under control, until Wasim Akram destroyed them with two balls of the greatest reverse swing you will ever goggle at in disbelief. To find England in a World Cup final in England, you have to wind the videotape of life back even further, to 1979. Yes, it\u2019s 40 years since these hosts last made it to their own party. To remember that day, you have to be middle-aged now; to have reported it, you have to be a pensioner. Breaking news: there is another team in this match, and they come trailing no such melancholy stats. New Zealand have reached their second successive World Cup final. But they do have their own version of 30 years of hurt, because they\u2019ve been eternal bridesmaids. They have made it to Lord\u2019s today by an unlikely route, starting sturdily, then losing three games in a row, including one against England. But they are over-achievers, they\u2019re under less pressure than England, they have a strong attack, and the weather \u2013 wet this morning, due to be grey all day \u2013 could hardly be making them feel more at home. The British bookies have England as favourites; if anything, I\u2019d have them as slight outsiders. Play starts at 10.30am, British \u201csummer\u201d time. Pre-preamble Tim will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s Barney Ronay\u2019s match preview.",

It\u2019s unreal to be two match points down and come back. It\u2019s a bit strange to play a tie-break at 12-all as well. I was hoping to get to the tie-breaks as well.

The other one goes begging too: Federer comes to the net, Djokovic comes up with a forehand pass for deuce. Djokovic will not lie down. He bangs a forehand down the line and Federer nets a weak forehand. Break point. And Federer, who had TWO CHAMPIONSHIP POINTS, nets a forehand. He\u2019ll be having flashbacks to the US Open semi-final of 2011 here.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26b5f42f7243bb2a5968e415a4210197eee45a2f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26b5f42f7243bb2a5968e415a4210197eee45a2f/0_0_5375_3583/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Novak Djokovic plays a forehand.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Novak Djokovic plays a forehand.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthias Hangst/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-14T18:09:27.764Z\">at 7.09pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d2b62e78f08cf92bb76fc1e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-14T17:18:47.436Z\">6.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Fifth set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 7-8 Federer (*denotes server):</strong> Two forehand errors from Federer make it 30-0.

When she woke up today, surely she needed some convincing to believe all of this hadn\u2019t been a dream.\u201d<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d2b1fbd8f0845f89e30cdfb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-14T12:27:44.935Z\">1.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a3577b4a-9b10-41a1-8729-2c89ae3f24eb\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CAnXh79m8G8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d2b1e888f08cf92bb76f99f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-14T12:23:37.775Z\">1.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Here\u2019s what Roger Federer thinks about taking on Novak Djokovic.</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s the same like going into a Rafa match.

Especially you know where the players go when it really matters, how much can you still surprise somebody. At the end of the day it comes very much down to who\u2019s better on the day, who\u2019s in a better mental place, who\u2019s got more energy left, who\u2019s tougher when it really comes to the crunch. In the tennis, there\u2019s always somebody who\u2019s going to be a little bit better because there\u2019s no draws in our sport. It\u2019s always quite brutal sometimes. Don\u2019t want to say always the better player wins, but sometimes it can be tough. Look, I\u2019m excited about the game against Novak. Like you said, we\u2019ve played each other so, so much. I don\u2019t mind that, I think it\u2019s more of a clear game plan.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d2b1db38f08d0b6ca5305a7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-14T12:19:11.778Z\">1.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Pre-match reading</strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/13/roger-federer-novak-djokovic-duel-wimbledon-final\">A duel with no secrets but does Roger Federer have greater shock potential? | Kevin Mitchell</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d2921008f08cf92bb76efd0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-13T00:08:48.419Z\">1.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Quote of the tournament: \u201cIf. If. If. Doesn\u2019t exist\u201d \u2013 Rafael Nadal, 4 July 2019. </strong>The Spaniard had just been asked whether Nick Kyrgios is capable of winning a grand slam <em>if</em> he focuses on tennis and his answer offered a telling insight into the mindset of a champion. Put simply, Nadal doesn\u2019t deal in what ifs and maybes. He deals in cold, hard facts and was in no mood to indulge all the ifs surrounding Kyrgios. If. If. If. Doesn\u2019t exist. The contempt flies off the screen, doesn\u2019t it?</p> \n  <p>And this is the truth before today\u2019s men\u2019s singles final at Wimbledon. Ultimately we know that the last point is all that matters \u2013 but we all have ideas about the journey Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic will take to get there. So if Federer hits his spots with his serves - like he did against Nadal - he could well win his ninth Wimbledon title. If he goes for the lines in the rallies, he\u2019ll be in with a chance of beating the world No1. If his backhand doesn\u2019t break down, he could overcome the Serbian cyborg for the first time at a grand slam since their 2012 Wimbledon semi-final. And if he holds his nerve in the big moments, this year\u2019s Wimbledon champion could be a father of four who turns 38 next month.</p> \n  <p>If. If. If. The challenge, however, is putting theory into practice and we have been here before with Federer and Djokovic. I seem to recall the conversation was similar before their final here in 2015. Federer had served magnificently in his semi-final win over Andy Murray, one of the best returners around, but he found it difficult to replicate that level against Djokovic, who was just so good at making his side of the court look smaller, closing the space, forcing errors and taking control with the brilliance and efficiency of his groundstrokes. It all fell rather flat in the end and it seemed Federer simply couldn\u2019t do Djokovic over five sets. It was too much to ask against such a supreme athlete. Djokovic would dominate. He won their 2014 and 2015 Wimbledon finals. He won their 2015 US Open final. He won their 2016 Australian Open semi-final. Each time Federer finished looking as steady on his feet as Woody Harrelson in the Royal Box.</p> \n  <p>But that was the era of Imperial Novak. The vibe is slightly different now. Federer has been a different player since returning from injury at the start of 2017. The Swiss has gained the edge in his rivalry with Nadal in the last two years, something that seemed unthinkable not so long ago, and now he gets a crack at Djokovic. You just know he\u2019ll be feeling confident before play begins.</p> \n  <p>All the same it\u2019s still Djokovic who sits at the top of the rankings. Sure, he had a duff period after completing the career slam at the French Open three years ago, but the 32-year-old has been the best player in the world since his restorative win at Wimbledon last year and he starts as a slight favourite here. He hasn\u2019t been at his peak over the past fortnight, but he hasn\u2019t really been pushed and there\u2019s always a sense he can up his level in the biggest matches. He\u2019ll be dying to disappoint all the Fed Fans on Centre Court.</p> \n  <p>If \u2013 if, if, if \u2013 Djokovic does then he moves up to 16 grand slam titles, two behind Nadal. If Federer wins he moves up to 21 grand slam titles, three clear of Nadal. As ever history is on the line.</p> \n  <p><strong>Play begins at: </strong>2pm BST.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-14T10:35:33.206Z\">at 11.35am BST</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "Wimbledon 2019 is over. Simona Halep is the women\u2019s singles champion. Novak Djokovic is the men\u2019s singles champion. Roger Federer is Roger Federer. And Andy Murray and Serena Williams played some mixed doubles! It\u2019s been good fun. Thanks for reading and emailing over the past fortnight. Next stop: Flushing Meadows. Bye! Three tie-breaks Novak Djokovic won. Maybe he should change his name to Ivo. Four hours and 57 minutes. I believe it\u2019s the longest Wimbledon final of all time. Novak Djokovic speaks! \u201cIf this was not the most exciting final then it was definitely the top two or three. I was up against one of the greatest players of all time, Roger, who I expect a lot. Unfortunately one player has to lose and we both had our chances. It\u2019s unreal to be two match points down and come back. It\u2019s a bit strange to play a tie-break at 12-all as well. I was hoping to get to the tie-breaks as well. And Roger says he hopes he can inspire others to believe they can do it at 32. I\u2019m one of them. When I was a boy and dreaming to be a tennis player this always has been the tournament for me. I used to make trophies out of different materials in my room and it\u2019s extra special sharing it with my son in the crowd and my parents and my whole team. My wife and daughter are here in London but they are at home. I\u2019ll see them soon. Back to being dad too, I guess.\u201d Roger Federer speaks! \u201cI will try to forget. It was a great match. It was long, it had everything, I had my chances, so did he. In a way I\u2019m happy. But Novak was great. Well done. I still feel good. I can still stand. Back to dad and husband. It\u2019s all good.\u201d Novak Djokovic, level on Bjorn Borg with five Wimbledon titles, collects his trophy. He\u2019s up to 16 grand slam titles. Two behind Rafa Nadal. Four behind Federer. Roger Federer, somehow managing to keep the tears at bay, collects his runners-up award. He might not get a chance like that again. Roger Federer had two championship points. Two. On his serve. And he didn\u2019t win. Fifth set tie-break: Djokovic 7-3 Federer* (*denotes server): Djokovic sends a slice wide. As the call is made Federer nets a backhand. Djokovic challenges. It was on the line. They will replay the point. Federer misses a first serve. Djokovic returns well off a second and Federer sends a forehand into orbit! That\u2019s it! Djokovic has won a quite extraordinary and barmy final to become the champion for a fifth time! He pats the grass. He smiles. He points to the sky. And Federer is left to wonder about all those chances and what might have been. Fifth set tie-break: Djokovic* 5-3 Federer (*denotes server): Djokovic whistles a backhand down the line - he has three championship points! Fifth set tie-break: Djokovic* 5-3 Federer (*denotes server): Djokovic punishes a short return with a fine forehand. Fifth set tie-break: Djokovic 4-3 Federer* (*denotes server): Djokovic puts a backhand return into the net. Fifth set tie-break: Djokovic 4-2 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer wins the point with a drop shot - as Djokovic slips heavily behind the baseline. He get up and dusts himself down with a towel. Fifth set tie-break: Djokovic* 4-1 Federer (*denotes server): Federer balloons another forehand wide. Fifth set tie-break: Djokovic* 2-1 Federer (*denotes server): Federer hooks a forehand wide. Fifth set tie-break: Djokovic 1-1 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer dabs a volley wide. Fifth set tie-break: Djokovic 1-1 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer crushes a forehand down the line. Djokovic challenges in vain. Fifth set tie-break: Djokovic* 1-0 Federer (*denotes server): Federer sends a backhand long. Fifth set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 12-12 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer\u2019s had so many chances to win this. And now he\u2019s serving to stay in it. He\u2019s relieved when Djokovic sends a backhand pass long. Djokovic receives a code violation for swiping his racket at the umpire\u2019s chair. Then Federer produces two sumptuous volleys for 40-0. He holds with an ace. This is the first 12-all tie-break! Fifth set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 12-11 Federer (*denotes server): Djokovic stomps into a 40-0 lead. Federer creeps back into it at 40-30. Then he overpowers Djokovic with his forehand during a baseline rally and charges forward to put an overhead away for deuce! Then comes an unbearably tense rally. They both keep brushing the net. Djokovic is straining and screaming. Federer goes big with an inside-out forehand. They both challenge. Turns out it was called out. It clipped the line! Djokovic, for some reason, is furious and has a go at the umpire. He needs to focus. It\u2019s a break point to Federer. Yet Djokovic aims a forehand into the left corner and Federer\u2019s backhand slice goes inches wide. Back to deuce. Good old deuce. Not for long. Federer lands a forehand on the baseline and closes the point with a volley. Djokovic thinks the forehand was out, but his challenge is unsuccessful. Break point. Djokovic is at the net. He just does enough with a smash! Deuce. Djokovic allows himself a smile. He\u2019s mightily relieved when he holds. Federer must hold to force a tie-break. Fifth set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 11-11 Federer* (*denotes server): Once again Federer serves to stay in it. He hooks a backhand wide for 0-15. He wins the next point with a well-angled backhand that forces Djokovic to hit wide. 15-all. Then Djokovic nets a weary forehand return. 30-15. Federer serves and volleys for 40-15. He holds when Djokovic sends a forehand return long. It\u2019s a bit like Anderson versus Isner. Said no one. Fifth set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 11-10 Federer (*denotes server): Djokovic slides an ace down the middle for 15-0. It\u2019s 15-all after he pulls a backhand wide. Another error from Djokovic makes it 30-all. But Federer lets him off the hook when he sends a forehand return long. Djokovic holds with another granite serve. Will it be a tie-break? Fifth set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 10-10 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer smacks an ace down the middle for 15-0. Then he misses a forehand down the line and challenges the call unsuccessfully. He makes up for it with a fine serve down the middle for 30-15. Then he volleys well enough to force Djokovic to dab a lob long. 40-15. Another good serve is enough. Fifth set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 10-9 Federer (*denotes server): Djokovic knocks a backhand long. 0-15. But he wins the next two points. Federer needs quick rallies. But Djokovic looks commanding. He whacks a forehand down the line to make it 40-15. He holds. Fifth set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 9-9 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer nets a slice. 0-15. He looks totally unsure of himself. On the next point he doesn\u2019t do enough with a volley. He doesn\u2019t do enough with a smash. He looks toast. Somehow he overpowers Djokovic with a forehand for 15-all. Djokovic nets a backhand return. 30-15. Djokovic nets another backhand. 40-15. This time Federer comes up with a good serve and Djokovic hits long. If only Federer had come up with one of those 10 minutes ago. Fifth set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 9-8 Federer (*denotes server): Djokovic cruises into a 40-0 lead. There\u2019s a feeling of inevitability about it all. Then Federer wins the next two points. But Djokovic serves well enough to hold. They march back to their seats before the changeover and Federer will sit down wondering how he let it get away. Fifth set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 8-8 Federer* (*denotes server): Roger Federer steps up to serve for his ninth Wimbledon title. The umpire has to tell the crowd to pipe down. Federer begins by whacking a forehand miles long. He challenges, presumably just to slow things down. Another tense rally - and Djokovic sends a forehand wide. 15-all. Then Federer bangs an ace down the middle. It\u2019s 30-15. He\u2019s two points away. Then he swings an ace down the middle! It\u2019s 40-15. Two championship points. It\u2019s incomprehensible. Federer nets a first serve. Djokovic returns well off a second serve and Federer, peeling backwards, sends a forehand wide for 40-30. The other one goes begging too: Federer comes to the net, Djokovic comes up with a forehand pass for deuce. Djokovic will not lie down. He bangs a forehand down the line and Federer nets a weak forehand. Break point. And Federer, who had TWO CHAMPIONSHIP POINTS, nets a forehand. He\u2019ll be having flashbacks to the US Open semi-final of 2011 here. Fifth set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 7-8 Federer (*denotes server): Two forehand errors from Federer make it 30-0. A good forehand from Federer makes it 30-15. A bad forehand from Djokovic makes it 30-all. Another bad forehand from Djokovic gives Federer a break point! Djokovic approaches the net. But he\u2019s played it into the Federer strike zone! Federer smacks a forehand from right to left and he breaks! He\u2019ll serve for the title! My word. Fifth set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 7-7 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer begins with an ace, his 20th so far. 15-0. And another. 30-0. Then Djokovic slices a forehand wide. 40-0. Federer holds to 15 with a forehand winner. He\u2019s 37! Fifth set: Djokovic|* 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 7-6 Federer (*denotes server): By the standards of this fifth set it\u2019s a simple hold for Djokovic, with Federer struggling to land a return. Surely this scenario favours Djokovic. How much has Federer got in the tank? Fifth set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 6-6 Federer* (*denotes server): Serving to stay in it again, Federer sprays a backhand down the line for 15-0. But the game goes to 15-all. Then Federer lifts a backhand long. 15-30. Djokovic is two points from the title. Amazingly he sends a backhand long off a second serve. 30-all. Federer wins the next point with a forceful forehand. 40-30. But then he wallops a simple drive volley long. Oh Roger. Deuce. But somehow Federer holds. And on they go. Fifth set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 6-5 Federer (*denotes server): Djokovic makes it 15-0 with a forehand that\u2019s too hot for Federer. Then he nets a tired backhand. They both need a good nap. Call it a draw? Pint in the bar upstairs? Hmm. Djokovic double-faults. 15-30. It\u2019s a chance for Federer. Yet Djokovic - showing he did learn from Boris Becker - somehow wins the next point when he dives to meet a Federer dink and his shot lands inside the baseline for 30-all. Soon it\u2019s 40-30 \u2013 and Djokovic holds. Federer will serve to stay in it again. It remains hard to see him making Djokovic crack. When they sit down, though, Djokovic asks the umpire when they play the tie-break. Not until it\u2019s 12-all, Novak. Fifth set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 5-5 Federer* (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the final, Federer begins by punching a backhand volley into the net. There was just enough pep on Djokovic\u2019s backhand and it\u2019s 0-15. The next point\u2019s bizarre. Djokovic drops a return short. Federer moves on to it. Then he flinches and looks like he doesn\u2019t know what to do with his forehand. He plays it straight to Djokovic, who nets a backhand. He got away with that, old Roger. He follows it up with an ace, then nets a backhand. 30-all. Fine margins now. Djokovic almost has the next point with a forehand pass, but Federer\u2019s there with a volley for 40-30. And he holds when Djokovic zaps a return wide. Fifth set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 5-4 Federer (*denotes server): Incredible! Out of nowhere Federer comes up with a staggering, spinning backhand drop shot that leaves everyone, especially Djokovic, totally surprised! It\u2019s 0-15. But Djokovic makes it 15-all with a commanding forehand and it\u2019s 40-15 after Federer misses two returns. Federer gets into the next rally and wins it with another drop shot. Yet Djokovic holds to 30. Federer will serve to keep the final alive. Fifth set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 4-4 Federer* (*denotes server): Another tentative rally ends with Djokovic just finding the line with a forehand for 0-15. Federer looks knackered. He\u2019s lucky to get away with a drop shot that Djokovic meets with a backhand into the net. He doesn\u2019t get away with it a second time, though. Djokovic makes it 15-30 with a backhand down the line. Yet he lets Federer off the hook when he clips the top of the net with an easy forehand and the ball drops wide, making it 30-all. Federer finally remembers how to serve. He makes it 40-30 and then he cracks an ace down the middle to hold. Fifth set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 4-3 Federer (*denotes server): But who knows what happens next? Djokovic begins this game by sending a forehand long for 0-15. It\u2019s 15-30 when he nets a backhand. But Federer whacks a forehand long. Centre Court\u2019s response: a resigned sigh. Djokovic\u2019s response: a double-fault. And here\u2019s a break point for Federer. Can he take it? Nope. He sends a tentative forehand long. Deuce. The next rally\u2019s torture. You\u2019re willing Federer to have a go. Eventually he does, pouncing on a short ball and drilling a forehand down the line. Break point. This time it\u2019s Federer\u2019s. This time Djokovic, yelping as he hits his shots, lifts a forehand long. Centre Court\u2019s response: celebratory. Poor Novak. Fifth set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 4-2 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer opens up with a backhand that lands a few yards past the baseline. It\u2019s a worrying sign for the Swiss. Another errant backhand from Federer has Djokovic feeling very lively at 0-30. Federer\u2019s struggling to make first serves now. Another fatigued backhand gives Djokovic two more break points. Another twist: Djokovic nets a forehand return off a second serve. Federer can\u2019t buy a first serve here, though. He gets drawn into a long rally, gets drawn into the net and can\u2019t stop Djokovic passing him with a backhand. The title is Djokovic\u2019s to lose. Fifth set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 3-2 Federer (*denotes server): A few weary shots from Federer allow Djokovic to establish a 40-0 lead. Djokovic looks to be in control. But three consecutive errors from the world No 1 take the game to deuce. It\u2019s a small chance for Federer, but Djokovic holds firm and holds serve. Fifth set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 2-2 Federer* (*denotes server): Djokovic enjoys a slice of luck on the first point, a net cord off a forehand return going his way. Federer won\u2019t like that at all. And he\u2019s under a bit of pressure when he drags a forehand wide for 15-30. It\u2019s a game defined by net cords, this one: when a Federer forehand flicks the top of the net it drops wide and Djokovic has two break points. He breathes a sigh of relief when Djokovic sends a backhand return long off a second serve, though, and then he produces a great shot, a swerving inside-out forehand to Djokovic\u2019s backhand. Deuce. Yet Djokovic has another chance when Federer sends a tired forehand wide. Federer\u2019s response is an ace that sends dust flying into the air. From there Federer holds. And the fans roar. And Djokovic looks annoyed. Fifth set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 2-1 Federer (*denotes server): Djokovic opens up with a pretty bad double-fault for 0-15. There have been a few of those today. The game goes to 30-all. Then deuce, Federer forcing it with a stunning 85mph backhand down the line. Yet Djokovic\u2019s serve clicks into gear and he holds. You sense Federer\u2019s the one who needs an early break here. Fifth set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 1-1 Federer* (*denotes server): A stat flashes up showing Djokovic hasn\u2019t lost a five-setter at Wimbledon since 2006. Mario Ancic beat him back then. Remember him? What a player. Anyway, Federer\u2019s quick to move into a 40-0 lead here. He ends up holding to 30, good serving keeping Djokovic at arm\u2019s length. Fifth set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 1-0 Federer (*denotes server): This is the fifth time Federer has been in a five-set Wimbledon final. He beat Nadal in 2007 and Roddick in 2009; he lost to Nadal in 2008 and Djokovic in 2014. Djokovic has also been in his fair share of five-set grand slam finals. This is familiar territory for both of them. Indeed Federer won the 2017 and 2018 Australian Open finals in five sets. But Djokovic does love a long race. You sense he should be the favourite here. And he begins the decider by holding to 15. Serving for the set again, this time Federer begins by meeting a Djokovic backhand with a deft volley for 15-0. Then comes a big serve for 30-0. Soon he has three set points. He takes the first by thrashing a drive volley into the open court. Mind you, he almost bashed it long. That would have summed it up. Fourth set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-5 Federer (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the set, Djokovic holds to 15. What must Federer be thinking now? He\u2019ll serve for it again. Fourth set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 3-5 Federer* (*denotes server): Serving for the set, Federer moves into a 15-0 lead. Then he double-faults. Then Djokovic nets a rotten backhand. But he isn\u2019t done yet. He makes it 30-all and earns his first break point of the final with a pinpoint backhand. It\u2019s taken him two hours and 47 minutes. But somehow Federer saves it, winning a 35-shot rally with a gorgeous backhand for deuce. Yet Federer nets a forehand, giving Djokovic another chance \u2013 and this time the Swiss nets a backhand slice! Dearie me, this is just ridiculous. Fourth set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 2-5 Federer (*denotes server): Federer smells blood. At 30-all he punches a forehand into the corner to earn a break point. Djokovic plonks a backhand long. Federer will serve for the fourth set. This is very strange. It\u2019s mindboggling. Fourth set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 2-4 Federer* (*denotes server): Looking to consolidate the break, Federer glides into a 40-0 lead with a gentle drop shot. He holds when Djokovic pulls a forehand well off target. Fourth set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 2-3 Federer (*denotes server): Federer moves to 0-15 with a fizzing backhand pass, but Djokovic produces a moment of genius on the next point, stretching into a forehand drop shot for 15-all. Then Djokovic double-faults. Then he smacks a forehand deep towards the baseline. Federer challenges. And he gets a challenge right! Federer has two break points. At which point Djokovic drags a backhand miles wide. It\u2019s not over yet! Fourth set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 2-2 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer looks in control at 40-15, only for a burst of excellence from Djokovic to force deuce. But there\u2019s still no sign of a break point for Djokovic. Federer holds. Fourth set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 2-1 Federer (*denotes server): Djokovic holds to love. Fourth set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 1-1 Federer* (*denotes server): Still no break points for Djokovic. Federer holds with a few cracking forehands. Just you try and make sense of this final! Fourth set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 1-0 Federer (*denotes server): What happens next? It\u2019s been such a strange match since the start of the second set. My tip, though: Djokovic to win this set and the title. It\u2019s tough to see Federer having enough in the tank to outlast the world No 1. Djokovic holds to 15. Incredibly he hasn\u2019t had a single break point yet - and he\u2019s winning the match. Third set tie-break: Djokovic* 7-4 Federer (*denotes server): Djokovic knocks a backhand down the line and Federer nets a forehand. Djokovic\u2019s will is extraordinary, but Federer will be kicking himself. From 5-3 up in the first-set tie-break, he\u2019s won four points across the two of them. Third set tie-break: Djokovic* 6-4 Federer (*denotes server): Federer lifts a backhand slice wide. He challenges in vain. Djokovic has two set points. Third set tie-break: Djokovic 5-4 Federer* (*denotes server): And that\u2019s an ace from Federer. Third set tie-break: Djokovic 5-3 Federer* (*denotes server): A bit of serve-volley from Federer. It\u2019s not over yet. Third set tie-break: Djokovic* 5-2 Federer (*denotes server): Federer gets one back, forcing Djokovic to net a forehand on the run. Third set tie-break: Djokovic* 5-1 Federer (*denotes server): Djokovic enters wall mode, overpowers Federer in an exhausting rally and punches the air as he watches his opponent\u2019s backhand drift long. Third set tie-break: Djokovic 4-1 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer nets a backhand. Oh Roger! Third set tie-break: Djokovic 3-1 Federer* (*denotes server): Djokovic nets a forehand return. Third set tie-break: Djokovic* 3-0 Federer (*denotes server): Federer sends another backhand wide. He looks the tighter player now. Third set tie-break: Djokovic* 2-0 Federer (*denotes server): Federer sends a forehand return long. Third set tie-break: Djokovic 1-0 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer begins by mishitting a backhand. Third set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 6-6 Federer (*denotes server): They\u2019ve been going a shade over two hours now. This game begins with a lengthy, even rally - and it goes Federer\u2019s way when Djokovic takes a chance, goes to the net and watches a backhand whizz past him for 0-15. Djokovic responds with a venomous backhand for 15-all. Three points earn him a tie-break. Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 5-6 Federer* (*denotes server): A quick game. Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 5-5 Federer* (*denotes server): Djokovic cracks a few into the net. Federer holds to love. Djokovic will serve to stay in the set again. Third set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 5-5 Federer (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the set, Djokovic falls to 0-15 after missing a forehand. Solid serving takes him to 15-all, but then he knocks a backhand long, handing Federer a 15-30 lead. The fans urge Federer on. Djokovic gets to 30-all. But Federer bangs a forehand down the line before charging forward to earn a set point with a classic backhand volley. Under pressure, Djokovic stays calm and a good serve forces Federer to block a backhand return wide. Deuce. From there Djokovic holds. He\u2019s pretty astonishing, isn\u2019t he? Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 4-5 Federer* (*denotes server): A good return from Djokovic unsettles Federer, who sends a forehand wide for 0-15. An ace makes it 15-all, but Djokovic is beginning to look increasingly alert. It goes to 30-all. Federer needs first serves. He gets one: 40-30. Then he finds a good second serve and Djokovic hooks a backhand long. Third set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 4-4 Federer (*denotes server): There\u2019s a sense of Djokovic knuckling down on serve. No more messing around. It\u2019s an admirable quality, the ability to survive the storm simply through efficiency. Lesser players would probably be a break down in this set but Djokovic actually hasn\u2019t given Federer a sniff of one. He holds to 15. Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 3-4 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer skips into a 40-0 lead. He\u2019s serving very well. He closes the game out with an ace. Third set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 3-3 Federer (*denotes server): Djokovic begins by netting a tame forehand for 0-15. He responds with a tough volley for 15-all. There\u2019s a sense he\u2019s waking up. He moves to 30-15 and makes it 40-15 with a forehand down the line. He holds when Federer balloons a forehand. Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 2-3 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer holds to 15, serving crisply and accurately. \u201cMaybe Djokovic was slightly injured by his slip early in the second set, just enough to lower the level of his game a bit,\u201d Harry Shannon offers. Third set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 2-2 Federer (*denotes server): Djokovic is serving so badly at the moment he\u2019d probably lose a point to one of those chumps who reckon they could take one off Serena Williams. But there\u2019s a sense he\u2019s more dialled in when the rallies go longer. And he lands a backhand on the baseline to hold to 15. He might just be perking up. Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 1-2 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer holds to love, rounding off four straight points with a smash. Third set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-6, 1-1 Federer (*denotes server): This feels like a big game for Djokovic, who wins the first point with a backhand down the line. But he follows it with a double-fault. At this point you\u2019re beginning to wonder if this is a ruse from Djokovic, a way of lulling Federer into a false sense of security, like he did against Murray in the 2015 Australian Open final. He does enough to hold to 30. The rot has been stopped. For now. Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-6, 0-1 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer picks up where he left off, pinging a forehand past a flailing Djokovic. Two accurate serves make it 40-15. Djokovic\u2019s vibe remains off. I\u2019d like to nip down there to give him a hug. Is that allowed? Perhaps during a changeover. Federer holds with an ace. Novak Djokovic has nipped off for a comfort break. Anything to disrupt the momentum generated by Roger Federer. Fed slaps a forehand away to make it 0-15. Then he reaches to his left and produces a stunning backhand drop shot for 0-30. Djokovic, thoroughly out of sorts, knocks a dreadful forehand long - and then he double-faults. Bizarre. It\u2019s almost as though Djokovic tanked it there - something I suspected Federer of doing in the second set against Nadal. Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-5 Federer* (*denotes server): The game goes to 15-all after a double-fault from Federer. Djokovic wakes up a bit, belting a forehand down the line for 15-30. But Federer does enough to win the next two points. An ace closes it out. Djokovic will serve to keep this odd little set alive. Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 1-4 Federer (*denotes server): Djokovic tries to mix it up with a drop shot but Federer is wise to the move and dinks well to make it 0-15. But just as we\u2019re starting to wonder whether it\u2019s going to be a bagel, Djokovic holds to 30. Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 0-4 Federer* (*denotes server): Just like that the set is Federer\u2019s to lose. Djokovic\u2019s energy has been very strange since it started. He keeps making uncharacteristic unforced errors. Up the other end Federer is moving serenely, acing for 40-0. He ends up holding to 30. Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 0-3 Federer (*denotes server): Djokovic knocks two backhands long to make it 0-30. This is a weird little slump from the Serbian, who\u2019s facing three more break points after putting a volley into the net. Djokovic saves the first with a wicked backhand. But Federer takes the second with a clean forehand. What a momentum shift! Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 0-2 Federer* (*denotes server): The game goes to 15-all after a double-fault from Federer. He makes it 30-15 with an ace. Djokovic responds with a crunching forehand. But Federer makes it 40-30 with a volley and backs up the break when Djokovic swipes a forehand wide. Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 0-1 Federer (*denotes server): Federer has never beaten Djokovic from a set down at a grand slam, which seems problematic. But he\u2019s on the prowl at the start of this set, earning two break points with a big forehand into the corner. Wrongfooted, Djokovic slips behind the baseline. He dusts himself down, but he\u2019s broken for the first time when he batters a forehand wide. That\u2019s the boost Federer needed. First set tie-break: Djokovic 7-5 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer miscues a backhand, sending it wide, and he\u2019s lost a tie-break he really should have won. Djokovic leads and you\u2019re left to wonder if Federer really believes he can beat this guy. First set tie-break: Djokovic* 6-5 Federer (*denotes server): Federer nets a forehand on the run. Djokovic has the first set point. First set tie-break: Djokovic* 5-5 Federer (*denotes server): Federer hoicks a forehand wide and long. First set tie-break: Djokovic 4-5 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer drags a forehand horribly wide. First set tie-break: Djokovic 3-5 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer serves well, Djokovic can\u2019t do anything with the return. First set tie-break: Djokovic* 3-4 Federer (*denotes server): Djokovic rushes to the net and this time Federer picks his spot with a forehand down the line. First set tie-break: Djokovic* 3-3 Federer (*denotes server): Federer cancels out the mini-break with a lovely backhand down the line. First set tie-break: Djokovic 3-2 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer comes back with an ace. First set tie-break: Djokovic 3-1 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer knocks a backhand long. First set tie-break: Djokovic* 2-1 Federer (*denotes server): With Djokovic at the net Federer rips a forehand long! What a miss! He should have won the last two points. First set tie-break: Djokovic* 1-1 Federer (*denotes server): A lengthy rally ends with Federer blinking first and blootering a forehand. First set tie-break: Djokovic 0-1 Federer* (*denotes server): Djokovic sends a return long. First set: Djokovic* 6-6 Federer (*denotes server): Djokovic begins with an ace down the middle. Then he makes it 30-0 with an amazing dink. His serving\u2019s improved since 0-30 at 4-5. He holds. Tie-break. First set: Djokovic 5-6 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer swings an ace out wide for 15-0. Djokovic doesn\u2019t look too convinced as he challenges. It brushed the line. But Djokovic hits back. A ripped return down the line makes it 15-all. Then he reads a poor drop shot from Federer and runs into a backhand to make it 15-30. The defending champion\u2019s threatening here. Federer\u2019s response is a massive backhand deep into the left corner to make it 30-all. Then he goes for the classic one-two punch, a serve out wide, a forehand into the opposite corner. But he follows it with a double-fault for deuce. The tension grows. Federer peels backwards, runs round a forehand and finds the line with a forehand down the line. What a shot. Such skill. He holds from there. This is a high-level match. They\u2019ve both been superb. First set: Djokovic 5-5 Federer (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the set, Djokovic falls to 0-15 after Federer feathers a drop shot over the net and wins the point with a volley into the open court. A long rally follows that one. Then, out of nowhere, Federer produces a gorgeous drop shot that clips the line and leaves Djokovic stranded at 0-30. All of a sudden Federer\u2019s two points from the set. But Djokovic responds with an ace for 15-30 and a backhand down the line for 30-all. Another accurate serve makes it 40-30. A double-fault makes it deuce, but Djokovic digs in and holds. He\u2019s hard as nails. First set: Djokovic 4-5 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer races into a 40-0 lead without much of a fuss. His serving remains on point. It has to be against Djokovic, who\u2019s ready with a fizzing return whenever there\u2019s a chance. A couple of big returns from Djokovic take the game to 40-30 - but Federer holds with another ace. First set: Djokovic* 4-4 Federer (*denotes server): At 15-0 Federer decides to attack a short ball and come to the net, only for Djokovic to pick him off with a backhand from left to right. Then Federer chips and charges off a return. He wins the point with a smash. He\u2019s always trying different directions. But Djokovic holds to 15, smashing well at the net. First set: Djokovic 3-4 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer is serving well, nailing most of his first serves, and it\u2019s helping him dominate with ball in hand. He holds to love, polishing off the game when he meets Djokovic\u2019s attempt at a backhand pass with a sharp volley. First set: Djokovic* 2-3 Federer (*denotes server): Federer admonishes himself after doing all the hard work of pulling Djokovic into the net, only to send a fairly easy backhand pass long for 15-0. Djokovic shows him how it\u2019s done on the next point, flaying a forehand past Federer, exposed at the net. 30-0. He makes it 40-15 with an ace down the middle. First set: Djokovic 2-3 Federer* (*denotes server): Having saved that break point, Djokovic raises his level and moves into a 0-30 lead after two wild misses from Federer. These are dangerous times for the Swiss. But three booming serves get him to 40-30. Federer holds thanks to a forehand down the line. First set: Djokovic* 2-2 Federer (*denotes server): Djokovic begins the game with a double-fault. 0-15. Federer is trying to play big early on, but he sends a forehand wide on the next point and wastes a challenge. Djokovic cruises into a 40-15 lead. Federer hits back with a forehand down the line for 40-30 and the game goes to deuce after Djokovic lifts a backhand long. Deuce is where they stay for a while \u2013 before Djokovic sends a backhand wide and finds himself facing the first break point of the final. Yet Federer fires a forehand wide for no good reason at all. Djokovic stirs from there and holds. He\u2019s passed the first test. First set: Djokovic 1-2 Federer* (*denotes server): The first long rally could be instructive: as it goes on it becomes clearer and clearer Djokovic has the upper hand and he wins the point with a crisp forehand for 0-15. His crosscourt backhand did some damage there. Federer races through the next three points, however, and holds to 30 when Djokovic fails to clear the net with a drop shot. First set: Djokovic* 1-1 Federer (*denotes server): Federer misses a couple of forehands, allowing Djokovic to move into a 30-0 lead. Soon it\u2019s 40-0. Djokovic holds to love when Federer nets another forehand. First set: Djokovic 0-1 Federer* (*denotes server): It\u2019s Roger Federer to open the 2019 men\u2019s singles final - and he begins with an ace for 15-0. Cue some whooping and cheering from the crowd. Poor Novak. Someone give him a hug. Another ace from Federer makes it 40-15. A belter of a forehand to close the game is the start Federer wants. Tok! Tok! Tok! They\u2019re knocking up. The No 1 seed and the No 2 seed go through a few final paces. Time for the coin toss. Then some pictures with the lucky young chap who spun the coin. Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer emerge from the locker room. Both have hired a couple of young squires to carry their bags for them. And so they set off on their walk. They both looked relaxed. They\u2019ve done this so many times. It\u2019s Djokovic\u2019s sixth Wimbledon final, Federer\u2019s 12th. So there\u2019s no point wasting them. They head straight out on court. Let\u2019s get down to business. Today\u2019s umpire is Argentina\u2019s Damian Steiner. Novak Djokovic had a bit of a run-in with him in Rome in 2016. Steiner also wound up Andy Murray in Miami in 2014. Here\u2019s hoping for more spice today! This will be the 48th meeting between these two. Novak Djokovic leads the head-to-head 25-22 and won his two matches with Roger Federer last year, beating the Swiss in Paris and Cincinnati. This is their first meeting in 2019. \u201cJust wanted to get this out there about yesterday\u2019s match,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cIf one credits the weight of history as the main factor which brought down Williams in the Final yesterday, they would be missing the point. Anyone who watched the match knows the truth, and will speak about it for years to come - it was tennis at its brutal best. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a more dominating display against the GOAT. The sport is played both on the field and in the mind... Halep did well enough in the former department to win the decisive edge for the latter one too! The critics shall rave, the fans shall boast, and the player herself shall revel in glory. At the grandest stage of tennis, Simona pulled off something spectacular. When she woke up today, surely she needed some convincing to believe all of this hadn\u2019t been a dream.\u201d Here\u2019s what Roger Federer thinks about taking on Novak Djokovic. It\u2019s the same like going into a Rafa match. I think the moment you\u2019ve played somebody probably more than 15 times, you know, especially in recent years also a few times, there\u2019s not that much more left out there. Especially you know where the players go when it really matters, how much can you still surprise somebody. At the end of the day it comes very much down to who\u2019s better on the day, who\u2019s in a better mental place, who\u2019s got more energy left, who\u2019s tougher when it really comes to the crunch. In the tennis, there\u2019s always somebody who\u2019s going to be a little bit better because there\u2019s no draws in our sport. It\u2019s always quite brutal sometimes. Don\u2019t want to say always the better player wins, but sometimes it can be tough. Look, I\u2019m excited about the game against Novak. Like you said, we\u2019ve played each other so, so much. I don\u2019t mind that, I think it\u2019s more of a clear game plan. Pre-match reading Quote of the tournament: \u201cIf. If. If. Doesn\u2019t exist\u201d \u2013 Rafael Nadal, 4 July 2019. The Spaniard had just been asked whether Nick Kyrgios is capable of winning a grand slam if he focuses on tennis and his answer offered a telling insight into the mindset of a champion. Put simply, Nadal doesn\u2019t deal in what ifs and maybes. He deals in cold, hard facts and was in no mood to indulge all the ifs surrounding Kyrgios. If. If. If. Doesn\u2019t exist. The contempt flies off the screen, doesn\u2019t it? And this is the truth before today\u2019s men\u2019s singles final at Wimbledon. Ultimately we know that the last point is all that matters \u2013 but we all have ideas about the journey Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic will take to get there. So if Federer hits his spots with his serves - like he did against Nadal - he could well win his ninth Wimbledon title. If he goes for the lines in the rallies, he\u2019ll be in with a chance of beating the world No1. If his backhand doesn\u2019t break down, he could overcome the Serbian cyborg for the first time at a grand slam since their 2012 Wimbledon semi-final. And if he holds his nerve in the big moments, this year\u2019s Wimbledon champion could be a father of four who turns 38 next month. If. If. If. The challenge, however, is putting theory into practice and we have been here before with Federer and Djokovic. I seem to recall the conversation was similar before their final here in 2015. Federer had served magnificently in his semi-final win over Andy Murray, one of the best returners around, but he found it difficult to replicate that level against Djokovic, who was just so good at making his side of the court look smaller, closing the space, forcing errors and taking control with the brilliance and efficiency of his groundstrokes. It all fell rather flat in the end and it seemed Federer simply couldn\u2019t do Djokovic over five sets. It was too much to ask against such a supreme athlete. Djokovic would dominate. He won their 2014 and 2015 Wimbledon finals. He won their 2015 US Open final. He won their 2016 Australian Open semi-final. Each time Federer finished looking as steady on his feet as Woody Harrelson in the Royal Box. But that was the era of Imperial Novak. The vibe is slightly different now. Federer has been a different player since returning from injury at the start of 2017. The Swiss has gained the edge in his rivalry with Nadal in the last two years, something that seemed unthinkable not so long ago, and now he gets a crack at Djokovic. You just know he\u2019ll be feeling confident before play begins. All the same it\u2019s still Djokovic who sits at the top of the rankings. Sure, he had a duff period after completing the career slam at the French Open three years ago, but the 32-year-old has been the best player in the world since his restorative win at Wimbledon last year and he starts as a slight favourite here. He hasn\u2019t been at his peak over the past fortnight, but he hasn\u2019t really been pushed and there\u2019s always a sense he can up his level in the biggest matches. He\u2019ll be dying to disappoint all the Fed Fans on Centre Court. If \u2013 if, if, if \u2013 Djokovic does then he moves up to 16 grand slam titles, two behind Nadal. If Federer wins he moves up to 21 grand slam titles, three clear of Nadal. As ever history is on the line. Play begins at: 2pm BST.",

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s be honest: Australians have never had much time for our South Pacific neighbours. The island nations that lie to our north and north-east, stretching from Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands to Vanuatu, Fiji and beyond, may be close to us geographically, but we have not found them especially interesting, important or profitable. With a few honourable exceptions, and tourism aside, Australians have been indifferent to our nearest neighbours\u2019 dramatic landscapes, their rich and diverse cultures, and their general welfare, and we have seen relatively few opportunities for trade. Only their strategic significance has attracted us: the islands scattered widely across the north of our continent are critical to our protection from armed attack. Our closest neighbours are crucial to the defence of our continent simply because of their proximity. Military operations are governed by distance. Whether you can sink a ship, bomb an airfield or seize a town \u2013 and, critically, how much it will cost \u2013 depends on how far your forces must operate from their bases and how far the enemy must operate from theirs. For much of our history, distance has worked to Australia\u2019s advantage. We have been secure because we are remote. But we lose this advantage if a potentially hostile great power can operate from bases close to our shores. The China wake-up call \u201cWe would view with great concern the establishment of any foreign military bases in those Pacific Island countries and neighbours of ours.\u201d That was then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull in April 2018, responding to press reports last April that China was seeking to build a naval base in Vanuatu. The story was swiftly and categorically denied by both Beijing and Port Vila, and Julie Bishop, then minister for foreign affairs, poured cold water on it. While it may prove a false alarm, it seems Canberra has received credible indications that China is indeed actively seeking a military base somewhere in the South Pacific. It would be hard to overstate the significance of such a development, were it to occur. This would be the first time since Japan was pushed out of the islands at the end of the Pacific War that any major power, other than one of our allies, has sought a military base so close to Australia. Establishing a base in our neighbourhood would be a low-cost, low-risk way for China to show off its growing military and diplomatic reach and clout. Moreover, by ignoring the noisy complaints that would surely emanate from Washington, Beijing would show that it is willing to defy the United States. And it would send an unambiguous message to us here in Australia, signalling Beijing\u2019s rejection of our claims to our own sphere of influence in the South Pacific, and sending a stark warning of China\u2019s reach and its capacity to punish us if we side too vociferously with the US or Japan against it. Abandoning the sphere of influence What can Australia do, then? One option is a radical recasting of our relations and role in the South Pacific, to draw our neighbour much more closely under our wing. But the better option would be to step back, abandoning our traditional ideas about keeping intruders out of the South Pacific. In fact, there may be no alternative. China poses an unprecedented challenge to the strategic assumptions that have framed our policies since European settlement. We have never encountered an Asian country as powerful as China is now, let alone as powerful as it will likely become in the decades ahead. The costs to us of trying to keep China out of the region might simply prove impossible to bear. Or, to be more precise, it might prove cheaper to build military capabilities that in a war could neutralise Chinese bases in the South Pacific (by denying access to them and subjecting them to strike attacks) than to prevent China from establishing such bases in peacetime. Building forces that could counter Chinese bases in our neighbourhood would mean that we could feel less anxious about the establishment of such bases, and relax the imperative to preserve the sphere of influence we have for so long assumed we must maintain. This would not mean abandoning all interest in our nearest neighbours and succumbing to the indifference that has historically weakened our relationships with them. On the contrary, we should make great efforts to maximise our role and presence \u2013 not in the form of an exclusive sphere of influence, but as one of the region\u2019s major partners. It is possible to imagine Australia actively engaged in the South Pacific not to exclude China (or any other power), but to work with it where possible, and to work against it where necessary, to protect our interests and the interests we share with our small neighbours as best we can. We should start to treat our smaller close neighbours as independent at last. The uncomfortable reality is that preserving an exclusive sphere of influence in the South Pacific is not going to be possible against a regional power that is far stronger than any we have ever confronted, or even contemplated. It might turn out that the more we try and fail to exclude China from the South Pacific, the less influence we will have there. If Scott Morrison is as serious about the South Pacific as he claims, he should start, paradoxically perhaps, by abandoning the idea of an exclusive sphere of influence, and then by guiding Australians to take a much greater interest in our neighbourhood than we ever have before. \u2022 Hugh White is a professor of strategic studies at the Australian National University.

Dehydration or Parkinson\u2019s disease? Deep fear or multiple sclerosis? Raging sepsis or dementia? This ridiculous question would rightly be thrown out of a medical curriculum because any reasonable clinician would insist on the need for a detailed history and examination followed by appropriate tests and often further observation before pronouncing a diagnosis, especially one with serious consequences for the patient and family.

      "bodyText": "Australia remains \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about China\u2019s treatment of the Uighur people, including use of forced labour, the foreign affairs minister Marise Payne has said. On Monday Payne revealed that China had blocked Australia\u2019s attempts to offer consular assistance to dual citizens and their families, and rejected China\u2019s claims that concerned nations had rebuffed an offer to visit Xinjiang province. Payne made the remarks to Radio National ahead of an ABC Four Corners investigation on treatment of Uighurs, which has prompted Cotton On and Target Australia to commit to investigate their supply chains because they reportedly source cotton from Xinjiang. Asked about the detention of more than a million Uighurs, Payne said Australia was \u201cdeeply concerned about the human rights situation in Xinjiang, including the use of detention facilities\u201d. \u201cThose concerns have been raised with China regularly including by me directly in my visit last year. \u201cA letter was signed to the president of the Human Rights Council and the UN high commissioner for human rights a week or so ago \u2013 we were one of 22 signatories to that letter \u2013 and I think what that reflects is an increasing international focus on the developments in Xinjiang.\u201d That letter, which called for an end to mass arbitrary detention, prompted a fierce backlash from China. It accused the signatories of having \u201cwantonly criticised and smeared China in total disregard for the truth\u201d and said that by \u201cblatantly politicising the issue of human rights, they have grossly interfered in China\u2019s internal affairs\u201d. Asked about the cases of 10 Australian permanent residents allegedly detained, including a two-year-old Australian citizen, Payne confirmed Australia had sought information and offered consular assistance to Uighurs but had not had access to the boy. \u201cWe do request consular access when we are notified of such a detention \u2026 it\u2019s very important to note there are complex family arrangements around family members who are in Xinjiang. \u201cBut if they\u2019re not Australian citizens we don\u2019t have an entitlement to consular access, [and] China doesn\u2019t allow consular access to dual nationals unless they\u2019ve actually entered China on their Australian passports, so that does add to the complexity.\u201d Asked if China\u2019s claims officials from the 22 signatory countries had declined an invitation to visit, Payne replied: \u201cI don\u2019t understand that to be the case. \u201cWe have sought diplomatic visits in the past \u2026 and those requests, as far as I\u2019m aware, have not been granted.\u201d Payne committed to continue to seek access to Xinjiang and \u201cpress our concerns\u201d through the Human Rights Council and directly with China. Payne was also asked about comments by Australia\u2019s defence force chief, Angus Campbell, reported in the Australian Financial Review, that China could take advantage of climate change to occupy abandoned islands in the Pacific. While not naming China, Campbell reportedly told a forum on climate change and national security in June that the potential for territorial expansion could be opened up if smaller islands were abandoned as a result of rising sea levels. \u201cIf other states see the opportunity to occupy uninhabited spaces then it could introduce new tension into our region,\u201d he reportedly said. In response, Payne noted at the Pacific Islands Forum in 2018 Australia had signed the Boe Declaration, which she said \u201cidentifies climate change clearly as a key security issue\u201d. \u201cWe are very focused on our engagement on climate in the region,\u201d she said.

The aggregation of these steps means critical transfers can take several months to progress.</p> <p>Nauru, which has banned tele-health assessments, regularly demands a third medical opinion, from a local doctor, before it will consider cases at fortnightly OMR meetings.</p> <p>Records show Bita and another woman, Shabnam*, were sent to doctors appointed by the OMR committee several weeks after the Australian government approved their transfers.

      "bodyText": "Bita* attempted suicide in May, in the grey months while authorities stalled on her medical transfer from Nauru to Australia. It is now more than 10 weeks since two doctors declared her situation \u201curgent\u201d and warned that delays to the medevac process would be life threatening. She is still waiting. \u201cFor almost seven years, I could put up with all the degradations, but I don\u2019t have the capacity to cope with uncertainty anymore,\u201d Bita, a refugee from Iran, told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt is like a slow death for me. I don\u2019t want to come to Australia any longer. My only desire is death.\u201d The Guardian has interviewed several people on Nauru, each with serious medical and mental health problems. They describe a system where hopes are raised and then dashed by a succession of delays, one that remains at the whim of authorities in both Australia and Nauru. In Bita\u2019s case, doctors said in April that assessments for chronic conditions were required with the \u201cutmost urgency\u201d because mental health problems were contributing to and exacerbated by her pain. A delay in treatment could see her face \u201cserious irreparable damage including death\u201d, one doctor said. On 16 May, three weeks after she received the medical opinions necessary for the medevac process, Bita saw a doctor on Nauru. Her medical records show she told the doctor: \u201cI don\u2019t want to live in this situation.\u201d Four days later, she attempted suicide by overdosing on medication. Later that same day, the Australian government solicitor advised Bita she had been approved by the minister\u2019s delegate for a medical transfer. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Nauru won\u2019t accept word of Australian doctors Australia\u2019s medevac laws require the government to transfer refugees and asylum seekers to Australia if two doctors determine it is necessary and the medical treatment is not available in offshore detention. In practice, people requiring assessment or treatment must then wait for the outcome of at least three successive decisions \u2013 approval from the Australian home affairs minister, approval by the Nauruan Overseas Medical Review (OMR) committee, and for the Australian Border Force (ABF) to schedule transport. Most recent cases have also required a final \u201cuplift approval\u201d from a senior Nauruan bureaucrat. The aggregation of these steps means critical transfers can take several months to progress. Nauru, which has banned tele-health assessments, regularly demands a third medical opinion, from a local doctor, before it will consider cases at fortnightly OMR meetings. Records show Bita and another woman, Shabnam*, were sent to doctors appointed by the OMR committee several weeks after the Australian government approved their transfers. In both cases, the OMR committee took about five weeks to make a decision. Those familiar with the process say paperwork can take more than a week to arrive after a decision is made. Last week, a federal court judge excoriated the Australian government for failing to transfer a sick refugee, accusing it of putting its relationship with Nauru above compliance with court orders and federal law. Justice Debra Mortimer scrutinised a case in which a transfer was approved by the Australian government but was delayed partly because the OMR committee insisted on obtaining its own medical report. A branch commander within the home affairs department, Peter Timson, told the court that to upset the Nauruans could impede further transfers, and it was therefore \u201cessential \u2026 that Australia retains and builds upon its strong working relationships with Nauruan officials\u201d. Bita and Shabnam were approved by the OMR committee last month, but have remained on Nauru for several weeks. They have not yet been given a date for their transfers. Government still pushing Taiwan transfers Yosef*, a 59-year-old diabetic asylum seeker, was offered treatment for a severe elbow injury in Taiwan in June. He declined the offer. \u201cI\u2019ve been advised that I can go to Taiwan with only one family member,\u201d Yosef said. \u201cI can\u2019t leave my severely sick children and wife alone. They are ill too. How can I accept any treatment while my children are suffering excessively?\u201d In 2017, the Australian government struck a deal with Taiwan to provide high-level care to sick refugees and asylum seekers \u2013 a move broadly viewed as an attempt to prevent people from reaching Australia. Yosef\u2019s documents show that despite the passage of the medevac laws, the home affairs department continues to direct people on Nauru towards treatment in Taiwan. His daughter, Hoda*, is the carer for her ill parents. She suffers from fatigue, chronic stress disorder and back pain. As the population of women on Nauru declines, due to some taking up resettlement offers and others being sent to Australia for treatment, those remaining say it has become increasingly unsafe. Hoda complained about wild dogs roaming near her residence. She complained of heart palpitations and severe chest pains due to a fear of \u201cthe island and its people and its animals\u201d. Baran* is also in the process of seeking a medical transfer and is seeking reports from doctors. Because of a backlog of critical cases, she has been on a waiting list for seven months for a case worker to assist with the process. Since 2013, Baran has suffered from gynaecological issues and urinary incontinence. She is one of several women on Nauru with similar conditions. Baran said she previously slept in a bed about two tents away from the toilet \u2013 a distance sometimes too far for her to make it in time. Instead, she urinated into a mug and then walked to the toilets to pour it out. \u2018This is not a nightmare anymore, it\u2019s reality\u2019 Last year, Medecins Sans Frontieres warned Nauru was in the grip of a mental health crisis and released findings that showed 60% of people in detention on the island had had suicidal thoughts. \u201cThe mental health suffering on Nauru is among the most severe MSF has ever seen, including in projects providing care for victims of torture,\u201d the report found. MSF Australia executive director Paul McPhun has described the medevac law as \u201ca desperate measure for a desperate situation\u201d. \u201cOur politicians should know, and the public needs to know, that the health crisis on Manus and Nauru is real,\u201d McPhun said. \u201cThe mental and physical suffering of the human beings trapped by Australian policy is real. The need to urgently act to stop this unnecessary suffering is real. \u201cOur experience during 11 months working on Nauru showed that people there were experiencing life-threatening mental health needs. We saw that there was insufficient independent medical care available on the island to cope with the levels of need.\u201d Having jumped through every hoop, Bita remains in limbo. Even after her transfer was approved by Nauru\u2019s OMR committee, she has spent another three weeks waiting for the ABF to advise her of her transfer date and a flight off the island. In the meantime, she has grown increasingly frustrated and isolated. \u201cSince majority of women have been transferred to Australia, Nauru has become an unsafer place for women,\u201d she said. \u201cMy home is surrounded by the stray dogs. I\u2019m endlessly fear. I have the illusion that a cat gazes at me. This is not a nightmare anymore, it\u2019s reality \u2013 everyone is gone and we are the ones left. \u201cNo one hears us because we are not a big group anymore. I have nightmares that dreadful animals are attacking me and I\u2019m always running away, waking up to the feeling of suffocation.\u201d * names have been changed.",
