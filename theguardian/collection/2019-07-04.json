It reduces the tax rate for those earning between $45,000 and $200,000 to 30 cents in the dollar.

This tax cut should not be confused with the tax return; they are not the same.</p> <p>A tax return is what you get if you overpaid your tax throughout the year \u2013 usually because you use PAYG. If you were supposed to pay $5,000 in tax but you were taxed $7,000, you will get $2,000 back.</p> <p>The tax cut this week is a tax offset. It means it reduces the amount of tax you were supposed to pay. That $5,000 goes down to $4,000. You were still taxed $7,000. You get $3,000 back.</p> <p>But the tax cut can\u2019t on its own give you a refund. So if you owe less than $1,080 in tax, you won\u2019t get money credited.</p> <p>You also still have to pay the Medicare levy of 2%. So you could, theoretically, have a $1,080 tax bill and a $1,080 offset and pay no tax \u2013 but still pay the 2% levy.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s tax cut package passed parliament on Thursday evening after weeks of political wrangling. But what will happen now, what does it mean, how much money can you expect and when? How much will I get? Between $255 and $1,080, depending on how much you earn. And you\u2019ll get it almost immediately \u2013 the cut will apply to the tax return you are about to file (or just did) for the 2018-19 financial year. Remember, the figures below are for the year that just passed, that is, the tax return you are about to do. If you earned: Under $37,000 \u2013 you will get $255 back. Between $37,000 and $48,000 \u2013 $255 back plus 7.5% of what is over $37,000 (so that\u2019s between $255 and $1,080). Between $48,000 and $90,000 \u2013 $1,080 back, flat. No calculations needed. Between $90,000 and $126,000 \u2013 $1,080 back but minus 3% of what is over $90,000 (so between $1,080 and $0). Over $126,000 \u2013 zero. Some examples: A person earning $35,000 gets $255 back $45,000 gets $855 back $55,000 gets $1,080 back $80,000 also gets $1,080 back $100,000 gets $780 back $120,000 gets $180 back Income tax cuts calculator What if I already submitted my tax return? Don\u2019t worry! You will still get the tax cut. The legislation is retrospective \u2013 so it will affect the return you submitted on 1, 2, 3 or 4 July. The ATO promises: \u201cIf these proposed changes become law, and you have received your income tax assessment we will automatically amend your assessment for you if your offset increases.

So if the bill hadn\u2019t passed, you still would have received: $200 back \u2013 if you earned below $37,000 $200 back, plus 3% of everything over $37,000 \u2013 if you were between $37,000 and $48,000 $530 back (flat) \u2013 if you earned between $48,000 and $90,000 $530 back, minus 1.5% of everything over $90,000 \u2013 if you earn over $90,000 So the government has boosted the $200 offset to $255, boosted the percentage you get back from 3% to 7.5% for people between $37,000 and $48,000, and doubled that $530 to $1,080 for everyone else. It has also doubled the percentage that is deducted (from 3% to 1.5%) for those earning over $90,000. So, back to the examples from before: Someone earning $35,000 is $55 better off (from $200 to $255) $45,000 equals $425 better off (from $440 to $855) $55,000 and $80,000 equals $550 better off (from $530 to $1,080) $100,000 equals $400 better off (from $380 to $780) $120,000 equals $80 better off (from $100 to $180) Will it be around forever? No. You\u2019ll get this tax cut for four years (including the tax return you\u2019re about to file). But then it will be gone. It is an explicitly temporary measure.

      "bodyText": "The five former top police officers in Britain have attacked the Conservatives\u2019 record on crime, saying that \u201cresources drained to dangerously low levels\u201d have contributed to a \u201cfeeling of lawlessness\u201d and saying confidence in the police has to be urgently restored. The attack came from a string of commissioners of the Metropolitan police, Britain\u2019s biggest force, who claimed the crisis was so deep that \u201cthe public have perilously low expectations of the police today\u201d. The letter is signed by Lord Condon, Lord Stevens, Lord Blair, Sir Paul Stephenson and Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe. It says: \u201cThe reduction of police and support staff by more than 30,000, the virtual destruction of neighbourhood policing and the inadvisable undermining of lawful police powers such as stop and search, have taken their toll. Common sense suggests that these factors have contributed to the feeling of lawlessness generated by knife murders and \u2018county lines\u2019 drugs.\u201d The letter, published in the Times, warns of an \u201cemasculation of British policing\u201d in recent years and says a royal commission is needed. It was the latest warning about the crisis in policing, with the chief inspector of constabulary also warning on Thursday that policing is under huge strain, struggling to meet rising demand and that radical reform is needed as well as more officers. In his annual state of policing report, Sir Tom Winsor said the criminal justice system was, in parts, failing, and said solutions lay in more rehabilitation, more crime prevention, and increased innovation and efficiency. After years of funding cuts resulting in 20,000 fewer police officers, the chief inspector, who is deeply unpopular among many rank and file officers, who view him as the executor of the Tories\u2019 police cuts, said they had influenced crime levels. Winsor said homicides were rising and the fall in crime had stalled, with the poorest areas suffering the worst cuts. \u201cThere are indications that some forces are straining under significant pressure as they try to meet growing, complex and higher-risk demand with weakened resources.\u201d The wider criminal justice system was \u201cmalfunctioning\u201d, \u201cdysfunctional and defective\u201d, he added. Policing was under extra pressure to pick up services normally covered by other services that had been cut under austerity. Winsor said the public \u201cthrough their elected representatives\u201d needed to decide how much money policing should receive after years of cuts, which were only recently being reversed. Winsor called for greater rehabilitation of prisoners because many jails \u201cwere full of people who were ill rather than bad\u201d. Reform of policing was urgently needed, he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, the windspeed of police reform will fall to a flutter, leaving the police service increasingly unable to meet the demands it faces. The inevitable legacy of such an approach would be unacceptable compromises in both the quality of service the police can offer the public and the level of public safety and security the police can uphold.\u201d Winsor spoke after the frontrunner for the Conservative leadership, Boris Johnson, pledged to recruit an additional 20,000 police officers at an estimated cost of \u00a31.1bn a year. He welcomed Johnson\u2019s pledge but suggested the cost would rise every year, adding that investment was needed in technology and innovation to make policing more efficient. \u201cThe police undoubtedly do need more people,\u201d Winsor said. \u201cNot all of that should be spent on hiring people. Some of that \u2026 should be spent on technology so they can be as efficient as possible.\u201d Asked about Johnson\u2019s promise on officer numbers, Winsor said: \u201cIt may not be the most efficient and effective way of spending \u00a31.1bn \u2026 every year.\u201d He added: \u201cThe police can be far more productive if they are given the kit that they need. What I think the government and public want is the productivity of 20,000 officers of the past, that doesn\u2019t mean to say they need to have 20,000 people.\u201d He said changing crime and technology had changed the dangers children faced. \u201cMost children are now more at risk in their own bedrooms then they are on the streets. This type of offending is not just about child sexual abuse and fraud, but radicalisation, harassment and stalking too,\u201d Winsor said. Winsor, who was a controversial choice to become chief inspector when given the job by Theresa May when she was home secretary said, since 2010, there had been more reform to policing than at any time since the 19th century. Martin Hewitt, the chair of the National Police Chiefs Council, said: \u201cThe findings make clear that we can only deliver effective justice if all of the criminal justice system works together. \u201cTo do that, all those with a part to play must be properly resourced, and as the report points out, that isn\u2019t currently the case.

The government announced a year ago that it intended to consult on the design of the domestic replacement fund by the end of 2018. \u201cThis still has not happened,\u201d said the Local Government Association (LGA) which called it a \u201chuge concern\u201d. Much of Philip Hammond\u2019s \u00a326bn fiscal headroom has already being promised on big-ticket items such as extra police and tax cuts by both Tory leader hopefuls Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson, and councils fear they would be the ones to lose out in any settlement post-Brexit. Kevin Bentley, the LGA\u2019s Brexit taskforce chair, said: \u201cBrexit cannot leave local areas facing huge financial uncertainty as a result of lost regional aid. This funding has been used by local areas to create jobs, support small and medium enterprises, deliver skills training, and invest in critical transport and digital infrastructure and boost inclusive growth across the country.\u201d The money comes from the European social fund, the European regional development fund (ERDF) and the European agricultural fund for rural development. The funds have helped improve roads, bring broadband to rural communities, train people with disabilities to help them get into work, as well as providing funds for tourist and environmentally important sites. In Portsmouth and Southampton the programme supports the long-term unemployed and people with disabilities and health conditions that make work challenging. In many cities, ERDF allocations have provided match-funding to help small businesses get off the ground. A citywide enterprise programme in Leeds involving pre-startups and businesses under three years old is one of the largest beneficiaries, with a total of \u00a39.1m in match-funding to the local authority and Prince\u2019s Trust contribution. Bentley said: \u201cWith 18 months until funding runs out, the government needs to work urgently with councils to develop a fully funded and locally driven successor scheme. With national funding for regeneration increasingly being depleted, all local areas have become increasingly reliant on EU money, and local areas are desperate to get on with creating jobs, building infrastructure and boosting growth.\u201d A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokeswoman said: \u201cWe know the importance of local growth funding to local places and of providing certainty on their future. That\u2019s why we are talking to interested parties on the design of the UK shared prosperity fund to ensure it can support those parts of our country whose economies are furthest behind.\u201d",

Their findings from their work on 13 patients are reported <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)31143-2/fulltext\">reported in the Lancet medical journal</a>. Van Zyl says she hopes they will encourage the thousands of people who become tetraplegic (also known as quadriplegic) by losing the function of all four limbs to seek surgery which could help them live more normal lives.</p> <p>Nerve transfers are not new, she says, but had not been successful in spinal cord injuries. Van Zyl had been using nerve transplants in brachial plexus injuries, where neck and shoulder nerves have been pulled out of the spinal cord, and wondered why they did not try them to restore function in patients who had been paralysed. In 2014, she and her team designed a triple nerve transplant.</p> <p>The first patient had \u201creally fabulous results from the surgery\u201d, she said. \u201cWord got out and we were fairly inundated with people wanting nerve transfers.\u201d</p> <p>They set up a structured project to track everything they did and all the outcomes, which has resulted in the Lancet paper. They recruited 16 young adult patients who had become tetraplegic after motor accidents, falls, sports or diving. Two of them did not continue with the programme and one died, unconnected to the surgery.</p> <p>Nerves were taken from shoulders and transplanted into paralysed muscles in the arm so that they bypassed the injury and connected back up to the spinal cord. Ten of the patients had nerve transfers to one arm and tendon transplants in the other. Four nerve transplants in three patients failed, but the team say tendon transplant is then available as a backup.</p> <p>Two years on from surgery, the patients have significant improvements in their hand function, particularly enough pinch and grasp strength to carry out most tasks of daily living.</p> <p>Van Zyl says she gets strength and inspiration from her patients. She tells of one who had been \u201ca very high-functioning individual. He was in a boating accident \u2013 he was thrown out of a boat. He was the CEO of three different companies he\u2019d set up and he was working seven days a week and he went from that to a head on a stick, as he described himself.</p> <p>\u201cHe told me, after he\u2019d had his surgery and had enough of a result from it, that he had decided that he would try this surgery but if it didn\u2019t work he was going to exit. He didn\u2019t want to live any more. His was a very high level of injury but he got enough out of what we did for him, which was a combination of tendon and nerve transfers, for him to start to work again at home, to be able to take a young family member out to the movies independently and handle the money, get the tickets, get the popcorn.\u201d</p> <p>One time Van Zyl video-called him and saw people milling about in the room. She asked if his carer could do something for her. \u201cHe said: \u2018That\u2019s not my carer \u2013 that\u2019s my assistant. I\u2019m working. These are people working for me.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cIn his case it was life-saving, not just life-changing.\u201d</p> <p>She and her team have now done about 160 nerve transfers. Between 250,000 and 500,000 people every year have a spinal injury, more than half of whom become tetraplegic. There are surgeons who could help at least some of them, says Van Zyl. \u201cWe are all dedicated to this cause and absolutely love this work. All around the world there are surgeons \u2013 we all know each other \u2013 some of them waiting for patients, frustrated that they don\u2019t get enough.\u201d</p> <p>They cannot do anything for someone as badly paralysed as Christopher Reeve was, but they can help the most common spinal injuries that cause tetraplegia, called C5 and C6 \u2013 damage to the fifth and sixth cervical (neck) vertebrae. She hopes the published paper will encourage rehabilitation teams to suggest surgery and patients to seek it out.</p> <p>In a commentary published with the paper, Dr Ida Fox from Washington University in the USA writes: \u201cStem cells and neuroprostheses could change the landscape of regenerative medicine in the future. For now, nerve transfers are a cost-effective way to harness the body\u2019s innate capability to restore movement in a paralysed limb.\u201d</p> <h2>Case study: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do it again\u2019</h2> <p>Paul Robinson, 34, from Australia\u2019s Gold Coast, said the surgery had been \u201clife-changing\u201d.</p> <p>Robinson fractured his C6 vertebra in a dirt bike accident in early 2015, a month before his 30th birthday. It left him a tetraplegic. He lost function in his hands, and was only able to manage a slight grip. Picking up objects like a cup to drink required squeezing two hands together.</p> <p>\u201cEven something light like an empty can would really be a struggle for me to grab with one hand because all I had was slight tenodesis grip, which is when you pull your wrist back and your fingers automatically close,\u201d Robinson said.</p> <p>After a few months in the spinal unit at Brisbane\u2019s Princess Alexandra hospital, one of his health workers mentioned the research being done by Dr Van Zyl into tendon and nerve transfers.</p> <p>In December 2015, he received a nerve and tendon transfer on his right side and nerve transfer on his left side. Recovering from the surgery was difficult, both physically and emotionally, because it erased progress he had made toward rehabilitation. But once he started rehab again, he forgot about the setback.</p> <p>\u201cYou spend so much time in rehab learning to do things with what you have got \u2026 and then all of a sudden you go almost back to the start,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I was four weeks [post surgery], not being able to move my arms, so it was back to \u2018Can someone give me a drink of water, can someone change the channel?\u2019 I was more or less bedridden for a while.</p> <p>\u201cIt was probably about six months and I started really noticing the results, and then after about eight months it was like: \u2018Oh wow, I didn\u2019t even notice I was doing that.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI was picking stuff up and I couldn\u2019t have done that previously. It is a slow healing process but I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do it again if I was in the same position. The amount of difference it\u2019s made to my daily life makes that recovery beyond comparison.\u201d</p> <p>Robinson can now lift up to 9kg with his right hand and 4kg with his left. The restored grip function means he is able to live independently and has recently moved out of his parents\u2019 home.</p> <p>\u201cIt means I am able to pull apart and put my wheelchair in and out of the car, pick things up off the ground, hold a drink with one hand,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Using his wheelchair is also easier now he can rely on his increased strength to manoeuvre on uneven ground. He travels to Brisbane several times a week to play wheelchair rugby and regularly meets other people who have received similar injuries who might benefit from the same surgery.</p> <p>\u201cThere might be someone else out there who doesn\u2019t see that this is an option,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has made such a big change to my life; hopefully it can help someone else too. It\u2019s really a life-changing thing.\u201d</p>",

At least 11 men and one woman were arrested on suspicion of trying to disrupt celebrations marking the 22nd anniversary of the former British colony\u2019s return to Chinese rule on Monday. On Thursday police said they have been been charged with offences that range from \u201cpossession of offensive weapons, unlawful assembly, assaulting a police officer, obstructing a police officer, offence against air navigation ( HK) order 1995 and failing to carry identity document\u201d. The oldest was 31 and the youngest was just 14. For the past month, protesters have been demanding the withdrawal of a bill that would allow extraditions to the Chinese mainland as anger has grown against Hong Kong authorities and morphed into a wider political crisis. The occupation of the legislature on Monday night coincided with a massive peaceful protest in which organisers say more than half a million people marched through the city on the anniversary of Hong Kong\u2019s 1997 return to Chinese rule. Officers on Wednesday had gathered debris from the legislature as evidence, showing pictures of bricks, metal bars and shields stacked neatly outside the damaged legislature on their Facebook page on Wednesday. \u201cPolice will certainly follow up and bring the culprits to justice for any unlawful acts,\u201d the force said in a statement. Police also arrested a 31-year-old man for assaulting police, criminal damage, forcible entry and disorderly conduct in a public place for his role on 1 July and and an earlier protest in June when thousands of demonstrators had gathered around police headquarters to voice concerns over police violence. On 12 June, police fired 150 rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets at a mostly peaceful crowd. Another eight people were arrested earlier on Wednesday for releasing personal information of police officer\u2019s online, including phone numbers and addresses. Officers were harassed with late night phone calls and threatening text messages. Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has asked to meet with the city\u2019s university students, her office said on Thursday. The student union at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, one of the eight major higher education institutions, turned down the request, saying that the city\u2019s leader had requested a closed-door meeting and that any dialogue must be open to all. Meanwhile, police also arrested people at a rally in support of police on 30 June. Five men and one woman were arrested for possessing offensive weapons, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, common assault and fighting in a public place. On Thursday, Chinese state media blamed meddling by Western governments for unrest in Hong Kong amid an escalating diplomatic spat between China and the United Kingdom the protests. \u201cIdeologues in Western governments never cease in their efforts to engineer unrest against governments that are not to their liking, even though their actions have caused misery and chaos in country after country in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia,\u201d the official China Daily said in an editorial. \u201cNow they are trying the same trick in China.\u201d Reuters contributed to this report",

      "bodyText": "Jill Scott said she and her England teammates endured a sleepless night after Tuesday\u2019s agonising semi-final defeat to the USA but added they are now determined to beat Sweden in Saturday\u2019s third-place play-off. It is something of a deja vu moment for the veteran midfielder, who collected a bronze medal in Canada four years ago. \u201cYou feel lower than a snake\u2019s belly,\u201d said Scott as she relaxed in the Mediterranean sunshine at England\u2019s latest beachside base, in Nice on Thursday. \u201cBut in a weird way 2015 felt like a bigger blow because we lost that semi-final to Japan with literally the last kick of the game. \u201cOne of my proudest moments, though, was the way that squad picked ourselves up and went and beat Germany in the play-off. I got my medal framed and, if we win this one, I\u2019ll get it framed too. I\u2019m devastated we haven\u2019t given the nation a final to look forward to but desperate to end this tournament on a high.\u201d Scott revealed she and the bulk of the squad spent Tuesday night sitting up having a post-mortem discussion. \u201cWith 11 million people at home watching on television you feel a kind of pressure,\u201d she said. \u201cThese bad moments don\u2019t get easier as you get older, in fact they hurt more because you know there\u2019ll be fewer future opportunities. \u201cLosing a semi-final is shattering; you\u2019re so low, but we\u2019ve got to somehow get ourselves back up and take something good out of this tournament. But I\u2019m not going to lie, it hurts and it\u2019s definitely going to hurt for a long time. \u201cI\u2019m not even over 2015, that still hurts, it really does. I\u2019m still gutted about Canada. It\u2019s the best job in the world but there\u2019s so many more lows than highs.\u201d With the passage of time, the 32-year-old Manchester City stalwart will surely be able to reflect on a personally excellent tournament in which Phil Neville selected her for every game and she proved one of England\u2019s outstanding individuals. While that second bronze medal is still to be secured Scott already has one memento: a black eye inflicted by a stray American elbow. \u201cI\u2019ve given out a few in my time so there will be a few girls in our league back home who think I\u2019m owed this one,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019ll take it, for them.\u201d",

In a move likely to be regarded as provocative by Corbyn\u2019s team, Watson is publishing a statement online, and inviting signatures, to underline the breadth of concern about Labour\u2019s stance. \u201cAs the party of remain, we will not take every voter with us, but it\u2019s the only way that Labour can win, and the only way to keep our country together,\u201d the statement says. Since the party\u2019s disastrous performance at the European elections in May, winning just 14% of the vote, Labour\u2019s position has already evolved. Corbyn has repeatedly said, including in the House of Commons, that any Brexit deal \u2013 or a no-deal Brexit \u2013 should be put to a public vote. He told Theresa May last week: \u201cWhoever the next prime minister is, they will barely hold the support of this house, so they certainly have no mandate to force a disastrous hard-right Brexit on this country. Whatever Brexit plan the new Tory leader comes up with, after three long years of failure they should have the confidence to go back to the people on a deal agreed by parliament.\u201d But Watson is among those members of the shadow cabinet who would now like to see Corbyn go further, and commit his party to campaigning for remain in a second referendum. Some of Corbyn\u2019s closest allies, including Diane Abbott and John McDonnell, have also said they want to see a shift, with the issue cutting across the traditional left-right divide within the party. Corbyn has insisted that he is still consulting on the issue; and has privately pointed to the historical lessons of the Harold Wilson government. Wilson formally backed continued membership of the European Community in the 1975 referendum; but took a back seat during the campaign, and allowed his cabinet to campaign on opposing sides. One of those then urging a leave vote was Corbyn\u2019s lifelong political hero, Tony Benn. Corbyn\u2019s spokesman has said a firm position is likely to be reached before MPs leave Westminster for the summer recess later this month. If the new stance is not resolutely anti-Brexit, Labour campaign groups including Love Socialism Hate Brexit are readying themselves for a summer of action before the party\u2019s conference in September. It was last year\u2019s conference in Liverpool where the \u201ccomposite motion\u201d, which first put the option of a referendum \u201con the table\u201d as part of Labour policy, was hammered out. But a number of MPs and members of the shadow cabinet, including Jon Trickett and Ian Lavery, continue to have profound concerns about the party embracing a remain position. They point out that the Brexit party represents a threat to Labour, as well as the anti-Brexit Lib Dems. A YouGov poll for the Times this week put Labour in fourth place behind both those parties, and the bitterly-divided Conservatives, on 18% of the vote. Watson\u2019s statement says: \u201cLabour\u2019s democratic tradition confers on us an obligation to win elections. Without power we can achieve nothing.

      "body": "<p>England have unveiled their official Rugby World Cup jersey but the debate continues over exactly who will wear the new shirt in Japan. Eddie Jones says three places in his 31-man squad, to be finalised on 12 August, are still up for grabs and 38 players have been invited to attend the latest camp in Teddington, starting on Sunday.</p> \n<p>The most striking name on the long list is Joe Marler, who announced his retirement from Test rugby last September for family reasons. The Harlequins loosehead prop has now rescinded that decision and confirmed to the world via Twitter that he is looking forward to \u201cgiving it another crack\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/04/david-pocock-closing-on-wallabies-return-with-rugby-world-cup-in-sight\">David Pocock closing on Wallabies return with Rugby World Cup in sight</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>No one doubts Marler\u2019s scrummaging ability or the steely edge that has earned him 59 caps for England and 2017 Lions tour selection but his commitment to his growing family had led him to suggest he would feel uneasy about leapfrogging rivals such as Ben Moon or Ellis Genge should he feature at the World Cup having declined to be involved last season. Such reservations, it seems, have now been set aside. \u201cWhen he suggested he wanted to come back we were happy to accept the change of mind,\u201d said Jones, adding he is \u201cconvinced\u201d Marler is ready to play.</p> \n<p>The ball, in other words, is back in Marler\u2019s court. Having become a father for the third time last month, Marler has clearly had other priorities lately but Jones is now challenging him \u201cto show us what he has got\u201d. For his teammates, there will be no problem in welcoming the 28-year-old back into the fold. \u201cSomeone like Joe is great in the team environment,\u201d said the scrum-half Ben Youngs. \u201cI\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t have come back without some kind of coping mechanism to make sure he doesn\u2019t beat himself up for being away.\u201d</p> \n<p>When he does check back in, Marler will find a fair amount has changed in his absence. Jones could scarcely have made it much clearer that Dylan Hartley\u2019s knee problem has scuppered his prospects \u2013 \u201cHe did a great job for us as captain and that\u2019s not forgotten but you have got to be fit to play in the World Cup\u201d \u2013 and the bell also looks to have tolled for Chris Robshaw, Danny Care, Mike Brown, Richard Wigglesworth and the perennially unlucky Dan Robson.</p> \n<p>Nor is there any room for younger candidates such as Alex Lozowski, Alex Dombrandt, Ollie Thorley and Ollie Devoto. Instead, with a promotional strapline of \u201cRising Sons\u201d to reinforce his message, Jones has picked four uncapped players. The New Zealand-born Willi Heinz is his third scrum-half, the Saracens-bound Jack Singleton is the third hooker and Bath\u2019s fleet-footed Ruaridh McConnochie is in the back three ahead of Brown. Northampton\u2019s Lewis Ludlam has also edged into the back-row frame, although his plane ticket to Tokyo remains far from confirmed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ce3bd681-448f-4d32-bc03-a27b7d09f390\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Forwards:</b> <b>Dan Cole</b> (Leicester Tigers, 85 caps);&nbsp;<b>Luke Cowan-Dickie</b> (Exeter Chiefs, 11 caps);&nbsp;<b>Tom Curry</b> (Sale Sharks, 10 caps);&nbsp;<b>Charlie Ewels</b> (Bath Rugby, 10 caps);&nbsp;<b>Ellis Genge </b>(Leicester Tigers, 9 caps);&nbsp;<b>Jamie George</b> (Saracens, 37 caps);&nbsp;<b>Maro Itoje</b> (Saracens, 27 caps);&nbsp;<b>Joe Launchbury </b>(Wasps, 58 caps);&nbsp;<b>Courtney Lawes</b> (Northampton Saints, 71 caps);&nbsp;<b>Lewis Ludlam</b> (Northampton Saints, uncapped);&nbsp;<b>Joe Marler</b> (Harlequins, 59 caps);&nbsp;<b>Ben Moon</b> (Exeter Chiefs, 8 caps);&nbsp;<b>Brad Shields</b> (Wasps, 8 caps);&nbsp;<b>Kyle Sinckler</b> (Harlequins, 22 caps);&nbsp;<b>Jack Singleton </b>(Saracens, uncapped);&nbsp;<b>Sam Underhill </b>(Bath Rugby 9 caps);&nbsp;<b>Billy Vunipola</b> (Saracens, 41 caps);&nbsp;<b>Harry Williams</b> (Exeter Chiefs, 17 caps);&nbsp;<b>Mark Wilson </b>(Sale Sharks, 13 caps).</p>\n    <p><b>Backs:</b> <b>Danny Cipriani</b> (Gloucester Rugby, 16 caps);&nbsp;<b>Joe Cokanasiga</b> (Bath Rugby, 4 caps);&nbsp;<b>Elliot Daly</b> (Saracens, 30 caps);&nbsp;<b>Owen Farrell</b> (Saracens, 70 caps);&nbsp;<b>George Ford</b> (Leicester Tigers, 55 caps);&nbsp;<b>Piers Francis</b> (Northampton Saints, 4 caps);&nbsp;<b>Willi Heinz</b> (Gloucester Rugby, uncapped);&nbsp;<b>Jonathan Joseph</b> (Bath Rugby, 40 caps);&nbsp;<b>Jonny May</b> (Leicester Tigers, 45 caps);&nbsp;<b>Ruaridh McConnochie</b> (Bath Rugby, uncapped);&nbsp;<b>Henry Slade</b> (Exeter Chiefs, 22 caps);&nbsp;<b>Ben Spencer</b> (Saracens, 3 caps);&nbsp;<b>Ben Te\u2019o</b> (unattached, 18 caps);&nbsp;<b>Manu Tuilagi</b> (Leicester Tigers, 32 caps);&nbsp;<b>Anthony Watson</b> (Bath Rugby, 33 caps);&nbsp;<b>Ben Youngs</b> (Leicester Tigers, 85 caps).</p>\n    <p><b>In camp for rehabilitation:</b> <b>George Kruis</b> (Saracens, 32 caps);&nbsp;<b>Jack Nowell </b>(Exeter Chiefs, 33 caps);&nbsp;<b>Mako Vunipola</b> (Saracens, 53 caps).</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Rejection may also still await Danny Cipriani, although he is still deservedly in the hunt for a final squad berth after an outstanding domestic campaign.

England will still have three warm-up games after their final squad announcement so, statistically, a couple of chosen squad members may be cruelly disappointed.</p> \n<p>For now George Kruis, Jack Nowell and Mako Vunipola remain confident of being involved as they continue their injury rehabilitation, while Kyle Sinckler is due to have a fitness test on his injured hamstring on Friday. The pristine new Canterbury kit may have been launched but a few niggling doubts still linger.</p>",

      "bodyText": "England have unveiled their official Rugby World Cup jersey but the debate continues over exactly who will wear the new shirt in Japan. Eddie Jones says three places in his 31-man squad, to be finalised on 12 August, are still up for grabs and 38 players have been invited to attend the latest camp in Teddington, starting on Sunday. The most striking name on the long list is Joe Marler, who announced his retirement from Test rugby last September for family reasons. The Harlequins loosehead prop has now rescinded that decision and confirmed to the world via Twitter that he is looking forward to \u201cgiving it another crack\u201d. No one doubts Marler\u2019s scrummaging ability or the steely edge that has earned him 59 caps for England and 2017 Lions tour selection but his commitment to his growing family had led him to suggest he would feel uneasy about leapfrogging rivals such as Ben Moon or Ellis Genge should he feature at the World Cup having declined to be involved last season. Such reservations, it seems, have now been set aside. \u201cWhen he suggested he wanted to come back we were happy to accept the change of mind,\u201d said Jones, adding he is \u201cconvinced\u201d Marler is ready to play. The ball, in other words, is back in Marler\u2019s court. Having become a father for the third time last month, Marler has clearly had other priorities lately but Jones is now challenging him \u201cto show us what he has got\u201d. For his teammates, there will be no problem in welcoming the 28-year-old back into the fold. \u201cSomeone like Joe is great in the team environment,\u201d said the scrum-half Ben Youngs. \u201cI\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t have come back without some kind of coping mechanism to make sure he doesn\u2019t beat himself up for being away.\u201d When he does check back in, Marler will find a fair amount has changed in his absence. Jones could scarcely have made it much clearer that Dylan Hartley\u2019s knee problem has scuppered his prospects \u2013 \u201cHe did a great job for us as captain and that\u2019s not forgotten but you have got to be fit to play in the World Cup\u201d \u2013 and the bell also looks to have tolled for Chris Robshaw, Danny Care, Mike Brown, Richard Wigglesworth and the perennially unlucky Dan Robson. Nor is there any room for younger candidates such as Alex Lozowski, Alex Dombrandt, Ollie Thorley and Ollie Devoto. Instead, with a promotional strapline of \u201cRising Sons\u201d to reinforce his message, Jones has picked four uncapped players. The New Zealand-born Willi Heinz is his third scrum-half, the Saracens-bound Jack Singleton is the third hooker and Bath\u2019s fleet-footed Ruaridh McConnochie is in the back three ahead of Brown. Northampton\u2019s Lewis Ludlam has also edged into the back-row frame, although his plane ticket to Tokyo remains far from confirmed. Rejection may also still await Danny Cipriani, although he is still deservedly in the hunt for a final squad berth after an outstanding domestic campaign. Jones is not ruling anything out \u2013 \u201cI am eager to see how he goes\u201d \u2013 but a fair amount of jiggling will be required to take a third specialist fly-half unless untimely injuries intervene. England will still have three warm-up games after their final squad announcement so, statistically, a couple of chosen squad members may be cruelly disappointed. For now George Kruis, Jack Nowell and Mako Vunipola remain confident of being involved as they continue their injury rehabilitation, while Kyle Sinckler is due to have a fitness test on his injured hamstring on Friday. The pristine new Canterbury kit may have been launched but a few niggling doubts still linger.",

And he said that during Johnson\u2019s first term in office, from 2008 to 2012, he was getting extra money, first from the Labour government and then from the coalition anxious not to cut police numbers before the London Olympics. Khan went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So the cuts to London\u2019s police numbers really began in earnest in 2012, and it takes some time for the cuts in preventative services to see the light of day.

But his criticism applied not just to Hunt, but to a proposal that could also be adopted by Boris Johnson, the favourite in the Tory leadership contest.</p> \n  <p>The government was meant to publish a green paper on adult social care last year, but it has been endlessly delayed and now the key decisions will be taken by the next prime minister. Johnson has said very little about how he would tackle the adult social care crisis, but Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who is one of his leading backers, has previously floated<a href=\"https://www.cityam.com/social-care-funding-crisis-could-solved-new-pensions-style/\"> the idea of getting more money into the system through an opt-out insurance model,</a> where people would automatically save for social care insurance, unless they chose to opt out.</p> \n  <p>In his Today interview Hunt said he also favoured a system that would involve people saving to fund their own social care. Accepting that councils needed more money for adult social care, Hunt said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>But we also need a system where people are encouraged and incentivised to save for their social care costs for when they got older, when they are much younger, as happens with pensions. We need a system where almost automatically people are saving up for their social care costs. And that\u2019s a long-term change that I would like to make.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Forsyth told the programme later that this approach would not work. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve looked at insurance, and we\u2019ve looked at having an opt-in system, as we have with pensions, which Jeremy Hunt mentioned earlier. And it simply doesn\u2019t work. Fortunately most of us are not going to require crisis care at the end of our lives, or during our working lives. And therefore, as the insurance industry [said in evidence to us] - our report is entirely based on the evidence received - it\u2019s a very hard sell to persuade people to put aside money for something that they think may not happen to them.</p> \n   <p>And there\u2019s huge ignorance. Local Government Association research which was given to us shows that as much as 48% of the country don\u2019t actually know what social care means, and more than a quarter think that it\u2019s provided free on the NHS.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>What is particularly significant about this is that Forsyth is no centrist or leftie. When he was Scottish secretary in the 1990s Forsyth was perceived as a hardline rightwinger and he told my colleague <strong>Patrick Butler</strong> this week that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/04/peers-call-for-extra-8bn-to-tackle-social-care-scandal\"> he still saw himself as a Thatcherite Tory.</a></p> \n  <p>But, on social care at least, Forsyth seems to have discovered socialism. <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201719/ldselect/ldeconaf/392/392.pdf\">The report from the Lords economic affairs committee (pdf)</a> that he chairs calls for adult social care to get an extra \u00a315bn - an immediate \u00a38bn to address the current shortfall, followed by an extra \u00a37bn a year to extend NHS-style free personal care to all by 2025 - with the money coming from general taxation. Forsyth told the Guardian:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I support reducing tax and controlling public expenditure. But this is the minimum requirement to provide a decent standard of care in our country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The committee\u2019s report also explains in more detail why the insurance modelled favoured by leading Tories like Hunt would not work. It says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No country relies primarily on private insurance to fund adult social care costs. In the current system, establishing a market for long term social care insurance in England would be difficult, even with a cap on lifetime social care costs or accommodation costs or an auto-enrolment scheme. Private insurance cannot provide the amount of funding required by the social care system, not least because roughly half of public social care funding is currently spent on people who are working-age.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"567eefaee0e006abf108078054cd9579fdbeddde\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/567eefaee0e006abf108078054cd9579fdbeddde/44_0_1152_691/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Forsyth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Forsyth</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-04T14:13:59.836Z\">at 3.13pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d1dd2e18f08c35bf8032fc3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-04T10:23:37.839Z\">11.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the light of Jeremy Hunt\u2019s comments about foxhunting, <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> is urging people to sign a Labour petition saying the ban should be maintained.

Hunt included the caveat that this would only happen when there was a probable majority for repealing the ban in the Commons, but he implied that this might happen if the Conservatives were to win a majority. \u201cAs soon as there was a majority of parliament that would be likely to repeal the foxhunting ban, then I would support a vote in parliament,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/04/jeremy-hunt-promises-vote-on-repeal-of-foxhunting-ban\">Jeremy Hunt promises vote on repeal of foxhunting ban</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>Traditional Tories were horrified when Labour passed a foxhunting ban, and amongst party members repeal is almost certainly a popular cause. But amongst the public at large the prospect of the law being changed to legalise a sport that involves dogs tearing foxes to pieces is toxic. During the 2017 general election campaign the Conservatives were surprised when what they thought was a tame restatement of their 2015 election position (allowing a free vote on repeal) became a major issue of social media, mobilising many voters to support anti-Tory candidates. Hunt is pitching himself as the leadership candidate most able to win an election for the party by appealing to floating voters, and so having this around his neck was a problem. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexwickham/status/1146539053367603205\">One Tory MP backing Hunt described it as \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d.</a></p> \n  <p>And so this morning Hunt clarified his position. Without entirely retracting what he told the Telegraph, he said the law on foxhunting would not change because he could not envisage there ever being a majority in favour in the Commons. Asked about what he said to the Telegraph, he told the Today programme:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, I think this is just because I was giving a straight answer to a straight question. But the law is not going to change on fox hunting. There isn\u2019t a majority in the House of Commons, and I don\u2019t see there ever being one. I was just restating the position in our manifesto from 2017 that there should be a free vote if it ever looked like that majority would change. But it would not be my priority as prime minister.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hunt\u2019s analysis is probably correct. Almost all the MPs in the Commons who support foxhunting are Conservatives, but there are plenty of Tories who would vote against repeal of the ban and the working assumption amongst campaigners is that there would have to be a very large Conservative majority in the Commons for the restoration of foxhunting to have any chance of passing.</p> \n  <p>The Today interview was awkward for Hunt. He repeatedly dodged a question about whether he viewed foxhunting as cruel, and instead he tried to switch the conversation to other things he might do for rural communities, like extend broadband. But he probably succeeded in defusing the hunting row.</p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>After 10.30am: </em>Mel Stride, the leader of the Commons, makes a statement in the Commons on next week\u2019s business.</p> \n  <p><em>Afternoon:</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/03/may-to-warn-successor-greatest-duty-is-to-strengthen-union\">Theresa May gives a speech in Scotland on the importance of strengthening the union.</a></p> \n  <p>As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on the Tory leadership contest and Theresa May\u2019s speech.

We\u2019re closing this live blog down now \u2013 you can read a summary of the prime minister\u2019s speech on Scotland and the union here and a summary of the day\u2019s earlier developments here. And, if you\u2019d like to read a comprehensive take on this evening\u2019s Tory leadership hustings, my colleague Peter Walker has duly obliged: Hunt is asked whether the mandatory foreign aid target should be abolished and that money spent within the UK by a member of the audience who notes that some military veterans are in need. \u201cOh dear, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re not going to like the answer I\u2019m going to give now,\u201d Hunt says. While he says he wants to help veterans, he points out that some countries are \u201cmuch, much worse off than us\u201d and says he wants to reform the way the money\u2019s spent, rather than scrap foreign aid. And that\u2019s all from Jeremy Hunt. Here\u2019s a little more detail on Hunt\u2019s proposals on social care. He said: I do think that councils need more money to discharge their responsibilities on social care. I also think we need to take more responsibilities ourselves. Just as we save for a pension throughout our lives, I think we need to create incentives for people to save for their social care costs as well. He said the government should also consider incentives to encourage people to look after elderly relatives in the family home. There are 420,000 households in our country that are three-generation households where granny, mum and dad and the kids all live under the same roof. I think that is a good thing. I am not saying we all want to live with our mother-in-law. But I think that three-generation families are a wonderful thing. If you look at Spain and Italy, where they spend less on social care than us but they don\u2019t have a social care crisis, is because they are societies that hold families together. As the party of the family, I think we should look to see if we could introduce incentives for that as well. Hunt signals that he would keep the help to buy policy and says he will \u201cgo further\u201d, with a scheme called \u201cright to own\u201d. Under that, he says, young people would be gifted land and would have to pay the cost of building a house on it themselves. Hunt tells the audience says Brexit is the \u201cultimate test\u201d of British democracy, indicating that many foreign nations are looking to see whether or not the UK government will enact the referendum result. He says it\u2019s important to \u201cunderstand the fears of the 48%\u201d and says Brexit will not be a case of saying \u201cforeigners are not welcome\u201d in the UK. It will not be, he says, a \u201cUkip Brexit\u201d. He had been asked by a member of the audience it was acceptable for MPs to ignore their constituents\u2019 votes in the referendum. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not,\u201d he responded, before acknowledging that a majority of his own constituents voted to remain (as he did himself), while he now advocates leaving. There are lots of constituencies where more people voted Remain, my constituency is one of them. But we didn\u2019t say we were going to take this decision constituency by constituency, we said we were going to take this decision as a country and 52% voted to leave. Hunt says he\u2019s in favour of greater devolution of powers in England, saying it would help the north of the nation in particular. Hunt is asked what are the \u201cserious consequences\u201d with which he has threatened China if freedoms are watered down in Hong Kong. He says it\u2019s an \u201cimportant question to ask\u201d but one that no foreign secretary would ever answer. He says he expects China to abide by the one country, two systems programme and says consequences would follow if it does not. The foreign secretary says he is a supporter of encouraging three generations of families to live together in a bid to cut social care costs \u2013 with one generation looking after the other. Hunt is asked straight away about repealing the hunting ban. He says he would vote for it but that pursuing repeal wouldn\u2019t be his priority as prime minister. He\u2019s asked why, then, he decided to make what is a fairly unpopular position public. Hunt tells the audience he gave a \u201cstraight answer to a straight question\u201d when asked about the issue and \u2013 in what sounds like another dig at Johnson over his character \u2013 Hunt says he\u2019s not one of the politicians who gives different answers to different audiences. Hunt opens with a joke about confusing China and Japan, then moves swiftly to Brexit. He says there\u2019s very little distance between him and Johnson on the issue and then repeats his claim that the question is who\u2019s best placed and most trusted to get a deal. That line about trust has been widely interpreted at a thinly veiled dig at his opponent, who has faced serious questions about his character. That\u2019s it from Boris Johnson \u2013 Jeremy Hunt is about to take the stage. Asked about privatising the rail industry, Johnson says the way to improve the system is to \u201cfind the right arse to kick\u201d. He says there\u2019s no accountability currently and says transport bosses should \u201cpay the political price for failing to deliver\u201d. On the environment, Johnson says the commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 is \u201cambitious but it can be done\u201d. He says the UK is a leader in \u201cbattery technology\u201d and says he would back offshore wind turbines and solar technology to produce a greater share of the UK\u2019s energy in order to meet the target. Johnson backs cutting corporation tax and business rates, which he claims will boost the UK economy. But he refuses to say whether he will match Jeremy Hunt\u2019s plan to push corporation tax as low as 12.5%. Asked whether such cuts are prudent, Johnson says he believes that cutting some taxes can bring in greater revenues because the cuts give an incentive to increase production. Johnson also picked a fight with large online firms \u2013 such as Google, Amazon and Facebook \u2013 who he says must be forced to pay more tax. The former foreign secretary signals that he supports the rights of demonstrators in Hong Kong to protest and calls on China to adhere to the one country, two systems principle. China has accused the UK of meddling in internal affairs over the latter\u2019s support for the demonstrators. Johnson tells the audience he\u2019s \u201cnot remotely attracted\u201d to the possibility of proroguing Parliament in order to force through Brexit. There\u2019s significant support among audience members, it must be said, for proroguing when the question is put to them. But he stays firm in his position. An audience member asks Johnson what his plan is to address drug, gun and knife crime. Johnson says \u201ckey nominals\u201d of county lines gangs need to be \u201crounded up\u201d and that the nation needs to \u201cbe backing the police\u201d. Johnson repeats his line about reducing knife crime during his time as mayor \u2013 citing his backing for stop and search. He says \u201cyou cannot fudge the murder rate\u201d and that it was reduced by 50% during his tenure. While the rate did fall by a significant margin \u2013 though by nowhere near as much as Johnson claims \u2013 it then rose again during his time as London mayor. Johnson is asked what he\u2019d do as prime minister to ensure northern England gets a fairer share of funding. He says he\u2019d back funding for transport and look at devolving some powers to smaller regions. On Scottish independence, Johnson claims he puts the union before Brexit \u2013 but says no Scottish voter would be able to support a UK government that does not push through Brexit after being asked to in the referendum. Therefore, he says, Brexit \u2013 which poses a serious potential existential threat to the union as it exists \u2013 has to happen in order to save the union. Johnson is asked if he\u2019s aware he\u2019s canvassing people under investigation over allegations of Islamophobia. Johnson, who has compared Muslim women in burqas to \u201cletterboxes\u201d and \u201cbank robbers\u201d in the past, says the Tory party welcomes people from every ethnic group and faith. He adds: Ages ago, when I was standing to be mayor, I was asked something like this and I said: \u2018I ban all racists from voting for me\u2019. And he gets a round of applause for saying it\u2019s also important to protect freedom of speech. Boris Johnson is on the stage at the Tory hustings in York. He says his mission is to \u201cprotect\u201d the UK from a Corbyn-led government. To do that, he says, he\u2019ll \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by 31 October. He repeats his lines about \u201ccreative ambiguity\u201d on the \u00a339bn the UK has agreed to pay as it withdraws and leaving the Irish border question until after Brexit has happened. Johnson also claims he wants to do for transport in the north of England what he \u201cdid for Crossrail\u201d. Crossrail was, of course, due to open in December 2018 and now looks likely to be delayed until 2021. The cost has also risen from \u00a314.8bn to \u00a317.6bn. Jeremy Corbyn has been furious about a report in the Times last week that said some civil servants were speculating about his mental and physical capacity to be prime minister. The Labour leader wrote to the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, to demand an investigation \u2013 a request that was granted \u2013 and the two have since held a meeting. Asked today how that went, Corbyn said: A very clear, very firm meeting. I said to him that we are proud to have a civil service that is independent, that respects democracy and doesn\u2019t make public comment on its political views. Somebody from the civil service or a group of people crossed the line and decided to make nonsensical claims about me. It\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s about our political system and I said to Mark Sedwill we want an assurance that the civil service will be democratic, will abide by decisions of the people and will work for whoever is elected into government. He assured me they would do that, he assured me there would be a very robust inquiry now into whoever made these comments to the relevant newspapers and that those people would face disciplinary action under the civil service code. Here are the main points from Theresa May\u2019s speech in Scotland. May warned her success not to opt for an Irish border plan that would undermine the Good Friday agreement. (See 6.03pm.) She accused the SNP government of being unwilling to cooperate with the UK government to make devolution work because it prioritises its separatist agenda. She said: It is telling that during the discussions over legislative consent for the EU withdrawal bill, after intense discussions and give and take on both sides, the Welsh government was willing to making a compromise, whereas the Scottish government was not. Over the last three years I have learned that while other parties can be relied on to work with the UK government in good faith to make devolution a success, an SNP Scottish Government will only ever seek to further the agenda of separation. That, I am afraid, is simply a fact of political life in the UK at the moment. She said today \u201cthe only threat to devolution comes from those parties who want to end it by breaking up the United Kingdom.\u201d She said federalism would not work in the UK. Many of those who advocate a federal UK are equally well-intentioned, but I believe are also in the wrong track. England makes up over 80% of the UK population. There is no example of a federal state anywhere in the world where one of the units of the federation is so large. The UK simply does not lend itself to federation as a sustainable constitutional model. The only way it could realistically be achieved would be by breaking England up into artificial regional units \u2013 something I would never support and for which I detect no appetite. She announced a review into what the UK government could do to strengthen the union. We need to work more cleverly, more creatively and more coherently as a UK government fully committed to a modern, 21st century union in the context of a stable and permanent devolution settlement to strengthen the glue that holds our union together. There have been several reviews into how devolution works. But we have never thought deeply about how we make the union work \u2013 how we ensure that as we fully respect devolution, we do not forget the UK government\u2019s fundamental duty to be a government for the whole United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. That is why I have asked Andrew Dunlop to lead an independent review into the structures of the UK government to ensure that they are set up to realise fully all the benefits of being a United Kingdom. Lord Dunlop has a wealth of experience from his time in Government as an advisor and minister and I look forward to reading his report. Of course it will be for my successor to respond to his recommendations, and I am delighted that both candidates are supportive of the review. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. This is what Theresa May said in her speech about the need for her successor not to undermine the Good Friday agreement. (See 5.25pm.) She said: At the heart of the Belfast agreement, which enabled the people of Northern Ireland to move beyond that past into a shared future, was a compromise. That people who identify as Irish can live in Northern Ireland but, to all intents and purposes, operate across the whole of Ireland in their day to day lives and in their business activities without any semblance of a border. That compromise was enabled by having a seamless border. The backstop insurance policy we agreed with the EU, which would have been activated only if we were unable to agree our new relationship within the implementation period, respected that compromise. And the future relationship will need to respect it. It will be for my successor to resolve that issue and I will not today seek to provide any advice on the matter. I will simply say this. There can and must be no false choice between honouring the solemn commitments of the Belfast agreement and delivering on the decision of the British people in the EU referendum. We must do both. May\u2019s decision to speak out on this point may have been prompted by hints that Boris Johnson, her likely successor, will propose an alternative to the backstop that will involve some extra checks for traders in Ireland and Northern Ireland, only not at the border. This was the implication of the recent report from the Alternative Arrangements Commission (pdf). The Telegraph\u2019s Peter Foster explored this idea in a recent article, and here is an extract. Mr Johnson chose his own words in Belfast very carefully. He stated that the withdrawal agreement was dead \u201cas it stands\u201d and promised that there \u201cwill be no physical checks or infrastructure at the border in Northern Ireland\u201d. A great deal rides on that small word \u2018at\u2019 - note that Mr Johnson does not promise the absence of \u201cchecks or infrastructure\u201d, only that they would not be \u2018at\u2019 the border. It is clear where this is heading from a report last week proposing \u2018Alternative Arrangements\u2019 for the border co-authored by Shanker Singham, a pro-Brexit trade specialist who is likely to feature in Mr Johnson\u2019s team of top advisers. It calls for a raft of measures - from digital customs forms, geo-tracking vehicles and mobile veterinary inspections - that will, as Mr Singham admits, require checks and controls, just not at the border. The EU has already expressed scepticism ... [The Irish government] argues that checks are absolutely the issue in a borderland which would actively resist the imposition of any such checks in the name of an \u2018English\u2019 Brexit that they never voted for. May challenges a journalist who asks about increased support for independence. She says the SNP actually lost support at the 2017 election. And that\u2019s it. The speech and Q&amp;A are over. I will post a summary soon. Q: What advice would you give to your successor about dealing with Nicola Sturgeon? May criticises Sturgeon for dismissing her speech before it was even delivered. Sturgeon should focus on day to day issues that matter to people in Scotland, she says. Q: Which of your successors will be best for the Tories in Scotland? May refuses to answer. Q: You accept Gordon Brown\u2019s analysis about the state of the union. So when will there be another independence referendum? May says the the SNP government should stop obsessing about independence and focus on governing. Q: Is there an explicit threat to the union from no-deal? May says she has always stressed the need to maintain the union. She thinks her successor will want to do the same. Q: Will no-deal end the union? And is that a risk worth taking? May says she thinks the government can deliver Brexit and strengthen the union. May says not enough thought has gone into how the UK government supports the union. She says she has asked Lord Dunlop, a government minister, to review what more the UK government can do to ensure that it works in a way that strengthens the union. It will be for her successor to take this work forward, she says. But she says both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt support the idea. May says the SNP accused her of using Brexit to claw back powers from Holyrood. She says that claim was \u201cabsurd\u201d. But it also showed how complicated implementing Brexit would be. She says the Welsh government was willing to compromise with the UK government over how powers being repatriated from Brussels would be distributed. But the Scottish government was not, she says. She says that is because, while others are willing to work with Westminster, the SNP government is not. An SNP Scottish government will only ever seek to further the agenda of separation. That is a fact of political life in the UK at the moment. May says the Irish border, and the need to protect it, was a major obstacle to getting a Brexit deal agreeing. She defends the \u201cbackstop insurance policy\u201d, saying it respected the compromise in Ireland agreed by the Good Friday agreement. She says it will be for her successor to find a solution. But she says there must be no \u201cfalse choice\u201d between respecting the Belfast agreement (her term for the Good Friday agreement - the unionst term) and delivering Brexit. Any solution must do both, she says. May says her successor must not advocate an Irish border policy that would put the Good Friday agreement at risk. May says delivering a Brexit that protects all parts of the UK has been a priority for her. She says her failure to achieve this is a source of regret. May says safeguarding the union will take longterm work. Two things are essential, she says. First, the government has to deliver Brexit. And, second, the government must do more to bind together the different countries of the UK. May says she attended the D-day commemorations. She says there is no better example of the nations of the United Kingdom achieving something by working together. And she says the bail-out of the banking system after the 2008 crash was only possible because of the size of the UK economy. May says the Scottish independence referendum was meant to settle the matter for a generation. But Nicola Sturgeon asked for another vote just three years later. May says she said no because she thought that was wrong. It will be for her successor to decide what to do next, she says. BBC News are giving up on their live coverage of the May speech after about 10 minutes. But there is a live feed at the top of the blog. Theresa May is speaking now. She says that when Gordon Brown spoke recently about the United Kingdom union being more at risk than at any time in the last 300 years, he spoke for many people. Theresa May will be giving her speech on devolution in Scotland soon. According to an extract released in advance, she will say: I am confident that whoever succeeds me in 10 Downing Street will make the nnion their priority. He will be building on work done over the last three years, during which time strengthening the union has become an explicit priority of government. The job of prime minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland brings with it privileges and responsibilities which you only really feel once the black door closes behind you. One of the first and greatest is the duty you owe to strengthen the Union. To govern on behalf of the whole United Kingdom. To respect the identities of every citizen of the UK \u2013 English and Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish. And to ensure that we can go on facing the future together, overcoming obstacles together, and achieving more together than we ever could apart \u2013a union of nations and people. Election strategists are forever coining new terms to describe the electoral demographic they are targeting: Mondeo man, Worcester woman, hardworking families, the JAMs (\u2018just about managing\u2019) etc. They are not always exactly the same people, but they are roughly, and it is easier just to call them floating voters. But now, in an interview with the Spectator, Boris Johnson has coined a new term for this constituency: Oppidan Britain. It\u2019s a university term for townie, but, as James Forsyth and Katy Balls explain in their interview, it is more specifically an Eton term. Here\u2019s the key extract from their article. The salvation of the Tory party, [Johnson] says, will be focusing on the wider problems exposed by Brexit. \u2018Loads of people in parts of rural Britain or urban, Oppidan Britain found a sense that their lives and their futures weren\u2019t as important,\u2019 he says. \u2018That is totally wrong. There is a big, big opportunity to bring the country together.\u2019 So he\u2019s pitching himself as the candidate for the disenfranchised rural folk and city dwellers of Britain. The word \u2018Oppidan\u2019 of course has resonance among Etonians. Boris was a King\u2019s Scholar there (the non-scholars are called Oppidans) and a pitch for the \u2018left-behind\u2019 Oppidans of the Tory party might literally mean reaching out to David Cameron, Rory Stewart and Oliver Letwin (all Oppidans). Dominic Raab spent more than \u00a350,000 on Facebook advertising during his failed bid for the Tory leadership, more than all his rivals combined, PoliticsHome reports. Here\u2019s a question from below the line that it would be helpful to answer up here. This was listed on the agenda yesterday, but I did not see any reporting of the judgment, and so I did not post on it. But you can read the full judgment here. And the New European has got a summary here. It\u2019s \u2018pose with an animal\u2019 day on the Tory campaign trail. Boris Johnson has been visiting a farm in Yorkshire. And Jeremy Hunt is in Surrey. At Tory leadership election hustings Boris Johnson is fond of saying he reduced knife crime in the capital when he was mayor of London, and that it is now rising again under his successor, Sadiq Khan. In an interview on LBC this morning Khan, the Labour mayor, was asked to defend his record. He said that knife crime has been going up across the whole country, not just in London. And he said that during Johnson\u2019s first term in office, from 2008 to 2012, he was getting extra money, first from the Labour government and then from the coalition anxious not to cut police numbers before the London Olympics. Khan went on: So the cuts to London\u2019s police numbers really began in earnest in 2012, and it takes some time for the cuts in preventative services to see the light of day. You don\u2019t overnight, when you close youth centres, see crime going up. ... The point is this: violent crime did start going up in 2014 onwards and one of the reasons is the cuts started biting then, not just in London but across the country. The Local Government Association, the cross-party body which represents councils in England and Wales, has challenged the government to publish its green paper on adult social care within the next 10 weeks. Responding to the report from the Lords economic affairs committee report for an NHS-style system of free personal care, funded by the taxpayer, the LGA also offered to host cross-party talks on finding a solution to the funding crisis. In a statement Ian Hudspeth, the Conservative leader of Oxfordshire council council and chair of the LGA\u2019s community wellbeing board, said: Councils are having to make incredibly difficult decisions within tightening budgets and cannot be expected to continue relying on one-off funding injections to keep services going. What is needed is funding certainty for both the immediate and long-term. That is why the government needs to commit to meeting our 10-week deadline, before the party conferences start, to finally publish its much-delayed and long-awaited green paper outlining what the future funding options and possible solutions to this crisis are. Local government stands ready to host cross-party talks to kick-start this process and make sure we get the answers and certainty we need, so that people can continue to receive essential care and support. Jeremy Corbyn has joined those criticising the prospect of George Osborne replacing Christine Lagarde as head of the International Monetary Fund. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, has told the World at One that a no-deal Brexit would make the break-up of the United Kingdom more likely. Asked if the UK could survive as one country in the event of no-deal, he replied: I think the UK would be under much greater strain in the event of a no-deal. Lidington also said the union was under greater strain than at any point in his lifetime. He went on: The threat to the union, in my view, comes not just from Scottish nationalism, or pressure for Irish unification, it comes from indifference amongst English opinion to the value of the union. I think there is a sense in which we take the union for granted. And sometimes I think there are too many people in England, including in my party, who assume that you can be dismissive of the contribution that Scotland or Northern Ireland makes. Lidington was speaking ahead of May\u2019s speech in Scotland on devolution, which is due at about 5pm. Ann Widdecombe, the Brexit party MEP and former Tory minister, has been branded \u201coffensive\u201d and a \u201cclown\u201d after likening EU membership to slavery. Jeremy Hunt, the underdog in the Tory leadership contest, has said the ban on foxhunting will not be repealed. He had to clarify his position after he provoked anger with an interview implying the ban might by lifted under his premiership if the Tories won a majority at the next election. (See 9.08am.) Hunt\u2019s plan to end the funding crisis in adult social care has been described as unworkable by Michael Forsyth, the Tory peer who chairs a Lords committee that has just published a report on the topic. (See 12.05pm.) Germany will stand fully in \u201csolidarity\u201d with Ireland over Brexit, the country\u2019s president has said, and look to \u201cunderpin rather than undermine\u201d the peace process that has kept the border with Northern Ireland invisible in the past 20 years. Hunt has refused to rule out imposing sanctions on China and expelling its diplomats in an escalating row over Hong Kong. George Osborne\u2019s interest in running the International Monetary Fund has met immediate criticism because of the former Chancellor\u2019s austerity policies and Brexit-related question marks over the UK\u2019s international standing. Conservative donors have spent lavish sums on hunting trips and champagne parties at a fundraising auction attended by the prime minister, Theresa May, and her potential successors, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt. Policing is under huge strain, struggling to meet rising demand and radical reform is needed, Sir Tom Winsor, the chief inspector of constabulary, has said. And here is the Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan on Ann Widdecombe. This is from Nick Boles, the former Conservative MP now sitting as an independent, who says some of those praising Boris Johnson in the media have been scathing about him in private. Here is Labour\u2019s David Lammy on the Ann Widdecombe speech. Here is video of the Ann Widdecombe speech. (See 1.19pm.) Here is a transcript. Guy Verhofstadt, the Belgian MEP and former prime minister who is the European parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman, has described Widdecombe as a \u201cclown\u201d. The former Conservative minister Ann Widdecombe likened the UK\u2019s departure from the EU to the emancipation of slaves, as she became the first Brexit party MEP to speak in the new European parliament, my colleague Daniel Boffey reports. Sir Tom Winsor, the chief inspector of policing, has suggested that Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to hire an extra 20,000 police officers may not be the most efficient use of money. Johnson is proposing to spend an extra \u00a31.1bn funding the pledge, which would see 20,000 extra officer in place by 2022. Presenting his annual state of policing report, Winsor welcomed the proposal, but suggested the money could be better spent. Asked if he welcomed the proposal, he replied: Yes. High-risk, high-harm crimes are on the increase. Street violence is a very significant problem. Police are having to cope with new patterns of crime and complexity. But when asked if it was too simplistic proposal Winsor said: It\u2019s certainly simple but it may not be the most effective way of spending on policing. I\u2019m not for a moment saying we don\u2019t need more cops and police staff. I\u2019m sure Boris Johnson doesn\u2019t expect people to believe there will be 20,000 police officers on the streets by Christmas. That just would be the case. A good rule of polling is that, if a poll result looks sufficiently unusual to be newsworthy, it is probably wrong. That\u2019s why today\u2019s YouGov poll, which puts Labour in fourth place, on 18%, behind the Tories, the Brexit party and the Lib Dems, might not be quite as disastrous for the party as it looks. The Times, which has splashed on the figures, says since the 1940s Labour has only one before sunk this low, in May 2009, at the height of the banking crisis. But another rule of polling is that it is, if you look at trends over a series of polls, they are a reliable guide to shifts in opinion. This confirms what almost all polling has implied since the European election, that Britain is becoming a four-way marginal. As YouGov explains in its write-up: Broadly speaking, this is a continuation of the trend we have seen over the past few months of a movement away from two-party politics and towards a fairly even four-way split between Labour, Conservative, Lib Dems and the Brexit Party. In the most recent poll 57% of Labour 2017 voters now say they would vote for another party, with 28% going to the Lib Dems, 15% moving to the Greens and 10% moving to the Brexit party. Meanwhile 47% of Conservative 2017 voters also now say they will vote for another party, with most of that (38%) going to the Brexit party and a further 6% moving to the Lib Dems. In a statement released by the People\u2019s Vote campaign, which wants a second referendum on Brexit, the Labour MP Phil Wilson said: Day after day, poll after poll shows the dismay among voters over Labour\u2019s failure to offer a clear and principled position backing a final say referendum. So long as the doubt and confusion continues over whether it will support a final say on any Brexit outcome - and on whether it will campaign to stay in the EU - Labour will continue to shed votes to parties like the Liberal Democrats. This is refreshing. In normal circumstances government ministers don\u2019t criticise each other in public. But discipline was breaking down anyway during the Brexit crisis, the Tory leadership contest created even more discord - it is impossible to have an election without disagreement - and this morning Caroline Dinenage, a health minister, has raided the Lib Dem lexicon to let us know what she thinks of Liz Truss, chief secretary to the Treasury. Dinenage was responding to this tweet from Truss, a libertarian ultra who is supporting Boris Johnson. Dinenage explained her thinking her. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has stepped up its criticism of the two Tory leadership candidate over their failure to provide proper costings for their spending plans. Paul Johnson, the IFS director, told the Press Association: While the two candidates have put forward tens of billions of pounds worth of proposals to increase spending and cut taxes, they have provided no sense at all of what their overall fiscal strategy would be, what level of deficit and debt they would be happy with, or how they would deal with the problems of long term fiscal sustainability as set out by the Office for Budget Responsibility. This is not currently a grown up discussion or strategy, it is a little more than a random throwing of sweeties at the children. Jeremy Hunt\u2019s plan for tackling the adult social care crisis won\u2019t work, according to the Tory peer who chairs a Lords committee that has just published a major report on the topic (pdf). Michael Forsyth - or Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, to use his full title - was speaking on the Today programme this morning not long after Hunt spoke about social care in his own interview. But his criticism applied not just to Hunt, but to a proposal that could also be adopted by Boris Johnson, the favourite in the Tory leadership contest. The government was meant to publish a green paper on adult social care last year, but it has been endlessly delayed and now the key decisions will be taken by the next prime minister. Johnson has said very little about how he would tackle the adult social care crisis, but Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who is one of his leading backers, has previously floated the idea of getting more money into the system through an opt-out insurance model, where people would automatically save for social care insurance, unless they chose to opt out. In his Today interview Hunt said he also favoured a system that would involve people saving to fund their own social care. Accepting that councils needed more money for adult social care, Hunt said: But we also need a system where people are encouraged and incentivised to save for their social care costs for when they got older, when they are much younger, as happens with pensions. We need a system where almost automatically people are saving up for their social care costs. And that\u2019s a long-term change that I would like to make. But Forsyth told the programme later that this approach would not work. He explained: We\u2019ve looked at insurance, and we\u2019ve looked at having an opt-in system, as we have with pensions, which Jeremy Hunt mentioned earlier. And it simply doesn\u2019t work. Fortunately most of us are not going to require crisis care at the end of our lives, or during our working lives. And therefore, as the insurance industry [said in evidence to us] - our report is entirely based on the evidence received - it\u2019s a very hard sell to persuade people to put aside money for something that they think may not happen to them. And there\u2019s huge ignorance. Local Government Association research which was given to us shows that as much as 48% of the country don\u2019t actually know what social care means, and more than a quarter think that it\u2019s provided free on the NHS. What is particularly significant about this is that Forsyth is no centrist or leftie. When he was Scottish secretary in the 1990s Forsyth was perceived as a hardline rightwinger and he told my colleague Patrick Butler this week that he still saw himself as a Thatcherite Tory. But, on social care at least, Forsyth seems to have discovered socialism. The report from the Lords economic affairs committee (pdf) that he chairs calls for adult social care to get an extra \u00a315bn - an immediate \u00a38bn to address the current shortfall, followed by an extra \u00a37bn a year to extend NHS-style free personal care to all by 2025 - with the money coming from general taxation. Forsyth told the Guardian: I support reducing tax and controlling public expenditure. But this is the minimum requirement to provide a decent standard of care in our country. The committee\u2019s report also explains in more detail why the insurance modelled favoured by leading Tories like Hunt would not work. It says: No country relies primarily on private insurance to fund adult social care costs. In the current system, establishing a market for long term social care insurance in England would be difficult, even with a cap on lifetime social care costs or accommodation costs or an auto-enrolment scheme. Private insurance cannot provide the amount of funding required by the social care system, not least because roughly half of public social care funding is currently spent on people who are working-age. In the light of Jeremy Hunt\u2019s comments about foxhunting, Jeremy Corbyn is urging people to sign a Labour petition saying the ban should be maintained. It is a good example of how foxhunting works for Labour as a campaigning issue, because petitions allow parties to harvest email addresses that can be used in the future. Germany will stand fully in \u201csolidarity\u201d with Ireland over Brexit, the country\u2019s president has said, and will look to \u201cunderpin rather than undermine\u201d the peace process that has kept the border with Northern Ireland invisible in the last 20 years. Frank-Walter Steinmeier told Ireland\u2019s president Michael Higgins, who is on a state visit to Germany, that Berlin \u201cstands firmly by Ireland\u2019s side\u201d, raising questions about Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson\u2019s optimism that the Irish border backstop can be revisited. Steinmeier said: Politically and economically, Ireland is more directly affected by Brexit than any other EU member state, for this reason, too, your country has our full solidarity. We have reiterated this pledge in recent months: Germany stands firmly by Ireland\u2019s side. The European Union\u2019s value and internal cohesion have rarely been so plain as during the withdrawal negotiations. Ireland is part of this union. And Ireland\u2019s core interests are and will remain the EU\u2019s core interests. His remarks come just days after Conservative party leader contender Jeremy Hunt claimed he had assurances from the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to \u201clook at\u201d his plan to strike a new Brexit deal if he won the keys to Number 10. This is from my colleague Peter Walker. This is from the Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan, who does not seem to have been listening to the Today programme at 8.10. (See 9.08am.) In an interview with Sky News Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, admitted that a no-deal Brexit could lead to a recession. Asked if he could rule it out, he replied: Well, no. As a former Treasury minister no one can ever rule out what could happen in the future. But Barclay stressed that that the government did not want a no-deal Brexit. And he said that some claims about what might happen in the event of no-deal were exaggerated. As an example, he cited claims that food prices might rise by 10%. When it was put to him that this figure came from a leaked letter written by Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, Barclay replied: Firstly, the figure that was initially put out from the Bank of England [about the impact on food prices] said 5 to 10% on some food. Only 30% of our food, it\u2019s worth remembering comes from the EU; 70% doesn\u2019t. [The figure] was put out before the trade flows improved. It was put out before we announced what our tariff schedules would be. So my point is, you get a figure like that put out saying it would be 10% when it was some food, it was [5 to 10%], it was before a number of things changed and people worry about a 10% figure which is quite a misleading figure for what the expectation really is. In his Today interview Jeremy Hunt, who is combining being a Tory leadership candidate at the moment with his day job of being foreign secretary, said there was \u201cno reason\u201d why Britain could not continue to have good relations with China despite the dispute over Hong Kong. He said: We have good relations with China ... there\u2019s no reason why that can\u2019t continue. But, for us, it is very important that the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 approach is honoured. He also refused to say what he meant when he warned that there could be be \u201cserious consequences\u201d if China failed to honour the terms of the 1984 joint declaration signed with the UK on Hong Kong. Asked if these serious consequences could include sanctions, he replied: I\u2019m not saying anything about what those consequences might be - that would not be the right thing for me to do as foreign secretary, because, of course, you keep your options open. But I am making the point that the United Kingdom views this situation very, very seriously. Sue Hayman, the shadow environment secretary, has criticised Jeremy Hunt for refusing to accept that foxhunting is cruel in his Today interview this morning. (See 9.08am.) She said: It is incredible and shocking that Jeremy Hunt, who aspires to be the next prime minister, can not bring himself to even acknowledge the barbaric cruelty of fox hunting. Once again it shows this Tory government\u2019s lack of understanding and sincerity on issues of animal welfare. There is overwhelming support in both rural and urban areas for keeping the ban on fox hunting that Labour was proud to bring in and will strengthen in government. In the inteview Hunt was asked three times whether fox hunting is cruel, but he sidestepped the question each time. He said: My view is a matter of public record ... I\u2019m here to talk about the things I want to change as prime minister - that is not something that\u2019s going to change. Hunt had not been elected as an MP when the hunting bill was passed in 2004, but he has said he opposes the ban. But he also told the Today programme he had never hunted himself, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not my thing.\u201d Jeremy Hunt has until now been running a better-than-expected campaign for the Tory leadership - if any party members are changing their mind after watching hustings, they seem more likely to be switching to Hunt than to Boris Johnson - but yesterday he made a rare error when he told the Daily Telegraph that he would support a free vote on repealing the ban on foxhunting and that he personally would vote to bring it back. Hunt included the caveat that this would only happen when there was a probable majority for repealing the ban in the Commons, but he implied that this might happen if the Conservatives were to win a majority. \u201cAs soon as there was a majority of parliament that would be likely to repeal the foxhunting ban, then I would support a vote in parliament,\u201d he said. Traditional Tories were horrified when Labour passed a foxhunting ban, and amongst party members repeal is almost certainly a popular cause. But amongst the public at large the prospect of the law being changed to legalise a sport that involves dogs tearing foxes to pieces is toxic. During the 2017 general election campaign the Conservatives were surprised when what they thought was a tame restatement of their 2015 election position (allowing a free vote on repeal) became a major issue of social media, mobilising many voters to support anti-Tory candidates. Hunt is pitching himself as the leadership candidate most able to win an election for the party by appealing to floating voters, and so having this around his neck was a problem. One Tory MP backing Hunt described it as \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d. And so this morning Hunt clarified his position. Without entirely retracting what he told the Telegraph, he said the law on foxhunting would not change because he could not envisage there ever being a majority in favour in the Commons. Asked about what he said to the Telegraph, he told the Today programme: Well, I think this is just because I was giving a straight answer to a straight question. But the law is not going to change on fox hunting. There isn\u2019t a majority in the House of Commons, and I don\u2019t see there ever being one. I was just restating the position in our manifesto from 2017 that there should be a free vote if it ever looked like that majority would change. But it would not be my priority as prime minister. Hunt\u2019s analysis is probably correct. Almost all the MPs in the Commons who support foxhunting are Conservatives, but there are plenty of Tories who would vote against repeal of the ban and the working assumption amongst campaigners is that there would have to be a very large Conservative majority in the Commons for the restoration of foxhunting to have any chance of passing. The Today interview was awkward for Hunt. He repeatedly dodged a question about whether he viewed foxhunting as cruel, and instead he tried to switch the conversation to other things he might do for rural communities, like extend broadband. But he probably succeeded in defusing the hunting row. Here is the agenda for the day. After 10.30am: Mel Stride, the leader of the Commons, makes a statement in the Commons on next week\u2019s business. Afternoon: Theresa May gives a speech in Scotland on the importance of strengthening the union. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on the Tory leadership contest and Theresa May\u2019s speech. I plan to publish a summary at lunchtime and then another when I finish. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Not only was Nadal knocked KO\u2019d by Kyrgios when the Australian enigma <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/01/nick-kyrgios-rafael-nadal-wimbledon-2014\">gatecrashed the quarter-finals as a Wimbledon debutant in 2014</a>, the Spaniard<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/16/nick-kyrgios-slams-cringeworthy-djokovic-and-salty-nadal-ahead-of-french-open\"> felt the full force of his rival\u2019s tongue</a> a few months ago, when he was accused of being a sore loser and \u201csuper salty\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s gracious only when he wins,\u201d cussed Kyrgios. \u201cHe\u2019s my polar opposite, like literally my polar opposite. Every time I\u2019ve beaten him ... when he wins, it\u2019s fine. He won\u2019t say anything bad, he\u2019ll credit the opponent: \u2018He was a great player.\u2019 But as soon as I beat him, it\u2019s just like: \u2018He has no respect for me, my fans and no respect to the game.\u2019 It\u2019s not a good look. And then Uncle Toni came out saying: \u2018He lacks education.\u2019 I\u2019m like: \u2018Bra, I did 12 years at school, you idiot. I\u2019m very educated. I understand that you\u2019re upset I beat your family again.\u2019\u201d</p> <p> Hostilities will be renewed in the third match on Centre Court today, after Cameron Norrie and Johanna Konta\u2019s matches, something of a scheduling surprise given that another Brit, Jay Clarke, is playing none other than Roger Federer and that\u2019s over on No 1 Court, where Serena Williams and Petra Kvitova are also on the bill. Eyebrows have also been raised at the decision to put the world No 1 and French Open champion, Ashleigh Barty, on No 2 Court, along with the defending champion, Angelique Kerber. Completing the lineup there is the British No 3, Dan Evans, who is continuing his tale of redemption after a drugs ban, and Marcos Baghdatis, the charismatic Cypriot and 2006 semi-finalist whose story will come to an end today if Italy\u2019s Matteo Berrettini puts him into retirement. </p> <p>Elsewhere, Harriet Dart takes British numbers in the singles to five, Sloane Stephens, John Isner, Sam Querrey and Amanda Anisimova are among the American contingent in action on the 4th of July, while Marin Cilic, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Kiki Bertens play too.</p> <p>And last but certainly not least, Andy Murray, back at Wimbledon after two years away, complete with a career-saving metal hip that has probably had security machines ringing around these heavily fortified and guarded grounds, begins his bid to make doubles the new singles. He and Pierre-Hugues Herbert take on Herbert\u2019s fellow Frenchman Ugo Humbert and Romania\u2019s Marius Copil in the first round, while his brother, Jamie, also begins his campaign. The Murrays could meet in round three. As for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/03/andy-murray-serena-williams-wimbledon\">Andy and Serena show</a>, their mixed doubles courtship will commence on another day. But given today\u2019s super schedule, there\u2019s more than enough to keep us going. </p> <p><strong> Play begins at</strong>: 11am BST on the outside courts/1pm BST on the show courts.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for today. Thanks for reading/emailing/tweeting etc. I\u2019ll leave you with Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report on the match of the day. Do join me for more of the same tomorrow. Bye! Murray will play in the second round of the men\u2019s doubles on Saturday, but he\u2019ll be back on court tomorrow when he begins his much-anticipated mixed doubles campaign with Serena Williams. Murray and Herbert are only a game away now, with Herbert serving for a place in the second round at 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, 5-0. Fittingly it\u2019s Murray who settles matters at the net on the second match point. The No 1 Court rise to their feet to salute their returning champion. Two years after leaving Wimbledon in such pain, it\u2019s so good to have a healthy Murray back. The British-French pairing are now steamrolling through the fourth set, leading 4-0. And here\u2019s that Kyrgios underarm serve for your viewing pleasure: Andy Murray and Herbert, gaining confidence it seems with every game, break at the start of the fourth. But Herbert, who has the strangest of service motions, bending his knees low and waving his racket a few times before tossing the ball up, then struggles to get through on his serve. After a deuce or two or three he and Murray eventually back up the break for 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, 2-0. Jamie Murray and Skupski wrap up the third 6-3 and play is suspended in the fading light. Andy Murray and Herbert, who now seem to be finding an understanding in their first match together, take the third set 6-4. The roof is being closed on No 1. Meanwhile Jamie Murray and Skupski look set to secure a two sets to one lead too, they\u2019re 5-3 ahead in the third. Some other snippets: On Nadal saying he could win a slam: \u201cI know what I\u2019m capable of. Just depends. I\u2019m a great tennis player, but I don\u2019t do the other stuff. I\u2019m not the most professional guy. I won\u2019t train day in, day out. I won\u2019t show up every day. So there\u2019s a lot of things I need to improve on to get to that level that Rafa brings, Novak, Roger have been doing for so long. Just depends how bad I want it. But, no, at the moment I don\u2019t think I can contend for a grand slam.\u201d On Bernard Tomic\u2019s fine: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with fining the guy all of his prize money. He earned his right to be in the draw. He played the whole year. He\u2019s obviously winning enough to be at the most prestigious tournament in the world. To take all his prize money I think is outrageous. I just hope Bernard is all right.\u201d On Andy Murray\u2019s return: \u201cI saw he\u2019s in, like, a tight battle at the moment in doubles. It\u2019s just good to see him around. I saw him in the locker room. We had a bit of banter. It\u2019s just good to see him. He had five pairs of shoes. I was like, chill. A bit nervous to be back on court. No, he\u2019s good. I\u2019m just happy to see him back. It\u2019s good to have him around. He\u2019s a good guy.\u201d Kyrgios admitted in his press conference that he deliberately hit Nadal with the ball in that spiky third set. \u201cYeah, I was going for him. Yeah, I wanted to hit him square in the chest. Why would I apologise? I mean, the dude has got how many slams, how much money in the bank account? I think he can take a ball to the chest, bro. I\u2019m not going to apologise to him at all.\u201d Andy Murray, meanwhile, having been in some doubles trouble after losing the first set, appears to have wrested control. He and Pierre-Hugues Herbert lead Marius Copil and Ugo Humbert 4-6, 6-1, 5-3, while Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski are tied at a set apiece in their match with Ivan Dodig and Filip Polasek. The flamboyant Fabio Fognini took three hours and 23 minutes to defeat Frances Tiafoe in round one and he\u2019s now needed three hours and 38 minutes to overcome Hungary\u2019s Marton Fucsovics, 6-3 in the deciding set. The Italian \u2013 the only other seed remaining in Nadal\u2019s quarter \u2013 will next play Tennys Sandgren of the US, who was also extended to five sets, overcoming the French veteran Gilles Simon 8-6. And with that, today\u2019s men\u2019s singles matches come to an end. Kyrgios, meanwhile, has gone straight to the press conference room: The victor speaks. And he\u2019s even got some praise for his rival: A tough opponent. I was aware of everything [Kyrgios\u2019s complaints to the umpire], I was just next to him. I don\u2019t want to comment on this. Right now it\u2019s an important victory for me. Sometimes it\u2019s tough to see a couple of things on court. It\u2019s amazing how good he\u2019s able to play. If he\u2019s able to forget about all this stuff, potentially he\u2019s a grand slam winner and fighting for the sport\u2019s best ranking. 4-2 turns into 5-3, so it\u2019s as you were. Kyrgios goes for the one-two punch but he knocks himself out with an errant forehand. 6-3, three match points. Nadal bounces the ball, fiddles with his shorts, and bounces the ball some more for good measure. Kyrgios\u2019s backhand slumps into the net and Nadal has defeated his nemesis! Given hostilities calmed a little in that fourth set, Nadal\u2019s celebration isn\u2019t perhaps quite as animated as it would have been an hour or so ago, but he still looks mightily pleased to have got through that. Nadal holds. Ready for another tie-break? Of course you are! A shocking start for Kyrgios as she makes an absolute hash of the smash. So Nadal already has the mini-break, which he consolidates when Kyrgios\u2019s effort goes wide. 2-0. And now Kyrgios is tanking. He doesn\u2019t even move his feet and pats into the net. 3-0. He does at least rally for 3-1 and then 3-2, with ace No 29. But it\u2019s 4-2 at the change of ends as Kyrgios again fails to properly chase down the ball, which he slaps so gently it bounces at least twice before slumping into the net ... \u201cI remember Nadal being wound up by Soderling at Wimbledon many years ago,\u201d says Steve Peters. \u201cHe did it much more subtly though - mimicking Nadal\u2019s routines/ticks before a point.\u201d That sneaky Swede. Meanwhile Nadal holds, again Kyrgios is under pressure at 30-all on his serve ... and again the Australian comes up with an ace backed up by another winner. Kyrgios, having stopped raging at the umpire at every opportunity, is a picture of near calm. And those are words I never thought I\u2019d type. Kyrgios leads 6-5. Right, let\u2019s get back to Centre, where the fourth set is starting to come to the boil, though thankfully Kyrgios is managing to keep a lid on his emotions. Kyrgios is serving at 4-4, 30-15. Nadal nudges to 30-all. A huge point. If Kyrgios were to lose it, Nadal would have a break point which, if he won, would leave him serving for the match. Kyrgios casually fires down an ace. And grabs the next point too for 5-4. So now there\u2019s a bit of pressure on Nadal, who\u2019ll need to hold serve to prolong this set. Murray has taken the first set. But it\u2019s not that one. Jamie and Neal Skupski lead Croatia\u2019s Ivan Dodig and Slovakia\u2019s Filip Polasek 6-2. As for Andy, he and Pierre-Hugues Herbert are three set points down, trailing 5-4, 40-0 against France\u2019s Ugo Humbert and Romania\u2019s Marius Copil. The former world No 1\u2019s forehand misfires and that\u2019s the set. I, for one, can\u2019t understand the crowd\u2019s reaction to those underarm serves. Why applaud the first and then boo the second? The fickle lot. \u201cI agree with Abijhato,\u201d says Mark Woldin. \u201cIf one wishes to condemn underarm serves then one would have to condemn panenka penalty shots and baseball change-ups. In fact, tennis servers do change up serve speeds, so there you are. \u201cWhile we\u2019re at it: Why need a player apologise for hitting his opponent if he struck from the baseline? His opponent was not helplessly vulnerable. He has the time to defend himself. He won\u2019t be hurt or injured. The etiquette concerns an occasion when both are at the net and one player has his opponent at his mercy.\u201d Williams\u2019s win, by the way, means the women\u2019s second round is complete. A few results that got missed amid the madness: Kiki Bertens, the fourth seed, defeated Taylor Townsend 6-2 in the third set; Belinda Bencic, Switzerland\u2019s biggest female talent since Martina Hingis, eased past Estonia\u2019s Kaia Kanepi in straight sets; but defeat for the American Amanda Anisimova. The 17-year-old stormed to the semi-finals of the French Open last month but she\u2019s stalled going from red to green, losing 6-4, 7-5 to Poland\u2019s Magda Linette. The fourth instalment of Nadal v Kyrgios is very much the calm after the third-set storm. Both are moving along on serve with \u2013 by the standards of this match, at least \u2013 little fuss. So it\u2019s Nadal 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (5), 2-2 Kyrgios. Next up for Evans in the third round is Portugal\u2019s Joao Sousa who, in some quirk of the draw, he\u2019s playing in the men\u2019s doubles right now. Evans and his British partner Lloyd Glasspool are locked at a set all against Sousa and Argentina\u2019s Leonardo Mayer. Emotional scenes on No 2 Court, where Marcos Baghdatis\u2019s colourful career has ended in a 6-1, 7-6 (4), 6-3 defeat to the Italian 17th seed Matteo Berrettini. The 34-year-old Cypriot was a surprise semi-finalist here back in 2006 but will be best remembered for his run to the Australian Open final the same year. \u201cI don\u2019t get the uproar against underarm serves,\u201d emails Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cThey\u2019re quite a clever way of punishing your opponents for exploiting the baseline while also keeping them on their toes. Since it can\u2019t be overused, people shouldn\u2019t be so worried and talk about the lack of an ambiguous sportsman\u2019s spirit. Most professionals in the sport would instead do well to create real strategies and practice returns to such ingenious improvisation from the likes of Nick.\u201d This just about sums it up: Seriously though, what a pulsating encounter. I\u2019m not sure I can remember seeing Nadal so wound up by an opponent before. The constant fist pumps and jumps of his early career are back in full force this evening. How will Kyrgios, having produced such a high level of tennis in that third set, recover from losing it? Does he fancy going five sets? The early signs are good as he holds at the start of the fourth courtesy of three aces, though the highlight was a quite ridiculous point with Kyrgios attacking, Nadal defending, Kyrgios attacking, Nadal defending, Kyrgios attacking and Nadal defending some more before suddenly launching his own attack with a wicked winner down the line. It\u2019s Nadal 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (5), 0-1 Kyrgios. Thanks Michael. So I haven\u2019t missed anything, have I?! Phew, what a match. Katy Murrells will take you through the rest of it (as well as all the other games including Murray\u2019s doubles match on Court 1). Enjoy! Nadal wins the second set 7-6 (4)! He leads Kyrgios two sets to one! Kyrgios slinks back to his chair with his head bowed, he\u2019ll have to take it to five sets if he wants to win this one. Nadal still has the one mini-break, though, and after a few points on serve, he has a serve to win the second set \u2026 One of the most impressive things about Kyrgios strokeplay is the way he can generate so much power, even when his feet aren\u2019t set correctly. So much of forehand power comes from your core, and Kyrgios often doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s ready to hit the ball \u2013 but then despatches one down the line at close to 100mph. Unreal. 5-3 to Nadal. Kyrgios scrambles back to 2-4 for the changeover \u2013 one that takes Nadal a good minute to complete (much to Kyrgios\u2019s annoyance) \u2013 but then Nadal gets a second mini-break, Kyrgios sending one just long as he scampered into the net. 5-2 to Nadal. Nadal is the first to get the mini-break in the tie-break, a flat backhand finds the corner, right up in the postage stamp. A loose backhand from Kyrgios and a Nadal ace gives the veteran some breathing room. 4-1 up to the Spaniard, that is only Nadal\u2019s sixth ace of the match. Kyrgios does indeed hold \u2013 winning the game with second-serve ace \u2013 and it\u2019s off to the tie-break we go! Kyrgios\u2019s dad, drenched in sunlight in the player\u2019s box, is a happy man, wolf-whistling and cheering his son on. Both Kyrgios and Nadal hold their own serves, to take the scores to 5-6. The Australian will serve to take this to a third-set tie-break. With Serena finished on Court 1, her mixed doubles partner, Andy Murray, takes to the grass with his other doubles partner, Pierre-Hugues Herbert. That\u2019s an unexpected and pleasant surprise for all the fans on Court 1, who let out shrieks of anticipation. You can read Kevin Mitchell\u2019s preview of this match right here. With the scores at 4-4 in the third set, there are more fireworks on Centre Court! With Nadal at the net, Kyrgios fires a fierce forehand right at the body of the Spaniard to win the point. It was right on the edge of being legal, but the point stands and Nadal sends absolute daggers across the net with his eyes, as if to say: \u201cOK, you\u2019re dead now.\u201d Nadal is fired up now, and recovers from break point down to win the game with a series of blurry baseline strokes, celebrating game point with a huge roar and leap. We never see Nadal like this! He\u2019s so pumped, almost as though he\u2019s just won the match! 5-4 to Nadal, and Kyrgios will serve to stay in the set. \u201cThe matador sees red,\u201d says Boris Becker on BBC commentary, who doesn\u2019t quite seem to have grasped the mechanics of bullfighting. Julia Goerges will be Serena\u2019s opponent in the next round. That is a repeat of last year\u2019s semi-final. Serena sees it out with an ace! That was a nervy win in parts, but you have to give her credit for coming back from one set down. Juvan was playing incredibly well, despite her I thought Juvan played well. She was really reading the returns. I started out a little slow. Pressure bring the best out of me. I play best when I\u2019m down sometimes. I\u2019m just a fighter that never gives up. On playing with Andy Murray in the mixed doubles: I\u2019m excited to be playing with a British icon like Andy. Maybe I can learn a thing or two. At 40-0 up, Kyrgios plays an audacious between-the-legs shot when a simple one would have sufficed. It\u2019s pure showboating, the sort of thing you might see down the park. Another loose volley at the net brings the scores to 40-30 \u2013 suddenly that circus shot isn\u2019t looking so clever \u2013 but Kyrgios sees out the game to make it 3-3. Juvan has broken Serena! This one isn\u2019t done yet. The Slovenian is still 3-5 down in the deciding step, but she certainly still has huge energy and a smile on her face. Serena is pulling away against Kaja Juvan, serving for the set at 5-2 in the third. Victory looks to be secured, but what a scare the seven-time champion here has had today. It\u2019s on serve, by the way, one set all, 3-2 to Nadal with Kyrgios to serve. More controversy with Nadal and Kyrgios. The Spaniard challenges a service call, and the ball was just about ruled to be in, clipping the last millimetre of the line. Kyrgios\u2019s return was out \u2013 he hit the ball at the same time as the line judge initially called it out \u2013 but because the serve is not ruled a valid one, Nadal is awarded the point on account of Kyrgios\u2019s return being no good. Understandably, Kyrgios is not happy, and more or less forfeits the rest of the game, before another heated discussion with the umpire, in which the Australian says: \u201cYou\u2019re a disgrace. You\u2019re a joke. Bro, you\u2019re nobody in the scheme of things. You\u2019re not important.\u201d This is getting a bit close to the bone. Lauren Davis, a 5ft 2in lucky loser who lost in qualifying that has just beaten the defending champion, Angelique Kerber, has had a microphone thrust in front of her face. \u201cI am so happy to win, it is almost surreal. This means everything as it is what I work for.\u201d That\u2019s Kerber\u2019s earliest exit since 2013, she practically sprinted off Court 2 when she lost. Kyrgios launches another tirade at the umpire, this time regarding the warning for unsportsmanlike conduct he received at the end of that second set for saying something as Nadal wound up for a serve. He really doesn\u2019t need to do this, work himself up into a frenzy, when he\u2019s playing sublime tennis and has just won the set. That said, maybe all this hot chat fires him up? His topspin forehands have been an average of 5mph quicker since he was given the warning. The crowd, incidentally, cheered when Krygios got that code violation. They seem to be favouring Nadal. Meanwhile, on No 1 Court, Serena has refound her own poise and won the second set against Kaja Juvan, the 18-year-old qualifier ranked 133 in the world. Now that Serena is back on level terms, this one is not a foregone conclusion. Juvan is holding her serve in the deciding third set, it\u2019s 2-1 there. This is exhibition stuff from Kyrgios! He lost his head, but has somehow found it again and is busy ripping 101mph winners \u00ba and deft drop shots at the net \u2013 to break Nadal back again! It\u2019s 5-3 to Kyrgios in the second set, and he will serve for the set! Kyrgios is in danger of losing it, and I\u2019m not just talking about the last two games. Nadal held his serve, finishing the game with a ridiculous forehand down the line and then broke Kyrgios\u2019s serve to love, with the Australian trying and failing with a couple of questionable shot selections, a drop shot that was never on and a reaching volley that fell well wide of the tramlines. Kyrgios is very unhappy that Nadal\u2019s speed of play, on a number of occasions the former champion isn\u2019t ready to face Kyrgios\u2019s serve \u2013 doing that towel thing he does \u2013 and etiquette dictates that play should be dictated at the speed of the server, not the returner. Kyrgios is quite right to be angry, although he\u2019s very animated at taking the umpire to task over the changeover. Do it, then. Stop saying that you\u2019re going to do it, and do it. Stop talking to me and talk to him. It\u2019s only taking you guys 20 years to say something. So much power up there. Wow, look at you. Feels good for you, huh? Hello everyone. Really bizarre to hear those boos for Krygios\u2019s underarm serve. Let\u2019s all try to have a bit of fun, shall we? It\u2019s within the rules, and a bit unusual, but then so is a toilet break at the end of the first set, and Centre Court wasn\u2019t booing Nadal. Kyrgios holds for 4-1 but has the jeers of spectators ringing around his ears after another underarm serve. Williams holds for 4-2. And with that I\u2019ll hand over to Michael Butler, who\u2019ll be your guide for the next hour or so. See you later ... The Kyrgios chatter has quietened a little, he\u2019s got his game face on, and he\u2019s holding on to that break, leading 3-1 in the second set after losing the first 6-3. Williams is also still in possession of a second-set advantage, 3-2 up against Juvan as the seven-times champion fights to force a decider. With all this going on, I forgot to give you tomorrow\u2019s order of play. Cori Gauff is on Centre, in only her third grand slam match. No pressure, Cori. A smile but surely he was seething inside: Just as the momentum shifts on Centre, so it does on No 1, where Williams, having dropped the first set to Kaja Juvan, is a break up, 2-1, in the second. Kyrgios, having been made to pay for a slow start in the first set, is dialled-in at the beginning of the second. Leading 1-0, he gets to 0-30 on Nadal\u2019s serve. He goes for broke on a second-serve return. It doesn\u2019t come off. But his next effort, a forehand down the line, does and it\u2019s 15-40. Kyrgios has his first break points of the match. The pair go at each other\u2019s throats in a punishing rally, which Kyrgios finishes with another firecracker of a forehand down the line! Kyrgios has the break, 2-0. Nadal takes a toilet break between sets. Kyrgios continues to vent at the umpire. \u201cHe takes 40 seconds between every serve,\u201d says the Australian. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me to play within reason; he doesn\u2019t play within reason.\u201d Nadal will definitely not have taken kindly to that underarm ace. He responds by jamming a body serve into Kyrgios when he\u2019s serving for the set \u2013 that\u2019ll have felt good \u2013 which he follows up with a winning volley. It\u2019s first blood Nadal, 6-3. Meanwhile Williams has indeed lost that first set, 6-2. Lauren Davis, a 5ft 2in lucky loser who lost in qualifying, has put out no less than the defending champion, defeating Angelique Kerber 2-6, 6-2, 6-1. Just as I try to digest that, I\u2019m distracted. A 143 mph second-serve ace from Kyrgios ... followed by an underarm ace! Kyrgios\u2019s antics can be incredibly grating at times, but they can also be so fun. And while all of this is going on, Serena Williams is in danger of losing the first set to an 18-year-old qualifier ranked 133 in the world, trailing Kaja Juvan 5-2. Phew. While Kyrgios has already been in conversation with himself, the umpire and anyone else who\u2019ll listen about several perceived injustices, Nadal is just letting his tennis do the talking. 2-0 becomes 4-2. Nadal\u2019s been dominant on serve, winning 94% of first-serve points, and there\u2019s another love hold for 5-2. He strides purposefully to his chair, a game away from the first set after only 20 minutes. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga awaits the winner of this in round three. Meanwhile upset alert on No 2 Court: Angelique Kerber\u2019s title defence is in serious danger. The fourth seed trails Lauren Davis of the US 5-1 in the deciding set. Meanwhile surely Serena Williams won\u2019t suffer the same fate as her sister, Venus, losing to a teenage prodigy? The younger Williams is 3-0 down in the opening set against the 18-year-old Slovenian Kaja Juvan, who\u2019s a former girls\u2019 champion here. Nadal\u2019s perfectionist ways are in stark contrast to Kyrgios\u2019s unpredictability and the Spaniard, having lined up his water bottles and performed the rest of his pre-match tics and tricks, is ready to play. And he\u2019s most certainly ready. After holding serve to love, he charges to 0-30 on Kyrgios\u2019s serve. Kyrgios gets his first point on the board for 15-30 but a showdown between Nadal\u2019s backhand and Kyrgios\u2019s forehand ends when Kyrgios clunks into the net. 15-40, two break points. Kyrgios throws in his first tweener at 30-40, but it\u2019s not enough. Nadal breaks and it\u2019s 2-0. Next up on Centre it\u2019s the one we\u2019ve been waiting for, the Nadal v Kyrgios grudge match. These two really don\u2019t like each other very much, and here\u2019s the evidence: Exhibit A: Nadal is KO\u2019d by a 19-year-old Kyrgios at Wimbledon in 2014, as the Australian becomes the first player outside the top 100 to beat a world No 1 at a grand slam since 1992. Exhibit B: Nadal is incensed by Kyrgios\u2019s underarm serving at the Mexico Open this year, accusing his opponent of lacking respect. \u201cHe is a player who has enormous talent,\u201d says Nadal after a frosty handshake. \u201cHe could win grand slams and fight the top positions of the ranking, but there is a reason why he is where he is [then at a world ranking of No. 72].\u201d Kyrgios\u2019s reply? \u201cI can smell the blood when I play this dude.\u201d Exhibit C: Kyrgios lays into Nadal in an interview a few months later, accusing the Spaniard of being a sore loser and \u201csuper salty\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s gracious only when he wins,\u201d continues Kyrgios. \u201cHe\u2019s my polar opposite, like literally my polar opposite. Every time I\u2019ve beaten him ... when he wins, it\u2019s fine. He won\u2019t say anything bad, he\u2019ll credit the opponent: \u2018He was a great player.\u2019 But as soon as I beat him, it\u2019s just like: \u2018He has no respect for me, my fans and no respect to the game.\u2019 It\u2019s not a good look.\u201d Federer has glided through the third set and Clarke is serving to stay in it at 5-2 down. Make that 5-2 and 15-40 down. Clarke cuts himself into pieces on the first match point with an errant slice and Federer takes the applause of the worshipping crowd, who don\u2019t seem to mind that he\u2019s just beaten a British player. After the aberration of losing a set in the first round to the world No 86, Lloyd Harris, the eight-times champion has taken care of business in straight sets. Konta speaks: I\u2019m pleased I was able to hold serve the way I did. She\u2019s very tricky. I\u2019m pleased I came through that and I really enjoyed my time on Centre Court. I look to enjoy every opportunity I get to play at the Championships, I never take it for granted. When I step on to court against Sloane it\u2019s 50-50. She\u2019s one of the best players in the world. It\u2019s nice to play her on the grass. Konta clobbers an ace down the T for 30-15. And there\u2019s another for 40-15. Two match points. Konta nets after a fairly long rally on the first. Siniakova slips and Konta calmly puts a winner into the open court on the second! Konta\u2019s showing the form that got her to the semi-finals at Roland Garros. Meanwhile it\u2019s all too much for poor Siniakova who, after her tumble, tumbles out of Wimbledon and scurries off Centre Court in tears. Konta, meanwhile, is 6-3, 5-4 up against Siniakova and is about to serve to set up a third-round date against Sloane Stephens. That could be quite some match. Konta claimed a superb victory over Stephens at the French Open last month, a performance Chris Evert described as one of the best clay-court performances she\u2019d ever seen. You\u2019d have to say Konta is an even better player on grass than the red dirt \u2013 but Stephens will surely be looking to prove a point. Federer, having given Clarke what now appears to be false hope in this second set, has decided to get serious and leads 4-2 in the tie-break. Which in the blink of an eye becomes 6-2. That\u2019s five consecutive points. Clarke\u2019s serving on the first set point, and Federer\u2019s return flies out. Federer, however, is serving on the second, and he dismisses Clarke with an ace. Federer takes the tie-break 7-3 and leads 6-1, 7-6. You wouldn\u2019t blame Marin Cilic for wanting to draw a line under his 2019 season so far. The runner-up to Federer two years ago, seeded an unlucky 13th this time, has crashed out in straight sets to Portugal\u2019s Joao Sousa, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. Clarke, the world No 169, is still staying in touch with Federer in this second set at 5-all. At 30-all on Clarke\u2019s serve, you wonder whether this is the moment when Clarke will blink or Federer strikes, but two botched backhands from Federer and Clarke nudges 6-5 ahead. Federer secures a speedy hold and this set will be settled by a tie-break. Angelique Kerber is almost the forgotten defending champion given how quiet she\u2019s been of late, barring that Eastbourne final appearance last week. However the fifth seed is making smooth progress against Lauren Davis, leading 6-2. Meanwhile Davis\u2019s fellow American, Alison Riske, has edged out Serbia\u2019s Ivana Jorovic, 9-7 in the final set. Clarke is refusing to bow to Federer\u2019s sovereignty in the second set. Maybe the eight-times champion\u2019s kingdom doesn\u2019t extend as far as No 1 Court. It\u2019s 4-4, after Federer dominated the first set 6-1. Jose Mourinho\u2019s a busy man: With Konta in control at 5-2, Siniakova is serving to stay in the first set. There are chuckles around Centre when one of the spectators pulls off a catch that even Ben Stokes would be proud of. There\u2019s a fist pump from Siniakova when she holds to 15. But there\u2019s an even steelier fist pump from Konta when four points later she wraps up the set with a hold to love. Konta\u2019s in charge, leading 6-3. The current scores on the board: Centre: Konta has broken Siniakova to lead 4-1. No 1: Federer has glided through the first set against Clarke 6-1. No 2: The defending champion, Angelique Kerber, has come from a break down to go a break up, 4-2, against the American Lauren Davis. No 3: John Isner, the double marathon man after those matches in 2010 and 2018, is nearing his 673rd fifth set at Wimbledon. He leads Kazakhstan\u2019s Mikhail Kukushkin by two sets to one but Kukushkin is 5-1 up in the fourth. Court 12: Jose Mourinho is watching on as his Portuguese compatriot Joao Sousa storms to a surprise two-sets to love lead, 6-4, 6-4, against the teary finalist of two years ago Marin Cilic. Always unconventional, Nick Kyrgios yesterday warmed up for today\u2019s match with Rafael Nadal by having a hit with Carla Suarez Navarro and then doing down the Dog and Fox pub in Wimbledon. Whether this was the best preparation remains to be seen \u2013 Kyrgios will be on court after Konta \u2013 but it\u2019s certainly worked wonders for Suarez Navarro, who\u2019s wrapped up a 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4) win over France\u2019s Pauline Parmentier. Let\u2019s hope the next British player on Centre fares better. But Johanna Konta has a tough assignment against Katerina Siniakova, the Czech doubles whizz who beat Naomi Osaka at the French Open last month. Meanwhile on No 1, another Brit, Jay Clarke, is attempting to take inspiration from his mixed doubles partner Cori Gauff\u2019s giantkilling of Venus Williams as he tackles Roger Federer. The last time Federer lost to a home player at Wimbledon was in 2001 against Tim Henman, when Clarke was only two years old. The eight-times champion has dropped only one set to British players since, in the 2012 final against Andy Murray, and the GOAT doesn\u2019t look in the mood to be any more charitable today. Federer already leads the 20-year-old 3-0. Even though Evans has allezed his way to victory, he\u2019ll never be as cosmopolitan as Norrie, who has a Scottish dad, a Welsh mum, was born in South Africa, raised in New Zealand and played US college tennis. So perhaps we can chalk off Norrie\u2019s 6-4, 6-4, 6-0 loss to Kei Nishikori as not only a British defeat but one for South Africa, New Zealand and the US too. That\u2019ll soften the blow. In all seriousness, though, that was a comprehensive victory for Nishikori, who\u2019ll play the American Steve Johnson in the last 32. Johnson outlasted the Australian 25th seed, Alex De Minaur, 6-3 in the final set. \u201cI was pretty nervous at the end,\u201d admits Evans. \u201cIt means so much to get through. I just want to win big matches. The crowd here are always so good to me, they got me over the line.\u201d At 6-2 Evans has four match points to add to the four he had earlier in the set. Surely all of these won\u2019t go begging? This time Evans needs only one. He clenches his fists and looks to the skies and there\u2019s even a tear or two. You can see how much this means. A year ago he was denied a wildcard after his ban for testing positive for cocaine. Now he\u2019s matched his best performance here by reaching the third round, where he\u2019ll face either Marin Cilic or Joao Sousa. Cilic, the 2017 runner-up, is in a bit of bother, trailing by a set 6-4. A tie-break it is on No 2 Court, when Evans biffs a backhand into the net. Norrie v Nishikori is briefly interrupted on Centre when a spectator is taken ill. It\u2019s hot out there today, well hot by Wimbledon standards, and the heat is rising back on No 2 when Evans grabs the first mini-break of the breaker. At 3-1, Basilashvili has a great chance to reduce his arrears, but his forehand flies wide! They change ends with Evans in charge at 5-1 ... Evans looks to be heading for a tie-break. He leads 6-5 but Basilashivili has a game point. Norrie meanwhile looks to be heading for the locker room. He\u2019s already conceded a break in the third set to trail Nishikori 6-4, 6-4, 2-0. Petra Kvitova was 5-3 down in the first set against France\u2019s Kristina Mladenovic. The two-times champion is now a 7-5, 6-2 winner. That\u2019ll further calm fears about the arm injury that forced her to miss the French Open. Kvitova\u2019s interview with Simon Hattenstone is well worth a read, if you\u2019ve not yet seen it: Thanks Tom. I said an hour ago I was hoping that Dart and Evans would have wrapped things up but the time I returned, but I suppose one out of two ain\u2019t bad. Dart did well to finish so strongly after her earlier wobbles and the win is especially impressive given Haddad Maia upset Garbine Muguruza, the 2017 champion, in the first round. Evans, however, isn\u2019t finishing with such a flourish, and from 5-2 up he\u2019s now been pegged back to 5-5. It\u2019s not \u201cthis time\u201d at all, as Evans flakes out with Basilashvili at his mercy. He\u2019s 0-40 down but has to fight back very hard to get to deuce. Even once he gets there, he has to send a hard, fast serve down the middle to stop his opponent breaking him. But it doesn\u2019t stop Basilashvili, who brings the scores back to 5-4 in the third set. On Centre Court, Nishikori has won the second set against Norrie 6-4. And with that, I\u2019ll hand back over to Katy Murrells. Evans blows two match points against Basilashvili and loses the game, having missed a very easy return at 30-40. The British player will now serve for the match at 5-3 up in the third. \u201cThis time,\u201d he says as he prepares to serve. Meanwhile, Nishikori is ahead but not finding Norrie an easy opponent on Centre Court, he leads 6-4, 4-3. Dan Evans goes 5-2 up against Basilashvili in the third set after a tricky game ended when the Georgian dumps the ball into the tramlines. He is one game away from victory and the third round. That\u2019s a good comeback from Kvitova, who wins a first set against Mladenovic despite being against the head for most of it. She takes it 7-5 and it will be interesting to see whether she can take the momentum of the last couple of games into the second set. Nishikori breaks Norrie in the second set on Centre Court to go 2-1 and a set up. Evans is well on his way to victory on No 2 Court. He\u2019s 4-1 up and two sets up against Basilashvili. On No 12 Court, Marin Cilic has been broken by Joao Sousa and is 0-2 in the first set. This is roughly what Evans v Basilashvili looks like, but to make it more accurate, shout \u2018Allez!\u2019 a lot alongside it. Nishikori wins the first set on Centre Court 6-4 against Cameron Norrie. On No 2 Court, Evans goes a break up against Basilashvili, then 3-0 up in the third set. On No 1 Court, Kvitova breaks Mladenovic after a deuce battle to make it 5-5 in the first set. Australia\u2019s Alex De Minaur has levelled against Steve Johnson of the United States. It\u2019s two sets all on Court 18 after a gruelling 2hr 42min, with the score 6-3, 6-7(7), 3-6, 6-3. Dan Evans is chuntering away to himself. For reasons that are not entirely obvious, he keeps shouting \u2018Allez!\u2019 whenever he wins a point. He\u2019s a game up and two sets up in the third set. Meanwhile, on No 1 court, Petra Kvitova is battling, she\u2019s 4-5 down in the first set with Kristina Mladenovic serving. Evans blows one set point at 30-40, but works his way to another from deuce. He takes it eventually, going two sets to the good against the 18th seed. He\u2019s 6-3, 6-2 up against Basilashvili, then wanders off the court, presumably for a comfort break, seemingly in a bit of a funk. On No 3 court, Mikhail Kukushkin has won the first set against the big American No 9 seed John Isner 6-4. Here\u2019s the moment Dart won: Nishikori has broken Norrie back as the first set on Centre goes back to being on serve, but the British player has started well. Dan Evans is moaning that the mixture in his drinks isn\u2019t right, but he\u2019s got his on-court formula correct - a hard-working performance has him 6-3, 5-2 up against Basilashvili and receiving the serve. She blows the first, but takes the second. Harriet Dart wins to go into the third round for the first time, where she will face world No 1 Ashleigh Barty. Dart has two match points against Haddad Maia, who is now hobbling a lot. Dan Evans is continuing to steamroller Nikoloz Basilashvili, he\u2019s now 6-3, 4-1 up. On Centre Court, Cameron Norrie has just broken Kei Nishikori in the first set to go 4-2 up. Serving to go 5-1 up in the second set, Harriet Dart is attacked by some sort of flying creature. She brushes it off, but doesn\u2019t brush off Haddad Maia who takes her to deuce. Dart gets to advantage when a challenge reveals one hair of the tennis ball is on the line but cannot capitalise. She sees it out at the second time of asking to go 7-6, 3-6, 5-1 up. Right I\u2019m off to get some lunch. Tom Bryant is taking over. See you in about an hour\u2019s time, by which point hopefully Dart and Evans will be through to round three given Dart now leads 7-6 (4), 3-6, 4-1 and Evans has a 6-3, 3-0 advantage ... John Millman has indeed set up that third-round meeting with Sam Querrey, easing past Serbia\u2019s Laslo Djere 6-3, 6-2, 6-1. Dart has been cursing on Court 12, as well as whacking the grass and her shoe for good measure. She doesn\u2019t look as if she thinks she\u2019s going to win this. But then out of nowhere, she breaks for 2-1 in the third set! Haddad Maia decides it\u2019s time to get some treatment on her hip. Meanwhile Dan is the man on No 2, winning the first set 6-3 against Basilashvili when the 18th seed flings a forehand wide. Fancy some action on the show courts? Sure you do. First up on Centre it\u2019s Britain\u2019s Cameron Norrie, making his debut on the main court, against the 2014 US Open finalist Kei Nishikori, while on No 1 it\u2019s Petra Kvitova, the champion here in 2011 and 2014, against France\u2019s former top-10 player Kristina Mladenovic. Germany\u2019s Jan-Lennard Struff was strutting his stuff against the USA! USA!! USA\u2019s!!! Taylor Fritz, leading 6-4, 6-3, but Fritz won the third set 7-5 and it\u2019s going on serve in the fourth. Meanwhile Australian whippersnapper Alex De Minaur, who scraps in the style of his mentor Lleyton Hewitt, is in a battle with the USA! USA!! USA\u2019s!!! Steve Johnson. It\u2019s one set all, De Minaur taking the first set 6-3 and Johnson the second 7-4 in the tie-break. It\u2019s been a horrible, error-strewn 15 minutes for Dart on Court 12 and the result is that she\u2019s succumbed in the second set, losing it 6-3 to Haddad Maia. The Brazilian celebrates by once again feasting on some honey-covered banana. This one\u2019s going the distance. While we\u2019re talking about Thiem, I still find this stat absolutely crazy: the Austrian\u2019s the only active player under the age of 28 to have reached a men\u2019s grand slam final. Sam Querrey has had a quiet year but is making some noise here. Having defeated Dominic Thiem, the French Open runner-up, on Tuesday, he\u2019s just routed the Russian Andrey Rublev, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3. Australia\u2019s John Millman looks a likely third-round opponent, given he\u2019s currently two sets to the good against Serbia\u2019s Laslo Djere. Wang Qiang, perhaps one of the best players you\u2019ve never heard of, has booked her place in the third round, trouncing Tamara Zidansek 6-1, 6-2. It\u2019s been an eventful second set for Dart. Having called for the trainer to get her ankle strapped, she was promptly broken. But from 2-0 down she\u2019s now 3-2 up on Haddad Maia. Meanwhile Evans has been operating in reverse. After breaking in the opening game he\u2019s been broken back and it\u2019s 1-1. Dan Evans is Stephens\u2019s successor on No 2 Court. The British No 3, who was ranked 1,195 just over a year ago after his suspension for cocaine use, has been enjoying himself on the grass this summer, winning Challenger titles in Surbiton and Nottingham. His talent has never been in doubt, his application has. But the drugs ban seems to have given the 29-year-old the kick up the backside he needed. He\u2019s playing Georgia\u2019s Nikoloz Basilashvili, who was the villain of the piece on Tuesday when he came from two sets down to defeat another Brit, James Ward. Sloane Stephens clearly also means business, surging past China\u2019s Wang Yafan 6-0, 6-2 in 54 minutes. Konta could be next in the last 32. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with Ash Barty not playing on centre court???\u201d emails Victoria Cook. \u201cShe\u2019s world No 1. If they treated Novak like that, it\u2019d be all over the news!\u201d Yes it is puzzling. Granted it\u2019s a packed schedule today, but I\u2019m not sure that Cameron Norrie and Johanna Konta\u2019s matches both warrant being on Centre. Novak was exiled to No 2 Court for one match last year \u2013 but he wasn\u2019t the world No 1 then. I can\u2019t see Barty being back on No 2 in the next round. Dart, having been broken when serving for the first set against Haddad Maia, has recovered from the disappointment to force a tie-break. She\u2019s got a mini-break, too, and is serving at 5-4. Dart brings up two set points with a, erm, darting forehand down the line. Haddad Maia\u2019s backhand then misfires! Dart takes the tie-break 7-4. Credit to the 22-year-old for putting that ninth game out of her mind. The Aussie Fanatics are in full voice on No 2 Court, where Barty is stepping up to serve for a place in the third round, having dominated Van Uytvanck 6-1, 5-2. However Van Uytvanck decides to gatecrash the Barty party by breaking to 30. Barty responds by breaking to 30 herself for the victory, knifing away a high backhand volley to take her winning streak to 14 matches. There\u2019s so much to like about the new world No 1 and French Open champion, who has such a classic style and level-headed attitude. She\u2019d be a popular winner here, though she may find she has few friends in round three, because next up could be Britain\u2019s Harriet Dart. Haddad Maia bizarrely got out a bottle of honey and squirted it on a banana during an earlier changeover. It\u2019s clearly done the trick though. Meanwhile talking of food ... Dart, having managed to hold on to that break she secured early against Haddad Maia, is serving for the first set, leading 5-3. There\u2019s danger for Dart at 0-30 but she shows composure to recover, including with a delicate drop shot, to get to 30-all. But from there it all goes wrong with two unforced errors - and Haddad Maia breaks. It\u2019s 5-all and we\u2019ll see what Dart\u2019s made of. Can she regroup? Double-take time: Stephens has to be one of tennis\u2019s most unpredictable players. The 26-year-old\u2019s just as likely to go out of a slam early \u2013 witness her first-round defeats at Wimbledon in 2017 and 2018 \u2013 as rip through the draw and do some serious damage. The signs here are that she\u2019s in the mood to go deep. Barty may have perfect manners but she\u2019s beating up the Belgian, leading Van Uytvanck 5-1. It\u2019s a race between her and Stephens to secure the opening set first. It\u2019s the world No 1 who comes out on top, taking hers 6-1, while Stephens shortly follows, whitewashing Wang 6-0. Stephens, who\u2019s now 5-0 up, is one of four Americans currently on court on the 4th of July. Sam Querrey, the giant and something of a giantkiller here in recent years, leads Russia\u2019s Andrey Rublev 5-3, Taylor Fritz is 5-3 down to Germany\u2019s Jan-Lennard Struff and Steve Johnson\u2019s also trailing by a break, 4-3 against Alex De Minaur. More news on the Australian antithesis to Nick Kyrgios and Bernard Tomic: What a start from Dart, as she breaks the qualifier Haddad Maia in the opening game, before consolidating it for 2-0. It\u2019s much the same story on No 2 Court where Barty moves 2-0, then 3-0 ahead. And getting in on the game gobbling act too is Sloane Stephens. The 2017 US Open leads China\u2019s Wang Yafan 3-0 on No 3. As if there weren\u2019t already eight early singles matches to keep an eye on, here\u2019s some reading for you to get through too: Harriet Dart, the first of five Brits in second-round singles action, has finished her warm-up on Court 12, where she plays the Brazilian Beatriz Haddad Maia. No sign yet of whether the Duchess of Cambridge will be slumming it with the commoners again today, having watched the 22-year-old\u2019s first-round match out on Court 14.

The world No 1 faces Belgium\u2019s Alison Van Uytvanck, who last year beat the defending champion Garbine Muguruza at this stage, while John Millman and the young Alex De Minaur play too. Meanwhile in news regarding another talented but extremely temperamental Aussie, Bernard Tomic has this morning been fined his entire prize money of \u00a345,000 following his 58-minute loss by Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the first round on Monday. Tomic was deemed not to have met the \u201crequired professional standard\u201d in his 6-2, 6-1, 6-4 defeat, which was the shortest men\u2019s match here since 2004. You may remember the 26-year-old was also fined two years ago during a controversial opening-round loss in which he admitted he felt \u201cbored\u201d. Nick Kyrgios has been preparing for his grudge match with Rafael Nadal as only Nick Kyrgios can: Rafael Nadal has been in something of a seedings-induced funk since last week and his mood has probably not been improved by having to share a court with Nick Kyrgios today. Not only was Nadal knocked KO\u2019d by Kyrgios when the Australian enigma gatecrashed the quarter-finals as a Wimbledon debutant in 2014, the Spaniard felt the full force of his rival\u2019s tongue a few months ago, when he was accused of being a sore loser and \u201csuper salty\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s gracious only when he wins,\u201d cussed Kyrgios. \u201cHe\u2019s my polar opposite, like literally my polar opposite. Every time I\u2019ve beaten him ... when he wins, it\u2019s fine. He won\u2019t say anything bad, he\u2019ll credit the opponent: \u2018He was a great player.\u2019 But as soon as I beat him, it\u2019s just like: \u2018He has no respect for me, my fans and no respect to the game.\u2019 It\u2019s not a good look. And then Uncle Toni came out saying: \u2018He lacks education.\u2019 I\u2019m like: \u2018Bra, I did 12 years at school, you idiot. I\u2019m very educated. I understand that you\u2019re upset I beat your family again.\u2019\u201d Hostilities will be renewed in the third match on Centre Court today, after Cameron Norrie and Johanna Konta\u2019s matches, something of a scheduling surprise given that another Brit, Jay Clarke, is playing none other than Roger Federer and that\u2019s over on No 1 Court, where Serena Williams and Petra Kvitova are also on the bill. Eyebrows have also been raised at the decision to put the world No 1 and French Open champion, Ashleigh Barty, on No 2 Court, along with the defending champion, Angelique Kerber. Completing the lineup there is the British No 3, Dan Evans, who is continuing his tale of redemption after a drugs ban, and Marcos Baghdatis, the charismatic Cypriot and 2006 semi-finalist whose story will come to an end today if Italy\u2019s Matteo Berrettini puts him into retirement. Elsewhere, Harriet Dart takes British numbers in the singles to five, Sloane Stephens, John Isner, Sam Querrey and Amanda Anisimova are among the American contingent in action on the 4th of July, while Marin Cilic, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Kiki Bertens play too. And last but certainly not least, Andy Murray, back at Wimbledon after two years away, complete with a career-saving metal hip that has probably had security machines ringing around these heavily fortified and guarded grounds, begins his bid to make doubles the new singles. He and Pierre-Hugues Herbert take on Herbert\u2019s fellow Frenchman Ugo Humbert and Romania\u2019s Marius Copil in the first round, while his brother, Jamie, also begins his campaign. The Murrays could meet in round three. As for the Andy and Serena show, their mixed doubles courtship will commence on another day. But given today\u2019s super schedule, there\u2019s more than enough to keep us going. Play begins at: 11am BST on the outside courts/1pm BST on the show courts.",

It remains to be seen what impact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/22/neighbour-who-called-police-over-boris-johnson-row-goes-public\">late-night police visit</a> will have on his chances.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has promised to push for a new deal while insisting the UK will leave the EU come what may on 31 October, even if it involves no deal. While his hard Brexit supporters are adamant this is a cast-iron guarantee of leaving on that date, elsewhere Johnson has been somewhat less definitive. Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate, Johnson said only that it was 'eminently feasible', although he then went on to tell TalkRadio that the 31 October deadline was 'do or die'.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His main pledge has been to raise the threshold for the 40% higher tax rate from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at a cost of almost \u00a310bn a year, which would help about 3 million higher earners, a demographic with a fairly sizeable crossover into Tory members. Johnson\u2019s camp insist it would be part of a wider \u2013 and so far unknown \u2013 package of tax changes.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Public spending</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has said relatively little, beyond promising a fairly small increase in schools funding, as well as talking about the need to roll out fast broadband across the country. Johnson has generally hinted he would loosen the purse strings, but given his prior fondness for big-ticket projects \u2013 London\u2019s cancelled garden bridge, the mooted 'Boris island' airport \u2013 perhaps expect more of a focus on infrastructure projects than services.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Climate and environment</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is unlikely to be a big issue for Conservative party members, and Johnson has not said much on this beyond confirming his general support for the new government target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Foreign policy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Also unlikely to be a big issue among Tory members, beyond vague platitudes on 'global Britain', it could be a weak spot for Johnson given his poor performance as foreign secretary. He was seen as something of a joke by diplomats \u2013 both UK and foreign \u2013 and is likely to face more questioning over his gaffe about the jailed British-Iranian woman&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe\">Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe</a></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterwalker\"><b>Peter Walker</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Political correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>However, experts stress that the \u00a339bn sum is primarily a backlog of existing commitments the UK has agreed to pay, and to withhold it would not only risk potential action by the EU to recover it, but also harm the UK\u2019s reputation as a responsible trading nation.</p> \n<p>While saying he did not think no deal would happen, if it did, Johnson explained: \u201cThen clearly, logically, there would be extra funds available from the \u00a339bn, which is a very substantial sum, in the upper end of what the EU expected, that we\u2019ll be able to spend looking after farmers, looking after a whole range of sectors.\u201d</p> \n<p>Slightly confusingly, when then asked if the money for schools would also come from this, Johnson said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/01/philip-hammond-boris-johnson-jeremy-hunt-brexit\">it would come from the \u00a326bn \u201cfiscal headroom\u201d</a> \u2013 possible extra borrowing identified by the Treasury, which would most likely disappear if there was no deal.</p> \n<p>However, Johnson then seemed to suggest both sums could be spent, saying: \u201cDid everybody get that?

Questioned at a hustings event in York on Thursday evening about his near-\u00a35bn annual pledge of extra money for schools, which was among a series of expensive spending and tax commitments he has made, Johnson was asked if this extra cash would be delayed if the UK left without a deal. Johnson replied, to cheers from the audience: \u201cIt may have escaped your notice, but in the event of a no-deal Brexit, we will have an additional \u00a339bn to spend.\u201d However, experts stress that the \u00a339bn sum is primarily a backlog of existing commitments the UK has agreed to pay, and to withhold it would not only risk potential action by the EU to recover it, but also harm the UK\u2019s reputation as a responsible trading nation.

It\u2019s a glorious day here at Grace Road, where surely the successful captain at the toss will bat. It is a used pitch as well - the same strip that was played on when Australia got over the line by two wickets on Tuesday - so it will doubtless take to turn as the day wears on. </p> <p>The hosts were abysmal early with the bat in the series opener, slumping to 4/19 and eventually skittled for 177. All that stood between them and a double-digit tally was all-rounder Nat Sciver (64) and No10 Sophie Ecclestone (27 in 27 balls).</p> <p>But to their credit, they clung on. As Megan Schutt says in her column, which I\u2019ll post below, the reason why Australia value wins over England so highly is that Heather Knight\u2019s side do not give up. When numbers nine and ten came together in Australia\u2019s chase they still had 11 to get. Aside from Alyssa Healy (66), there was very little that was convincing about Australia\u2019s chase. It sets today up well.<br></p> <p>A reminder on how the multi-format points system before we get going: each of these three ODIs are worth two points, the standalone Test in Taunton later this month has four points on the line, the three T20s a further two to finish. It works quite nicely. As does the OBO when we talk throughout. <a href=\"mailto:adam.collins.casual@theguardian.com\">Drop me a line!</a> Hello! <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianAus/status/1146641809017376768\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Don\u2019t buy into the idea that Australia are raging hot Women&#39;s Ashes favourites | Megan Schutt <a href=\"https://t.co/ChOhtsrtv9\">https://t.co/ChOhtsrtv9</a></p>&mdash; Guardian Australia (@GuardianAus) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianAus/status/1146641809017376768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 4, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "So, England go into the third and final ODI with all the pressure and none of the points. Pluses - their batting at the tail can only get better, they lost 6-34 at the end, and Tammy Beaumont should be buzzing with that first Ashes hundred. Australia are proving that, surprise, surprise, they\u2019re a force to be reckoned with, and they\u2019re only warming up. Thanks for your emails, especially those of you clocking in during the night hours. Good night! Meg Lanning: \u201cIt was about being disciplined and composed under pressure and I thought Ellyse Perry batted really well and so did Beth Mooney at the end.\u201d And the player of the match is ... Delissa Kimmince for her career best five for 26. Heather Knight: \u201cI think it was a frustrating one. I thought Tammy played outstandingly on a slow wicket, and if we\u2019d had someone who\u2019d stayed with her we\u2019d have pushed it up to 250 and beyond. We tried to put a bit of pressure on them with the ball and we did outstandingly well taking early wickets, but those two at the end batted well. We need to be a bit smarter with the bat. We\u2019re going to have to debrief quite quickly and turn it around very quickly.\u201d A clinical Australian performance. England can be grateful to a wonderful century by Tammy Beaumont, her first against Australia, which propped up the batting and deserved more. With the ball, England didn\u2019t quite have the incisiveness against the quality of Perry, Mooney, Haynes and Lanning. The batting line-up that never ends. Australia have now won the first two ODI matches, which gives them a 4-0 lead in the series. One ODI, a Test and the T20s to go. Next? Canterbury on Sunday. With 28 balls spare.Not flawless, but efficient, and clever. 45th over: Australia 215-6 (Jonassen 29, Mooney 42) Cross comes back and Mooney drives her up and gloriously over extra cover. The crowd pack up their picnics and wander away. Australia need three to win off five overs. 44th over: Australia 208-6 (Jonassen 29, Mooney 36) Ecclestone bravely throws it up. Australia potter through for a couple of singles. And the fifty stand comes up. Australia need ten to win. Ah Graham. Hello!! Doesn\u2019t seem to be working out. How can Australia fail? Brunt yelling \u201cchunder\u201d before every delivery? By the way, if Freddie Truman was your dad\u2019s childhood hero \u2026 I am older by a generation. I hope we win the test and the T20s, of course. How come so few emails? It is very exciting \u2026 well it was until Australia came back after being substituted by Austria. We were in with a shout. I don\u2019t know what everyone\u2019s doing. It\u2019s been fun. Thank you my loyal emailers. WHERE ARE YOU PEOPLE? 43rd over: Australia 206-6 (Jonassen 28, Mooney 35) Katherine Brunt is the last throw of the dice. She stops the flow of boundaries, but Australia jog through for four singles. Anyone got a miracle up their sleeve? Australia need 12 from 41 balls. 42nd over: Australia 202-6 (Jonassen 26, Mooney 33) Mooney top-edges Ecclestone\u2019s first ball but it descends between the clutching fingers of three fielders. Jonassen goes for a similar shot next ball, but executes it much better and it soars one bounce over long on to the rope. A shake of singles and Australia are cruising now. They need 16 from 48 balls. 41st over: Australia 195-6 (Jonassen 21, Mooney 31) Marsh bowls a more tidy over, and though the ball is hitting the fielders now, Australia still run eager singles. Five from the over, no risks, no bother. Australia need 23 from 54 balls. 40th over: Australia 190-6 (Jonassen 19, Mooney 28) We\u2019re back to dibble-dabble strokes from Australia as Shrubsole regains some authority. Just two off the over. Australia need 28 from 60 balls and it all depends if Australia make the same hash of the end of their innings as England did. 39th over: Australia 188-6 (Jonassen 18, Mooney 27) A pricey over from Laura Marsh - eleven off it. Mooney has itchy feet and lofts her up and over extra cover and through the off side. Australia need 30 off 66 balls. 38th over: Australia 177-6 (Jonassen 12, Mooney 22) A ruddy-faced Shrubsole thunders in. She\u2019s been the most expensive of the bunch, but has a Bothamesque ability to take wickets from both brilliance and bathos. Mooney slog-sweeps her for four, then a handful of singles. Australia need 41 off 72 balls. 37th over: Australia 169-6 (Jonassen 10, Mooney 16) Two fours from Sophie Ecclestone\u2019s over as she strays uncharacteristically wild. A little wide and Jonassen directs her past third man, then again through the covers. 36th over: Australia 159-6 (Jonassen 1, Mooney 15) An intriguing game now, as the swingometer inches over from Australia to England. A cross-seamed tortoise-paced ball from Shrubsole bowls Gardener, who was attempting to drive her. Big relief there for Shrubsole who dropped her in the previous over. 35th over: Australia 155-5 (Gardener 12, Mooney 13) A good over for Australia. Ecclestone still causing problems but two boundaries, one awkward, ugly, four between midwicket and mid-on, and a gorgeous extra-cover drive. 34th over: Australia 146-5 (Gardener 8, Mooney 8) Shrubsole bowls full and on the stumps, Gardener whips her for four. Then, a howler. Gardener pushes back at Shrubsole who somehow lets the ball fall through her fingers. She gets a consoling pat from Knight and Jones but is mouthdownturningly miserable about that. 33rd over: Australia 140-5 (Gardener 2, Mooney 8) Brunt marches with intent. She does everything with intent. Gardner watches carefully, showing the face of her bat. She swings round at the last ball of the over, a shorter ball, which she pulls down for a single. 32nd over: Australia 138-5 (Gardener 1, Mooney 8) The breakthrough of the match for England. It feels like it is advantage England now At 31.3 overs (the fall of the wicket) England were 144-4; Australia were 136-5. Swings and roundabouts. A terrible wide nothing that Perry stands still to, stretches for, and gets the lightest of touches on. Even Shrubsole looks embarrassed. But that is a vital breakthrough for England - Perry was in sparkling form. 31st over: Australia 132-4 ( Perry 58, Mooney 7) A ripple of applause as Katherine Brunt serves her appointed time prowling in the deep and is thrown the ball again. Six off the over, one a leg-side loosener that Perry helps on its way to the boundary. Thanks vey much Australia need 86 from 19 overs at 4.25. 30th over: Australia 126-4 ( Perry 53, Mooney 6) That\u2019s a super shot by Perry to bring up her fifty. She squared up and just pinged the ball past mid-on, straight and hard. She raises her bat and smiles, blond ponytail poking out of the back of her helmet. That hundred came from 72 balls, and included seven fours. 29th over: Australia 119-4 ( Perry 48, Mooney 4) England keeping Perry waiting for her fifty. Three singles off Marsh\u2019s over, including an inelegant sweep by Mooney that catches the glove and might have been a possible run-out had the throw hit. 28th over: Australia 116-4 ( Perry 47, Mooney 2) Two off Cross\u2019s over and three emails! Untold riches. Oh: they all say the same thing - I have Austria playing in the Ashes. Thanks Jordan, Nick and Martin! 27th over: Austria 114-4 ( Perry 46, Mooney 1) A vital wicket there for Marsh, but Haynes is replaced by another left hander in Mooney. This Australian batting line-up is long but, number by number, England are getting there. The breakthrough England needed. A leading edge back to the delighted bowler and England reap the rewards for frustrating Haynes. A partnership with Perry of 53. 26th over: Austria 110-3 ( Perry 44, Haynes 29) The sun has disappeared now at Grace Road and the floodlights are on, a nonsensical rule means they have to be switched on for the second innings, no ifs, no buts. In England in midsummer? Seems daft not to be able to use your initiative, and a terrible waste of electricity. Just two off that Cross over. Tick, tock. Katherine Brunt was off the field for about half an hour so won\u2019t be able to bowl again till about quarter to eight. Graham writes again: Everyone is younger than me. But in case you do not know the word \u201cchunder,\u201d it is a peculiarly Aussie term popularised by Barry Humphries in his Private Eye cartoon Barry McKenzie. Origins are earlier, but it is a euphemism for the contents of ones stomach after a calamitous regurgitation. Sorry for lowering the tone. Banana is a good call. I bet I\u2019m older than you. Chunder is a great word. But I\u2019m not sure vomit yellow is quite fair.... 25th over: Austria 110-3 ( Perry 44, Haynes 29) Laura Marsh, red soled shoes, flights it and Haynes gets in a tangle, pads over boots. Just a couple from that one. Nice over. 24th over: Austria 108-3 ( Perry 40, Haynes 29) Sciver has bowled well but with the odd loose ball every over. And it happens again. A short one that Perry sends dismissively on its way. And Australia are half way to their target, after 24 overs. 23rd over: Austria 102-3 ( Perry 36, Haynes 29) Haynes squints through the bars of her helmet at Laura Marsh, watches, watches, then takes two steps down the pitch and drives just to the side of the stumps for four. She smiles, pleased. And so she should be. Gorgeous. 22nd over: Austria 94-3 ( Perry 34, Haynes 23) Nat Sciver, hair in a bun, complete action, scampers in . Her second ball is a shorter ball and Haynes deposits it through midwicket for four. A few more scrambled runs and Australia are ticking over. 21st over: Austria 86-3 ( Perry 32, Haynes 17). And England keep it tight again, just one off Marsh\u2019s over. Something will give soon, what will it be? And there is Katherine Brunt back on the field. Phew! 20th over: Austria 85-3 ( Perry 31, Haynes 17) Nat Sciver, who looks like the type of schoolgirl who was good at everything AND nice, takes the ball. Full of energy, but Perry\u2019s eyes light up to her second ball and sends it spinning back through the covers for four. And off the pitch, we see Katherine Brunt in a yellow bib, perhaps banana, galloping from side to side. The odd grimace, but it\u2019s obviously not too bad. Perhaps a twisted ankle? (aside: don\u2019t trust me, I\u2019m not a doctor). 19th over: Austria 79-3 ( Perry 26, Haynes 16) Ah Rachael Haynes, that was gorgeous. A drive off Marsh through mid off for four. The sublime is nearly followed by the ridiculous as Perry and Haynes try to run each other out. But the England throw wasn\u2019t accurate enough to milk their mistakes. 18th over: Austria 74-3 ( Perry 25, Haynes 10) Just two off Ecclestone\u2019s over as Australia struggle to pin point the boundary. Patient? Impatient? We shall see. 17th over: Austria 72-3 ( Perry 25, Haynes 10) Laura Marsh, bowling in sunnies. Not Chris Gayle wide boy sunnies, just your bog standard sporty numbers. Haynes looks desperate to twinkle down the pitch but restrains herself. A good over apart from when she strays a little leg side. Tim Robinson, looking grizzled, signals wide. 16th over: Austria 71-3 ( Perry 25, Haynes 10) Long shadows stretching over the field as Ecclestone bowls her fourth over. She\u2019s quick through these overs - have some compassion Sophie! Rachel Haynes jigs forward and lifts her high and handsome for six. And that\u2019s drinks. 15th over: Austria 62-3 ( Perry 24, Haynes 2) Laura Marsh comes on where Brunt came off and Australia only scuttle through for a couple. England will desperately miss Brunt, who bowled four overs, taking one for 16 before she went off. If she doesn\u2019t come back, England will have to somehow muddle through, a bowler down. 14th over: Australia 61-3 ( Perry 24, Haynes 1) Just two from Ecclestone\u2019s over. Lovely stuff. 13th over: Australia 59-3 ( Perry 23, Haynes o) Brunt limps off with the strength and conditioning coach on one arm and the physio on the other. Hope she\u2019ll be ok. She was walking gingerly, but walking. A great wicket though, a super ball, and Lanning was done over by the speed - or lack of it. The average partnership between Perry and Lanning before today was a hundred. Not anymore! A slower ball gets the gun! Lanning gets an edge and the bails go flying. But Brunt goes down flat on the ground. This doesn\u2019t look good. An ankle? Hamstring? 12th over: Australia 56-2 ( Perry 21, Lanning 17) Ecclesstone bowls with a tangle of arms, as if she\u2019s using one of those old fashioned hand-whisks with a turning circle. She flights it, tempting the bats, who are watchful. Just a couple of singles from the over 11th over: Australia 54-2 ( Perry 20, Lanning 16) Brunt and England keep it tight, frustrating Perry and Lanning who like to deal in boundaries. I just get the feeling they\u2019re going to want to hit out soon. 10th over: Australia 51-2 ( Perry 19, Lanning 14) Perry is watchful as Knight turns to Ecclestone. She\u2019s on her toes straight away, but is unable to get her away. Ecclestone in sunglasses, her long ponytail dancing down her back, has a maiden to start. End of the powerplay. 9th over: Australia 51-2 ( Perry 19, Lanning 14) A super over from Brunt. Dot to dot from one to four. Then a wide. Then Perry angles her bat and guides the ball into the offside and the Aussies scamper through for two quick and determined singles. That\u2019s the fifty up at the close of the ninth over. Abhijato Sensarma again: \u201cOf course we can! As a matter of fact, in my entire club cricket career, the strongest and most skilled all-rounder who attended our coaching was a girl (she was a classical runner between the wickets too!) I remain in awe of her till this day, and cite this song as a point of reference to the legendary she\u2019s... Cheers gals, you rock!\u201d Thanks Abhijato! 8th over: Australia 48-2 ( Perry 19, Lanning 12) Perry swings at Cross\u2019s first ball and misses. Point to Cross. Then she dollies up a half volley and Perry needs little temptation and it crosses the rope with a twang. Banana or gold, Perry is class. 7th over: Australia 44-2 ( Perry 15, Lanning 12) Heather Knight scratches her cap and throws the ball to Katherine Brunt who marches with military precision to her mark. But Perry doffs her cap to no-one, nudging the first ball down to the boundary where Laura Marsh just fails to cut it off. OB Jato is in poetic mode: \u201cVague drives are the death of precision, yet the birth of simultaneous lazy excellence and frustration depending on whether the concerned individual pulls off the shot or not.\u201d A metaphor for life OB? 6th over: Australia 37-2 ( Perry 10, Lanning 10) England struggling to keep Australia from bubbling over here. Another four from Lanning screams \u201clook at me\u201d 5th over: Australia 32-2 ( Perry 6, Lanning 9) Now Lanning gets in on the act, a square drive, lovely, through the covers, brmmm, brmmm, for four. Abhijato Sensarma writes in with An ode to all the batsmen I\u2019ve ever batted with: \u201cI shouldn\u2019t call you in this daze/ Yeah this flick\u2019s made me brave/ The pitch is still the comfort, the chase/ I shouldn\u2019t call you in this daze \u2018Cause I know that this is not the only one/ Which is tryna be this partnership\u2019s only one/ Don\u2019t want you in the danger zone but out of sight/ If you let this be our only one/ There will never be a lonely run/ I can\u2019t go on hoping the fielder doesn\u2019t throw with his right Stand by/ There\u2019s a million other singles on offer tonight/ You know I could have a safe one if I like/ Yeah you ain\u2019t gon\u2019 run to save me/ That\u2019s no lie/ I can\u2019t stay on/ Stand By! (The \u2018oh\u2019s featured in the original song\u2019s chorus are to be replaced by the quintessential club cricketer\u2019s \u201cNo! No! No!\u201d while denying a single :) We can change those he\u2019s to she\u2019s just for today? 4th over: Australia 26-2 ( Perry 8, Lanning 1) Perry knows how to turn disappointment into crushing disappointment in a single stroke, a drive through midwicket off Kate Cross sighs prettily over the rope the ball after the stumping review. Perry\u2019s foot seems to rest almost exactly on the white line at the crucial moment. A fine bit of work by Warwickshire\u2019s Amy Jones, but Perry survives by a big toe. England look confident as the umpires consider the review... We look at the replay from the side and the back... 3rd over: Australia 17-2 ( Perry 0, Lanning 0) Two big banana inswingers from Anya Shrubsole, but Healy drives the second straight down the ground for four. Then a wide. And another one. Yikes, Healy looking ominous. But Shrubsole has always possessed the ability to conjure important wickets from nothing. And does it again! The danger woman goes! A vague drive to Danni Wyatt at backward point is well caught by Wyatt perching on her knees. 2nd over: Australia 11-1 (Healy 5, Lanning 0) Kate Cross on the money straight away. An energetic run up, long too. She bristles with the ball, and Bolton couldn\u2019t resist. Lanning carefully plays back her first two deliveries. A lovely tidy catch by Amy Jones as Bolton drives loosely at a wide one from Cross. 1st over: Australia 9-0 (Healy 4, Bolton 0) Not a great start with five wides from Shrubsole who is straying legside. Then Healy turns another wide one down past fine leg for four. can England restrict this dangerous Australian batting line up? Anya Shrubsole to bowl the first over. A reminder of the teams for those of you joining us late. Australia are unchanged, England are without Sarah Taylor, resting with an ankle niggle. Danni Wyatt replaces her. England: Tammy Beaumont, Amy Jones (w), Heather Knight (c), Natalie Sciver, Danielle Wyatt, Fran Wilson, Katherine Brunt, Anya Shrubsole, Sophie Ecclestone, Laura Marsh, Kate Cross. Australia: Nicole Bolton, Alyssa Healy (w), Meg Lanning (c), Ellyse Perry, Rachael Haynes, Beth Mooney, Ashleigh Gardner, Jess Jonassen, Delissa Kimmince, Georgia Wareham, Megan Schutt. Not sure if they\u2019re borrowing the World Cup win predictor for the women\u2019s ashes. I\u2019d guess: 60:40 Australia today? But Raf Nicholson has watched a lot of women\u2019s cricket and she points out that this would have been a winning total on Tuesday. Graham is keen to nail the Australian colours: \u201cAustralians seem very exercised when their uniform is called yellow and green, insisting it is gold and green. If you ever see a piece of jewellery that colour, keep walking. I wonder what would be the best moniker for the colour? Canary, buttercup, primrose, maize, chunder yellow? If you want to call it gold you have to change it to something like the San Francisco 49ers or New Orleans Saints. \u201c Chunder? Graham! I like buttercup. Banana is also good. Frank Keating once memorably called Wisden, \u201cthe annual primrose doorstep.\u201d Personally, I prefer yellow to gold and was slightly disappointed ten years ago when my husband told me he had bought a yellow car and then arrived in a gold one. I never admitted it though. Thanks Adam and hi everyone! Looks like a beautiful July afternoon at Grace Road, T-shirts and shadows, but England won\u2019t be too pleased with that collapse of four for six at the end. Still, better than a collapse at the top of the order, which is what they conjured up for the first ODI. Tammy Beaumont was chuffed to bits when interviewed at the break. Honest too: \u201cThe pitch was a little bit slow and we were a bit lucky with a few loose balls early on.\u201d Beaumont brilliant but Australia too good. The most important component to a big ODI innings is partnerships and England never did that, their highest 65 between Beaumont and Knight for the second wicket. There was no collapse (until the end), rather, each time they had Austalia under pressure a bowling change was made by Lanning a wicket fell and the stand and Beaumont had to start again. The opener was outstanding in tallying her first Ashes ton and sixth in ODIs. She could not have done any more to keep the board ticking, getting to the mark at better than a run a ball. What a fantastic player she has been over the last three years. \u201cIt is the best innings she has played for England,\u201d says Charlotte Edwards. So, can Australia chase with more authority than they did on Tuesday? Can England hang on there with the ball and take advantage of bowling second on a used pitch? For that, stick around with Tanya Aldred to find out. Bye for now! Five for Kimmince! A superb shift by the seamer, claiming the third best figures for an Australian against England in ODIs. She leads Australia from the field with 5/26 from her 7.4 overs. In the process, she\u2019s torn this England innings apart. The fifth was Kate Cross, picked up first ball giving catching practice to point. Great job. Marsh tries to go long down the ground but doesn\u2019t get much of it, caught at long off by Gardner. That\u2019s four for Kimmince, who is deservedly cashing in. 47th over: England 216-8 (Ecclestone 3, Marsh 2) It was this pair who put on a decent stand of 38 in the final handful of overs on Tuesday, Ecclestone the far more likely of the two to find or clear the boundary. But with Schutt on, they are going to have to get resourceful or back their eye. They do neither in this over, Ecclestone looking to clear the front leg but not getting the ball she needs. Excellent from the Australian opening bowler, who has been faultless today. Kimminceis getting just reward for an excellent afternoon at the bowling crease, Shrubsole her second wicket in the over when top edging high in the air, Mooney taking the straightforward chance at midwicket. 46th over: England 212-8 (Ecclestone 1, Marsh 0) Clever from Kimmince, sending it wide when Brunt dances before the ball is bowled. Healy did the rest, getting a good look to complete the classy stumping. 45th over: England 210-6 (Brunt 11, Shrubsole 11) Schutt has three left and they can\u2019t get her away either. Brunt advances to the final ball and makes solid enough contact to long-off but Mooney makes a brilliant diving one-handed stop in front of our press box position to ensure that they can\u2019t get four for it. When Beaumont was there, 270 was within reach. Now? They\u2019ll be very pleased with 250-odd. 44th over: England 204-6 (Brunt 9, Shrubsole 9) Kimmince again giving away very little: singles down the ground starting the over off the front foot, singles out to cover ending it off the back foot. In common is at no point did they get a chance to free the arms and attack the rope without a fair degree of risk. Lanning should just bowl out Kimmince here, I reckon. Especially given that Perry has been ropey. 43rd over: England 199-6 (Brunt 7, Shrubsole 6) Despite the fact that this pair can both hit the ball a long way, they are happy enough building in the smaller denominations here, the sweeper at cover the preference. It might be time for Brunt to take a few risks and bosh it about with Ecclestone able to replace her if it doesn\u2019t work out. 42nd over: England 195-6 (Brunt 4, Shrubsole 5) Kimmince is having a brilliant day, really showing her worth as a change bowler in this side. It wasn\u2019t for nothing that she held her nerve at number nine the other night, too. Clever cricketer. 41st over: England 193-6 (Brunt 3, Shrubsole 4) The start of happy hour, sent down by Wareham who has a bit of work today in this final ten. She\u2019s bowled aggressively so far, which is to be commended. Brunt and Shrubsole, both still playing themselves in, are happy to take the singles on offer square of the wicket. 40th over: England 188-6 (Brunt 1, Shrubsole 1) The long-term opening bowling partners, Brunt and Shrubsole, are together now with bat in hand. The former has been just as important with her runs as her wickets over the last couple of years. She can\u2019t get Jonassen away here though, the successful over worth only three. Two in two overs! And it is the big one: Beaumont. She edges onto her stumps when going for the reverse sweep. The opener receives warm congratulations from the Australian players when walking off, marking the end of an outstanding hand. 39th over: England 185-5 (Beaumont 112, Brunt 1) Beaumont nearly run out! An excellent pressure over by Schutt, who has barely done a thing wrong across these two games so far. Back to the run out chance, Brunt tipped and ran to point, Beaumont en route before getting sent back. She was gone with a direct hit. Excellent cricket by Schutt and Healy: the bowler finding the edge, taken by the \u2018keeper up to the stumps. Perhaps a tad close for Wyatt to using the horizontal bat. 38th over: England 183-4 (Beaumont 111, Wyatt 25) Ping! Wyatt comes down the track at Jonassen who had her under control until the penultimate ball of this over, creating a half-volley and smashing it for four down the ground. Going again, I think she\u2019s steered that through the slips but it might have been off the edge, either way - three are added making eight from the over and 33 in the last five. 37th over: England 175-4 (Beaumont 110, Wyatt 18) I\u2019m advised that Beaumont\u2019s century is the first by an England player since ODIs were incorporated into the Women\u2019s Ashes. You\u2019ll see that in all of our copy later tonight, I suspect. Six from Schutt\u2019s new over, her sixth of the innings, all in ones an twos. 36th over: England 169-4 (Beaumont 109, Wyatt 13) Gardner goes again and after the set pair set up the over with a couple of singles, Beaumont busts out the reverse sweep and nails it just wide of the fielder at backward point. A couple of further singles to finish makes another over worth eight. They\u2019re on track for a very healthy total here, especially if Beaumont can last another half an hour or so. 35th over: England 161-4 (Beaumont 103, Wyatt 11) Charlotte Edwards on the TV notes that the job for Beaumont is to go BIG now, which she has once before against Pakistan in 2016 down at Taunton. Wyatt is making the running against Perry here though, hammering the second ball of her new spell past point for four. 34th over: England 154-4 (Beaumont 101, Wyatt 7) Beaumont is back on strike via a Wyatt single and the crowd go wild, confusing the pair. But now they get a chance to cheer, Beaumont tucking Gardner for the run she needs to bring up her first Ashes ton. \u201cCome on!\u201d roars the pocket-rocket opener. What a fine innings this has been, raising the hundred in 99 balls, striking 11 boundaries along the way. 33rd over: England 150-4 (Beaumont 99, Wyatt 5) Beaumont to 98 through midwicket and 99 in that diretion too. The 150 is raised when Wyatt gives her the strike back with one ball to go in the over... which she defends. DRINKS! Catch up with Victor\u2019s latest following England\u2019s win in the men\u2019s World Cup yesterday, ensuring their progress to the semi-finals next week. 32nd over: England 146-4 (Beaumont 97, Wyatt 3) Gardner is on to replace Kimmince. Beaumont is sweeping, Wyatt pushing, Beaumont scooping, Wyatt paddling. The board keeps ticking, England\u2019s opener three short of a ton. 31st over: England 141-4 (Beaumont 95, Wyatt 0) A wicket slows England down, the sucessful Jonassen over on track for a wicket maiden until Beaumont retains the strike with a push through cover. At Leeds, Afghanistan are making steady progress in pursuit of the Windies\u2019 311-6. Straight down deep square leg\u2019s throat! Given how many sweeps these two have been playing, it was highly probable that the shot would get one of them. It was a full-blooded strike of the ball, but Gardner didn\u2019t need to move a muscle. 30th over: England 140-3 (Beaumont 94, Wilson 8) Beaumont gets two from a clip off Kimmince, running hard for the second. Later in the over she plays a gorgeous square drive steered between the two fielders patrolling the backward point region. Just about the shot of the day for mine, that. It advances the opener to 94. 29th over: England 132-3 (Beaumont 87, Wilson 7) When spin is on, these two will sweep at every avaialble opportunity. They have the paddle, the conventional, the lap, the reverse. In addition to a couple of drives down the ground, five are added from Jonassen\u2019s first over back after Beaumont hit her out of the attack earlier. 28th over: England 127-3 (Beaumont 84, Wilson 5) Kimmince is an outstanding middle-overs bowler, the perfect combination of accuracy and pace variation. It\u2019s a great story behind her return to Australian colours after a long absence (which included working in a London pub for a time), and she\u2019s really making it count. 27th over: England 125-3 (Beaumont 83, Wilson 4) Four singles off Wareham, all taken via sweeps to fine leg. Wilson, in particular, is known as a prolific sweeper, taking the mantle from Lydia Greenway as the best in this England side when the World Cup winner retired a couple of summers ago. She was out sweeping on Tuesday, given leg before off her glove. Sure enough, that caused quite a stir: why isn\u2019t there DRS in this series? The technology is here, they saw it on the big screen. 26th over: England 121-3 (Beaumont 81, Wilson 2) Excellent from Kimmince, through another accurate over giving up just three. She\u2019s very hard to hit from nagging line just on the off-stump, mixing up her speeds along the way. 25th over: England 118-3 (Beaumont 78, Wilson 2) Wilson has to dive to make her ground when Beaumont takes a quick single. The stumps weren\u2019t broken, otherwise she would have been in strife. But the near miss doesn\u2019t deter the opener, who moves through the 70s with a crisp conventional sweep to the rope. 24th over: England 109-3 (Beaumont 71, Wilson 0) A successful over, Lanning again rewarded with a wicket in the over where she made a change. Kimmince got the nod ahead of Nicola Carey for these ODIs and has looked the part so far. Meanwhile in men\u2019s World Cup land, Plunkett wants the final on free TV. I\u2019m sure the players all think that, but it is interesting that he would actually say it. Sciver plays across the line and pays the price for missing the ball, struck on the back pad. That was good enough for the umpire, who didn\u2019t hesitate. 23rd over: England 106-2 (Beaumont 69, Sciver 14) Warhem begins her second spell from the Bennett/Curzon Rd/Broadcast end, her first three overs going for 0/16. Beaumont is dancing at her straight away, Sciver doing likewise when she gets on strike, winning a misfield out of Mooney at mid-off due to how hard she hits it. 22nd over: England 103-2 (Beaumont 67, Sciver 13) Sciver brings up the England 100, starting the new Gardner over with one behind square. Beaumont then paddle sweeps another single before Sciver picks out the midwicket sweeper. They\u2019re risk-free runs, even when the reverse sweep is busted out later in the over. 21st over: England 99-2 (Beaumont 65, Sciver 11) Better from Perry, keeping Beaumont quiet early in the over. The opener plays a fine square drive through the gap that would have been four if not for an assured diving stop from Schutt. To finish, another dive is required - this time by Wareham - to again deny a boundary. 20th over: England 94-2 (Beaumont 61, Sciver 10) That\u2019s Sciver\u2019s jam, dancing down at Gardner from around the wicket and driving over mid-on for her first four. With four other singles around the sweepers, it\u2019s another good over. 19th over: England 86-2 (Beaumont 59, Sciver 4) Good start for Beaumont, driving through the gap at cover for three. In response, Perry attacks the stumps but it ends up a full toss, the opener helping it along for four. The Australian attack-leader has not been at her best so far today. 18th over: England 77-2 (Beaumont 51, Sciver 3) Beaumont laps the first ball of Gardner\u2019s fresh over, bringing up her half-century from 44 deliveries, striking eight boundaries along the way. Only couple further singles come from it, though. Gardner was Australia\u2019s most frugal bowler here during the 2017 World Cup. 17th over: England 74-2 (Beaumont 49, Sciver 2) Perry returns to the attack, replacing Wareham. Beaumont plays her with respect, happy with a single to cover. Sciver, with one ball to deal with, needs to get low to a ball that doesn\u2019t get up but keeps it out safely. Beaumont is one away from raising her bat. 16th over: England 73-2 (Beaumont 48, Sciver 2) Sciver was superb on Tuesday. She\u2019s off the mark first ball here today with a couple behind square. Of course, this is where she made her towering maiden ODI ton during the 2017 World Cup. Great change from Lanning to get Gardner on just as the previous pair were getting busy. Gardner strikes with her third ball! Brought in to replace Jonassen, Knight tried to take the off-spinner long and straight after dancing down the track but miscued the stroke, the ball flying high into the air, taken easily by Haynes at mid-off. 15th over: England 69-1 (Beaumont 46, Knight 17) You can\u2019t bowl full tosses at Tammy Beaumont, the opener hitting a four from the first ball of the over for the third time on the bounce. She really is flying now, striking at nearly 130. 14th over: England 62-1 (Beaumont 40, Knight 16) Beaumont is go! She begins the Jonassen over with a loft over mid-off for four, landing just inside the rope. That\u2019s the way to go after a spinner, doing it early in the set. She goes again from the second ball, punching through cover and timing it so well that it runs away for four more. The 50-partnership is raised with it. Fine batting. Of course, after failing cheaply in the first ODI last home summer, she hit back to back tons against South Africa. Of course, now I\u2019ve mentioned this she\u2019ll get out straight away. 13th over: England 53-1 (Beaumont 31, Knight 16) Better from Wareham, who has found her length nice and early. I\u2019m enjoying how much air she is giving. I\u2019ve no time for leggies who rush it through. Give me risk/reward, thanks very much. 12th over: England 49-1 (Beaumont 29, Knight 14) Beaumont is going again at Jonassen early in the over, this time on the cut first ball behind for her fifth boundary. A couple of further singles makes another healthy over. After the early wicket and slow start against Schutt, the England base is now building very nicely. 11th over: England 43-1 (Beaumont 24, Knight 13) The leggie Wareham is on for her first go and it takes Beaumont only only two balls to get resourceful, deflecting expertly through the vacant third man for four. Giving it plenty of air, the opener is playing watchfully before tucking one to keep the strike. 10th over: England 38-1 (Beaumont 19, Knight 13) Spin for the final over of the first power play, via left-armer Jess Jonassen. Singles are exchanged early in the over to the sweeper at cover. Given a bit more depth later in the set, Knight uses the crease and crunches behind point for four. Shot. Jonassen bounces back though, slipping a straight one past the captain\u2019s inside edge. They\u2019re up for leg before but the appeal is turned down. Of course, we have no DRS in this series. Grrrrr. 9th over: England 32-1 (Beaumont 18, Knight 8) Schutt oversteps first up, which is most unusual. Beaumont gets a fair of the free hit but not quite enough to reach the rope, a diving stop from Lanning denying the fourth. The skipper wouldn\u2019t be denied getting a boundary of her own later in the over though, Knight creaming an overpitched delivery through extra cover for four. Nice, positive batting. 8th over: England 23-1 (Beaumont 15, Knight 3) Beaumont takes one to third man early. Perry is up for leg before to Knight but it is quickly turned down. The captain picks out the fielders on the circle a couple of times but is unable to pick the gap. Speaking of the captain. \u2018Heather\u2019s Pride\u2019 took place last week, which was a competition where letters/videos were sent in by kids explaining why they should get a training session with England. By all reports, it was a lovely day. Here are the competition winners alongside Knight, Katherine Brunt and Anya Shrubsole. 7th over: England 22-1 (Beaumont 14, Knight 3) Beaumont takes a run off Schutt after a couple of maidens from her end, on the front foot to mid-on. Knight grabs a couple around the corner to get her moving in the right direction. These two have an even bigger job ahead of them than usual today with Sarah Taylor missing. 6th over: England 19-1 (Beaumont 13, Knight 1) Beaumont leaps onto a short and wide delivery, cutting her third boundary off Perry. She\u2019s then down the other end via a steered single to third man. Good batting. They\u2019re giving the home skipper nothing when she\u2019s on strike, Knight again playing out the remainder of the set. 5th over: England 14-1 (Beaumont 8, Knight 1) Schutt is bowling into a shoebox. It isn\u2019t always easy to get into that groove early as a swing bowler but it is exactly what the South Australian has done early on here. Knight is forced to make a good decision from each delivery, and does, playing out another maiden. 4th over: England 14-1 (Beaumont 8, Knight 1) Perry gives Beaumont a full toss on her pads and she makes no mistake putting it away through square leg to get off the mark. She makes it two boundaries in the over from the final delivery, crashing a half-volley through cover. Beaumont\u2019s away. 3rd over: England 6-1 (Beaumont 0, Knight 1) Schutt is right on the money here, bouncing in after that familiar squat at the top of her mark, ala Rubel Hossain from the Bangladesh men\u2019s team. A maiden it is, Knight in defence throughout. 2nd over: England 6-1 (Beaumont 0, Knight 1) Such a poor start for Jones, who has had a brilliant nine months or so. This is the series she has been longing to play in and dominate. She\u2019ll have to wait for Sunday now. Earlier in the over, she picked up a boundary off Perry\u2019s first ball down to fine leg. With Taylor missing, the captain Heather Knight shuffles up to No3. She was out first ball to Perry on Tuesday, lbw, but is off the mark first up today, with a tuck behind square. Back to back soft dismissals for Jones, chipping a catch to midwicket. 1st over: England 1-0 (Jones 0, Beaumont 0) Tidy from Schutt to begin, line and length to Jones who is happy to get her eye in with the full face of the blade in defence. She is off the mark from the final delivery down to fine leg for the easiest of singles. Plug Schutt\u2019s column again? I will. The discussion about how the Australian dressing room has changed from 2017 is really interesting. The players are on the field! Megan Schutt has the ball in her hand, running away from us at the the broadcast or Bennett end. Amy Jones will be facing the first ball, Tammy Beaumont opening the batting with her. PLAY! It is an ankle niggle. Official word from the England team: \u201cSarah Taylor injured her ankle in the first ODI and hasn\u2019t recovered in time to play today.\u201d Dave Lawrence opening up on the emails. \u201cGreetings! Looking forward to another exciting Ashes ODI.\u201d Good afternoon to you. Let\u2019s hope for a high-scoring thriller. \u201cRe: the multi-format series, would you not rather see a higher points weighting for the Test Match and lesser for the T20s? Or perhaps an extra test with one fewer of each of the limited overs formats?\u201d My fix: ODIs 3, Test 5 (two each for a draw), T20s 2. Reduces the likelihood of an even scoreline and reflects the fact that winning an ODI is harder than a T20. England: Tammy Beaumont, Amy Jones (w), Heather Knight (c), Natalie Sciver, Danielle Wyatt, Fran Wilson, Katherine Brunt, Anya Shrubsole, Sophie Ecclestone, Laura Marsh, Kate Cross. Australia: Nicole Bolton, Alyssa Healy (w), Meg Lanning (c), Ellyse Perry, Rachael Haynes, Beth Mooney, Ashleigh Gardner, Jess Jonassen, Delissa Kimmince, Georgia Wareham, Megan Schutt. \u201cIt is important that we move on quite quickly,\u201d she says. \u201cI asked for some fight in the last game after the bad start we had, which was brilliant. But not enough.\u201d Sarah Taylor is out. She has a niggle. Danni Wyatt comes into the XI for her. Amy Jones will \u2018keep for England, as she does whenever Taylor misses out. Meg Lanning says that Australia would also have batted too \u201cbut we\u2019re comfortable chasing whatever they set us.\u201d They are unchanged from Tuesday. In front of my OBO position, the England superstar \u2018keeper hasn\u2019t got the gloves on and doesn\u2019t appear to be warming up. We\u2019ll find out what\u2019s going on there at the toss in a couple of minutes. Welcome to Leicester for the second Women\u2019s Ashes ODI! It\u2019s a glorious day here at Grace Road, where surely the successful captain at the toss will bat. It is a used pitch as well - the same strip that was played on when Australia got over the line by two wickets on Tuesday - so it will doubtless take to turn as the day wears on. The hosts were abysmal early with the bat in the series opener, slumping to 4/19 and eventually skittled for 177. All that stood between them and a double-digit tally was all-rounder Nat Sciver (64) and No10 Sophie Ecclestone (27 in 27 balls). But to their credit, they clung on. As Megan Schutt says in her column, which I\u2019ll post below, the reason why Australia value wins over England so highly is that Heather Knight\u2019s side do not give up. When numbers nine and ten came together in Australia\u2019s chase they still had 11 to get. Aside from Alyssa Healy (66), there was very little that was convincing about Australia\u2019s chase. It sets today up well. A reminder on how the multi-format points system before we get going: each of these three ODIs are worth two points, the standalone Test in Taunton later this month has four points on the line, the three T20s a further two to finish. It works quite nicely. As does the OBO when we talk throughout. Drop me a line! Hello!",

      "bodyText": "The family of a 12-year-old refugee schoolgirl who drowned in a river in Bury have called for further investigation into her death, and claimed police were not fully cooperating with them. Shukri Yahya Abdi\u2019s mother, who moved to the UK with her family from Somalia more than two years ago, said her daughter had been badly bullied for months. Zamzam Canab Ture said: \u201cIf the rights we came to the country for exist, I want something done\u201d, in a video released on social media.

As people have experienced that over the past three years, many people, including some who voted no to independence in 2014, have reconsidered that view and that\u2019s why we see support for independence rising.\u201d May said she was confident her successor would make the union a priority, adding: \u201cOne of the lessons of the independence referendum in 2014 was that those of us who believe in our United Kingdom need to do much more to make and demonstrate the emotional case for it \u2013 and to strengthen the ties that bind it together.\u201d She also insisted that the election of 13 Scottish Conservative MPs in the last general election \u201cwas a very clear message that the people of Scotland gave that they want Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom\u201d. Referring to the breakdown of power-sharing arrangements in Northern Ireland, as well as the electoral successes of nationalists in Wales and Scotland, May quoted the former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, who warned recently that the union was \u201cmore imperilled now than it has ever been\u201d. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s World at One earlier on Thursday that the union was under threat, not only from Scottish nationalism or pressure for Irish unification, but from English \u201cindifference\u201d. He said a no-deal Brexit would make the breakup of the UK more likely. Senior Scottish Conservative critics of Boris Johnson have privately expressed their despair at his likely succession to the Tory leadership, fearing it could be a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d for the UK and immediately boost support for a second independence referendum if he pressed ahead with a no-deal Brexit. A recent Panelbase poll in the Sunday Times Scotland found support for independence would jump to 53% if Johnson became prime minister. It found he had a popularity rating among Scottish voters of -37, a worse rating than Nigel Farage. May also used the event, at a technology startup hub near Stirling castle, to unveil plans for a review of the role of Whitehall departments in the devolved nations, chaired by the former Scotland Office minister Andrew Dunlop, adding she was \u201cdelighted\u201d both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt were supportive of the review.",

The 51-year-old repeated his claim that he witnessed a boy being deliberately mown down by a car in a revenge hit-and-run after being warned by the late MI5 head Sir Michael Hanley not to have any friends. The alleged fantasist \u2013 known under the pseudonym \u201cNick\u201d \u2013 also tearfully said he tried to save another boy who he claimed was raped and strangled by former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, the court heard. On a third occasion, he alleged that Hanley ordered Beech and three other boys to choose which of them was to die at an abuse session before a child was beaten to death. Giving evidence for the second day at Newcastle crown court, Beech also told jurors how the former prime minister Sir Edward Heath cuddled and comforted him after he became upset on the politician\u2019s yacht.

      "bodyText": "The UN has issued a withering appraisal of the human rights situation in Venezuela, as horrific details emerged of the injuries inflicted on a navy captain allegedly tortured to death during a crackdown on alleged plotters against Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. A report by UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet \u2013 which follows a three-day mission to the South American country last month \u2013 accuses Maduro\u2019s security forces of committing a series of \u201cgross violations\u201d against Venezuelan dissenters and urges him to disband a notorious special forces group blamed for a wave of politically-motivated killings. The 16-page document also contains chilling details of the techniques allegedly being used by Venezuela\u2019s security and intelligence services to interrogate and intimidate members of the political opposition, as Maduro battles to retain power. The report says that in scores of cases identified by researchers from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) \u201cwomen and men were subjected to one or more forms of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including electric shocks, suffocation with plastic bags, water boarding, beatings, sexual violence, water and food deprivation, stress positions and exposure to extreme temperatures\u201d. It adds: \u201cSecurity forces and intelligence services routinely resort to such practices to extract information and confessions, intimidate, and punish the detainees.\u201d The report is also highly critical of FAES, a shadowy special forces unit activists suspect has been tasked with subduing opposition to Maduro in Venezuela\u2019s impoverished periphery. The report said Bachelet\u2019s team had interviewed relatives of 20 young men killed by FAES between June 2018 and April this year, all of whom described a similar modus operandi. Heavily-armed, balaclava-wearing agents would storm homes and separate their targets from their families before shooting them. \u201cAccording to their relatives, almost all of the victims had one or more shots in the chest,\u201d the report said. Maduro\u2019s government rejected the \u201cdistorted\u201d report in an 11-page rebuttal that accused Bachelet of offering \u201ca selective and openly biased vision\u201d of human rights in Venezuela. It said: \u201cThe imprecisions, mistakes, decontextualizations and false claims are innumerable.\u201d The UN report was released amid growing outrage over last Friday\u2019s killing of Rafael Acosta, a Venezuelan navy captain who had been detained during a roundup of supposed anti-Maduro conspirators. Acosta\u2019s wife has claimed he was tortured to death by military counter-intelligence officers \u2013 claims supported by a copy of the homicide squad\u2019s preliminary autopsy that was leaked to a pro-government newspaper on Wednesday. The newspaper said pathologists had given the cause of death as \u201csevere cerebral edema [brain swelling] caused by acute respiratory failure caused by a pulmonary embolism caused by rhabdomyolysis [a potentially life-threatening breakdown of muscle fibers] by multiple trauma\u201d. Doctors reportedly identified internal bleeding in Acosta\u2019s digestive tract, colon and neck as well as a pulmonary embolism and broken ribs. A separate report claimed Acosta had suffered 16 broken ribs and a whiplash-like back injury during the alleged torture session. At a press conference in Caracas on Thursday, opposition lawmaker Delsa Solorzano said the autopsy left in no doubt what had happened. \u201cThere are lots of technical words that those of us who aren\u2019t doctors can\u2019t fully understand,\u201d Solorzano told reporters. \u201cBut at the end of day what they mean is they beat him to death.\u201d Venezuelan authorities have moved quickly to portray the killing as the act of a small group of intelligence officers, acting independently. On Monday attorney general Tarek Saab \u2013 a close Maduro confidant \u2013 said he had ordered two agents suspected of involvement in the \u201cunfortunate incident\u201d to be arrested on manslaughter charges. Saab promised an \u201cobjective, independent and impartial\u201d investigation and said the culprits would receive \u201cexemplary punishment\u201d. Bachelet\u2019s report suggested neither was likely to happen. It said: \u201cThe attorney-general\u2019s office has regularly failed to comply with its obligation to investigate and prosecute perpetrators.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Mad magazine, a US institution famous for the grinning face of jug-eared, tiny-eyed mascot Alfred E Neuman, is to stop being a regular fixture of newsstands. The satirical magazine will no longer be published monthly with new material from the autumn, its owners DC Comics said. Instead there will be end-of-year specials and magazines with classic and best-of content which will be sold in comic shops and direct to subscribers. While Mad magazine is not disappearing, it is not going to be the force it once was. The comedian and musical parodist Al Yankovic, a former guest editor, was one of many to take to social media lamenting the decision. He said he was \u201cprofoundly sad \u2026 I can\u2019t begin to describe the impact it had on me as a young kid \u2013 it\u2019s pretty much the reason I turned out weird. Goodbye to one of the all-time greatest American institutions.\u201d The comic book artist Bill Sienkiewicz tweeted: \u201cI hope people understand what this means to us as a nation, both as a culture and as a functioning critical society. \u201cMAD wasn\u2019t JUST a humor magazine. It\u2019s not just the end of an era; it\u2019s the end of\u2026\u201d Actor and musician Steven Van Zandt tweeted a Mad cover poking fun of the Sopranos cast, of which, as Silvio Dante, he was part. \u201cMaking the cover of Rolling Stone was nice, but I didn\u2019t feel meaningful until I made the cover of Mad Magazine!\u2019\u201d Mad magazine was founded in 1952 as a comic book, the first issue written almost entirely by its editor Harvey Kurtzman. It became a magazine in 1955 and soon began building up influence and readership with its sharp satire and cheerful daftness. Its readership peaked at more than 2 million in 1974 but in recent years it was widely acknowledged not to be the force it once was. When Donald Trump compared the Democrat 2020 nomination hopeful Pete Buttigieg to gap-toothed, freckled Neuman, catchphrase \u201cWhat, me worry?\u201d, it went over the younger politician\u2019s head. Buttigieg confessed: \u201cI\u2019ll be honest. I had to Google that. I guess it\u2019s just a generational thing. I didn\u2019t get the reference. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of funny, I guess. But he\u2019s also the president of the United States and I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s not spending more time trying to salvage this China deal.\u201d",

Called \u201cFour (4) Heads Came Out on Wednesday\u201d, the monochrome, signed print was only available in person at the box office on Thursday, with all but seven snapped up at the time of publishing. The gallery describes the picture as showing a \u201cfigurative apparition with multiple floating, circling heads, wailing upon a lonely hillside, a house of home in the rear-ground, earth and sky mingling in a brewing storm of Lynchian menace\u201d. Lynch, plus his collectors, have lent 88 artworks to HOME for a free show called My Head Is Disconnected, one of the highlights of this year\u2019s Manchester International Festival (MIF).

Also premiering on Thursday night was Tree, a musical based on Mi Mandela, an album by actor and DJ Idris Elba. Previews of the show have been overshadowed by claims from two female writers, who alleged they had been frozen out of the production after developing it for four years. On Thursday Sarah Henley and Tori Allen-Martin announced that they had raised \u00a312,800 in two days since going public with their grievance involving Elba and director Kwame Kwei-Armah, who are billed as the co-creators of Tree in the MIF programme.

It is a moment the Australian has been longing for since he first started watching cycling as a child. \u201cI will be pinching myself on the start line,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was growing up, the Tour de France was the only race that was regularly televised. It was the race that I followed. To be there racing myself \u2013 I know it is clich\u00e9d, but it is a dream come true.\u201d",

He had 15cm rods inserted in either side of his pelvis. When he had recovered to leave his hospital bed, he was restricted to walking laps of Arden Street. Then he worked the leg press. And then small jumps. Only then did he begin to run again.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s something I never thought he\u2019d do,\u201d former Kangaroo Brent Harvey told SEN earlier in the week. \u201cIt\u2019s miraculous to see he can run properly and then to be physical and run and jump and get pushed off the ball.\u201d</p> <p>Harvey recalled going to the hospital and seeing Daw unable to walk. \u201cI went back a week later, and he still couldn\u2019t walk and all my local friends, who don\u2019t know a lot about football, asked me if he\u2019ll play again and I said he\u2019s got no chance.\u201d</p> <p>And this is before you contemplate the mental journey that Daw has had to take, compounded by living in a city that places an AFL footballer at the centre of public life \u2013 one, as Daw has experienced, which places you in the middle of social media hatestorms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60c8c2970c58b6df4b32488f9195b7ad9024f8b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60c8c2970c58b6df4b32488f9195b7ad9024f8b5/0_0_3000_2043/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Majak Daw\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Majak Daw sits in the stands at the JLT Community Series match St Kilda.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quinn Rooney/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At a preseason game against St Kilda, in the early days of his recovery, Daw was photographed sitting with the son of teammate Jed Anderson. Here was a picture of a man regaining his sense of self right in front of your eyes, yet it was all that a pathetic ball of hate of on Facebook could do but post: \u201cWhat a frightening experience for the youngster. Face to face with a gorilla.\u201d</p> <p>In this toxic culture of degradation and hate, it feels as if we are a country running up a sizeable empathy deficit. This is why we must not forget sport\u2019s true promise of bringing people together, and part of this is its power to heal.</p> <p>For all their faults, football clubs can provide an environment where everyone works together and provides an enormous sense of purpose. They provide young men and women with a sense of meaning, belonging and having a real purpose.</p> <p>And this is something football clubs now understand. In the previous collective bargaining agreement the AFLPA mandated that each club was to have a full-time person working in the player development space. And one of the key principles of the current agreement is player development and wellbeing.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Daw acknowledged that he was fortunate to have the entire football club behind him. While much of the focus was deservedly on North Melbourne\u2019s head of conditioning Alex Moore, much of it comes from the supportive environment within the club\u2019s walls.</p> <p>Through the courage of footballers such as Dayne Beams, Tom Boyd and Jack Steven, who have all spoken of their mental health battles, an increased number of players are now seeking professional help, from psychiatrists and psychologists. Clubs are responding to this by investing significant sums through their welfare programs to deal with the mental health of their employees. The league is also looking to appoint a head of mental health and wellbeing to manage the implementation of a proactive mental health program.</p> <p>This is a significant journey for the AFL and the young men who play the game to have made.

      "bodyText": "Empathy, from the Greek empatheia \u2013 em (into) and pathos (feeling) \u2013 is a kind of travel. \u201cIt suggests you enter another person\u2019s pain as you\u2019d enter another country, through immigration and customs, border crossing by way of query,\u201d writes Leslie Jamison in The Empathy Exams. But how do you enter the world of Majak Daw, a man who comes from a place very few of us understand firsthand \u2013 from fleeing a Sudanese civil war as a young boy, to being found in the murky waters of the Yarra a week before Christmas last year with the horrific injuries that come from a 6ft 5in man nudging 100kg hitting the murky water from the height of the Bolte Bridge. While we can barely begin to know from where Daw has come, it is difficult not to regard his return to football this weekend as the best story the AFL has to tell in 2019. Earlier this year, it was all Daw could do to walk. He had 15cm rods inserted in either side of his pelvis. When he had recovered to leave his hospital bed, he was restricted to walking laps of Arden Street. Then he worked the leg press. And then small jumps. Only then did he begin to run again. \u201cIt\u2019s something I never thought he\u2019d do,\u201d former Kangaroo Brent Harvey told SEN earlier in the week. \u201cIt\u2019s miraculous to see he can run properly and then to be physical and run and jump and get pushed off the ball.\u201d Harvey recalled going to the hospital and seeing Daw unable to walk. \u201cI went back a week later, and he still couldn\u2019t walk and all my local friends, who don\u2019t know a lot about football, asked me if he\u2019ll play again and I said he\u2019s got no chance.\u201d And this is before you contemplate the mental journey that Daw has had to take, compounded by living in a city that places an AFL footballer at the centre of public life \u2013 one, as Daw has experienced, which places you in the middle of social media hatestorms. At a preseason game against St Kilda, in the early days of his recovery, Daw was photographed sitting with the son of teammate Jed Anderson. Here was a picture of a man regaining his sense of self right in front of your eyes, yet it was all that a pathetic ball of hate of on Facebook could do but post: \u201cWhat a frightening experience for the youngster. Face to face with a gorilla.\u201d In this toxic culture of degradation and hate, it feels as if we are a country running up a sizeable empathy deficit. This is why we must not forget sport\u2019s true promise of bringing people together, and part of this is its power to heal. For all their faults, football clubs can provide an environment where everyone works together and provides an enormous sense of purpose. They provide young men and women with a sense of meaning, belonging and having a real purpose. And this is something football clubs now understand. In the previous collective bargaining agreement the AFLPA mandated that each club was to have a full-time person working in the player development space. And one of the key principles of the current agreement is player development and wellbeing. Earlier this week, Daw acknowledged that he was fortunate to have the entire football club behind him. While much of the focus was deservedly on North Melbourne\u2019s head of conditioning Alex Moore, much of it comes from the supportive environment within the club\u2019s walls. Through the courage of footballers such as Dayne Beams, Tom Boyd and Jack Steven, who have all spoken of their mental health battles, an increased number of players are now seeking professional help, from psychiatrists and psychologists. Clubs are responding to this by investing significant sums through their welfare programs to deal with the mental health of their employees. The league is also looking to appoint a head of mental health and wellbeing to manage the implementation of a proactive mental health program. This is a significant journey for the AFL and the young men who play the game to have made. Just this week, Wayne Schwass recalled a painful 12 years of \u201clying, hiding and pretending\u201d that he was happy and healthy, when he was paralysed with fear and wanting to end his own life. The cumulative welling up many of us experienced watching Daw\u2019s media conference suggests that for all the issues that have plagued our game just this year \u2013 from thugs belting the intellectually disabled to former footballers taking offence at being called out for making vile jokes on sexual assault \u2013 there are enough of us to redress an empathy deficit. To this, the final word on the journey of Majak Daw should go to North Melbourne captain Jack Ziebell. \u201cFor him to be able to get out and back on the green stuff playing the game he loves, it brings a smile to everyone\u2019s faces.\u201d Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14;Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636.

      "bodyText": "The Northern Territory government is still fighting civil claims from Don Dale detainees by arguing the use of spit hoods on minors was \u201creasonable\u201d, despite having since banned their use and agreeing to royal commission recommendations to outlaw the practice. The government has also argued Don Dale officers were trying to keep a young Indigenous detainee \u201csafe\u201d when they left him for almost an hour with his hand handcuffed above his head to a basketball court fence. The NT banned spit hoods and restraint chairs in youth detention in 2016 following shocking footage showing their use on Dylan Voller in Darwin\u2019s Don Dale youth detention centre. The footage helped prompt a far-ranging royal commission, which recommended in 2017 that spit hoods \u201cshould continue to be prohibited\u201d and said they had the potential to \u201ccause distress to young persons\u201d. The current NT Labor government has maintained the ban. But Guardian Australia can reveal the NT government is continuing to defend civil claims from former Don Dale detainees by arguing spit hoods were justified and reasonable. A former juvenile detainee, Marley Campbell, is suing the Northern Territory over his detention between 2009 and 2012 in Alice Springs and in the Don Dale centre, and over a temporary transfer to the Darwin Correctional Centre, an adult prison. Campbell, who was 14 when he first entered detention in 2009, alleges he was fitted with a spit hood three times while in the Darwin Correctional Centre, including when he was being walked to a doctor, transferred between cells and taken back to the prison\u2019s reception for transfer back to Don Dale. Campbell\u2019s lawyer, Sam Tierney of Ken Cush and Associates, has alleged in court documents that the use of the spit hoods was unlawful and involved excessive force. \u201cOn the first occasion that the applicant was placed in a spit hood, it was applied from behind, without warning and caused the applicant to experience discomfort, difficulty breathing, shock, panic and fear and to believe that he was being suffocated by the officers,\u201d the court documents allege. But the NT government has argued the spit hoods were used only once and only as a \u201creasonable precaution\u201d. It has argued Campbell was involved in an earlier spitting incident and that spit hoods do \u201cnot restrain or control movement and is not an article of restraint\u201d. The civil case is the latest in a long run of claims against the Northern Territory over the treatment of juvenile offenders inside detention centres. In 2017, four of the teenagers at the centre of a teargassing incident were awarded damages over officers\u2019 use of spit hoods and leg shackles, and cuffing of their hands behind their backs, which the judge ruled were \u201cacts of battery\u201d. The judge found the use of teargas was reasonable and necessary. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Campbell also alleged he was beaten by guards, threatened and forced to shower in the view of adults while at the Darwin Correctional Centre \u2013 allegations the NT government denies. In another incident, Campbell alleges officers came into his cell during a disturbance at Don Dale on Boxing Day 2011. He alleges he was handcuffed, grabbed around the neck and marched outside, where he had his face forced into grass and arms pinned back in a \u201cchicken wing\u201d hold. Officers then handcuffed him to a fence with his arm above his head and left him for \u201cmore than an hour\u201d, according to court documents.

It was then further suspended after the 2011 Boxing Day riot, during which Campbell allegedly assaulted the centre superintendent, the government\u2019s defence said. The royal commission into the protection and detention of children in the NT made more than 230 recommendations, including the closure of Don Dale, raising the age of criminal responsibility to 12 and banning the detention of under-14s except for serious crimes. Don Dale remains open. As of March this year the government still had no timeline for opening a replacement detention centre, after it abandoned plans for a facility at Pinelands in the wake of community objections. Campbell\u2019s case is due for hearing in the federal court in Darwin in September.",

      "bodyText": "United Nations human rights inspectors will have \u201ccompletely unfettered access to all places of detention\u201d when they visit Australia in coming months. This week the UN subcommittee on prevention of torture announced it would visit six countries to inspect places of detention, including Australia and Nauru. It will be the first time Australia is subject to the inspections, which it is obliged to allow after ratifying the optional protocol to the convention against torture (Opcat) in December 2017, more than eight years after signing it. The protocol was designed to prevent the mistreatment of people in detention, through inspection processes. The chair of the subcommittee, Sir Malcolm Evans, told Guardian Australia inspectors had \u201cthe right of unannounced access to any place of detention or any place we believe people might be being deprived of their liberty\u201d. \u201cOur visits are relatively short, we can\u2019t look at everything. We have to be strategic. We will be doing our homework.\u201d He said he was confident the Australian authorities would understand and cooperate with the inspectors\u2019 expectation of \u201ccompletely unfettered access to all places of detention, to any person, place or thing, to people of all categories in detention\u201d. The inspectors will have a broad brief, including prisons, youth detention, immigration detention, psychiatric hospitals, police stations and social care environments such as aged care and disability homes. \u201cThe reality is these are institutions that are supported, regulated and run by the state,\u201d Evans said. \u201cThe reality is people are being detained and subjected in some instances to forms of ill treatment for which the state would be accountable.\u201d He said the subcommittee was particularly concerned about marginal groups in society which are often subject to poorer treatment than others for various reasons including disability, race, age and infirmity. Evans said a key issue for the subcommittee was to help nations set up their own oversight bodies with similar powers to the subcommittee. Countries were usually obliged to establish the mechanism within a year, but Australia exercised a right to delay it until the end of 2021. Evans said the subcommittee also hoped to prompt some \u201cself reflection\u201d about the way a country runs its custodial systems. After each visit, the committee writes a confidential report for the subject nation\u2019s government, which it is encouraged to release. Australia\u2019s detention facilities have been extensively criticised, and subjected to countless investigations, reports, inquiries and royal commissions. Prison populations are rising, particularly those of women and Indigenous people, in an increasingly privatised system. \u201cAbuse thrives behind closed doors,\u201d said Ruth Barson, a legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre, welcoming the international scrutiny. \u201cWhile independent scrutiny is essential to expose abuse, the onus will be on our governments to then take action and end mistreatment.\u201d Youth detention has come under the spotlight in recent years with the Northern Territory royal commissions, and separate reports on facilities in Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland, and the royal commission into aged care continues to hear shocking allegations of mistreatment of elderly residents. Australia\u2019s immigration policies \u2013 of which detention is a major pillar \u2013 have been criticised by international human rights organisations, legal groups, the United Nations and other governments. Domestic immigration detention centres, which are federal facilities often run by private companies, have hosted multiple acts of alleged mistreatment and abuse against detainees. Human rights and legal groups have accused the government of operating without transparency, allowing alleged abuses to go uninvestigated. Australia\u2019s offshore immigration facilities are outside the subcommittee\u2019s mandate for its Australia visit, but the regional processing centre on Nauru will be inspected for a second time this year. Nauru was previously inspected in 2015, but Evans noted it has yet to establish the prevention mechanism, has not responded to the inspectors\u2019 findings, and has not made the report public.",

This destruction is a significant contributor to the carbon emissions that are driving the climate crisis. However, trees draw carbon dioxide back out of the atmosphere as they grow, and planting trees will need to play an important part in ending the climate emergency.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Forests are also a vital and rich habitat for wildlife. Earth is at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/10/earths-sixth-mass-extinction-event-already-underway-scientists-warn\">start of a sixth mass extinction</a> of species and the razing of forests and other ecosystems is the biggest contributor to the losses. Tropical rainforests are especially important, hosting 50% of known terrestrial species on only 6% of the world\u2019s land.

This is hugely important blueprint for governments and private sector.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ren\u00e9 Castro, assistant-director general at the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, said: \u201cWe now have definitive evidence of the potential land area for re-growing forests, where they could exist and how much carbon they could store.\u201d</p> \n<p>The study, <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aax0848\">published in the journal Science</a>, determines the potential for tree planting but does not address how a global tree planting programme would be paid for and delivered.</p> \n<p>Crowther said: \u201cThe most effective projects are doing restoration for 30 US cents a tree. That means we could restore the 1tn trees for $300bn [\u00a3240bn], though obviously that means immense efficiency and effectiveness. But it is by far the cheapest solution that has ever been proposed.\u201d He said financial incentives to land owners for tree planting are the only way he sees it happening, but he thinks $300bn would be within reach of a coalition of billionaire philanthropists and the public.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth\">Avoiding meat and dairy is \u2018single biggest way\u2019 to reduce your impact on Earth</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Effective tree-planting could take place across the world, Crowther said: \u201cThe potential is literally everywhere \u2013 the entire globe. In terms of carbon capture, you get by far your biggest bang for your buck in the tropics [where canopy cover is 100%] but every one of us can get involved.\u201d The world\u2019s six biggest nations, Russia, Canada, China, the US, Brazil and Australia, contain half the potential restoration sites.</p> \n<p>Tree planting initiatives already exist, including <a href=\"http://www.bonnchallenge.org/content/challenge\">the Bonn Challenge</a>, backed by 48 nations, aimed at restoring 350m hectares of forest by 2030. But the study shows that many of these countries have committed to restore less than half the area that could support new forests. \u201cThis is a new opportunity for those countries to get it right,\u201d said Crowther. \u201cPersonally, Brazil would be my dream hotspot to get it right \u2013 that would be spectacular.\u201d</p> \n<p>The research is based on the measurement of the tree cover by hundreds of people in 80,000 high-resolution satellite images from Google Earth. Artificial intelligence computing then combined this data with 10 key soil, topography and climate factors to create a global map of where trees could grow.</p> \n<p>This showed that about two-thirds of all land \u2013 8.7bn ha \u2013 could support forest, and that 5.5bn ha already has trees. Of the 3.2bn ha of treeless land, 1.5bn ha is used for growing food, leaving 1.7bn of potential forest land in areas that were previously degraded or sparsely vegetated.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis research is excellent,\u201d said Joseph Poore, an environmental researcher at the Queen\u2019s College, University of Oxford. \u201cIt presents an ambitious but essential vision for climate and biodiversity.\u201d But he said many of the reforestation areas identified are currently grazed by livestock including, for example, large parts of Ireland.</p> \n<p>\u201cWithout freeing up the billions of hectares we use to produce meat and milk, this ambition is not realisable,\u201d he said. Crowther said his work predicted just two to three trees per field for most pasture: \u201cRestoring trees at [low] density is not mutually exclusive with grazing. In fact many studies suggest sheep and cattle do better if there are a few trees in the field.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/19/planting-billions-trees-save-planet\">Can planting billions of trees save the planet?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Crowther also said the potential to grow trees alongside crops such as coffee, cocoa and berries \u2013 called agro-forestry \u2013 had not been included in the calculation of tree restoration potential, and neither had hedgerows: \u201cOur estimate of 0.9bn hectares [of canopy cover] is reasonably conservative.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, some scientists said the estimated amount of carbon that mass tree planting could suck from the air was too high. Prof Simon Lewis, at University College London, said the carbon already in the land before tree planting was not accounted for and that it takes hundreds of years to achieve maximum storage. He pointed to a scenario from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 1.5C report of 57bn tonnes of carbon sequestered by new forests this century.</p> \n<p>Other <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aax9539\">scientists said avoiding monoculture plantation forests</a> and respecting local and indigenous people were crucial to ensuring reforestation succeeds in cutting carbon and boosting wildlife.</p> \n<p>Earlier research by Crowther\u2019s team calculated that there are currently about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/02/scientists-reveal-there-are-3tn-trees-in-world-new-count\">3tn</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/02/scientists-reveal-there-are-3tn-trees-in-world-new-count\"> trees in the world</a>, which is about half the number that existed before the rise of human civilisation. \u201cWe still have a net loss of about 10bn trees a year,\u201d Crowther said.</p> \n<p><em>Visit <a href=\"https://www.crowtherlab.com/\">the Crowther Lab website</a> for a tool that enables users to look at particular places and identify the areas for restoration and which tree species are native there.</em></p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 18 October 2019 to reflect a revision made to the original research paper, and a clarification in a letter by the authors of the study <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6463/317\">in the journal Science</a>, that responds to criticism of their work.

Other scientists agree that carbon will need to be removed from the atmosphere to avoid catastrophic climate impacts and have warned that technological solutions will not work on the vast scale needed. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bastin, also at ETH Z\u00fcrich, said action was urgently required: \u201cGovernments must now factor [tree restoration] into their national strategies.\u201d Christiana Figueres, former UN climate chief and founder of the Global Optimism group, said: \u201cFinally we have an authoritative assessment of how much land we can and should cover with trees without impinging on food production or living areas. This is hugely important blueprint for governments and private sector.\u201d Ren\u00e9 Castro, assistant-director general at the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, said: \u201cWe now have definitive evidence of the potential land area for re-growing forests, where they could exist and how much carbon they could store.\u201d The study, published in the journal Science, determines the potential for tree planting but does not address how a global tree planting programme would be paid for and delivered. Crowther said: \u201cThe most effective projects are doing restoration for 30 US cents a tree. That means we could restore the 1tn trees for $300bn [\u00a3240bn], though obviously that means immense efficiency and effectiveness. But it is by far the cheapest solution that has ever been proposed.\u201d He said financial incentives to land owners for tree planting are the only way he sees it happening, but he thinks $300bn would be within reach of a coalition of billionaire philanthropists and the public. Effective tree-planting could take place across the world, Crowther said: \u201cThe potential is literally everywhere \u2013 the entire globe. In terms of carbon capture, you get by far your biggest bang for your buck in the tropics [where canopy cover is 100%] but every one of us can get involved.\u201d The world\u2019s six biggest nations, Russia, Canada, China, the US, Brazil and Australia, contain half the potential restoration sites. Tree planting initiatives already exist, including the Bonn Challenge, backed by 48 nations, aimed at restoring 350m hectares of forest by 2030. But the study shows that many of these countries have committed to restore less than half the area that could support new forests. \u201cThis is a new opportunity for those countries to get it right,\u201d said Crowther. \u201cPersonally, Brazil would be my dream hotspot to get it right \u2013 that would be spectacular.\u201d The research is based on the measurement of the tree cover by hundreds of people in 80,000 high-resolution satellite images from Google Earth. Artificial intelligence computing then combined this data with 10 key soil, topography and climate factors to create a global map of where trees could grow. This showed that about two-thirds of all land \u2013 8.7bn ha \u2013 could support forest, and that 5.5bn ha already has trees. Of the 3.2bn ha of treeless land, 1.5bn ha is used for growing food, leaving 1.7bn of potential forest land in areas that were previously degraded or sparsely vegetated. \u201cThis research is excellent,\u201d said Joseph Poore, an environmental researcher at the Queen\u2019s College, University of Oxford. \u201cIt presents an ambitious but essential vision for climate and biodiversity.\u201d But he said many of the reforestation areas identified are currently grazed by livestock including, for example, large parts of Ireland. \u201cWithout freeing up the billions of hectares we use to produce meat and milk, this ambition is not realisable,\u201d he said. Crowther said his work predicted just two to three trees per field for most pasture: \u201cRestoring trees at [low] density is not mutually exclusive with grazing. In fact many studies suggest sheep and cattle do better if there are a few trees in the field.\u201d Crowther also said the potential to grow trees alongside crops such as coffee, cocoa and berries \u2013 called agro-forestry \u2013 had not been included in the calculation of tree restoration potential, and neither had hedgerows: \u201cOur estimate of 0.9bn hectares [of canopy cover] is reasonably conservative.\u201d However, some scientists said the estimated amount of carbon that mass tree planting could suck from the air was too high. Prof Simon Lewis, at University College London, said the carbon already in the land before tree planting was not accounted for and that it takes hundreds of years to achieve maximum storage. He pointed to a scenario from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 1.5C report of 57bn tonnes of carbon sequestered by new forests this century. Other scientists said avoiding monoculture plantation forests and respecting local and indigenous people were crucial to ensuring reforestation succeeds in cutting carbon and boosting wildlife. Earlier research by Crowther\u2019s team calculated that there are currently about 3tn trees in the world, which is about half the number that existed before the rise of human civilisation. \u201cWe still have a net loss of about 10bn trees a year,\u201d Crowther said. Visit the Crowther Lab website for a tool that enables users to look at particular places and identify the areas for restoration and which tree species are native there. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 October 2019 to reflect a revision made to the original research paper, and a clarification in a letter by the authors of the study in the journal Science, that responds to criticism of their work. They clarify that one comparison made did not take into account that 55% of the CO2 produced by human activity is absorbed by land and oceans. The text of the first and second paragraph of this article have been edited to reflect this and the paper revision.",

Already, in the brasseries and cafes around the Grand Place in central Brussels, where this year\u2019s Tour\u2019s teams were presented to the public in warm evening sunshine, the talk is of who will fill the vacuum left by the four-times winner. Froome\u2019s dramatic crash at the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 has opened up the Tour. Most pundits point to his fast-rising Ineos teammate Egan Bernal as heir apparent, at the expense of the defending champion, Geraint Thomas, but plenty of others \u2013 even the French \u2013 rate their own chances. Romain Bardet, the doe-eyed, floppy-haired climber, more reminiscent of Eddie Redmayne than Eddy Merckx, is, as he is most years, the French favourite.

They have riders like Michal Kwiatkowski, Wout Poels, Dylan van Baarle, so the team is still full of big-name riders.\u201d The staging of the Grand D\u00e9part pays tribute to the first Tour win, 50 years ago in July 1969, of the Belgian legend Merckx and is the 23rd time the race has started abroad. The first stage will pass through WoluweSaint-Pierre, where the five-times Tour winner grew up. If Merckx\u2019s renown has since been surpassed by that of Eden Hazard among Belgian sports fans, his reputation among hardcore cycling aficionados remains intact and he is still referred to in glowing terms. But there are some other anniversaries that the Tour is not so keen to commemorate. Twenty years ago Lance Armstrong took the first of his seven wins, seizing control of the 1999 race less than three years after being diagnosed with testicular cancer. That success ushered in the darkest period in the Tour\u2019s long and colourful history. The ghosts of the Armstrong era still haunt the Tour, as does the whiff of hypocrisy that surrounds the feting of Merckx, who tested positive three times during his career, which contrasts starkly with the continued shunning of Armstrong. Two decades after Armstrong\u2019s first win many within the sport insist that there has been fundamental change while others believe it has been little more than a makeover. The spectre of doping is never far away, as was hinted at by the recent Operation Aderlass scandal, which clouded the opening days of this year\u2019s Giro d\u2019Italia and remains an active investigation. Armstrong himself, so well-versed that he could cite doping as his specialist subject, once counted Merckx as a mentor and close friend and will be podcasting at a distance throughout this year\u2019s race. Yet even the American refuses to be drawn on the current state of the sport. \u201cI\u2019m too far removed,\u201d he told NBC recently. \u201cI don\u2019t have access, I don\u2019t have intel.

      "bodyText": "If the European parliament approves Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s nomination in two weeks\u2019 time, the German defence minister will make for an unusual European commission president: a consensus candidate who has won the approval of western liberals and eastern rightwingers, yet is proving divisive in her home country. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has praised the 60-year-old for having \u201cthe DNA of the European community\u201d, while the conservative Polish newspaper Gazeta Polska has hailed her nomination as a \u201chistoric choice\u201d. However, in Germany the prospect of a German filling the commission presidency for the first time in 52 years has been met with outcries across the political spectrum. The former leader of the Social Democrats (SPD) Martin Schulz described Von der Leyen as \u201cthe government\u2019s weakest minister\u201d, while his SPD colleague Sigmar Gabriel, a former vice-chancellor, called her nomination \u201can unprecedented act of political trickery\u201d. The Greens bemoaned Von der Leyen\u2019s nomination as an \u201cold-school backroom deal\u201d, the pro-business Free Democrats said she was \u201cnot the best candidate\u201d, the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland said her selection would amount to \u201ccheating voters\u201d and even Manfred Weber, the candidate that Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union had originally fielded for the top commission post, lamented a \u201csad day for European democracy\u201d. Katarina Barley, a former SPD justice minister who is now one of the new European parliament\u2019s vice-presidents, said she would vote against her former cabinet colleague \u2013 a move endorsed by leading German newspapers such as S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. Von der Leyen was an \u201cinappropriate\u201d choice, the paper said, because her track record in the defence ministry was so poor that she should long ago have resigned. \u201cShe will be unable to cope with the commission presidency,\u201d it added. In a bizarre twist, Germany was the only of the 28 EU member states to abstain from the vote to nominate her. Few of Von der Leyen\u2019s critics question that her CV ticks the right boxes, however. Born in Brussels to one of the first pan-European civil servants, she speaks fluent French and English, and built up a profile in the early years of her career with a bold commitment to a \u201cUnited States of Europe, modelled on federal states like Switzerland, Germany or the US\u201d. Many German commentators note the progress made under her current cabinet brief, defence integration. Her diplomatic effort in organising the 2016 Nato mission in the Aegean Sea in response to the refugee and migrant crisis required support from both Greece and Turkey, and is said to have won her admirers in Brussels. During her time in charge of Germany\u2019s family ministry, from 2005 to 2009, she confounded expectations by radically expanding nurseries and parental pay; in 2017, she voted for same-sex marriage when her mentor Merkel voted against. But since taking over defence in 2013, Von der Leyen\u2019s popularity has plummeted \u2013 she sits second from bottom in Der Spiegel\u2019s approval ratings monitor. Her defenders say being in charge of Germany\u2019s underfunded military is a poisoned chalice \u2013 the job used to be known as the \u201cejector seat\u201d because it curtailed the careers of so many of her predecessor. The fact that the first woman to hold the post has survived is testimony to her staying power, they add. However, at least one of the scandals surrounding the defence ministry is closely linked to Von der Leyen: a parliamentary committee is investigating accusations of nepotism in connection to the allocation of contracts worth hundreds of millions of euros to external consultants. One management consultancy firm awarded with jobs was McKinsey, where her son works as an associate. By focusing her reform efforts of the armed forces on \u201csoft factors\u201d such as working hours and nurseries, Von der Leyen is accused of having ignored bigger challenges around training and equipment \u2013 and lost support among the military in the process. \u201cTo put it mildly: German soldiers don\u2019t feel very loved by her,\u201d said journalist Thomas Wiegold, a leading chronicler of the country\u2019s military. Relations reached a nadir in 2017, when she accused her troops of having an \u201cattitude problem\u201d. Yet Wiegold said Von der Leyen was only partially to blame for scandals that have plagued her ministry, and said she compared favourably to predecessors who managed to say the right things to please troops while at the same time signing off significant budget cuts. In May, she announced a \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.4bn) increase in the German defence spending, the biggest since the end of the cold war. The force with which German politicians have attacked Von der Leyen\u2019s EU nomination is more easily explained by the disappointment that followed the collapse of the so-called \u201cspitzenkandidaten\u201d process of appointing the commission president, whereby the main party bloc in the European parliament nominate a lead candidate for the role, even though that candidate can only be voted in one country. Aborting the process amounted to \u201cdeceiving and cheating on voters\u201d who had been sold the system as a crucial step to democratising the EU, according to a former German vice-president of the commission. \u201cIf you had to invent a way to further disillusion in democracy and politics Europe, then you would come up exactly with what has happened now,\u201d G\u00fcnter Verheugen told Deutschlandradio. \u201cThe damage is great and the consequences cannot yet be foreseen.\u201d Yet critics of \u201cspitzenkandidaten\u201d say the system was a German invention that was never truly accepted as an official procedure by most other member states. None of the three top contenders \u2013 Weber, the SPD\u2019s Frans Timmermans and the Danish liberal Margrethe Vestager \u2013 managed to gain a clear majority among MEPs. In the light of that, Von der Leyen was \u201ca decent solution\u201d, said the centre-left German broadsheet Die Tageszeitung. \u201cShe has experience and respect on the European stage, she stands for a moderate Merkel-CDU, and she won\u2019t allow herself to be bullied by any of the heads of state.\u201d",

Instead the Home Office has announced a temporary fix, which will now allow compensation to be paid, in the absence of legislation.</p> <p>People waiting for compensation responded with frustration to the revelation that the government has only now made arrangements to make the payment of damages possible. Janet Mckay, whose partner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/01/man-detained-threatened-with-removal-after-52-years-in-the-uk\">Anthony Bryan</a> spent five weeks in detention and was booked by the Home Office in 2017 on to a plane back to Jamaica (a country he left at the age of eight, and had not visited in 52 years), said it was \u201cstrange\u201d to discover that the government had not previously made arrangements to facilitate the payment of compensation.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone is struggling to fill in the forms. I had no idea they weren\u2019t ready to pay out as soon as the forms were sent in,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Labour MP David Lammy said the new evidence of delays was staggering. \u201cI welcome the announcement that compensation payments will now be paid to the victims of the Windrush scandal \u2013 at least to those who are still alive. However, this also reveals that no such payments have been made thus far, which is deeply yet predictably disappointing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is also staggering that the Home Office is yet to establish any legislative framework for these claims to be processed; it is hard to fathom just how badly the Home Office continues to let down the Windrush generation.\u201d</p> <p>Omar Khan, director of the <a href=\"https://www.runnymedetrust.org/\">Runnymede Trust</a>, the race equality thinktank, said he was shocked that this issue had only now been resolved. \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough to commit in principle to compensation if you don\u2019t put in place the levers required to get money into people\u2019s pockets. They\u2019ve had months to get it right. It raises questions about how urgently and seriously the government is responding to this injustice,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Charities assisting victims to claim compensation say that people are increasingly frustrated at the protracted process. Daniel Ashwell at the<a href=\"https://rmcentre.org.uk/\"> Refugee and Migrant Centre</a> in Wolverhampton, which is helping around 10 people to claim damages, said: \u201cThe most frustrating thing is that people are still waiting. We see the pressure that this is putting on them; they constantly have this on their minds \u2013 wondering when they are going to get compensation. Some of them are very vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>The permanent secretary to the Home Office, Sir Philip Rutnam, informed the home secretary, Sajid Javid, that he would ordinarily advise against making payments from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/09/mps-call-for-review-of-windrush-scandal-compensation-scheme\">Windrush</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/09/mps-call-for-review-of-windrush-scandal-compensation-scheme\"> compensation </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/09/mps-call-for-review-of-windrush-scandal-compensation-scheme\">scheme</a> until specific legislation has been passed. However, given the \u201cimportance of putting right wrongs that have been done\u201d, he identified an interim solution, allowing the Home Office to get around the absence of legislation. Javid has subsequently issued a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/correspondence-on-the-work-of-the-home-office-windrush\">ministerial direction</a> to proceed, which means that the Home Office is now in a position to start making payments.</p> <p>In a ministerial statement, Javid announced: \u201cThe government deeply regrets what has happened to some members of the Windrush generation and when I became home secretary I made clear that responding to this was a priority. The compensation scheme I launched in April is a key part of this response. The compensation scheme has been open to receive claims since April 2019 and the Home Office is now in a position to start making payments.\u201d He said specific legislation giving financial authority for payments made would be introduced when parliamentary time allows.</p> <p>\u201cI am committed to providing members of the Windrush generation with assurance that they will be appropriately and promptly compensated where it is shown that they have been disadvantaged by historical government policy,\u201d he wrote.</p>",

Labour MP David Lammy said the new evidence of delays was staggering. \u201cI welcome the announcement that compensation payments will now be paid to the victims of the Windrush scandal \u2013 at least to those who are still alive. However, this also reveals that no such payments have been made thus far, which is deeply yet predictably disappointing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is also staggering that the Home Office is yet to establish any legislative framework for these claims to be processed; it is hard to fathom just how badly the Home Office continues to let down the Windrush generation.\u201d Omar Khan, director of the Runnymede Trust, the race equality thinktank, said he was shocked that this issue had only now been resolved. \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough to commit in principle to compensation if you don\u2019t put in place the levers required to get money into people\u2019s pockets. They\u2019ve had months to get it right. It raises questions about how urgently and seriously the government is responding to this injustice,\u201d he said. Charities assisting victims to claim compensation say that people are increasingly frustrated at the protracted process. Daniel Ashwell at the Refugee and Migrant Centre in Wolverhampton, which is helping around 10 people to claim damages, said: \u201cThe most frustrating thing is that people are still waiting. We see the pressure that this is putting on them; they constantly have this on their minds \u2013 wondering when they are going to get compensation. Some of them are very vulnerable.\u201d The permanent secretary to the Home Office, Sir Philip Rutnam, informed the home secretary, Sajid Javid, that he would ordinarily advise against making payments from the Windrush compensation scheme until specific legislation has been passed. However, given the \u201cimportance of putting right wrongs that have been done\u201d, he identified an interim solution, allowing the Home Office to get around the absence of legislation. Javid has subsequently issued a ministerial direction to proceed, which means that the Home Office is now in a position to start making payments. In a ministerial statement, Javid announced: \u201cThe government deeply regrets what has happened to some members of the Windrush generation and when I became home secretary I made clear that responding to this was a priority. The compensation scheme I launched in April is a key part of this response. The compensation scheme has been open to receive claims since April 2019 and the Home Office is now in a position to start making payments.\u201d He said specific legislation giving financial authority for payments made would be introduced when parliamentary time allows. \u201cI am committed to providing members of the Windrush generation with assurance that they will be appropriately and promptly compensated where it is shown that they have been disadvantaged by historical government policy,\u201d he wrote.",

      "bodyText": "A long-lost interview with a young man claiming to be Banksy, the world\u2019s most famous anonymous street artist, has been found in a television company\u2019s vault. The interview was filmed before the elusive artist\u2019s breakthrough 2003 Turf War exhibition in London and features a man whose face is partially obscured with a baseball cap and T-shirt. It was shown on ITV London at the time but then forgotten about until the Bristol-based ITV News reporter Robert Murphy stumbled upon it when he was doing some research on Bansky. The figure is shown stencilling a picture of a black insect on to a wall and working on a piece in which a baby is playing with alphabet building blocks that spell out: \u201cKILL MORE.\u201d Both pieces have long been attributed to Banksy. The two-minute report, by the ITV News correspondent Haig Gordon, features the man speaking for 35 seconds. His eyes, eyebrows and forehead are visible. \u201cI\u2019m disguised because you can\u2019t really be a graffiti writer and then go public,\u201d he tells Gordon, who has since retired. \u201cThe two things don\u2019t quite go together.\u201d In Turf War, Bansky decorated live farm animals including cattle with \u201cthis way up\u201d arrows and stencilled blue police patrol car colours on pigs. The interviewee says: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make an entertaining picture at the best of times but at least if you have something that wanders around and licks its nose and urinates in front of you it\u2019s going to make the picture a bit more interesting.\u201d Asked about spraying \u201cDesignated Riot Area\u201d on Nelson\u2019s Column, the man says: \u201cI thought that was quite funny.\u201d Gordon asks: \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I pass your details on to the police?\u201d He replies: \u201cNo. What details have you got?\u201d Murphy found the report in the ITV News archives and conceded it was impossible to say if the man was Banksy.

Earlier, Marshall had put himself on the radar of James Bond fans when he was seen in The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) as Commander Talbot, captain of a British nuclear submarine captured by a supertanker. It brought another grisly end for the actor when Talbot was killed by a grenade while storming the ship\u2019s control room after Roger Moore\u2019s 007 freed him and his crew. Marshall\u2019s talent was largely lost to British film and TV producers and directors after he moved to Australia in 1983, although he made a few returns to his homeland and was seen in Australian soaps broadcast in Britain. He was born in Battersea, south London, and on leaving the local Salesian college went through jobs in an insurance office and as a sales rep while acting with amateur companies.

Another pivotal role for Marshall came in the film Quatermass and the Pit (1967), a big-screen remake of the writer Nigel Kneale\u2019s third sci-fi serial for TV about a scientist confronting alien forces. He played Potter, a bomb squad captain identifying an unexploded device unearthed during an archaeological dig as a German V-missile. It was his fourth appearance in a Hammer Films production. Earlier he was the Russian villager Vasily in Rasputin: The Mad Monk (1966), played Tom in The Witches (1966) and was Dominic in The Viking Queen (1967). After moving to Australia in 1983, Marshall remained a prolific screen actor. Among many appearances in television dramas, he starred in Golden Pennies (1985) as a pioneering Englishman seeking his fortune in an 1850s gold-rush mining area, and played Duncan Stewart, Australian ambassador to a fictional south-east Asian country, in the first two series of Embassy (1990-91). His soap roles included Piet Koonig in A Country Practice (1983), Dr Jonathan Edmonds in Prisoner (retitled Prisoner: Cell Block H in Britain, 1984), Gerard Singer in Neighbours (1987) and Ron Hawkins in The Flying Doctors (1988), and he took two parts in Home and Away \u2013 John Simpson (1998) and Trevor Bardwell (2003). In 1989 Marshall hosted the first series of Australia\u2019s Most Wanted, featuring real-life unsolved crimes. There were occasional returns to Britain for roles that included DSI Don Roberts in two 1997 episodes of Thief Takers and a vet with a drink problem in Heartbeat in 1998. Marshall is survived by his wife, Vicki, and their three sons, Sean, Paul and Joshua. \u2022 Bryan Marshall, actor, born 19 May 1938; died 25 June 2019",

      "body": "<p>The UK baked in another record-breaking heatwave last weekend, which was made at least five times more likely by climate change (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/02/climate-change-european-heatwave-likelier\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 3 July). Weather bulletins are naturally the first point of information for events like these. They provide us with the information we need to act, whether that\u2019s keeping our children indoors on extremely hot days or taking our umbrella to work when it\u2019s expected to rain.</p> <p>As climate change gathers pace, dangerous weather is expected to rise in frequency. We once chose only how to respond to the weather. We now face profound choices that will define how the weather responds to us. Given that, and what is at stake, it surely makes sense that broadcasters communicate the best understanding of how climate change is disrupting our weather \u2013 and is expected to disrupt it further still if left unchecked. With that understanding we can make the collective choices needed to preserve the fragile ecological balance that sustains us.</p> <p>It\u2019s time for the regular weather bulletins to start including climate science communication. Broadcasters must use the tools, expertise and trust they enjoy to provide the information we need to protect ourselves from harm.<br><strong>Max Wakefield</strong><br><em>10:10 Climate Action</em><br><strong>Adam Corner</strong><br><em>Climate Outreach</em></p> <p>\u2022 In her conversation with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Greta Thunberg says: \u201cWe aren\u2019t destroying the biosphere because we are selfish. We are doing it simply because we are unaware. I think that is very hopeful, because once we know, once we realise, then we change, then we act\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/29/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-met-greta-thunberg-hope-contagious-climate\" title=\"\">Show up. Stand up. Act.</a>, Weekend, 29 June).</p> <p>Oh dear. Who\u2019s going to tell her? Most of us do know \u2013 and care \u2013 but we don\u2019t act. We\u2019re deterred by the enduring success of powerful and corrupt global short-termism. Ocasio-Cortez was keen to tell Thunberg about the immense lobbying power of vested interests. Perhaps Thunberg should set her formidable sights on those corporate obstructionists.<br><strong>Chris Hughes</strong><br><em>Leicester</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your article on tourism (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jul/01/global-tourism-hits-record-highs-but-who-goes-where-on-holiday\" title=\"\">The briefing</a>, Journal, 1 July) quotes Claudio Milano from Ostelea School of Tourism saying \u201cwe need new indicators and a new set of measures of tourism\u201d. Perhaps we could start with the effect that flying has on climate catastrophe. The CO<sub>2</sub> is emitted above the trophosphere, and stays in the atmosphere longer than CO<sub>2</sub> emitted at ground level because it takes longer to percolate down to the level of vegetation which will consume some of it.</p> <p>So perhaps we could tax the airlines for the oil consumed, which at present is untaxed. As your map indicated, it is the rich minority world that goes touring the poorer majority world where the ecological damage is done. The new indicators and set of measures of tourism should make this clear to make people aware of the atmospheric damage flying causes.<br><strong>Ann Bliss</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Re the letters on flying (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/01/aviation-industry-must-get-real-about-emissions\" title=\"\">Aviation industry must get real about emissions</a>, 2 July). We planned a camping trip to Sweden this summer but changed our minds when we realised that all car ferries crossing from the UK to Scandinavia have recently been discontinued and transporting the camping gear in our car to a port in Holland or Belgium would have necessitated driving hundreds of extra miles through Holland, Germany and Denmark.</p> <p>But we decided to persevere with our trip, and to go by train. We spent at least two bad-tempered days planning the train journeys from London to Stockholm and estimated they would take two-and-a-half-days and cost, one way, including overnight stops in cheap hotels in Hamburg and Copenhagen, at least \u00a3350 per person. Compare that with about \u00a350 for a two-and-a-half-hour flight from London to Stockholm, as advertised on the net.</p> <p>Does this perverse incentive to fly exist in the whole world? Can anyone explain the disconnect between the worldwide scientific consensus about the climate emergency and our political paralysis?<br><strong>Jackie Farley</strong><br><em>Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 The first letter above was amended on 5 July 2019. An earlier version omitted the intended two signatories and instead used the name of an unintended signatory.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK baked in another record-breaking heatwave last weekend, which was made at least five times more likely by climate change (Report, 3 July). Weather bulletins are naturally the first point of information for events like these. They provide us with the information we need to act, whether that\u2019s keeping our children indoors on extremely hot days or taking our umbrella to work when it\u2019s expected to rain. As climate change gathers pace, dangerous weather is expected to rise in frequency. We once chose only how to respond to the weather. We now face profound choices that will define how the weather responds to us. Given that, and what is at stake, it surely makes sense that broadcasters communicate the best understanding of how climate change is disrupting our weather \u2013 and is expected to disrupt it further still if left unchecked. With that understanding we can make the collective choices needed to preserve the fragile ecological balance that sustains us. It\u2019s time for the regular weather bulletins to start including climate science communication. Broadcasters must use the tools, expertise and trust they enjoy to provide the information we need to protect ourselves from harm. Max Wakefield 10:10 Climate Action Adam Corner Climate Outreach \u2022 In her conversation with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Greta Thunberg says: \u201cWe aren\u2019t destroying the biosphere because we are selfish. We are doing it simply because we are unaware. I think that is very hopeful, because once we know, once we realise, then we change, then we act\u201d (Show up. Stand up. Act., Weekend, 29 June). Oh dear. Who\u2019s going to tell her? Most of us do know \u2013 and care \u2013 but we don\u2019t act. We\u2019re deterred by the enduring success of powerful and corrupt global short-termism. Ocasio-Cortez was keen to tell Thunberg about the immense lobbying power of vested interests. Perhaps Thunberg should set her formidable sights on those corporate obstructionists. Chris Hughes Leicester \u2022 Your article on tourism (The briefing, Journal, 1 July) quotes Claudio Milano from Ostelea School of Tourism saying \u201cwe need new indicators and a new set of measures of tourism\u201d. Perhaps we could start with the effect that flying has on climate catastrophe. The CO2 is emitted above the trophosphere, and stays in the atmosphere longer than CO2 emitted at ground level because it takes longer to percolate down to the level of vegetation which will consume some of it. So perhaps we could tax the airlines for the oil consumed, which at present is untaxed. As your map indicated, it is the rich minority world that goes touring the poorer majority world where the ecological damage is done. The new indicators and set of measures of tourism should make this clear to make people aware of the atmospheric damage flying causes. Ann Bliss London \u2022 Re the letters on flying (Aviation industry must get real about emissions, 2 July). We planned a camping trip to Sweden this summer but changed our minds when we realised that all car ferries crossing from the UK to Scandinavia have recently been discontinued and transporting the camping gear in our car to a port in Holland or Belgium would have necessitated driving hundreds of extra miles through Holland, Germany and Denmark. But we decided to persevere with our trip, and to go by train. We spent at least two bad-tempered days planning the train journeys from London to Stockholm and estimated they would take two-and-a-half-days and cost, one way, including overnight stops in cheap hotels in Hamburg and Copenhagen, at least \u00a3350 per person. Compare that with about \u00a350 for a two-and-a-half-hour flight from London to Stockholm, as advertised on the net. Does this perverse incentive to fly exist in the whole world? Can anyone explain the disconnect between the worldwide scientific consensus about the climate emergency and our political paralysis? Jackie Farley Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire \u2022 The first letter above was amended on 5 July 2019. An earlier version omitted the intended two signatories and instead used the name of an unintended signatory.",

      "bodyText": "The British car industry has accused the government of undermining the sector after sales of electrified vehicles fell for the first time in more than two years. Sales of cars with alternative fuels \u2013 including battery electric vehicles and hybrids \u2013 were down 11.8% in June compared with the same month last year, the first annual decline since April 2017, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Electrified vehicles accounted for about one in every 17 cars sold in June. Their share of the market needs to increase rapidly for the UK to meet its target of net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. Battery electric vehicle sales continued to rise strongly, by 61.7% year on year, but sales of plug-in hybrids, which combine a combustion engine with a battery that can be charged externally, halved compared with last year. The SMMT blamed the downgrade of government subsidies in October. The \u00a32,500 subsidy for plug-in hybrid vehicles was cut altogether, and the government reduced the grant for pure electric vehicles from \u00a34,500 to \u00a33,500. Carmakers have relied on the subsidies to stimulate demand for electrified vehicles. Falls in sales of hybrids, which still emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide, would make it more difficult for carmakers to cut their fleet average emissions, opening them up to the risk of hundreds of millions of euros in fines. Battery electric vehicles emit no carbon dioxide directly, but consumer uptake has been held back by concerns over their range and a lack of readily available charging infrastructure, as well as cost. Large-volume carmakers must reduce the average emissions of the cars they sell to below 95kg of carbon dioxide per kilometre driven after 2021. Only two brands \u2013 the electric vehicle maker Tesla and Daimler\u2019s Smart microcars \u2013 out of 50 analysed by the data company Jato Dynamics met the limits in 2018. Overall, new UK car sales in June were down 4.9% year on year, the fourth consecutive month of falling sales. The industry has blamed the slump in demand on Brexit uncertainty and the decline of diesel vehicles after emissions scandals. Meanwhile, sales of diesel models fell by one-fifth year on year, further complicating the industry\u2019s efforts to meet carbon dioxide emissions targets. Diesel cars emit particles that directly cause health problems as well as poisonous nitrogen oxides, but they tend to have a lower carbon dioxide output than those running on petrol. Relations between the industry and the government have been strained in recent years, with carmakers complaining of inconsistent policy. At the same time, executives across the sector have warned a no-deal Brexit would be deeply damaging. Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: \u201cAnother month of decline is worrying but the fact that sales of alternatively fuelled cars are going into reverse is a grave concern. Manufacturers have invested billions to bring these vehicles to market, but their efforts are now being undermined by confusing policies and the premature removal of purchase incentives. \u201cIf we are to see widespread uptake of these vehicles, which are an essential part of a smooth transition to zero-emission transport, we need world-class, long-term incentives and substantial investment in infrastructure.\u201d A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: \u201cThe plug-in car grant has supported the purchase of 180,000 new cars with over \u00a3700m, including 100,000 plug-in hybrids, and the government is now focusing on the cleanest, zero-emission models.

Constable had no time for agricultural labourers, whom he regarded as potential agitators and troublemakers, and even less for Travellers. It is true that his Gypsy is in the foreground of his composition, but this only highlights her isolation from the community signified by the village in the background.</p> <p>An important formal source for Constable\u2019s picture is Claude\u2019s Hagar and the Angel, and it may be that the links between the two works go beyond structural similarity. The Bible tells that Hagar became pregnant by Abraham, but left his house after an understandable row with Abraham\u2019s childless wife Sarah.

      "bodyText": "As Professor Judith Okely notes (Letters, 2 July), John Constable does indeed include a Gypsy woman and her baby in his 1828 painting of the Vale of Dedham, but this is unlikely to be as a sign of sympathy. Constable had no time for agricultural labourers, whom he regarded as potential agitators and troublemakers, and even less for Travellers. It is true that his Gypsy is in the foreground of his composition, but this only highlights her isolation from the community signified by the village in the background. An important formal source for Constable\u2019s picture is Claude\u2019s Hagar and the Angel, and it may be that the links between the two works go beyond structural similarity. The Bible tells that Hagar became pregnant by Abraham, but left his house after an understandable row with Abraham\u2019s childless wife Sarah. The angel is sent to require Hagar\u2019s return to her previous abode (submission to the established authority). I doubt the reactionary Constable (a natural Brexiteer \u201cavant la lettre\u201d) would have been praising the Gypsy\u2019s right to choose her own lifestyle; rather he would have been intimating the need for her to live according to the dictates of her \u201cbetters\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Zoe Williams cites the American sociologist Elizabeth Armstrong, who \u201cexamined the evidence for the detrimental effects of stress on a pregnancy. The only demonstrable correlation was between a profound stress event \u2013 the death of an existing child, or spouse \u2013 during pregnancy, and a negative outcome\u201d (The Handmaid\u2019s Tale comes to life in Alabama, 2 July). Several scientific studies have shown a significant effect on the offspring of pregnant women living in the area of catastrophic events, such as 9/11 and the earthquake in Kobe, Japan, in 1995. The ratio of boys to girls born alive a few months later is always reduced. The male foetus is more vulnerable than his female sister to death from severe maternal stress. Conversely, when women are secure and optimistic they produce more boys than usual. ONS data of sex ratios at birth show three such peaks, in 1919, 1945 and 1974. All were times of hope and social cohesion, the first two at the end of world wars, and the third when social inequality in the UK (and in the rest of the western world) was at its lowest ever. While the sex ratio was relatively high in the 30 years after 1945, it has settled since the mid-1980s at levels not seen since the 1930s.

No one expected it to last, but Britain left with a certain dignity.</p> \n<p>So why did Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, take it on himself this week to revisit the scene? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/01/jeremy-hunt-backs-hong-kong-citizens-right-to-protest\" title=\"\">He applauded</a> Hong Kong\u2019s recent demonstrations and warned Beijing not to crack down on the rioters.

      "bodyText": "It was June 1997 and I was standing in the crowd on Hong Kong\u2019s waterfront in torrential rain. A sad bugle played as the flag was lowered, and the royal yacht Britannia carried the Prince of Wales out to sea \u2013 and Britain out of its last Asian colony. We all had one thought. Thank goodness that\u2019s over. Hong Kong\u2019s last governor, Chris Patten, left what China clearly saw as a mess on the carpet, an elected assembly under the slogan \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. No one expected it to last, but Britain left with a certain dignity. So why did Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, take it on himself this week to revisit the scene? He applauded Hong Kong\u2019s recent demonstrations and warned Beijing not to crack down on the rioters. He said the Chinese regime should not use a few broken windows as \u201ca pretext for repression\u201d. Britain would not stand for it. He said there would be \u201cserious consequences\u201d. As was glaringly obvious, Hunt\u2019s remarks had nothing to do with Hong Kong. He was puffing up his chest and signalling virtue in his contest for Downing Street with Boris Johnson. He wanted to show himself a player who could talk big on the world stage, who could move mountains. Johnson, he implied, could only move a few London cycle lanes.

Carberry agrees: \u201cYou read a lot of people on Facebook now saying that if this isn\u2019t a good reason to vote for independence then what is?\u201d Nor is Russell convinced by May\u2019s expected announcement of further funding for devolved nations from the UK government: \u201cTheresa May might be on her legacy tour but she won\u2019t be in charge for much longer, so I don\u2019t think her promises are worth having any truck with.\u201d But the prime minster is not entirely friendless in Stirling. Josie Day, who runs an art gallery and picture framers\u2019 further along the Walk, agrees with Theresa May \u201call the way\u201d that the UK is \u201cstronger together\u201d. Day is particularly concerned about the impact of independence on taxation, which she believes is already crippling businesses like hers under the SNP government at Holyrood. \u201cSeparatism has brought about a lot of hatred and upset in family groups and among friends,\u201d she cautions. \u201cPeople who believe in the union tend to keep quiet about it, but they come out to vote on the day.\u201d While Day voted to remain within the UK and the EU, she is adamantly not one of those Scottish remainers who pollsters have lately observed considering independence more seriously as the prospect of no deal looms. The Scottish Conservative MP for Stirling, Stephen Kerr, noted recently that Johnson \u201chas to project a different image to the people of Scotland\u201d, and he has not won Day\u2019s support. She would prefer Jeremy Hunt: \u201cHe looks more statesmanlike.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A quarter of betting shops on UK high streets have been slated for closure, putting 12,000 jobs at risk, with William Hill the latest bookmaker to blame job cuts on stricter regulation of fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs). Restrictions cutting the maximum stake on the controversial betting machines from \u00a3100 per spin to \u00a32 came into force in April after a lengthy campaign by activists and MPs, who linked the controversial machines to gambling addiction. Britain\u2019s leading bookmakers, including Ladbrokes Coral, William Hill and Betfred, have since announced plans to shed jobs, blaming the loss of a product that contributed about half of their annual high-street income. William Hill said on Thursday that it could close 700 high-street shops, putting 4,500 jobs under threat. The Ladbrokes owner, GVC, has already said 900 shops could close, threatening 5,000 staff, while Betfred has predicted up to 500 closures, which would reduce its headcount by 2,500. The combined total of 2,100 shops represents 25% of the UK\u2019s 8,423 bricks-and-mortar bookmakers, potentially affecting up to 12,500 staff, or nearly 12% of people employed in the UK gambling industry. But the impact is significantly less than the 4,500 closures and 21,000 job losses that bookmakers predicted in a widely discredited report submitted to the government last year in an effort to influence the FOBT decision. Tracey Crouch, the former sports minister who pioneered curbs on FOBTs before resigning over a planned delay in their implementation, said it was too convenient for bookmakers to blame the policy. \u201cWhile I am sorry to hear of job losses, the truth is there was huge overinflation in the number of bookmakers on our high streets because of the profit-making capacity of FOBTs. \u201cThe closures shouldn\u2019t only be blamed on stake changes though \u2013 that would be too simplistic. \u201cThere has been consolidation within the industry and a drive from the bookmakers themselves to less costly online gambling for some time now and mass closures were predicted in the industry-funded KPMG report, even without stake reductions.\u201d Industry statistics indicate that gambling firms\u2019 high-street betting empires were in decline before the stake cut, as more and more punters switch to online gambling brands, often owned by the same businesses. Income from racecourse and bookmaker betting fell from \u00a33.3bn in April 2015 to \u00a33.2bn in September 2018, according to regulator the Gambling Commission. During the same period, online betting income jumped from \u00a34.2bn to \u00a35.6bn. A survey by YouGov indicates that online gambling is now more popular, with 13% of people admitting to placing a bet on the internet in the past year, compared to 11% at an event or in a bookmaker\u2019s shop. While GVC, William Hill and Betfred have all said they expect shop closures and job losses as a result of the FOBT restrictions, Paddy Power Betfair, which recently changed its name to Flutter Entertainment, has said it expects to see no impact. Tom Blenkinsop, operations director at the betting shop workers union, Community, called on William Hill to do everything it could to minimise redundancies and find alternatives where possible. \u201cThe government also has a role to play and must look at what support they can offer to workers whose jobs are threatened as a consequence of changes to the law around FOBTs,\u201d he said. \u201cBetting shops provide an important source of local employment and many of our members have served the company loyally for years. Workers don\u2019t deserve to be the victims of the changes happening in the industry as a result of either government policy or the significant shift towards online gambling.\u201d William Hill said it would do whatever it could to cut jobs through voluntary redundancies and find alternative roles for affected staff. FOBTs were branded a \u201csocial blight\u201d by the government last year after a lengthy review, during which bookmakers vehemently resisted any cut in FOBT stakes, only to see them reduced to the lowest possible level of \u00a32. The low stake effectively rendered the machines, which account for more than half of high street bookmakers\u2019 revenues, uneconomical. Gambling firms have since been at pains to stave off similar curbs on their fast-growing online businesses, offering to impose a voluntary ban on advertising during TV sports and increase their contribution to gambling charities to \u00a360m.",

And, yes, I am very, very much here for descriptions of tequila as \u201cfarm-to-bottle\u201d, an epithet that really plays up the wholesome rural charm of this most pastorally idyllic of all the spirits.</p> <p>Charlie will be a \u201cgreat addition\u201d to the team, according to the brand\u2019s other owner, particularly in the way he can \u201cpromote the brand and tell our story\u201d. Over to Sheen himself. \u201cWhen the company reached out to me with an opportunity to get involved with their organisation,\u201d Charlie muses, presumably lucratively, \u201cI was instantly interested and excited, as, in the past, Don Sue\u00f1os\u2019 Tequila Blanco was one of my favourite sipping spirits due to its superior taste and quality.\u201d</p> <p>Clearly the key phrase in that sentence is \u201cin the past\u201d. And in the circumstances, I am afraid we are going to have to go there. A few years ago, the then Two and a Half Men star was fired from his position on the show as the highest-paid actor in US television, following a series of what convention demands we style as \u201cbizarre public antics\u201d. What had begun as gateway 9/11 truthing and anti-vax nonsense deepened into multiple spousal assault allegations and hotel arrests. There was Sheen\u2019s claim he was a warlock, the suggestion his veins ran with tiger blood <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/charlie-sheen-today-show-interview-ive-got-adonis-dna-tiger-blood-and-cbs-should-be-licking-my-feet/\" title=\"\">and that he was in possession of something called Adonis DNA</a>.

The obvious issues with the collaboration suggest there is a desperate scarcity crisis in the pool of celebrity influencers. To wit, there are now so few celebrities not shackled to a spirits brand that marketers are left with no one to turn to push their wares but notorious alcoholics who are on the wagon. We can only wait to see how this one pans out, along with Sheen\u2019s sober sponsor, presumably. In the meantime, line your stomach with something starchy, and let\u2019s take a look at some of his competition in the celebrity booze market.</p> <h2><strong>George Clooney\u2019s Casamigas tequila</strong><br></h2> <p>Although Clooney and his associates <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/george-clooney-highest-paid-actor-because-of-tequila-2018-8?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">sold their tequila brand Casamigas for $1bn last year</a>, he is still very much involved in publicising it. If you go to a bar and they ask you \u201cwhich tequila?\u201d, maybe request the one that makes you act like George Clooney as opposed to Charlie Sheen.</p> <h2><strong>Chris Noth\u2019s Ambhar </strong><strong>tequila</strong><br></h2> <p>Undeterred by the crowded celebrity tequila marketplace, The Good Wife and Sex in the City star Chris Noth got in on the act last year with his purchase of Ambhar, a brand described as \u201cultra-premium\u201d. Or, as Chris <a href=\"https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2018/12/noth-my-tequila-is-better-than-clooneys/\" title=\"\">preferred to categorise</a>, it\u2019s \u201cbetter than Clooney\u2019s\u201d. The thing I like about that quote was that Noth gave it while in London to pick up last year\u2019s Cigar Smoker of the Year award, allowing him to go full Swiss Toni. \u201cSmoking a cigarette is like having sex,\u201d Noth explained, \u201cwhile smoking a good cigar is like making love, which is how I view Ambhar.\u201d The agave for this is \u201chand-harvested in accordance with ancient recipes\u201d, according to its PR material, with \u201cancient recipes\u201d being one way of euphemising the fact that what we are dealing with here, at base, is tarted-up moonshine. Or as Noth prefers to put it: \u201cFine tequila is a drink that promotes conversation and mediation.\u201d To which the only reasonable response is: lol ok.</p> <h2><strong>Marilyn Manson\u2019s Mansinthe</strong><br></h2> <p>Ever the iconoclast\u2122, Marilyn Manson shunned the basics arena of whiskies or tequilas when he came to distil his own essence into retailable alcoholic form. Instead, he went for some kind of 66% proof absinthe analogue, which he naturally named <a href=\"https://www.absinthe.de/en/absinthe/switzerland/oliver-matter/absinthe-mansinthe/\" title=\"\">Mansinthe</a>. According to the original publicity material produced around the launch, the singer \u201cdiscovered the famed drink on Millennium Eve with Johnny Depp, and now drinks the potent beverage exclusively instead of regular booze\u201d. Or, as Manson <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/68998k/marilyn-manson-the-pale-emperor-interview-2015\" title=\"\">explained to Vice a few years ago</a>: he no longer drinks it, \u201cout of vanity\u2019s sake. It has too much sugar in it. I just felt like it really restricted me from being fit enough to kick someone\u2019s ass. Also, you know, when you\u2019re fitter it makes your cock look bigger. Absinthe is the same as having someone with small hands hold your dick \u2026 when you don\u2019t drink it.\u201d Not sure whether that description rules this in or out as the bottle you\u2019re planning to buy your kid\u2019s headteacher or your business associate this Christmas; I merely pass it on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"673325c6e01555cef97485013f7f66c285fd0032\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/673325c6e01555cef97485013f7f66c285fd0032/0_701_2516_2516/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew McConaughey: a roving ambassador for Wild Turkey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew McConaughey: a roving ambassador for Wild Turkey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Kern/Getty Images for Wild Turkey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Matthew McConaughey and Wild Turkey</strong><br></h2> <p>Like all of the truly refined connoisseurs, I am interested in any alcohol being marketed by a man whose most famous intoxication experience is being arrested and hauled downtown <a href=\"https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/the-beach-bum-matthew-mcconaughey-arrest-bongos\" title=\"\">for playing naked bongos</a>. There\u2019s a gentility to it, you know? Furthermore, you should be profoundly impressed by the fact that McConaughey is not simply the brand ambassador for Wild Turkey bourbon, but its creative director. As Wild Turkey explains, the actor serves as \u201cthe chief storyteller for Wild Turkey both behind the camera and in front of it\u201d. Think of him as bourbon\u2019s leading auteur \u2013 the Orson Welles of getting smashed.</p> <h2><strong>Danny DeVito\u2019s Limoncello</strong><br></h2> <p>As an implacable adorer of Danny DeVito, I believe he may be the one guy who could convince me that limoncello isn\u2019t just the drink they give you free at the end of an Italian meal, and that there\u2019s a reason for that (see also: grappa). He also functions as quite the heritage pick in this roundup, having launched his own brand shortly after he <a href=\"https://people.com/celebrity/clooney-had-brutal-night-drinking-with-devito/\" title=\"\">appeared charmingly plastered on American daytime talkshow The View</a>, attributing his state to a night partying with George Clooney. \u201cI knew it was the last seven limoncellos that was going to get me,\u201d he reflected, and a perfect brand was born shortly thereafter.</p> <h2>Dan Aykroyd\u2019s Crystal Head vodka<br></h2> <p>Forget everything you ever knew about vodka production when contemplating the actor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.crystalheadvodka.com/en/age_check\" title=\"\">Crystal Head vodka</a>, which is sold in a bottle in the shape of a skull. The process: \u201cHighest-quality peaches-and-cream corn is distilled four times into a neutral grain spirit and blended with pristine water from Newfoundland, Canada. The liquid is then filtered seven times, of which three are through layers of semi-precious crystals known as Herkimer diamonds.\u201d Just like they did it back in the old country, even as Peter the Great was encouraging them to drink deep and pay off any debts by committing to 25 years\u2019 service in the army. According to its marketing, the bottle is skull-shaped because it is a \u201csymbol of life\u201d. And if you buy the idea that the skull is a famous symbol of life, you\u2019ll certainly accept that it reflects \u201cpower and enlightenment\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Ryan Reynolds\u2019s Aviation American gin</strong><br></h2> <p>We conclude with the majestic Reynolds, on the basis that the Deadpool star has built an entire promotional strategy around taking the piss out of the celebrity artisan spirits culture. Shortly after acquiring the Aviation brand last year, Reynolds released an advert suggesting every juniper berry was individually blessed and apologised to before being pulverised, and claiming such things as that the citrus fruits are \u201cmisted using only the tears of Aviation\u2019s owner \u2013 me\u201d. Other marketing strategies have including his giving his only gin a four-star Amazon review, under the pen name Champ Nightengale. \u201cWhen I woke up the next day, I mentioned to my wife Linda that last night must have been a REAL blowout because I slept in my clothes,\u201d this ran. \u201cI also noticed it was really hard to look out the window at the Seattle skyline. Partly because of the bright sun (I\u2019ve always been sensitive to light) but also because I don\u2019t live in Seattle. I live in Coral Gables, Florida. Also, it\u2019s important to note, until that morning, I\u2019d never met anyone named Linda.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s competition regulator will seek to have ticket resale website Viagogo found in contempt of court, after it allegedly ignored repeated warnings to comply with consumer law. The Competition and Markets Authority has sent a \u201cletter before action\u201d to Viagogo, triggering a process that it had warned would begin unless the company cleaned up its often-criticised business practices. If found in contempt, the company risks significant fines, while directors could even face prison. The digital, culture, media and sport select committee chair, Damian Collins, welcomed the move, saying: \u201cThe CMA clearly shared our concern and we look forward to a speedy resolution to end what has been a troubling and distressing time for music fans who\u2019ve had bad experiences with the site.\u201d Labour MP Sharon Hodgson said she hoped the action would force Viagogo to change its \u201cparasitical\u201d business model. The Switzerland-based website has been criticised for flouting consumer law and teaming up with ticket touts to squeeze high prices out of fans for access to events such as a talk by Michelle Obama and charity concerts by Ed Sheeran. The CMA obtained a court order last November, demanding that Viagogo overhaul its website to abide by consumer law before mid-January. Viagogo has repeatedly insisted that it is doing so but the regulator said on Thursday that it was still in breach, despite several warnings. The CMA said Viagogo was not doing enough to inform buyers that they might be turned away at the door if venues or promoters have banned resale. Viagogo is also publishing \u201cmisleading\u201d information about the number of tickets available, it said, while some seat numbers are still not being displayed on ticket listings. Under pressure from the CMA, Viagogo has begun printing the names of touts who sell more than 100 tickets a year but the regulator said addresses were often incomplete. Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, said: \u201cIt is simply not good enough that Viagogo is continuing to drag its heels by not complying in full with this important court order.\u201d He said fans \u201cdeserve to know the facts before parting with their hard-earned money.\u201d. \u201cAfter the CMA repeatedly raised concerns with Viagogo [\u2026] we are very concerned that it still hasn\u2019t done what it was ordered to do,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are now taking the next step in legal action to ask a court to find Viagogo in contempt.\u201d Viagogo has been monitored by an independent adjudicator, a process the regulator said had secured \u00a3400,000 in refunds for customers who had been refused them. The company said it was \u201csurprised\u201d by the CMA\u2019s move and believed it had until 18 July to comply with the court order. It denied being in breach of compliance with regulations, adding that the independent adjudicator had said it was \u201creaching compliance\u201d. \u201cWe will continue to work closely with the CMA, as we have been for the past year, to ensure we are offering the best possible consumer experience and protections in the UK,\u201d it said.",

The moves come a week after publication of an undercover investigation by the Guardian and ITV News, which posed questions about the business interests of Woodhouse, who has raised more than \u00a380m from private investors but whose firms have a multimillion-pound \u201cblack hole\u201d. At a high court hearing on Thursday, brought by creditors seeking to place three Woodhouse businesses into interim administration, Judge Sally Barber said: \u201cThis appears to be a thoroughly dishonest business model and a shameful abuse of the privileges of limited liability trading. I am entirely satisfied by the evidence before me that this court must take immediate action.\u201d Limited liability is a legal structure that means business owners\u2019 private assets are not at risk when a company fails.

Millions of pounds from those stalled care home projects were loaned to another company in which Woodhouse owns 60% of the shares but that company has gone into administration and the cash appears to have vanished. Investors have grown increasingly concerned about their money and Woodhouse admits that he has fallen behind paying their scheduled returns. Woodhouse did not appear personally in court but his barrister said that he had not had sufficient time to respond in detail to the application for an administration order, while he argued that the matters did not need dealing with urgently by the court. Barber said: \u201cThese are serious, serious, matters which your client has to respond to in his witness statement [but has not] \u2026 They are not unsubstantiated. They are based fairly and squarely on the company\u2019s own records.\u201d She added: \u201cI do not accept that submission [that the case is not urgent]. Ordinary members of the public have collectively invested millions of pounds into three companies. They have been led to believe that their investment monies were ringfenced and used only for particular projects. This was untrue. \u201cInstead their monies were paid out, often by so-called intercompany loans to other companies under the same ownership, with little or no prospect of recovery. In a number of cases such loans, running into millions, have been written off as irrecoverable already.\u201d A third care home company \u2013 MBI Walsden Care Ltd \u2013 avoided an interim administration order as it is no longer trading. The company is owned by Woodhouse but he is not a director. The firm\u2019s sole director pledged to the court that assets would not be dissipated and the business\u2019s records safeguarded. Woodhouse\u2019s barrister declined to comment on her client\u2019s behalf in court. Woodhouse denies any wrongdoing. He has previously said that investors\u2019 money is held in bank accounts and that he would build the outstanding care homes.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>DO YOU REALLY LOVE THE LAMP OR ARE YOU JUST SAYING IT BECAUSE YOU SAW IT?</strong></h2> <p>Having spent 13 years as a player at Chelsea, Frank Lampard really knows the club\u2019s DNA. Swab its saliva with one of those cotton bud thingummies, stick the sample under a microscope and he would be able to identify that particular deoxyribonucleic acid in a heartbeat, even if the teeny, tiny Ron \u201cChopper\u201d Harrises and Po\u2019 John Terrys patrolling those double helix spirals, unceremoniously booting any rogue sugar or phosphate molecules, might be a little bit of a giveaway.</p> <p>And now, due almost entirely to his intimate knowledge of this hereditary material, Lampard has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/03/frank-lampard-unveiled-new-chelsea-manager-thursday\">unveiled as Chelsea\u2019s new manager</a> following a minor delay prompted by technical shortcomings on FaceSpace and its disgraceful social media cousins, which meant they would have missed out on those all-important clicks. With just one season\u2019s worth of gaffering experience with Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County under his belt, the club have taken a punt on their record goalscorer to pick up where chain-smoking Italian curmudgeon Maurizio Sarri left off.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/04/frank-lampard-chelsea-home-manager-transfer-embargo-injuries-champions-league\">Frank Lampard is home but has taken on a tough task at Chelsea | Dominic Fifield</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI am immensely proud to be returning to [Frank Lampard\u2019s] Chelsea as head coach,\u201d cheered FLC\u2019s Frank Lampard, beaming with pen poised over a three-year contract worth \u00a34m per year. Noticing the new manager had brought along an orange root vegetable with a green stalk attached to a stick with a piece of string, the interest of a reporter from FLC\u2019s in-house propaganda wing, Pravda, was understandably piqued. \u201cI want to work with those players,\u201d he tooted of FLC\u2019s swollen ranks of academy players who never actually get to play for the club. \u201cI want to dangle the carrot. Can you work hard? Can you compete? Can you get in the team?\u201d</p> <p>With FLC banned from signing new players, their youngsters will never have a better chance of grabbing that carrot and their new boss will have his work cut out. But his popularity among FLC fans and a press pack which will almost certainly find somebody else to blame for anything that might go wrong early doors, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/04/frank-lampard-chelsea-home-manager-transfer-embargo-injuries-champions-league\">will undoubtedly stand him in good stead</a>. Indeed, being a likable club legend rather than an unloved 60-year-old Italian former banker means he has already got off to the perfect start. But while while we can only speculate over whether he\u2019ll be able to emulate the largely unappreciated success of his predecessor, one suspects the latest addition to the extensive Stamford Bridge managerial DNA database will be given every chance.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cThese are my watches, give me my watches.

      "bodyText": "DO YOU REALLY LOVE THE LAMP OR ARE YOU JUST SAYING IT BECAUSE YOU SAW IT? Having spent 13 years as a player at Chelsea, Frank Lampard really knows the club\u2019s DNA. Swab its saliva with one of those cotton bud thingummies, stick the sample under a microscope and he would be able to identify that particular deoxyribonucleic acid in a heartbeat, even if the teeny, tiny Ron \u201cChopper\u201d Harrises and Po\u2019 John Terrys patrolling those double helix spirals, unceremoniously booting any rogue sugar or phosphate molecules, might be a little bit of a giveaway. And now, due almost entirely to his intimate knowledge of this hereditary material, Lampard has been unveiled as Chelsea\u2019s new manager following a minor delay prompted by technical shortcomings on FaceSpace and its disgraceful social media cousins, which meant they would have missed out on those all-important clicks. With just one season\u2019s worth of gaffering experience with Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County under his belt, the club have taken a punt on their record goalscorer to pick up where chain-smoking Italian curmudgeon Maurizio Sarri left off. \u201cI am immensely proud to be returning to [Frank Lampard\u2019s] Chelsea as head coach,\u201d cheered FLC\u2019s Frank Lampard, beaming with pen poised over a three-year contract worth \u00a34m per year. Noticing the new manager had brought along an orange root vegetable with a green stalk attached to a stick with a piece of string, the interest of a reporter from FLC\u2019s in-house propaganda wing, Pravda, was understandably piqued. \u201cI want to work with those players,\u201d he tooted of FLC\u2019s swollen ranks of academy players who never actually get to play for the club. \u201cI want to dangle the carrot. Can you work hard? Can you compete? Can you get in the team?\u201d With FLC banned from signing new players, their youngsters will never have a better chance of grabbing that carrot and their new boss will have his work cut out. But his popularity among FLC fans and a press pack which will almost certainly find somebody else to blame for anything that might go wrong early doors, will undoubtedly stand him in good stead. Indeed, being a likable club legend rather than an unloved 60-year-old Italian former banker means he has already got off to the perfect start. But while while we can only speculate over whether he\u2019ll be able to emulate the largely unappreciated success of his predecessor, one suspects the latest addition to the extensive Stamford Bridge managerial DNA database will be given every chance. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThese are my watches, give me my watches. It\u2019s important for me. I worked in the watch industry and I made my collection. Forty-one years they were [at Fifa], I could have taken them home, a long time ago. Why are they fighting for these watches? There is no respect, there is no respect by the president [Gianni Infantino]\u201d \u2013 Sepp Blatter launches legal proceeding against Fifa for\u2026 and you\u2019ll like this \u2026 \u201cmoral damage\u201d and to reclaim around 60 of his watches. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Football Weekly Extra will be in this general vicinity. FIVER LETTERS \u201cI (and 1,056 other Americans) must ask: how can it be a rivalry when neither your women nor your men can beat the USA! USA!! USA!!! when it matters in a World Cup. PS. Happy Independence Day\u201d \u2013 James Armstrong (and no other Americans). \u201cIt\u2019s not often I agree with The Fiver, but the comparison of England\u2019s defence to a \u2018portcullis\u2019 (yesterday\u2019s Fiver) seemed to be spot on, given that both are comprised largely of holes. Too soon?\u201d \u2013 Paul Dixon. \u201cI\u2019ve no problem with Arsenal paying \u2018Argos-style\u2019 payments (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters), or the never-never as older (ahem) readers may recall, but there is no discount and 30% APR is bunged on top. The \u00a380m \u2018Zaha\u2019 would cost only \u00a32.4m per month over five years. The real question is: would Arsenal pass the loan affordability tests or do they know a desperate noodle company?\u201d \u2013 Antony Melvin. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Paul Dixon. BITS AND BOBS Manchester City have broken their transfer record with the \u00a362.8m signing of Rodri from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. \u201cIt\u2019s a style that excites me, as do the club\u2019s ambitions boyo,\u201d he cheered. Dani\u00eblle van de Donk reckons confidence\u2019s USA! USA!! USA!!! will underestimate them before Sunday\u2019s World Cup final. \u201cI don\u2019t think they think we\u2019re that good,\u201d she sniffed as Alex Morgan worked on a clog-mocking, dam-plugging, spliff-toking hybrid celebration. Modern football dept: Ayoze P\u00e9rez is now a \u00a330m footballer, after Leicester activated his Newcastle ejector clause. The Old Man of Turin has successfully coughed for the Old Lady\u2019s doctor, meaning Gianluigi Buffon, 84, is once against a Juventus player. Andre Gomes says he\u2019s happier at Everton than Barcelona because there\u2019s less pressure playing alongside Cenk Tosun than Lionel Messi. \u201cI played with the best players in the world at Barcelona \u2026 but the opportunity at Everton was really good,\u201d he quickly added. And Peru will be the next set of Brazil\u2019s opponents to be getting fresh and funky with the referee after beating Chile 3-0 to reach the Copa Am\u00e9rica final. STILL WANT MORE? Afghanistan women\u2019s coach Kelly Lindsey on the blatant disregard for the protection of women and girls in football and a culture that needs to change. Dominic Fifield on the challenge facing FLC\u2019s Frank Lampard. Does Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix\u2019s mega-money move to Atl\u00e9tico spell the end of Diego Simeone\u2019s \u201cCholismo\u201d era? Sid Lowe asks and answers the question. The Serie A team of the 1980s. Women\u2019s World Cup finals and a DJ-ing referee are among the visual treats in this week\u2019s Classic YouTube. USA! USA!! USA!!! deserve to be on a podium not a pedestal, reckons Beau Dure, reminding us that well-behaved women rarely make history. Eni Aluko on what Phil Neville got wrong in England\u2019s semi-final defeat. And Hope Solo on what USA! USA!! USA!!! got right.

It has also been a lesson in bad economics. Osborne\u2019s extraction of public funds just when the private sector was also flagging meant that the recovery that had been building under Gordon Brown was choked off. The average worker has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/12/uk-wages-have-not-yet-recovered-to-pre-crisis-levels-says-ifs\">still not seen their wages recover</a> to pre-financial crisis levels.</p> <p>Most sinister was Osborne\u2019s ability to construct a narrative about \u201cLabour\u2019s overspending\u201d that misled the entire country about the need for his cuts.

      "bodyText": "Faiza Shaheen, director of the Centre for Labour and Social Studies and Labour PPC for Chingford &amp; Woodford Green, has demolished George Osborne\u2019s bid: There are many reasons why having Osborne as the future managing director of the IMF is undesirable, but let\u2019s just start with his record. Osborne was the mastermind of the austerity programme which has brought untold and widespread misery in the UK. Whether it be the doubling of rough sleeping, 130,000 related deaths, a social care crisis or thousands of teachers leaving education, his programme has taken this country backwards. It has also been a lesson in bad economics. Osborne\u2019s extraction of public funds just when the private sector was also flagging meant that the recovery that had been building under Gordon Brown was choked off. The average worker has still not seen their wages recover to pre-financial crisis levels. Most sinister was Osborne\u2019s ability to construct a narrative about \u201cLabour\u2019s overspending\u201d that misled the entire country about the need for his cuts. But perhaps knowing how to mislead and gaslight a whole country while categorically missing your own targets are just the right qualifications for an international financial institution. More here! If you\u2019re just tuning in (perhaps after enjoying the tennis...) here\u2019s my colleague Richard Partington on the surprise candidate to run the IMF.... George Osborne\u2019s interest in running the International Monetary Fund has met immediate criticism because of the former chancellor\u2019s austerity policies and Brexit-related question marks over the UK\u2019s international standing. The former chancellor has signalled to friends that he views himself as a potential candidate to replace Christine Lagarde, the current head of the Washington-based fund, who was nominated to lead the European Central Bank this week. However, his role as the architect of austerity was highlighted on Thursday as being badly out of step with the needs of the global economy, while the IMF has gradually also begun to distance itself from a fiscal approach that requires heavy cuts to public spending. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told the Guardian that the use of austerity had hindered the UK\u2019s recovery from the financial crisis. He said: \u201cBefore the decision is made on any IMF appointment, consideration should be made to the fact that George Osborne was the architect of the slowest recovery from a recession since Napoleonic times. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly the record or qualification for someone to steer the ship of the global economy.\u201d More here: Despite the burden of his many jobs (and his desire for another one), George Osborne is squeezing in some tennis-watching today. He has been spotted in the Royal Box at Wimbledon, along with his father Peter (founder interior design firm Osborne &amp; Little). The former chancellor also chatted with former Bank of England governor Lord King: One potential candidate to lead the International Monetary Fund has ruled himself out. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann has let it be known that he is very happy in his current rule, and won\u2019t apply for Christine Lagarde\u2019s job at the top of the IMF. Bloomberg has more details. Weidmann has been seen as a potential candidate to replace Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank, but has lost out to Lagarde. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has weighed in against George Osborne: The excitement over the IMF job has made up for an extremely dull day in the financial markets. The FTSE 100 index of top UK-listed shares is currently unchanged at 7,609, which was an 11-month closing high last night. The pound is flat too, at $1.257 to the dollar, and \u20ac1.114 to the euro. And with Wall Street shut for Independence Day celebrations, there\u2019s little to excite traders today. Another economics professor, Nouriel Roubini, reckons Mark Carney and Mario Draghi are the best potential choices (tho, as explained earlier, the IMF\u2019s age limit might rule Draghi out). Economics professor Danny Blanchflower, who served on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, reckons Osborne\u2019s austerity programme derailed the UK\u2019s recovery: Kristalina Georgieva, the Bulgarian chief operating officer of the World Bank, has also been tipped as a potential IMF head, according to the Financial Times. Georgeiva has previously served as a European Commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis response, and as a vice-president of the EC, following an academic career in economics. She briefly ran the World Bank earlier this year after Jim Kim quit. Georgeiva has a strong focus on environmental issues [here\u2019s a profile from 2011]. Back in January, she told the World Economic Forum in Davos about the importance of battling the climate emergency: When you think about climate, get a photo of your children and grandchildren in front of you. I guarantee you it will change your perspective. I did this and it works. If you want to know what the International Monetary Fund is thinking, it\u2019s good to check out their blogs. Written by economists across the Fund, they cover a wider range of issues than its regular economic outlook reports. In the last two months, this has included articles on tariffs and trade wars, education, two pieces on fintech, two on climate change and three on inequality (plus pieces on the state of the global economy and debt levels). George Osborne doesn\u2019t really have a track record on such issues... unlike Mark Carney. The governor of the Bank of England has been pushing green finance, and trying (with limited success) to make the BoE a more open institution. Just this week, he explained how global trade wars damaged growth and prosperity. He also chairs an important committee of central bankers that looks out for threats to the global economy. Plus, Carney will soon be available, and holds both Irish and British citizenship - meaning he satisfies the rule that the IMF chief should be European. Surely a front-runner to replace Christine Lagarde? There\u2019s also chatter today that Mario Draghi, the outgoing head of the European Central Bank, would make a better IMF chief. That would mean an usual jobswap, as Christine Lagarde is heading from Washington to Frankfurt to succeed Draghi. Bloomberg\u2019s Ferdinando Giugliano reckons Draghi (the man who saved the euro in the debt crisis) has ideal experience managing crises, working with political leaders and fiercely defending European monetary union. But there\u2019s a problem..... Perhaps the sharpest take so far, from the FT\u2019s Katie Martin: Not that the pound\u2019s habit of lurching around like an emerging market currency since the Brexit vote is a laughing matter.... Looks like George Osborne has been hard at work at the Evening Standard -- they\u2019re splashing on the Tory leadership race, and the new Chelsea manager (unusually, a top job which Osborne didn\u2019t go for...) No mention of his own hunt for a move to the IMF.... Labour MP Dan Carden isn\u2019t convinced either.... Surely George Osborne can rely on The Spectator to back his charge towards the International Monetary Fund? Apparently not! A new article on the conservative current affairs magazine argues that Osborne would be a ideal continuity candidate to fill Christine Lagarde\u2019s shoes - but that\u2019s not what the Fund needs. Matthew Lynn writes on its Coffee House blog: Smooth. Intelligent and articulate. A former finance minister. A European. And perhaps most importantly of all, a mildly irritating potential rival to the prime minister of his own country. In lots of ways, George Osborne ticks all the boxes to replace Christine Lagarde as the managing director of the IMF. Indeed, if you were looking for a perfect replica of the incumbent, minus the pearls and the elegant neck scarfs, you might well settle on the former chancellor..... [But...] [The IMF] needs radical change, and fresh agenda. Osborne has never shown any appetite for that. He would be perfectly competent at networking with the Davos set, but he has no real interest in economics, nor has he ever shown any desire to break with the reigning consensus. And that makes him the wrong person for the IMF. The UK should press for a British MD. But it can surely find a better candidate than the former chancellor, no matter how much he might want the job. Miriam Brett, who analyses the impact of the IMF and the World Bank\u2019s policies, also has concerns about George Osborne\u2019s suitability: John McDonnell is right - the UK\u2019s recovery from the 2008-09 recession on George Osborne\u2019s watch was remarkably poor. It took six whole years for Britain\u2019s economy to return to its pre-crisis levels [in 2014], which economists agree is the weakest since the 19th century. As ever, there are various factors to consider. The eurozone crisis, which flared into life in 2011, undermined the UK\u2019s own recovery. With many European countries falling into recession, there was less demand for British-made goods and services. But the UK\u2019s push into austerity was surely also a major factor, choking off the recovery that was underway at the end of Gordon Brown\u2019s administration. As Britain\u2019s economy stalled, tax revenues disappointed, meaning the Cameron administration never came close to its goal of eliminating the budget deficit -- its flagship economic policy. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, questions whether George Osborne is the right person to run the International Monetary Fund. Speaking to the Guardian, McDonnell says: Before the decision is made on any IMF appointment, consideration should be made to the fact that George Osborne was the architect of the slowest recovery from a recession since Napoleonic times. That\u2019s hardly the record or qualification for someone to steer the ship of the global economy. George Osborne is now the bookmakers\u2019 favourite to become the next managing director of the International Monetary Fund, we hear. Betway tells us there has been \u201ca big move for George Osborne\u201d overnight. He\u2019s now the market leader at 5/2. Yesterday he was listed at just 25-1, before \u201cfriends\u201d of the chancellor revealed that he fancies the job. We should have the full odds shortly.... George Osborne would need the backing of the UK government for his bid to succeed Christine Lagarde. Candidates to run the IMF need to be nominated, either by a member of the Fund\u2019s board or by a country\u2019s governor (Philip Hammond for the UK). Back in 2011, David Cameron famously spiked Gordon Brown\u2019s ambitions, saying his predecessor lacked credibility due to running up the UK national debt. It\u2019s unclear whether Theresa May would look kindly on Osborne\u2019s own ambitions (given he once aspired to have her \u2018chopped up in bags\u2019 in his freezer). But, fortunately for Osborne, his Evening Standard backed front-runner Boris Johnson to replace May two weeks ago. The timing may be co-incidental, but it might just help..... Christine Lagarde\u2019s replacement will be chosen by the 24 members of the IMF\u2019s executive board. Here\u2019s what they\u2019ll be looking for: The successful candidate for the position of Managing Director will have a distinguished record in economic policymaking at senior levels. (S)he will have an outstanding professional background, will have demonstrated the managerial and diplomatic skills needed to lead a global institution, and will be a national of any of the IMF\u2019s member countries. As chief of the IMF\u2019s staff and as Chairman of the Executive Board, (s)he will be capable of providing strategic vision for the work of a high quality, diverse, and dedicated staff; and will be firmly committed to advancing the goals of the IMF by building consensus on key policy and institutional issues, including through close collaboration with the Executive Board, under whose direction (s)he will fulfill his or her responsibilities. (S)he will have a proven understanding of the IMF and the policy challenges facing the Fund\u2019s diverse global membership. (S)he will have a firm commitment to, and an appreciation of, multilateral cooperation and will have a demonstrated capacity to be objective and impartial. (S)he will also be an effective communicator. George Osborne appears to have enjoyed his time editing the Evening Standard over the last couple of years. Journalism has allowed Osborne to work off any lingering pain about being sacked by Theresa May, by tweeting a series of cartoon puns at the PMs expense: Bu....the editor\u2019s chair may feel less comfy today. The Standard lost \u00a311.5m last year, forcing Osborne into a round of job cuts as the print and online teams are merged. Paul Diggle of investment group Aberdeen Standard also reckons Osborne\u2019s track record at the Treasury will also count against him. He told the Telegraph that the former chancellor probably isn\u2019t a \u201crealistic candidate\u201d, due to his enthusiasm for austerity. The IMF has had its own rethink about the merits of cutting spending during a downturn (having seen the mess it made of Greece), and now leans towards governments using their fiscal firepower. As Diggle puts it: He is a big advocate for expansionary fiscal contraction and that is no longer in vogue at the IMF. His thinking doesn\u2019t really chime with where the fund is at. Opposition from Europe could scupper George Osborne\u2019s ambitions. Stefan Gerlach, former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, reckons EU member states will shove a spanner in: My colleague Richard Partington reckons George Osborne faces a tough battle to succeed Christine Lagarde: Osborne could face stiff competition from other highly qualified candidates at a time when Britain\u2019s place in the world has been coloured by internal disputes over leaving the EU, clouding the UK\u2019s international reputation. Other contenders may include Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, who was installed by Osborne. Although Canadian by birth, he holds Irish and UK citizenship. Carney is due to leave Threadneedle Street early next year. The Daily Telegraph says Osborne is giving \u201cserious thought\u201d to filling the IMF vacancy, quoting one source who reckons: While it might be tricky for any UK candidate to get the job... [Osborne is].. the only Brit with the international reputation to pull it off. Or perhaps almost the only Brit with the ambition to even try..... It\u2019s fair to say that reaction to George Osborne\u2019s ambitions is decidedly mixed. His failed attempt to eliminate the UK\u2019s budget deficit in the 2010-2015 parliament, through a harsh austerity programme, makes him ill-equipped. So argues Nobel-prize winning economist Paul Krugman, for example, who tweeted ironically: But, Guardian columnist George Monbiot remembers the IMF\u2019s own track record in Argentina and Greece.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Running the International Monetary Fund is one of the most important jobs in the global economy, You\u2019re managing one of the pillars of the world order, monitoring global growth, lending to countries in crisis, and driving (for good or ill) a message of economic liberalisation. And much to many people\u2019s surprise, former UK chancellor George Osborne thinks he\u2019d do a good job of it. \u201cFriends of Osborne\u201d have thrown the chancellor\u2019s hat into the ring, just a day after Christine Lagarde (the current IMF managing director), was nominated to lead the European Central Bank. Lagarde\u2019s move (also a surprise) has triggered a flurry of speculation and some frantic CV polishing among the global elite. But could her job shift really hand the former MP for Tatton a shock comeback to the corridors of power? Osborne, it seems, believes he is well placed to win international support. He built up links with China during his time running the UK Treasury, and is also well-connected to US Republicans (who share his vision of a small state). That will help him win the necessary support. However, European leaders might be less impressed, if they remember Osborne\u2019s criticism of the eurozone during its debt crisis. The IMF has never been led by a Brit (although John Maynard Keynes played a crucial role in its creation). Osborne believes he\u2019s got the skills to change that. As the Financial Times puts it: Having recently backed Boris Johnson to become prime minister, the former UK chancellor of the exchequer \u2014 who now edits London\u2019s Evening Standard \u2014 also has high hopes of winning the backing of a British government led by the former foreign secretary.... Mr Osborne has told friends that it was a fascinating job to have at a challenging time for international institutions and the current climate required a \u201cskilled political communicator and operator . . . not a technocrat\u201d. But he faces a fight. Mark Carney, the current Bank of England governor, will soon have some time on his hands. India\u2019s former top central banker, Raghuram Rajan, is another possibility (unless he succeeds Carney at the BoE!). There are also strong candidates from the world of business -- Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam and Mohamed El-Erian, the former chief executive of PIMCO, could be considered. So Osborne faces a tough fight if he\u2019s to add another job to his lengthy resume (he\u2019s currently editing the Evening Standard and advising fund manager BlackRock). Also coming up today It\u2019s a quiet day in the markets, with America closed for the 4th July celebrations. Rather than trading stocks and shares, investors can enjoy the sight of tanks on the streets of Washington DC, with the Donald Trump \u201cbaby blimp\u201d bobbing nearby.

      "bodyText": "The Church of England is to formally recognise religious communities, bringing them under its oversight for the first time since Henry VIII\u2019s dissolution of the monasteries. A canon, or church law, is expected to receive final approval at the C of E synod, which meets in York this weekend, and will be enacted next year. The move has been prompted by the emergence of a new generation of religious communities in recent years, sometimes known as New Monasticism. Concerns about safeguarding are also a factor, as some communities have faced sexual abuse allegations or charges. Under the new canon, a community may be declared a recognised C of E religious community if it meets conditions relating to governance, financial affairs, safeguarding and the making of vows or promises. It must have a written constitution, a minimum number of members and agree to \u201cvisitations\u201d, or inspections, at least every five years. The church will have the power to revoke recognition of a community if there is \u201cgrave cause\u201d to do so. There are thought to be dozens of semi-official religious communities that could be formally recognised by the C of E under the new law. Alexander McGregor, the chief legal adviser to the synod, said: \u201cThis is the first canonical provision in respect of religious communities being made since the dissolution of the monasteries. It will provide for there to be an approved list of official C of E religious communities.\u201d In 1536, Henry VIII embarked on a programme of closures of monasteries and religious houses following his break with Rome. He set about acquiring monasteries\u2019 land and wealth, destroying libraries and executing defiant abbots. By 1540, monasteries were closing at a rate of 50 a month, and monasticism vanished from English life for three centuries. In recent years, \u201cthere has been a growth in new religious communities, and it seems timely to provide more formal support and guidance and structure\u201d, said David Walker, the bishop of Manchester and chair of a C of E committee on relations with religious communities. He attributed the growth to \u201ca desire among people for a sense of belonging \u2013 people feel quite atomised in this day and age \u2013 and for that belonging to have some weight and a sense of mutual accountability. \u201cMonasticism has been around for a very long time but we are now seeing fresh expressions of it.\u201d New religious communities are diverse, mixed in gender and marital status, ecumenically open and often dispersed rather than physically living under one roof, he said. Most engage with society, rather than setting themselves apart. Communities may have a specific focus, such as ministering to the needs of young people out at night in a city or town centre, he said. Some exist largely online, praying together via webcams or platforms such as Skype and perhaps meeting annually. Others invite members to live in a community house for a defined period of time, rather than make a lifelong commitment. Few of the new communities require members to take traditional life vows, but many members make promises signifying commitment and mutual accountability. \u201cVows are something many people take at important moments of their lives, such as marriage,\u201d said Walker. Some communities have rules or follow \u201crhythms\u201d, which may relate to daily prayers, lifestyle, study, penitence and spiritual retreat. In 2015, Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, established a new religious community at Lambeth Palace, his London headquarters. More than 100 young people from different Christian traditions around the world have spent time with the St Anselm community, with the number of applicants far outnumbering the available places. Writing in the Church Times in September, Welby said: \u201cWe are witnessing a revival of interest in community life in its different forms: celibate and non-celibate, communal and dispersed, traditional and experimental.\u201d Religious community offered an ancient and powerful answer to modern commitment phobia and isolation, he said. But there have also been allegations and cases of sexual abuse within communities. In 1960, Peter Ball, later the bishop of Gloucester and Lewes, co-founded a monastic community, the Order of the Glorious Ascension. Peter Ball, who died last month, was sent to prison in 2015 for the sexual abuse of teenagers and young men under his care as novice monks. \u201cIn any place where power is exercised, or people are making promises, there are safeguarding risks associated with that,\u201d said Walker. Last week, the C of E\u2019s national safeguarding steering group said it would accept the recommendation of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse that religious communities must meet adequate requirements for safeguarding and child protection. Walker acknowledged some religious communities might be reluctant to accept guidelines and oversight from C of E bishops. \u201cSome people might pine for an era when they felt less watched,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we cannot give our trust unequivocally in that way any more.

Alternatively, on Instagram.</p> <p><strong>And they\u2019re human, are they? </strong>\u201cMurfer\u201d is just a portmanteau of \u201cmum\u201d and \u201csurfer\u201d. Really, they\u2019re micro-influencers.</p> <p><strong>What does that mean? </strong>It means they spend a lot of time posting pictures of their gorgeous, beach-based lives, and earning money from it.</p> <p><strong>And they all live in Byron Bay? </strong>Yes. <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/07/the-coast-of-utopia-surfer-moms-instagram-influencers\">According to a Vanity Fair article</a>, they are a \u201ca cross-tagging, cross-promoting, mutually amplifying, audience-sharing group of friends living, loving, working and posting aspirational lifestyle content in a highly Instagrammable paradise\u201d.</p> <p><strong>I hate them. </strong>You are not alone, but it is working for them. The Instagram mums of Byron are brands, exploiting themselves and their families to push either their own products or those of select sponsors.</p> <p><strong>How are they organised? Do they have a ringleader? </strong>If they do, it would be Courtney Adamo, an American mother of five and the founder of the Babyccino parenting website, who moved to Australia with her husband two-and-a-half years ago.</p> <p><strong>So she is the most major</strong><strong> micro-thingy? </strong>She is a \u201cmid-tier family lifestyle micro-influencer\u201d, according to VF, with 250,000 Instagram followers, all of whom hanker after her life, her hair, her jumpers and her kitchen.</p> <p><strong>It reminds me of the Stepford Wives. </strong>It is a modern, in no way less scary version, where every picnic basket you produce must not only be perfect, but also professionally photographed and tagged online before you eat.</p> <p><strong>What if I just want crisps and beer?</strong> There are no crisps in murfer world. There is plenty of kombucha, but no crisps.</p> <p><strong>What do the critics of murfer world say? </strong>They say that murfers are promoting an essentially unachievable dream: the effortlessly elegant, brand-building, stay-at-home mum with a spotless house and a \u00a310,000 oven.</p> <p><strong>I don\u2019t want any of that, except the oven. Which I would then sell to buy medicine.</strong> To be a successful murfer like Adamo, it helps if you\u2019re pretty rich in the first place.</p> <p><strong>So it\u2019s all fake? </strong>The \u201cslow life\u201d they\u2019re pushing is certainly a myth; they\u2019re all extremely busy.</p> <p><strong>What about Byron Bay? </strong><strong> Is that, at least, the laid-back paradise that they make out? </strong>Here\u2019s a fun fact: Byron Bay is known as the anti-vaxxer capital of Australia.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>\u201cI want the look, but without the measles.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t say:</strong> \u201cI\u2019m feeling a bit micro-influenced, but that\u2019s because I\u2019ve been micro-dosing all week.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Name: Murfers. Age: Varies. Appearance: Tanned, toned, surrounded by children on a pristine beach in the golden haze of a setting sun. Whereabouts do you find such creatures? Byron Bay, Australia. Alternatively, on Instagram. And they\u2019re human, are they? \u201cMurfer\u201d is just a portmanteau of \u201cmum\u201d and \u201csurfer\u201d. Really, they\u2019re micro-influencers. What does that mean? It means they spend a lot of time posting pictures of their gorgeous, beach-based lives, and earning money from it. And they all live in Byron Bay? Yes. According to a Vanity Fair article, they are a \u201ca cross-tagging, cross-promoting, mutually amplifying, audience-sharing group of friends living, loving, working and posting aspirational lifestyle content in a highly Instagrammable paradise\u201d. I hate them. You are not alone, but it is working for them. The Instagram mums of Byron are brands, exploiting themselves and their families to push either their own products or those of select sponsors. How are they organised? Do they have a ringleader? If they do, it would be Courtney Adamo, an American mother of five and the founder of the Babyccino parenting website, who moved to Australia with her husband two-and-a-half years ago. So she is the most major micro-thingy? She is a \u201cmid-tier family lifestyle micro-influencer\u201d, according to VF, with 250,000 Instagram followers, all of whom hanker after her life, her hair, her jumpers and her kitchen. It reminds me of the Stepford Wives. It is a modern, in no way less scary version, where every picnic basket you produce must not only be perfect, but also professionally photographed and tagged online before you eat. What if I just want crisps and beer? There are no crisps in murfer world. There is plenty of kombucha, but no crisps. What do the critics of murfer world say? They say that murfers are promoting an essentially unachievable dream: the effortlessly elegant, brand-building, stay-at-home mum with a spotless house and a \u00a310,000 oven. I don\u2019t want any of that, except the oven. Which I would then sell to buy medicine. To be a successful murfer like Adamo, it helps if you\u2019re pretty rich in the first place. So it\u2019s all fake? The \u201cslow life\u201d they\u2019re pushing is certainly a myth; they\u2019re all extremely busy. What about Byron Bay? Is that, at least, the laid-back paradise that they make out? Here\u2019s a fun fact: Byron Bay is known as the anti-vaxxer capital of Australia. Do say: \u201cI want the look, but without the measles.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cI\u2019m feeling a bit micro-influenced, but that\u2019s because I\u2019ve been micro-dosing all week.\u201d",

Haftar launched a military assault on the capital on 4 April in an effort to oust the GNA, which he claims is supported by terrorists and Islamists.</p> \n<p>The GNA interior minister, Fathi Bashagha, said on Thursday his officials were discussing closing all detention centres and releasing the refugees and migrants for their own safety.</p> \n<p>At the UN in New York, US diplomats blocked a move to set up an independent inquiry into responsibility for the airstrikes. They said they could not yet back a British-drafted statement, expressing concern about its call for a ceasefire.</p> \n<p>US policy towards Haftar\u2019s efforts to seize the capital by force has been beset by inter-agency disagreements in Washington and lobbying by both sides in the civil war that has raged off and on in Libya since Col Muammar Gaddafi was ousted with the help of Nato forces in 2011.</p> \n<p>The EU, UN agencies in Libya, Britain and Italy had been leading calls for an investigation into Wednesday\u2019s attack that might eventually lead to war crime charges.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ac6d5631-79a8-41ad-ae75-42dddc804976\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TTTXCx6AUD8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There is a widespread assumption, including from former British diplomats in Libya, that Haftar\u2019s airforce was responsible for the strikes.

The UN had given the coordinates to all sides in the conflict.</p> \n<p>UN agencies said they were trying to remove all refugees and migrants from the areas of fighting around Tripoli, but 600 were still at the Tajoura camp.

      "bodyText": "Libya\u2019s government is considering closing all migrant detention centres in the wake of an airstrike that killed 53 people after it was reported that guards shot at detainees trying to flee the attack. Overnight the air force of Gen Khalifa Haftar kept up its bombardment of the Libyan capital, Tripoli, mounting raids on the international airport. A UN humanitarian report said there were two airstrikes in the early hours of Wednesday morning, one hitting an unoccupied garage and one hitting a hangar housing about 120 refugees and migrants. Reports, including from UN agencies, suggested guards forced the refugees to stay in the Tajoura detention centre after the first strike hit the garage, only for the second missile to hit the hangar. \u201cThere are reports that following the first impact, some refugees and migrants were fired upon by guards as they tried to escape,\u201d the UN report said. The UN-recognised government of national accord (GNA) has accused the force led by Haftar of mounting the air raid. Haftar launched a military assault on the capital on 4 April in an effort to oust the GNA, which he claims is supported by terrorists and Islamists. The GNA interior minister, Fathi Bashagha, said on Thursday his officials were discussing closing all detention centres and releasing the refugees and migrants for their own safety. At the UN in New York, US diplomats blocked a move to set up an independent inquiry into responsibility for the airstrikes. They said they could not yet back a British-drafted statement, expressing concern about its call for a ceasefire. US policy towards Haftar\u2019s efforts to seize the capital by force has been beset by inter-agency disagreements in Washington and lobbying by both sides in the civil war that has raged off and on in Libya since Col Muammar Gaddafi was ousted with the help of Nato forces in 2011. The EU, UN agencies in Libya, Britain and Italy had been leading calls for an investigation into Wednesday\u2019s attack that might eventually lead to war crime charges. There is a widespread assumption, including from former British diplomats in Libya, that Haftar\u2019s airforce was responsible for the strikes. Many diplomats believe Haftar\u2019s airforce had clearly signalled it was prepared to take greater risks in targeting perceived military sites of militia backing the GNA. The detention centre was adjacent to a militia headquarters at the Naarn military camp. The UN had given the coordinates to all sides in the conflict. UN agencies said they were trying to remove all refugees and migrants from the areas of fighting around Tripoli, but 600 were still at the Tajoura camp. More than 3,800 people were \u201carbitrarily detained\u201d in camps across Libya that were exposed to the fighting, the UN said. The United Arab Emirates, which supports Haftar, denied it was supplying arms to his Libyan National Army in defiance of UN sanctions, let alone flying the planes on behalf of the LNA. Egypt has issued similar denials. The UAE foreign ministry said it supported UN resolutions imposing an arms embargo on Libya. The UAE said weapons found recently in Libya were not from the UAE, and it was fully cooperating with UN experts policing the embargo. The UN said on Wednesday: \u201cHumanitarian actors have repeatedly warned that the return of refugees and migrants to Libyan shores, and their arbitrary detention in unsafe areas, placed these vulnerable men, women and children at great risk of exactly the type of tragedy which occurred last night.\u201d It said it called \u201con all parties to the conflict to refrain from locating military assets within or near densely civilian populated areas, such as detention centres, and to evacuate civilian persons under their control, including persons in detention, from the vicinity of military objectives to a more secure place, and to take all possible measures to ensure that their essential needs [are met].\u201d",

Certainly, the speed with which the first-night audience at this bracing regional premiere leapt to its feet to applaud a mighty Curve ensemble testifies to the power of a musical rooted in hardship and struggle.</p> <p>The adaptation, by Marsha Norman, could be more explicit, of course. With its telegraphed dialogue skipping through the scenes to allow the songs by Brenda Russell, Allee Willis and Stephen Bray to carry the emotional weight, it glosses over the scale of poor Celie\u2019s abuse. If we had to dwell on the misery of a teenager who is raped by her stepfather, then has her babies taken away from her before she is farmed into a slave-like marriage, we\u2019d never get past the first song.</p> <p>Likewise, in the good-hearted context of a musical, Celie\u2019s line about not knowing her husband\u2019s name gets a laugh, but it signals an appalling level of abuse that is largely brushed over. Equally, however, the stage version has none of the insipid romanticism of the <a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/praise-whoopi-goldberg-steven-spielberg-color-purple\">Steven Spielberg movie</a>, offering instead something with considerable integrity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5eb50b23e1becd6544b36670cbf99074075af57e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5eb50b23e1becd6544b36670cbf99074075af57e/217_566_5006_3004/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018An invigorating sense of community.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018An invigorating sense of community.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it is this integrity that director Tinuke Craig is most true to. When discussing a musical, it is tempting to talk about the big choral numbers and the company dance routines, and with this Color Purple that wouldn\u2019t be hard. Musical director Alex Parker takes the 17-strong cast through exuberant gospel numbers that create an invigorating sense of community, while Mark Smith\u2019s choreography \u2013 all elbows and hands \u2013 has a snappy, syncopated precision that is a joy to watch. That\u2019s all great, but the real strength of Craig\u2019s production is its stillness.</p> <p>It is most apparent in T\u2019Shan Williams\u2019s performance as Celie. As a singer she is capable of belting it out and, when called upon, she\u2019ll bring the house down \u2013 as she does with the climactic I\u2019m Here, a jaw-dropping performance sung solo on an empty stage. You wouldn\u2019t want to take that away from her, but just as impressive is her restraint. Craig often positions her lying downstage on her front, singing softly, drawing us in with a mask-like capacity to let emotions be projected on to her. The lack of assertiveness is not only appropriate for a character who remains cheerful despite being dealt the worst hand life has to offer, but also magnetic in its own right. Williams is the opposite of histrionic \u2013 and all the better for it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8da821ec57df51d04a551c4466e206c9e51fc064\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8da821ec57df51d04a551c4466e206c9e51fc064/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ako Mitchell as Mister and Danielle Fiamanya as Nettie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ako Mitchell as Mister and Danielle Fiamanya as Nettie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her voice is particularly well matched to that of Danielle Fiamanya as sister Nettie \u2013 another star performance \u2013 their harmonies sweet and delicate.

With its telegraphed dialogue skipping through the scenes to allow the songs by Brenda Russell, Allee Willis and Stephen Bray to carry the emotional weight, it glosses over the scale of poor Celie\u2019s abuse. If we had to dwell on the misery of a teenager who is raped by her stepfather, then has her babies taken away from her before she is farmed into a slave-like marriage, we\u2019d never get past the first song. Likewise, in the good-hearted context of a musical, Celie\u2019s line about not knowing her husband\u2019s name gets a laugh, but it signals an appalling level of abuse that is largely brushed over. Equally, however, the stage version has none of the insipid romanticism of the Steven Spielberg movie, offering instead something with considerable integrity. And it is this integrity that director Tinuke Craig is most true to. When discussing a musical, it is tempting to talk about the big choral numbers and the company dance routines, and with this Color Purple that wouldn\u2019t be hard. Musical director Alex Parker takes the 17-strong cast through exuberant gospel numbers that create an invigorating sense of community, while Mark Smith\u2019s choreography \u2013 all elbows and hands \u2013 has a snappy, syncopated precision that is a joy to watch. That\u2019s all great, but the real strength of Craig\u2019s production is its stillness. It is most apparent in T\u2019Shan Williams\u2019s performance as Celie. As a singer she is capable of belting it out and, when called upon, she\u2019ll bring the house down \u2013 as she does with the climactic I\u2019m Here, a jaw-dropping performance sung solo on an empty stage. You wouldn\u2019t want to take that away from her, but just as impressive is her restraint. Craig often positions her lying downstage on her front, singing softly, drawing us in with a mask-like capacity to let emotions be projected on to her. The lack of assertiveness is not only appropriate for a character who remains cheerful despite being dealt the worst hand life has to offer, but also magnetic in its own right. Williams is the opposite of histrionic \u2013 and all the better for it. Her voice is particularly well matched to that of Danielle Fiamanya as sister Nettie \u2013 another star performance \u2013 their harmonies sweet and delicate. It\u2019s a quality of Martin Higgins\u2019s orchestrations that the raucous bar-room blues and all-hands-on-deck gospel so often gives way to a slinky, stripped-down jazz that shows off the vocal lines to best effect. All the time, Craig keeps the action keenly focused on the singers and songs, whether it\u2019s Joanna Francis as an earthy Shug Avery, unapologetically driven by her passions, or Karen Mavundukure relishing the boldness of Sofia in a show that celebrates female empowerment. In that focus, Craig resists the artform\u2019s pull towards glibness to create a show with soul as well as spirit. \u2022 At Curve, Leicester, until 13 July and at Birmingham Hippodrome, 16\u201320 July.",

We decided to go for it, figuring it would be good to know where we could cut back. And if that benefits the environment too? Even better.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t take us long to get to grips with what a \u201cnormal\u201d day\u2019s energy consumption looks like for our family.

But it\u2019s not just about the cost to us, it\u2019s about the cost to the planet.</p> <p>As a family, we aim to live as sustainably as we can, and we\u2019re always looking for ways we can lessen our carbon footprint, which is why the smart meter really appealed. At home, we recycle and use a food waste caddy, and we try to limit what goes into the landfill bins \u2013 there\u2019s a local TerraCycle scheme where we live, in Cardiff, which we use regularly too. When I\u2019m in the shower, I turn the water off while I\u2019m shampooing my hair, and I use waste water for plants, rather than pouring it down the sink. When it comes to shopping, I try not to buy single-use plastics that can\u2019t be recycled (or any unnecessary plastics in fact), and I always aim to buy local, rather than things that have been imported. So of course we want to consume energy carefully too.</p> <p>Having a smart meter installed led to some surprising discoveries. Let\u2019s start with heating. Turning it on for just 30 minutes showed a big spike in our energy consumption \u2013 much more than anticipated. Now, if we\u2019re chilly, I, my husband Eoin and our son Reuben all put on a jumper \u2013 and then if we\u2019re still<em> </em>cold, we\u2019ll turn the heating on. Our oven is another villain. Apparently, it\u2019s not very energy-efficient \u2013 and it\u2019s shocking to see how quickly the meter jumps up when it\u2019s in use. We now cook and prepare food in more energy-efficient ways, such as in the microwave or on the hob. For us though, the biggest surprise was that simply getting a smart meter is a step towards a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/smarter-energy/2019/jun/27/what-is-the-smart-grid-and-why-should-i-care\">greener energy network</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s definitely changed our habits around the home \u2013 now I turn most things off at the mains when we\u2019re not using them (except the TV, because it\u2019s fiddly to keep turning off and on again). I\u2019ll unplug appliances too, like the kettle or toaster, if the socket doesn\u2019t have a switch \u2013 even the small amounts of energy they drain add up over time. And what\u2019s the point wasting energy unnecessarily? I used to charge my phone overnight, but I\u2019ve stopped that now \u2013 it\u2019s not great for the battery anyway, so I just plug it in when it\u2019s in need. Ultimately, I\u2019m really pleased to have found a way of helping the planet<em> and </em>our bills at the same time.</p> <p><em>Part of Britain\u2019s commitment to creating a more sustainable, low-carbon future includes making our energy network \u201csmarter\u201d \u2013 implementing digital tech to make our energy system more responsive to increased demand and variable wind speed.

At home, we recycle and use a food waste caddy, and we try to limit what goes into the landfill bins \u2013 there\u2019s a local TerraCycle scheme where we live, in Cardiff, which we use regularly too. When I\u2019m in the shower, I turn the water off while I\u2019m shampooing my hair, and I use waste water for plants, rather than pouring it down the sink. When it comes to shopping, I try not to buy single-use plastics that can\u2019t be recycled (or any unnecessary plastics in fact), and I always aim to buy local, rather than things that have been imported. So of course we want to consume energy carefully too. Having a smart meter installed led to some surprising discoveries. Let\u2019s start with heating. Turning it on for just 30 minutes showed a big spike in our energy consumption \u2013 much more than anticipated. Now, if we\u2019re chilly, I, my husband Eoin and our son Reuben all put on a jumper \u2013 and then if we\u2019re still cold, we\u2019ll turn the heating on. Our oven is another villain. Apparently, it\u2019s not very energy-efficient \u2013 and it\u2019s shocking to see how quickly the meter jumps up when it\u2019s in use. We now cook and prepare food in more energy-efficient ways, such as in the microwave or on the hob. For us though, the biggest surprise was that simply getting a smart meter is a step towards a greener energy network. It\u2019s definitely changed our habits around the home \u2013 now I turn most things off at the mains when we\u2019re not using them (except the TV, because it\u2019s fiddly to keep turning off and on again). I\u2019ll unplug appliances too, like the kettle or toaster, if the socket doesn\u2019t have a switch \u2013 even the small amounts of energy they drain add up over time. And what\u2019s the point wasting energy unnecessarily? I used to charge my phone overnight, but I\u2019ve stopped that now \u2013 it\u2019s not great for the battery anyway, so I just plug it in when it\u2019s in need. Ultimately, I\u2019m really pleased to have found a way of helping the planet and our bills at the same time. Part of Britain\u2019s commitment to creating a more sustainable, low-carbon future includes making our energy network \u201csmarter\u201d \u2013 implementing digital tech to make our energy system more responsive to increased demand and variable wind speed. By collecting data on our energy use through smart meters, our network can better understand, plan for and balance out peaks and troughs in demand, making it easier to integrate renewable energy sources.

      "body": "<p>Nova Scotia is the kind of place where strangers stop to talk and smiles come easy. It\u2019s also where this famous east-coast hospitality, fresh seafood, good wine and pristine beaches all come together to create memorable summer holidays. Just a six-hour flight from the UK, there\u2019s no shortage of things to do, from exploring historic fishing villages to world-class surfing. Here are our top 10 recommendations.</p> <p><strong>Line up a lobster<br></strong>Whether it\u2019s fish and chips from a food truck or fresh oysters from a trendy downtown restaurant, there is no shortage of seafood here. Although Nova Scotia is renowned for its lobster, other seafood options are extensive and menus are constantly evolving, but for a traditional lobster feast, you can take your pick from a lineup of restaurants along the Halifax waterfront. The most famous local lobster experience, however, can be found at the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2ISm9he\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shore Club</a>, located by the shore 30 minutes outside of the city in Hubbards. The club has been around for more than 80 years and is popular with locals, while the restaurant serves a daily lobster dinner throughout the summer.</p> <p><strong>Take in colourful Lunenburg<br></strong>The <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2KUkABM\" rel=\"nofollow\">charming seaside town</a>, located an hour south of Halifax, on the South Shore, is known for its brightly painted wooden houses and buildings. The colourful facades are meant to reflect how the town would have looked during Victorian times, when houses served as beacons for the ships coming in to port. It\u2019s the perfect town to stroll in, stopping for a fresh seafood lunch by the water and admiring the secret coves and fishing boats. It\u2019s also home to the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/31XIxxq\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic</a>, as well as the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2xhL4UY\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ironworks Distillery</a>, where visitors can enjoy both local spirits and a lesson in Lunenburg\u2019s history of rum running.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47b00a2b5bcae04f601ca0eb8e750e70cf528f93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47b00a2b5bcae04f601ca0eb8e750e70cf528f93/0_81_1620_972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Learn to surf at Lawrencetown beach near Halifax\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Learn to surf at Lawrencetown beach near Halifax</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Have a pre-breakfast surf<br></strong>The secret is out: some of the best waves this side of the Atlantic are waiting for those intrepid enough to withstand the cool waters. Think misty mornings, wetsuits and world-class waves, all set against the bucolic backdrop of friendly, rural communities. Infamous east-coast storms and hurricanes can result in some intense waves, but it\u2019s still a good spot to learn, with the help of expert teachers at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2xhL5s0\" rel=\"nofollow\">East Coast Surf School</a>. Bonus: the waves are so close to the city you can hit the beach for an early-morning surf and be back in time for breakfast.</p> <p><strong>Sea kayaking in Cape LaHave<br></strong>Kayak through a network of more than 20 islands, with incredible local guides at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/31PsuBE\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cape LaHave Adventures</a>. Paddlers can learn about the flora, fauna and folklore of the region and see untouched beaches and coastal wildlife, including seals. Choose from a two-hour lesson to a three-day glamping adventure that includes campfires, craft cocktails and fresh oysters for dinner.</p> <p><strong>The Rum Runners Trail<br></strong>During Prohibition, many Nova Scotian fishermen opted for a lucrative career change: rum running from Canada to the eastern seaboard of the US. The former train route that transported much of the booze from the hidden inlets to the main ports, almost 100 years ago, has now been converted into a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/31Psv8G\" rel=\"nofollow\">74-mile multi-use trail</a> that runs between Halifax and Lunenburg. The trail is the ideal way for outdoor enthusiasts to explore the coastal communities, stopping at local cafes, bars, beaches and provincial parks along the way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5471a7a2868787f8614c04911443bf4ce3936884\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5471a7a2868787f8614c04911443bf4ce3936884/0_124_5935_3561/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful landscape of Peggys Point Lighthouse (Peggys Cove Lighthouse) with tourists besides the ocean.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The lighthouse at Peggy\u2019s Cove.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Whoever/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Alight at Peggy\u2019s Cove <br></strong>Nova Scotia is home to more than 150 lighthouses, but the one at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2KUzrfC\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peggy\u2019s Cove</a> is definitely the most recognised. Just a 40-minute drive outside Halifax, the cove is covered in sprawling granite boulders that stretch out into the crashing waves of the Atlantic, creating a dramatic backdrop for landscape photos and windswept selfies. Wooden fishing shacks and lobster traps line the inlet that both local fishermen and an inspired community of artists all call home.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/discover-cool-canada/2018/nov/01/the-lowdown-on-nova-scotia-canadas-seaside-paradise\">The lowdown on Nova Scotia, Canada\u2019s seaside paradise</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Fossil hunt at Bay of Fundy<br></strong>The <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2KVTjiC\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bay of Fundy</a> is a unique, visually arresting coastal environment. Every day the tide rises as high as 16 metres (53 feet) and during the following six hours recedes back down, leaving behind geological gems on the ocean floor. At low tide, it\u2019s possible to walk along the mudflats, hunt for fossils and look at marine life in tidal pools. For a more adrenaline-infused way to experience the tides, head out on a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2ITldJG\" rel=\"nofollow\">tidal-bore rafting adventure</a>. When the incoming tide meets the Shubenacadie River, the waves created by the tidal bore make for a pretty wild rafting ride.</p> <p><strong>On the Halifax waterfront<br></strong>Halifax boasts almost 4km of boardwalk and the waterfront is jam-packed with museums, farmers\u2019 markets and shops. There are also plenty of options for harbour tours. Alternatively, watch the boats sail in while sipping on a cold pint in a beer garden, or head somewhere a little more upscale, like <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2xhXBrI\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Five Fishermen</a>, to feast on fresh seafood and local wines. Catch some live music at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/31PsvFI\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stayner\u2019s Wharf Pub and Grill</a>, or at the iconic <a href=\"http://bit.ly/31ZgCNG\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lower Deck</a>, located in one of the beautiful Historic Properties. Across the harbour, the downtown of neighbouring Dartmouth boasts lots of excellent<strong> </strong>cafes, breweries and restaurants. The ferry takes just 10 minutes to cross and offers excellent views of the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c7a3a7ab3790e93c7ea5b901edb4530b0ed82ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c7a3a7ab3790e93c7ea5b901edb4530b0ed82ff/0_105_1555_933/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Annapolis valley is home to most of Nova Scotia\u2019s vineyards\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Annapolis valley is home to most of Nova Scotia\u2019s vineyards</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Enjoy the magic of wine country<br></strong>The last decade has seen a surge in <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2KUv8AZ\" rel=\"nofollow\">vineyards in Nova Scotia</a>, most of them located in the gorgeous Annapolis Valley, a collection of farms and vineyards that are on a similar latitude to Bordeaux. The coastal region is one of the cooler climate limits for vines, and the results yield crisp, bright white wines that pair spectacularly with seafood. There\u2019s even a Tidal Bay appellation, with most wineries producing their own blend made from 100% Nova Scotia-grown grapes. A hot tip to visit wine country in Nova Scotia is to board the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/31PrQ7c\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Winery Bus</a>, a vintage British doubledecker that provides a guided hop-on hop-off service to the best wineries in the area.</p> <p><strong>Explore the coastline<br></strong>Wherever you end up in Nova Scotia, you can count on a beach being close by.

      "bodyText": "Nova Scotia is the kind of place where strangers stop to talk and smiles come easy. It\u2019s also where this famous east-coast hospitality, fresh seafood, good wine and pristine beaches all come together to create memorable summer holidays. Just a six-hour flight from the UK, there\u2019s no shortage of things to do, from exploring historic fishing villages to world-class surfing. Here are our top 10 recommendations. Line up a lobster Whether it\u2019s fish and chips from a food truck or fresh oysters from a trendy downtown restaurant, there is no shortage of seafood here. Although Nova Scotia is renowned for its lobster, other seafood options are extensive and menus are constantly evolving, but for a traditional lobster feast, you can take your pick from a lineup of restaurants along the Halifax waterfront. The most famous local lobster experience, however, can be found at the Shore Club, located by the shore 30 minutes outside of the city in Hubbards. The club has been around for more than 80 years and is popular with locals, while the restaurant serves a daily lobster dinner throughout the summer. Take in colourful Lunenburg The charming seaside town, located an hour south of Halifax, on the South Shore, is known for its brightly painted wooden houses and buildings. The colourful facades are meant to reflect how the town would have looked during Victorian times, when houses served as beacons for the ships coming in to port. It\u2019s the perfect town to stroll in, stopping for a fresh seafood lunch by the water and admiring the secret coves and fishing boats. It\u2019s also home to the Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic, as well as the Ironworks Distillery, where visitors can enjoy both local spirits and a lesson in Lunenburg\u2019s history of rum running. Have a pre-breakfast surf The secret is out: some of the best waves this side of the Atlantic are waiting for those intrepid enough to withstand the cool waters. Think misty mornings, wetsuits and world-class waves, all set against the bucolic backdrop of friendly, rural communities. Infamous east-coast storms and hurricanes can result in some intense waves, but it\u2019s still a good spot to learn, with the help of expert teachers at East Coast Surf School. Bonus: the waves are so close to the city you can hit the beach for an early-morning surf and be back in time for breakfast. Sea kayaking in Cape LaHave Kayak through a network of more than 20 islands, with incredible local guides at Cape LaHave Adventures. Paddlers can learn about the flora, fauna and folklore of the region and see untouched beaches and coastal wildlife, including seals. Choose from a two-hour lesson to a three-day glamping adventure that includes campfires, craft cocktails and fresh oysters for dinner. The Rum Runners Trail During Prohibition, many Nova Scotian fishermen opted for a lucrative career change: rum running from Canada to the eastern seaboard of the US. The former train route that transported much of the booze from the hidden inlets to the main ports, almost 100 years ago, has now been converted into a 74-mile multi-use trail that runs between Halifax and Lunenburg. The trail is the ideal way for outdoor enthusiasts to explore the coastal communities, stopping at local cafes, bars, beaches and provincial parks along the way. Alight at Peggy\u2019s Cove Nova Scotia is home to more than 150 lighthouses, but the one at Peggy\u2019s Cove is definitely the most recognised. Just a 40-minute drive outside Halifax, the cove is covered in sprawling granite boulders that stretch out into the crashing waves of the Atlantic, creating a dramatic backdrop for landscape photos and windswept selfies. Wooden fishing shacks and lobster traps line the inlet that both local fishermen and an inspired community of artists all call home. Fossil hunt at Bay of Fundy The Bay of Fundy is a unique, visually arresting coastal environment. Every day the tide rises as high as 16 metres (53 feet) and during the following six hours recedes back down, leaving behind geological gems on the ocean floor. At low tide, it\u2019s possible to walk along the mudflats, hunt for fossils and look at marine life in tidal pools. For a more adrenaline-infused way to experience the tides, head out on a tidal-bore rafting adventure. When the incoming tide meets the Shubenacadie River, the waves created by the tidal bore make for a pretty wild rafting ride. On the Halifax waterfront Halifax boasts almost 4km of boardwalk and the waterfront is jam-packed with museums, farmers\u2019 markets and shops. There are also plenty of options for harbour tours. Alternatively, watch the boats sail in while sipping on a cold pint in a beer garden, or head somewhere a little more upscale, like the Five Fishermen, to feast on fresh seafood and local wines. Catch some live music at Stayner\u2019s Wharf Pub and Grill, or at the iconic Lower Deck, located in one of the beautiful Historic Properties. Across the harbour, the downtown of neighbouring Dartmouth boasts lots of excellent cafes, breweries and restaurants. The ferry takes just 10 minutes to cross and offers excellent views of the city. Enjoy the magic of wine country The last decade has seen a surge in vineyards in Nova Scotia, most of them located in the gorgeous Annapolis Valley, a collection of farms and vineyards that are on a similar latitude to Bordeaux. The coastal region is one of the cooler climate limits for vines, and the results yield crisp, bright white wines that pair spectacularly with seafood. There\u2019s even a Tidal Bay appellation, with most wineries producing their own blend made from 100% Nova Scotia-grown grapes. A hot tip to visit wine country in Nova Scotia is to board the Magic Winery Bus, a vintage British doubledecker that provides a guided hop-on hop-off service to the best wineries in the area. Explore the coastline Wherever you end up in Nova Scotia, you can count on a beach being close by. The province has more than 8,200 miles of pristine coastline, including the many islands that dot the coast, and there are beaches to suit everyone\u2019s taste. Think white sand and crystal-clear turquoise water, rocky, mist-laden shores with rolling waves or swimming and relaxing at the warm water beaches of Northumberland Shore. If you fancy surfing, Lawrencetown beach is a favourite, with its sand and cobblestone beach and big waves, just half an hour from the city centre. Crystal Crescent, just 40 minutes south of the city, is an expansive crescent-shaped beach, backed by a gorgeous 12-mile coastal hiking trail.

When you do, it can\u2019t help but stick out.</p> <p>Which isn\u2019t to say that Holly Hobbie doesn\u2019t fit on CBBC. It absolutely does. Holly is the sort of girl who, when confronted with sheep in the road, cycles up to them and says: \u201cBeep beep.\u201d She sells muffins in her grandmother\u2019s cafe after school. She finds herself permanently adjacent to endless Little League games. If the show was any more wholesome, it would die of constipation. As such, it slots right in to the CBBC schedule.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/05/cbeebies-the-clean-green-slightly-bonkers-world\">The clean, green and slightly bonkers world of CBeebies | Sophie Elmhirst</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But part of me wonders whether the sheer Americanness of Holly Hobbie is a step too far. American shows are everywhere right now. If you\u2019re a kid with even the slightest ability to channel-hop in 2019, you will be inundated with American shows wherever you look. They\u2019re not all bad \u2013 in fact, in the case of something like Netflix\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80108159\">Ask the StoryBots</a>, they can be world-beatingly great \u2013 but they are ubiquitous nonetheless.</p> <p>Until now, the BBC\u2019s childrens\u2019 output felt like a respite from that; it felt like an oasis of smaller, homelier shows that you could put on whenever you got worried that your child was about to start saying \u201czee\u201d or \u201cfire truck\u201d, or using the incorrect number of syllables to pronounce the word \u201caluminium\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s always good, especially when you are young, to see a version of yourself reflected onscreen. For the most part, the BBC is tremendous at providing that for British children. Its shows have a grounding in place that would be missed if it just imported programmes wholesale from elsewhere. It would be a shame for CBBC to lose such a delightful niche by shipping in more US shows such as this. So, as needlessly confrontational as this is going to sound on Independence Day, Holly Hobbie should think about going back to where she came from.</p>",

It is based on the life of a real American illustrator who made her fortune by selling her likeness to a range of deliberately folksy dolls, which is just about the most American thing I have ever heard. There is simply no way to disguise how intrinsically American Holly Hobbie is. And that\u2019s quite rare. Ofcom demands that the overwhelming majority of programming on CBBC be original and UK-commissioned so, aside from a smattering of movie spin-off cartoons and the occasional stupid prank show, it\u2019s almost completely impossible to hear an American accent on CBBC these days. When you do, it can\u2019t help but stick out. Which isn\u2019t to say that Holly Hobbie doesn\u2019t fit on CBBC. It absolutely does. Holly is the sort of girl who, when confronted with sheep in the road, cycles up to them and says: \u201cBeep beep.\u201d She sells muffins in her grandmother\u2019s cafe after school. She finds herself permanently adjacent to endless Little League games. If the show was any more wholesome, it would die of constipation. As such, it slots right in to the CBBC schedule. But part of me wonders whether the sheer Americanness of Holly Hobbie is a step too far. American shows are everywhere right now. If you\u2019re a kid with even the slightest ability to channel-hop in 2019, you will be inundated with American shows wherever you look. They\u2019re not all bad \u2013 in fact, in the case of something like Netflix\u2019s Ask the StoryBots, they can be world-beatingly great \u2013 but they are ubiquitous nonetheless. Until now, the BBC\u2019s childrens\u2019 output felt like a respite from that; it felt like an oasis of smaller, homelier shows that you could put on whenever you got worried that your child was about to start saying \u201czee\u201d or \u201cfire truck\u201d, or using the incorrect number of syllables to pronounce the word \u201caluminium\u201d. It\u2019s always good, especially when you are young, to see a version of yourself reflected onscreen. For the most part, the BBC is tremendous at providing that for British children. Its shows have a grounding in place that would be missed if it just imported programmes wholesale from elsewhere. It would be a shame for CBBC to lose such a delightful niche by shipping in more US shows such as this. So, as needlessly confrontational as this is going to sound on Independence Day, Holly Hobbie should think about going back to where she came from.",

I\u2019m BLACK &amp; my name is Magid. I don\u2019t intend to try fit in. Get used to it.\u201d </p> \n<p>He suggested his physical appearance had made \u201cpeople feel uncomfortable\u201d. He added: \u201cMEPs don\u2019t reflect the people that they represent, Europe-wide, and I know I\u2019m gonna stick out like a sore thumb.\u201d</p> \n<p>The European parliament said no member of its staff was involved in the incident.</p> \n<p>The European Network Against Racism (ENAR), a network of more than 160 grassroots anti-racism organisations, said the incident reflected a wider pattern in European politics: \u201cTo be successful in EU politics, you must be white.\u201d</p> \n<p>Last week Younus Omarjee, an MEP from the French island of R\u00e9union, documented another alleged racist encounter. Travelling by train to Brussels, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/younousomarjee/status/1144563900366635008\">Omarjee said</a>, he and his Congolese colleague were the only people in the carriage to be subjected to a targeted police control.</p> \n<p>Sarah Chander, a senior advocacy officer at the ENAR, said: \u201cUnfortunately, for people of colour in Brussels this week the issue has not been how to secure the top jobs. Instead, a number of ethnic minority MEPs have simply had to justify their right to be here.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese incidents may seem minor to some. A snide comment here, a \u2018random\u2019 security check there. Many of the responses on Twitter were eager to deny that racism may have been a factor motivating these encounters. But these incidents are major and they are significant.

      "bodyText": "An incident in which a black British MEP was asked to leave the European parliament on his first day highlighted the lack of racial diversity in EU politics, a campaign group has said. Magid Magid, a Green MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber, said he nearly missed the opening of the new legislature in Strasbourg after he was asked to leave the building. He said the request had undertones of racism. \u201cI know I\u2019m visibly different,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI don\u2019t have the privilege to hide my identity. I\u2019m BLACK &amp; my name is Magid. I don\u2019t intend to try fit in. Get used to it.\u201d He suggested his physical appearance had made \u201cpeople feel uncomfortable\u201d. He added: \u201cMEPs don\u2019t reflect the people that they represent, Europe-wide, and I know I\u2019m gonna stick out like a sore thumb.\u201d The European parliament said no member of its staff was involved in the incident. The European Network Against Racism (ENAR), a network of more than 160 grassroots anti-racism organisations, said the incident reflected a wider pattern in European politics: \u201cTo be successful in EU politics, you must be white.\u201d Last week Younus Omarjee, an MEP from the French island of R\u00e9union, documented another alleged racist encounter. Travelling by train to Brussels, Omarjee said, he and his Congolese colleague were the only people in the carriage to be subjected to a targeted police control. Sarah Chander, a senior advocacy officer at the ENAR, said: \u201cUnfortunately, for people of colour in Brussels this week the issue has not been how to secure the top jobs. Instead, a number of ethnic minority MEPs have simply had to justify their right to be here. \u201cThese incidents may seem minor to some. A snide comment here, a \u2018random\u2019 security check there. Many of the responses on Twitter were eager to deny that racism may have been a factor motivating these encounters. But these incidents are major and they are significant. They reflect a wider pattern in European politics.\u201d Magid, who wore a baseball cap and a T-shirt reading \u201cf**k fascism\u201d to the opening of parliament, said he did not know the identity of the person who asked him to leave, although he believed they were an official. He said the person asked if he was lost and then suggested he leave. After receiving messages of support, Magid said: \u201cJust to clarify [I] obviously didn\u2019t leave. But to even be put in this position says a lot about what people think the stereotypical politician is meant to look like.\u201d A spokeswoman for the European parliament said: \u201cWe investigated the matter immediately after our attention was brought to it and can safely say that no member of parliament staff was involved.\u201d In 2017 the European commission launched a diversity strategy calling for special measures to improve representation of four groups: women, people with disabilities, LGBTI people and older people. Chander said nothing had changed. The ENAR said only 5% of MEPs were people of colour and it predicted the situation was likely to worsen after Brexit. \u201cThe EU holds immense power on affairs directly affecting people of colour. The EU has the competence to influence migration policy, non-discrimination legislation, data protection and justice issues. And yet people of colour are absent in EU power circles,\u201d Chander said. \u201cThere are no explicit steps toward positive action to improve racial diversity.

The letter cites statistics showing that by February, manufacturing stockpiling had hit the highest ever level in any of the G7 major industrialised nations since records began, with surveys showing two-thirds of manufacturers considering stockpiling or already doing it. \u201cThose data, combined with a discrepancy between orders and outputs on a scale not seen in recent years, demonstrate clearly that manufacturers are responding to potential supply-chain disruptions by increasing buying activity and stockpiling,\u201d the letter warns. \u201cThis has serious implications for the financial viability of some manufacturers which are compounded by the fact that orders are on hold, with customers concerned that their goods may get stuck at ports or not able to pass the border.\u201d The shadow ministers say stockpiling put a strain on businesses\u2019 cashflows, saying this had caused a dip in confidence. \u201cCash tied up in stockpiled goods is money not invested in skilling workers, developing new technologies or increasing exports,\u201d they say. \u201cWe call on the government to work with unions, industry bodies and banks to ensure that a package of appropriate support is made available and that relevant authorities and financial institutions are encouraged to show forbearance to exposed businesses.\u201d On Friday, the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, told Sky News that it was impossible to rule out the idea that a no-deal departure could prompt a recession. Asked whether May agreed with this, her spokesman said: \u201cThe PM has been clear that in the event of no deal, there would be disruption. But she\u2019s also said that we are making preparations to keep that disruption to a minimum, and that work is ongoing.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Once Pride in London ends this weekend, the banks, supermarkets and sandwich chains will drop their rainbow-coloured logos and revert to business as usual. Perfect timing, then, for the Barbican, in the east of the capital, to launch <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/series/forbidden-colours\" title=\"\">Forbidden Colours</a>, a series of films made in countries hostile to the rights of LGBT people. The season begins this month with <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/retablo\" title=\"\">Retablo</a>, an understated but powerful study of the relationship between a teenager and his closeted father in the Peruvian Andes.</p> <p>When I phone the film\u2019s 43-year-old writer-director, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5461014/\" title=\"\">Alvaro Delgado Aparicio</a>, I am expecting to hear tales of thwarted funding and industry homophobia. On the contrary, he tells me, the money came easily: a chunk of it from Peru, the rest from Europe. Surely, then, there was some backlash when the movie opened? After all, <a href=\"https://albertodebelaunde.pe/\" title=\"\">Alberto de Belaunde</a>, one of only two out gay members of the country\u2019s majority conservative Congress, recently described a proposed bill for marriage equality and gender identity as \u201cdoomed\u201d. Hardly an auspicious climate for a film such as Retablo. Wrong again: it has played for six weeks to full houses. Perhaps, then, Aparicio has his own war stories about coming out in a part of the world where, as a 2017 CNN report put it, homosexuality is <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/26/americas/lgbt-rights-in-the-americas/index.html\" title=\"\">legal but deadly</a>. \u201cOh, no,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not gay.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfb0afebafc706792aba93e109ada4396120b3f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfb0afebafc706792aba93e109ada4396120b3f3/0_36_2079_1267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alvaro Delgado-Aparicio, director of Retablo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"609\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alvaro Delgado-Aparicio, director of Retablo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Busacca/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dig a little deeper and it transpires that Retablo could only be made by sidestepping some intransigent attitudes in the communities where it was shot. Aparicio spent a year living among villagers in the Andes; securing permission to shoot there required something less than full disclosure. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of conformity, and it\u2019s very conservative and religious. In the deeper parts, there is no police. There\u2019s the rural police and they have their own norms. I heard some, um, complicated stories about teenagers who were gay. People who had been beaten, tied up and left in public places to be humiliated. These things are still happening.\u201d</p> <p>Even the discussion of sexuality was off-limits. \u201cAt the start, we would tell people the story of the film and they just didn\u2019t want to talk about it, they didn\u2019t want to listen. In some places, it was dangerous so we just said, \u2018It\u2019s about a father and son\u2019, because we were afraid of how they would react. But we shot the film and many of the villagers ended up being extras.\u201d Later this year, he is planning to take Retablo to the communities where it was made. But if those people were unable even to mention sexuality, how will they feel about appearing in a movie that shows a boy witnessing his father being masturbated, albeit discreetly, by another man? \u201cWe\u2019ll see. It\u2019s very important to me that we go back and have that conversation and find out what happens.\u201d</p> <p>The other title already confirmed in the Barbican season comes from Romania, where homosexuality was not decriminalised until 2001. <a href=\"https://www.edfilmfest.org.uk/2018/several-conversations-about-very-tall-girl-cateva-conversatii-despre-o-fata-foarte-inalta/06-0\" title=\"\">Several Conversations About a Very Tall Girl</a> is a lesbian love story that exudes a Nouvelle Vague freshness despite being confined largely to apartment interiors and laptop screens. \u201cThe LGBT community in Bucharest has very few safe spaces to meet,\u201d explains the film\u2019s 42-year-old writer-director, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6518715/\" title=\"\">Bogdan Theodor Olteanu</a>, who, like Aparacio, is not gay himself. \u201cTheir life has to be very much online.\u201d One of the main characters, raised in the city, is comfortable with her sexuality, while the other carries with her from a smalltown upbringing a raft of inhibitions and neuroses. \u201cIt\u2019s a film about fear and what it does to people. In Romanian society, there is a fear of authority left over from communism and that has implications on many levels \u2013 it destroys people\u2019s attempts to be happy as well as their ability to express opinions and hold politicians to account.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3cf3d76f7a040b0da29fe225955f48d17c633283\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cf3d76f7a040b0da29fe225955f48d17c633283/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Romanian film Several Conversations About a Very Tall Girl is being shown at the Barbican.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Romanian film Several Conversations About a Very Tall Girl is being shown at the Barbican.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>State-owned cinemas in Bucharest refused to show Olteanu\u2019s film, although he points out that even venues that agree to programme a movie can still sabotage it in subtle ways. \u201cThey might only give you two screenings a day, very early in the morning. Then they will say: \u2018Oh, it didn\u2019t sell any tickets.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Other releases in Bucharest have fared even worse. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/07/robin-campillo-120-beats-per-minute-director-interview\" title=\"\">Robin Campillo</a>\u2019s award-winning Aids drama 120 Beats Per Minute had one of its screenings disrupted by rightwing protesters. A group calling itself Christian Orthodox invaded the cinema and sang the national anthem while brandishing banners with slogans such as \u201cRomania isn\u2019t Sodom\u201d and \u201cHey Soros, leave them kids alone\u201d (a reference to the Hungarian-American liberal philanthropist George Soros).</p> <p>Similarly targeted was a Romanian film, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7262052/\" title=\"\">Soldiers: </a><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7262052/\" title=\"\">Story from Ferentari</a>, which depicts the unlikely romance between a man recently estranged from his girlfriend and an ex-convict from the Roma community. Soldiers is shot with a Fassbinder-esque eye for the social and economic pressures that shape our most intimate relationships, but try telling that to the protesters, who played rock music to drown out the movie. Its 35-year old Serbian director, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3875677/?ref_=nmbio_bio_nm\" title=\"\">Ivana Mladenovic</a>, shrugs when I ask her about the incident. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there. I heard there were supposed to be undercover police taking care of it and making sure the film wasn\u2019t stopped, but fights still broke out. It wasn\u2019t anything more than that.\u201d</p> <p>Although Several Conversations About a Very Tall Girl was spared such protests, Olteanu encountered a wariness among some actors to audition for it. \u201cFrom my shortlist of eight women, four declined because they were afraid of what a gay role might do to their career. One said to me: \u2018I work with a lot of older directors in the theatre and some of them may exclude me if I do this.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4c1f0e1899c9d818b4fdcb2d9af9221006ab983\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4c1f0e1899c9d818b4fdcb2d9af9221006ab983/0_139_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Levan Akin had to have bodyguards on the set of his film And Then We Danced.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Levan Akin had to have bodyguards on the set of his film And Then We Danced.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Busacca/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The gay Swedish-Georgian film-maker <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2172605/\" title=\"\">Levan Akin</a>, whose drama <a href=\"https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/and-then-we-danced-cannes-review/5139269.article\" title=\"\">And Then We Danced</a> premiered at Cannes this year and has the distinction of being the first explicitly gay-themed Georgian movie, factored the protection of cast members into his budget. \u201cSome of them aren\u2019t in Georgia any more,\u201d the 39-year-old says cheerfully. \u201cWe would rather be safe than sorry, so we budgeted for them to not be around for a while after the movie came out. They\u2019re having fun at the moment travelling in Europe.\u201d Perhaps they will even have enjoyed the sort of inclusive festivities that would have been denied them had they stayed at home: Tblisi\u2019s first-ever Pride celebration was cancelled last month in the face of rightwing opposition and a lack of state protection. Hardly surprising in a country that the <a href=\"http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSContents.jsp\" title=\"\">World Values Survey</a> ranked the third most homophobic in the world.</p> <p>The making of Akin\u2019s film, which explores the attraction between two men in a traditional Georgian dance company, was littered with obstacles. \u201cThe Georgian National Film Center did not support it. Even retroactively after we got into Cannes, it refused to express support. We also met with Nino Sukhishvili from the Georgian National Ballet before shooting, and her reaction was: \u2018Why can\u2019t he fall in love with a girl? There are no gay people in Georgian dance.\u2019 We could have really used her help, but she wouldn\u2019t support us. Not only that but we found out that she called other dance companies and banned dancers from appearing in the movie, telling them they would never dance again. And the effect spread. We would lose important locations at a few days\u2019 notice because suddenly there were \u2018renovations\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Threats from a rightwing group resulted in the production employing bodyguards on set, while scenes shot in public spaces required a convincing cover story. \u201cWe told people it was a movie about a French guy drawn to the beauty of Georgian culture,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt all bolstered us. It made us feel the movie was very important. People in the west may have this complacent feeling: \u2018Oh, that fight is over.\u2019 But it\u2019s not. In most places in the world, it is far from over. And in Georgia, it\u2019s an extreme situation. On one hand, there is the Orthodox religious community that says the gays and the paedophiles are taking over \u2013 that\u2019s also the narrative Russia is pushing. And then there are the kids coming up, fighting against that, some of whom are in my movie. The future of Georgia belongs to them, not to the old, bearded guys who try to beat them up. I wanted to make a film about how you can own and redefine your culture rather than leaving it to the bigots.\u201d He claims he has already detected a change among people involved with the film. \u201cOne of the actors had a message from his aunt, who used to be homophobic, telling him not to listen to the haters. And some people in smaller roles on the film were a bit prejudiced at first but now they feel differently. We\u2019re changing a few minds. I hope we can change even more.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Retablo is at the <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/series/forbidden-colours\" title=\"\">Barbican, London EC1</a>, on 9 and 16</em><em> July; Several Conversations About a Very Tall Girl is on 22 October.

      "bodyText": "Once Pride in London ends this weekend, the banks, supermarkets and sandwich chains will drop their rainbow-coloured logos and revert to business as usual. Perfect timing, then, for the Barbican, in the east of the capital, to launch Forbidden Colours, a series of films made in countries hostile to the rights of LGBT people. The season begins this month with Retablo, an understated but powerful study of the relationship between a teenager and his closeted father in the Peruvian Andes. When I phone the film\u2019s 43-year-old writer-director, Alvaro Delgado Aparicio, I am expecting to hear tales of thwarted funding and industry homophobia. On the contrary, he tells me, the money came easily: a chunk of it from Peru, the rest from Europe. Surely, then, there was some backlash when the movie opened? After all, Alberto de Belaunde, one of only two out gay members of the country\u2019s majority conservative Congress, recently described a proposed bill for marriage equality and gender identity as \u201cdoomed\u201d. Hardly an auspicious climate for a film such as Retablo. Wrong again: it has played for six weeks to full houses. Perhaps, then, Aparicio has his own war stories about coming out in a part of the world where, as a 2017 CNN report put it, homosexuality is legal but deadly. \u201cOh, no,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not gay.\u201d Dig a little deeper and it transpires that Retablo could only be made by sidestepping some intransigent attitudes in the communities where it was shot. Aparicio spent a year living among villagers in the Andes; securing permission to shoot there required something less than full disclosure. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of conformity, and it\u2019s very conservative and religious. In the deeper parts, there is no police. There\u2019s the rural police and they have their own norms. I heard some, um, complicated stories about teenagers who were gay. People who had been beaten, tied up and left in public places to be humiliated. These things are still happening.\u201d Even the discussion of sexuality was off-limits. \u201cAt the start, we would tell people the story of the film and they just didn\u2019t want to talk about it, they didn\u2019t want to listen. In some places, it was dangerous so we just said, \u2018It\u2019s about a father and son\u2019, because we were afraid of how they would react. But we shot the film and many of the villagers ended up being extras.\u201d Later this year, he is planning to take Retablo to the communities where it was made. But if those people were unable even to mention sexuality, how will they feel about appearing in a movie that shows a boy witnessing his father being masturbated, albeit discreetly, by another man? \u201cWe\u2019ll see. It\u2019s very important to me that we go back and have that conversation and find out what happens.\u201d The other title already confirmed in the Barbican season comes from Romania, where homosexuality was not decriminalised until 2001. Several Conversations About a Very Tall Girl is a lesbian love story that exudes a Nouvelle Vague freshness despite being confined largely to apartment interiors and laptop screens. \u201cThe LGBT community in Bucharest has very few safe spaces to meet,\u201d explains the film\u2019s 42-year-old writer-director, Bogdan Theodor Olteanu, who, like Aparacio, is not gay himself. \u201cTheir life has to be very much online.\u201d One of the main characters, raised in the city, is comfortable with her sexuality, while the other carries with her from a smalltown upbringing a raft of inhibitions and neuroses. \u201cIt\u2019s a film about fear and what it does to people. In Romanian society, there is a fear of authority left over from communism and that has implications on many levels \u2013 it destroys people\u2019s attempts to be happy as well as their ability to express opinions and hold politicians to account.\u201d State-owned cinemas in Bucharest refused to show Olteanu\u2019s film, although he points out that even venues that agree to programme a movie can still sabotage it in subtle ways. \u201cThey might only give you two screenings a day, very early in the morning. Then they will say: \u2018Oh, it didn\u2019t sell any tickets.\u2019\u201d Other releases in Bucharest have fared even worse. Last year, Robin Campillo\u2019s award-winning Aids drama 120 Beats Per Minute had one of its screenings disrupted by rightwing protesters. A group calling itself Christian Orthodox invaded the cinema and sang the national anthem while brandishing banners with slogans such as \u201cRomania isn\u2019t Sodom\u201d and \u201cHey Soros, leave them kids alone\u201d (a reference to the Hungarian-American liberal philanthropist George Soros). Similarly targeted was a Romanian film, Soldiers: Story from Ferentari, which depicts the unlikely romance between a man recently estranged from his girlfriend and an ex-convict from the Roma community. Soldiers is shot with a Fassbinder-esque eye for the social and economic pressures that shape our most intimate relationships, but try telling that to the protesters, who played rock music to drown out the movie. Its 35-year old Serbian director, Ivana Mladenovic, shrugs when I ask her about the incident. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there. I heard there were supposed to be undercover police taking care of it and making sure the film wasn\u2019t stopped, but fights still broke out. It wasn\u2019t anything more than that.\u201d Although Several Conversations About a Very Tall Girl was spared such protests, Olteanu encountered a wariness among some actors to audition for it. \u201cFrom my shortlist of eight women, four declined because they were afraid of what a gay role might do to their career. One said to me: \u2018I work with a lot of older directors in the theatre and some of them may exclude me if I do this.\u2019\u201d The gay Swedish-Georgian film-maker Levan Akin, whose drama And Then We Danced premiered at Cannes this year and has the distinction of being the first explicitly gay-themed Georgian movie, factored the protection of cast members into his budget. \u201cSome of them aren\u2019t in Georgia any more,\u201d the 39-year-old says cheerfully. \u201cWe would rather be safe than sorry, so we budgeted for them to not be around for a while after the movie came out. They\u2019re having fun at the moment travelling in Europe.\u201d Perhaps they will even have enjoyed the sort of inclusive festivities that would have been denied them had they stayed at home: Tblisi\u2019s first-ever Pride celebration was cancelled last month in the face of rightwing opposition and a lack of state protection. Hardly surprising in a country that the World Values Survey ranked the third most homophobic in the world. The making of Akin\u2019s film, which explores the attraction between two men in a traditional Georgian dance company, was littered with obstacles. \u201cThe Georgian National Film Center did not support it. Even retroactively after we got into Cannes, it refused to express support. We also met with Nino Sukhishvili from the Georgian National Ballet before shooting, and her reaction was: \u2018Why can\u2019t he fall in love with a girl? There are no gay people in Georgian dance.\u2019 We could have really used her help, but she wouldn\u2019t support us. Not only that but we found out that she called other dance companies and banned dancers from appearing in the movie, telling them they would never dance again. And the effect spread. We would lose important locations at a few days\u2019 notice because suddenly there were \u2018renovations\u2019.\u201d Threats from a rightwing group resulted in the production employing bodyguards on set, while scenes shot in public spaces required a convincing cover story. \u201cWe told people it was a movie about a French guy drawn to the beauty of Georgian culture,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt all bolstered us. It made us feel the movie was very important. People in the west may have this complacent feeling: \u2018Oh, that fight is over.\u2019 But it\u2019s not. In most places in the world, it is far from over. And in Georgia, it\u2019s an extreme situation. On one hand, there is the Orthodox religious community that says the gays and the paedophiles are taking over \u2013 that\u2019s also the narrative Russia is pushing. And then there are the kids coming up, fighting against that, some of whom are in my movie. The future of Georgia belongs to them, not to the old, bearded guys who try to beat them up. I wanted to make a film about how you can own and redefine your culture rather than leaving it to the bigots.\u201d He claims he has already detected a change among people involved with the film. \u201cOne of the actors had a message from his aunt, who used to be homophobic, telling him not to listen to the haters. And some people in smaller roles on the film were a bit prejudiced at first but now they feel differently. We\u2019re changing a few minds. I hope we can change even more.\u201d \u2022 Retablo is at the Barbican, London EC1, on 9 and 16 July; Several Conversations About a Very Tall Girl is on 22 October. And Then We Danced will be released next year",

      "body": "<p>For nearly 30 years the discordant sound that Sunday Telegraph readers heard each weekend was the paper\u2019s columnist Christopher Booker barking up the wrong tree. Booker, the first editor of the satirical magazine Private Eye, took iconoclasm to extraordinary, and frequently eccentric, lengths.

Many of his stories, such as the allegation that the EU would force owners to pressure-cook their dead pets before burying them, were ludicrous, but they helped to contribute to the pervasive hostility to Europe that fuelled the 2016 referendum result. Characteristically, in March this year, in one of his last columns, Booker castigated the shambles that has resulted: \u201cEven those few of us who have been trying to explain the unrecognised realities of our situation since long before the referendum could not have predicted quite what a catastrophic mess we would end up with \u2026 By ripping us out of the incredibly complex system that had so tightly integrated our economy with the rest of the EU we were putting at risk not just a large part of our currently frictionless export trade with the EU itself which provides an eighth of our national income, we were also risking much of our trade with other countries across the world.\u201d Booker\u2019s conviction that climate change was a hoax was another long-term obsession. He described governments\u2019 attempts to reduce carbon emissions as \u201cone of the most expensive, destructive and foolish mistakes the human race has ever made\u201d. His many scientific critics, pointing out that he had no such qualifications himself, were infuriated by the simplistic errors he made and maintained in his analysis, even when they were pointed out to him. George Monbiot, writing in the Guardian in 2011, described Booker as \u201csimply a device to waste as much of other people\u2019s time as possible \u2026 a computer programme randomly generating nonsense. It seems almost impossible that one man could make so many superhuman cock-ups.\u201d Exasperated, at one stage the head of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change sued him over allegations he had made. Such criticism seemed to make little difference to his certainties. A judge upbraided him over his coverage of an abuse case, for relying on a mother\u2019s claim that her child had only suffered mild bruising rather than the broken bones actually incurred. Noting that Booker had not attended the court, Judge Clifford Bellamy said: \u201cTo rely uncritically upon what a parent says can lead to reporting that is unbalanced, inaccurate and just plain wrong.\u201d Among his other books was The Seven Basic Plots (2004), a study of the patterns used in novel writing, which criticised authors such as Proust, Joyce and DH Lawrence while praising the films ET and Terminator 2. As a young man, Booker claimed that he wanted to edit a magazine, appear on television and marry an aristocrat\u2019s daughter. He managed all three by the age of 25, though his first marriage, in 1963, to Emma Tennant, the daughter of Lord Glenconner, was brief, as was his second marriage, in 1972, to Christine Verity; both ended in divorce. He is survived by his third wife, Valerie Patrick, whom he married in 1979, and their two sons, Nicholas and Alexander. \u2022 Christopher John Penrice Booker, journalist and author, born 7 October 1937; died 3 July 2019",

      "body": "<p>With his Oscar-winning debut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/apr/13/worldcinema.drama\">The Lives of Others</a> in 2006, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck made an important movie about the intellectual squalor of postwar East Germany, featuring a Stasi spy whose life of bugging and listening-in betrays his own emotional bankruptcy \u2013 and that of an entire ideology. But Donnersmarck\u2019s following film was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/dec/09/the-tourist-review\">lacklustre caper The Tourist</a> starring Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp in 2010. Now here is his third film, Werk Ohne Autor (that is: Work Without Author \u2013 although it has been assigned the English title Never Look Away) which received Oscar nominations for best foreign film and best cinematography.</p> <p>It\u2019s an unevenly acted and sometimes frankly misjudged sexy-sentimental melodrama of epic length set in Germany of the 1930s, 40s, 50s and 60s, based on the life of the artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gerhard-richter\">Gerhard Richter</a>, and inspired by the eerie, tragic coincidences in Richter\u2019s family background, which he appeared to intuit in his work before actually finding out about them in later life. The fictionalisation makes all this look like a solemn and interminable TV movie.</p> <p>Tom Schilling plays Kurt, a young German artist who finally achieves success with paintings derived from what are avowedly anonymous snapshots and photo booth pictures: the press hails a new authorless aesthetic.

      "bodyText": "With his Oscar-winning debut The Lives of Others in 2006, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck made an important movie about the intellectual squalor of postwar East Germany, featuring a Stasi spy whose life of bugging and listening-in betrays his own emotional bankruptcy \u2013 and that of an entire ideology. But Donnersmarck\u2019s following film was the lacklustre caper The Tourist starring Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp in 2010. Now here is his third film, Werk Ohne Autor (that is: Work Without Author \u2013 although it has been assigned the English title Never Look Away) which received Oscar nominations for best foreign film and best cinematography. It\u2019s an unevenly acted and sometimes frankly misjudged sexy-sentimental melodrama of epic length set in Germany of the 1930s, 40s, 50s and 60s, based on the life of the artist Gerhard Richter, and inspired by the eerie, tragic coincidences in Richter\u2019s family background, which he appeared to intuit in his work before actually finding out about them in later life. The fictionalisation makes all this look like a solemn and interminable TV movie. Tom Schilling plays Kurt, a young German artist who finally achieves success with paintings derived from what are avowedly anonymous snapshots and photo booth pictures: the press hails a new authorless aesthetic. But these images are, in fact, deeply embedded in his own memories \u2013 images of a beautiful, troubled aunt who set him on the road to his vocation when he was a boy back in prewar Germany, and of his overbearing, sinister father-in-law, played by Sebastian Koch (who was the careerist author in The Lives of Others). Never Look Away is not without ambition and reach, and there is a real storytelling impulse. But the central performance of Schilling looks shruggingly uncertain, as if he is bemused by what is going on. And the scene at the beginning, showing the Nazi regime\u2019s gassing of mentally disabled young women as a tastefully tragi-romantic curtain-raiser for all the drama to come, is misconceived. There is an interesting cameo at the beginning from Lars Eidinger as the hatchet-faced Nazi functionary who gives conducted tours of the national exhibition of \u201cdegenerate art\u201d, complete with acid commentary.",

The 25-year-old striker has signed a four-year contract with Leicester after they activated the buy-out clause in his contract and beat off competition from a number of leading European clubs.</p> <p>Leicester will now press ahead with their attempt to sign Youri Tielemans from Monaco. Tielemans is keen to move to the King Power Stadium after enjoying a successful loan spell last season but it is understood that Leicester and Monaco are still some way apart when it comes to their valuation of the 22-year-old midfielder. Leicester recognise that it will take a club-record deal to sign Tielemans but the asking price is currently upward of \u00a340m and there may well need to be a compromise to get the transfer through.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/03/manchester-city-pay-rodri-release-clause-atletico-madrid-transfer-window-football\">Manchester City sign Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s Rodri after paying \u00a362.8m release clause</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Including Adrien Silva as a makeweight \u2013 the Portuguese moved to Monaco on loan last season as part of the deal that saw Tielemans go the other way \u2013 would appeal to Leicester but the French club have made it clear that they want any transfer for the Belgium international to be straight cash. That is not to say that Monaco may not return for Silva at a later date in what feels like a game of brinkmanship.</p> <p>The arrival of P\u00e9rez, meanwhile, will increase Leicester\u2019s attacking options and also raises the prospect of him playing alongside Jamie Vardy. Leicester have tried and failed to find a player to fulfil that second striker role in recent years, with Kelechi Iheanacho enduring two difficult seasons following his arrival from Manchester City. Iheanacho, however, is expected to stay at Leicester.</p> <p>P\u00e9rez scored 12 Premier League goals last season, with his excellent partnership with Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n helping Newcastle to pull away from the relegation zone. Newcastle will make a large profit on a player signed from Tenerife for \u00a31.5m in 2014, but his departure also leaves a sizeable hole to fill. P\u00e9rez has been Newcastle\u2019s top scorer in all competitions in each of the past two seasons, getting 13 goals in the last campaign and also reaching double figures the year before.</p> <p>His versatility, together with his age and his excellent form for Newcastle in the second half of the season, when he scored 11 goals, made him an attractive proposition for Leicester and their manager, Brendan Rodgers. \u201cI think Ayoze will be a wonderful addition to the squad,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cHe\u2019s quick, has a good eye for goal and he\u2019s experienced in the Premier League too. I think he\u2019s a player who will excite our supporters.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Leicester City have completed the signing of Ayoze P\u00e9rez from Newcastle for around \u00a330m. The 25-year-old striker has signed a four-year contract with Leicester after they activated the buy-out clause in his contract and beat off competition from a number of leading European clubs. Leicester will now press ahead with their attempt to sign Youri Tielemans from Monaco. Tielemans is keen to move to the King Power Stadium after enjoying a successful loan spell last season but it is understood that Leicester and Monaco are still some way apart when it comes to their valuation of the 22-year-old midfielder. Leicester recognise that it will take a club-record deal to sign Tielemans but the asking price is currently upward of \u00a340m and there may well need to be a compromise to get the transfer through. Including Adrien Silva as a makeweight \u2013 the Portuguese moved to Monaco on loan last season as part of the deal that saw Tielemans go the other way \u2013 would appeal to Leicester but the French club have made it clear that they want any transfer for the Belgium international to be straight cash. That is not to say that Monaco may not return for Silva at a later date in what feels like a game of brinkmanship. The arrival of P\u00e9rez, meanwhile, will increase Leicester\u2019s attacking options and also raises the prospect of him playing alongside Jamie Vardy. Leicester have tried and failed to find a player to fulfil that second striker role in recent years, with Kelechi Iheanacho enduring two difficult seasons following his arrival from Manchester City. Iheanacho, however, is expected to stay at Leicester. P\u00e9rez scored 12 Premier League goals last season, with his excellent partnership with Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n helping Newcastle to pull away from the relegation zone. Newcastle will make a large profit on a player signed from Tenerife for \u00a31.5m in 2014, but his departure also leaves a sizeable hole to fill. P\u00e9rez has been Newcastle\u2019s top scorer in all competitions in each of the past two seasons, getting 13 goals in the last campaign and also reaching double figures the year before. His versatility, together with his age and his excellent form for Newcastle in the second half of the season, when he scored 11 goals, made him an attractive proposition for Leicester and their manager, Brendan Rodgers. \u201cI think Ayoze will be a wonderful addition to the squad,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cHe\u2019s quick, has a good eye for goal and he\u2019s experienced in the Premier League too. I think he\u2019s a player who will excite our supporters.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne\u2019s interest in running the International Monetary Fund has met immediate criticism because of the former chancellor\u2019s austerity policies and Brexit-related question marks over the UK\u2019s international standing. Osborne, the editor of the Evening Standard, has signalled to friends that he views himself as a potential candidate to replace Christine Lagarde, the current head of the Washington-based fund, who was nominated to lead the European Central Bank this week. However, his role as the architect of austerity was highlighted on Thursday as being badly out of step with the needs of the global economy, while the IMF has gradually also begun to distance itself from a fiscal approach that requires heavy cuts to public spending. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told the Guardian the use of austerity had hindered the UK\u2019s recovery from the financial crisis. He said: \u201cBefore the decision is made on any IMF appointment, consideration should be made to the fact that George Osborne was the architect of the slowest recovery from a recession since Napoleonic times. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly the record or qualification for someone to steer the ship of the global economy.\u201d The IMF was a prominent advocate of austerity when Osborne was chancellor but has recently drifted away from supporting budget cuts to balance the books.

Two nights previously, he was commanding moshpits at London\u2019s O2 Arena, as tour support to Nicki Minaj. By the end of the week, his second album, <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/juice-wrld-death-race-for-love/\" title=\"\">Death Race for Love</a>, will be at No 1 in the US charts. This weekend, he plays alongside Cardi B, Travis Scott and Future at London\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.wirelessfestival.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Wireless festival</a>; he collaborated with the latter on the album WRLD on Drugs, which reached No 2 in the US last year. Still, the man born Jarad Higgins cannot help wondering where he would be had his esoteric blend of 00s emo and prescription-medicated hip-hop not blown up. \u201cMusic was so nearly just a hobby for me, so I\u2019m always thinking about that,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I\u2019d do instead, who I\u2019d be if it weren\u2019t for all of this.\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t expect to find him delivering parcels any time soon. Since Higgins started recording songs on his phone in 2015 while still at high school, the 20-year-old has evolved from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/20/death-drugs-and-destruction-the-troubled-year-of-soundcloud-rap\" title=\"\">SoundCloud rap</a> also-ran to chart-busting mainstream name. Exploring anxiety and unrequited romance over booming trap beats and minor-chord guitars, he has won a fanbase raised in an internet era in which genre tribalism has been dissolved. Tracks such as his Sting-sampling 2018 breakout hit Lucid Dreams have earned him billions of streams and the approval of Alicia Keys, who covered it at this year\u2019s Grammys. Not that Higgins saw that. \u201cI was taking a piss and missed it,\u201d he laments today.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzB1VGEGcSU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mzB1VGEGcSU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Higgins says that his hybrid sound began \u201cwith a crush I had in fifth grade\u201d, a girl who blogged about peacocking goth-metal band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/28/black-veil-brides-makeup-10-minutes\" title=\"\">Black Veil Brides</a>. \u201cI was like: \u2018I gotta know everything about them so I can impress this girl.\u2019 So I did my research.\u201d Did it work? \u201cHa! No. I wrote her a note: \u2018Do you like me? Yes or no?\u2019 She circled \u2018no\u2019. But I kept listening to the music. Remember those iPod Classics that look like a brick now? I had one filled with Escape the Fate, Panic At the Disco, Killswitch Engage \u2026\u201d He also dresses like someone who cross-pollinates these two worlds, slouching in a basketball jersey and skate shorts, peering back at me from behind an eruption of colourful dreads.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everybody\u2019s got pain. Depression, addiction, heartbreak \u2013 these are human characteristics</p> <footer> <cite>Juice WRLD</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Juice WRLD is part of a rising tide of hip-hop that has been increasingly embracing vulnerability over the past three years, breaking from the genre\u2019s traditional machismo. Songs such as the Death Race cut, Rider, on which he raps despairingly: \u201cMy paranoia and insecurities hold me close / Lay me down to sleep with my casket closed\u201d, take the introspection and isolation pulsing beneath the music of blockbuster acts such as Drake and push them to even rawer extremes. In the anguished realm of emo rap, the likes of Higgins, <a href=\"https://www.liluziofficial.com/\" title=\"\">Lil Uzi Vert</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCstw-41J8syXgdJ8xWvaizA\" title=\"\">Trippie Redd</a> paint pictures of wounded young men numbing their inner torment any way they can, but usually with fentanyl and Xanax.</p> <p>Where is the anguish on Death Race, and in the emo-rap scene at large, coming from? \u201cEverybody\u2019s got pain,\u201d he says. \u201cDepression, addiction, heartbreak: these are human characteristics and human errors they can relate to.\u201d These universal emotions within his music are what is driving his success, with, he suggests, the rest of rap now playing catch-up. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much trash, you know? I\u2019m not clowning any other artists, I love a lot of other rap artists. But after a while, I talk about stuff they either don\u2019t know anything about, or don\u2019t want to admit that they know about. I could write song after song about jumping on private jets, but the people that download my music, most of them won\u2019t ever step on a private jet.\u201d</p> <p>For some, this is a mutation within hip-hop to be celebrated: young men should be able to vent and discuss their fears and frustrations, and emo rap facilitates that. For others, it is dangerous: not long after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/16/death-lil-peep-us-prescription-drugs-epidemic-hip-hop-rapper\" title=\"\">the overdose-induced death of Long Beach emo-rapper Lil Peep in 2017</a>, the US Drug Enforcement Agency slammed the rising scene for alleged \u201cglorification of opioid use\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Juice WRLD is contemplating another life. \u201cYou think I could be a FedEx worker, Mom?\u201d he asks across the room, a suite in a swanky Soho hotel filled with family and friends. Two nights previously, he was commanding moshpits at London\u2019s O2 Arena, as tour support to Nicki Minaj. By the end of the week, his second album, Death Race for Love, will be at No 1 in the US charts. This weekend, he plays alongside Cardi B, Travis Scott and Future at London\u2019s Wireless festival; he collaborated with the latter on the album WRLD on Drugs, which reached No 2 in the US last year. Still, the man born Jarad Higgins cannot help wondering where he would be had his esoteric blend of 00s emo and prescription-medicated hip-hop not blown up. \u201cMusic was so nearly just a hobby for me, so I\u2019m always thinking about that,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I\u2019d do instead, who I\u2019d be if it weren\u2019t for all of this.\u201d Don\u2019t expect to find him delivering parcels any time soon. Since Higgins started recording songs on his phone in 2015 while still at high school, the 20-year-old has evolved from SoundCloud rap also-ran to chart-busting mainstream name. Exploring anxiety and unrequited romance over booming trap beats and minor-chord guitars, he has won a fanbase raised in an internet era in which genre tribalism has been dissolved. Tracks such as his Sting-sampling 2018 breakout hit Lucid Dreams have earned him billions of streams and the approval of Alicia Keys, who covered it at this year\u2019s Grammys. Not that Higgins saw that. \u201cI was taking a piss and missed it,\u201d he laments today. Higgins says that his hybrid sound began \u201cwith a crush I had in fifth grade\u201d, a girl who blogged about peacocking goth-metal band Black Veil Brides. \u201cI was like: \u2018I gotta know everything about them so I can impress this girl.\u2019 So I did my research.\u201d Did it work? \u201cHa! No. I wrote her a note: \u2018Do you like me? Yes or no?\u2019 She circled \u2018no\u2019. But I kept listening to the music. Remember those iPod Classics that look like a brick now? I had one filled with Escape the Fate, Panic At the Disco, Killswitch Engage \u2026\u201d He also dresses like someone who cross-pollinates these two worlds, slouching in a basketball jersey and skate shorts, peering back at me from behind an eruption of colourful dreads. Juice WRLD is part of a rising tide of hip-hop that has been increasingly embracing vulnerability over the past three years, breaking from the genre\u2019s traditional machismo. Songs such as the Death Race cut, Rider, on which he raps despairingly: \u201cMy paranoia and insecurities hold me close / Lay me down to sleep with my casket closed\u201d, take the introspection and isolation pulsing beneath the music of blockbuster acts such as Drake and push them to even rawer extremes. In the anguished realm of emo rap, the likes of Higgins, Lil Uzi Vert and Trippie Redd paint pictures of wounded young men numbing their inner torment any way they can, but usually with fentanyl and Xanax. Where is the anguish on Death Race, and in the emo-rap scene at large, coming from? \u201cEverybody\u2019s got pain,\u201d he says. \u201cDepression, addiction, heartbreak: these are human characteristics and human errors they can relate to.\u201d These universal emotions within his music are what is driving his success, with, he suggests, the rest of rap now playing catch-up. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much trash, you know? I\u2019m not clowning any other artists, I love a lot of other rap artists. But after a while, I talk about stuff they either don\u2019t know anything about, or don\u2019t want to admit that they know about. I could write song after song about jumping on private jets, but the people that download my music, most of them won\u2019t ever step on a private jet.\u201d For some, this is a mutation within hip-hop to be celebrated: young men should be able to vent and discuss their fears and frustrations, and emo rap facilitates that. For others, it is dangerous: not long after the overdose-induced death of Long Beach emo-rapper Lil Peep in 2017, the US Drug Enforcement Agency slammed the rising scene for alleged \u201cglorification of opioid use\u201d. Higgins, who says he \u201cslowed down\u201d his drug use after Peep\u2019s death, shrugs off the suggestion. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s therapy,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery time I make music, it helps me cope. Part of the reason I make it is also for other people to get that release, too. I know I can touch lives with my voice, so I choose to use it.\u201d And he intends to keep using it. After Wireless, there is a collaborative project with Young Thug to come, as well as more new solo music, which may delve even further into the more abrasive ends of emo. \u201cEvery chance I get, I go on YouTube and look up how to scream. It\u2019s supposed to come from your diaphragm but I always sound like somebody just shot a cat. I\u2019m gonna get better, though!\u201d he promises.

However, it was inevitable that an industry propelled by women\u2019s fears and insecurity would land on fertility.</p> <p>The use-by date of our reproductive systems is constantly shone in our eyes like an optician\u2019s torch. But nature doesn\u2019t always follow its own rules. Often until someone starts trying for a baby they have no idea how easy or hard it will be. If conceiving is hard, they might wish they\u2019d started looking into things earlier. This swimming sense of uncertainty can lead people to magical thinking; the belief that what we think, wish or do will affect our physical world realities. During the research process for my new book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hormonal-9780349011394.html\" title=\"\">Hormonal</a>, I spoke to women who felt that if they didn\u2019t try everything on the market that might help with their fertility they\u2019d be shooting themselves in the foot.</p> <p>It is not hard to see how a woman who is anxious she may not conceive might see something like the \u201cfertility drip\u201d in her social media feed and be seduced by the idea. The company boasts having \u201cqualified doctors and nurses\u201d among its healthcare professionals and lists lots of scientific-sounding bumf.</p> <p>Capitalising on this tangle of fear and self-doubt women live with is nothing new. \u201cAlternative\u201d medicine, with its chakras and expensive supplements, has long done the same. Vitamin drips are just one of the newer products being offered, despite being routinely <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thomasdolphin/status/1145349512254369792\" title=\"\">lambasted by medical professionals</a> as false quick fixes. A one-off vitamin IV might have a nice placebo effect but is probably as helpful to our physical constitution as a shoehorn made of rhubarb.</p> <p>We must consider the driving forces behind the consumption of these products. There has been a powerful shift in the way women conceptualise and treat their health. The <a href=\"https://globalwellnessinstitute.org/press-room/press-releases/wellness-now-a-372-trillion-global-industry/\" title=\"\">Global Wellness Institute reports</a> that the wellness industry grew 10.6% from 2013 to 2015 and is now valued at $3.72tn.

Tired of being dismissed, unheard, left in pain or forgotten, women in the western world have created their own alternative healthcare system. This industry has the female body at its centre, providing soft-lit, embracing and safe spaces that make women feel seen, heard and, crucially, an individual with individual needs. </p> <p>From light therapy to sound baths, shamans to yoni crystals, wellness interventions are designed to make women feel unique and treated as such. There are no doubt many practitioners in the field who are kind, dedicated people potentially making their clients feel a lot better about themselves. Yet even the term \u201cpractitioner\u201d is worthy of our suspicion \u2013 those with the self-appointed, proper-sounding title are charging women an absolute fortune for their perceived wisdom but often haven\u2019t studied long-term and don\u2019t have robust qualifications or legislative accountability.</p> <p>Use of the word \u201cwellness\u201d itself is also pernicious because it is nebulous and less open to being challenged by regulatory bodies that have started to home in on companies using words such as \u201cnatural\u201d as a marketing tool. These phrases rely on tapping into or creating a set of values. It can all feel rather sinister when you consider who is ultimately profiting \u2013 usually white, rich people.</p> <p>But it is not only the wellness industry that is selling fertility reassurance to women: the medical world continually monetises women\u2019s hopes in the private sector.

      "bodyText": "Get A Drip, a wellness company offering \u201caffordable IV vitamin drips and booster shots\u201d, has withdrawn a product it called a \u201cfertility IV\u201d from sale after the British Pregnancy Advisory Service said there was no evidence this \u201ctreatment\u201d could improve fertility. The drip was advertised as costing \u00a3250. The only supplements medically recommended for women trying to conceive are folic acid and vitamin D, so you wonder what on earth it contained to warrant such a price tag (\u00a3250 would get you 28 bottles of folic acid from Holland &amp; Barrett, incidentally). More to the point, how could the wellness industry have stooped to such a new, exploitative low? Get A Drip was caught out quickly \u2013 withdrawing this \u201cfertility\u201d product, offering apologies for insensitivity but saying it made no claims of alleviating any medical condition. However, it was inevitable that an industry propelled by women\u2019s fears and insecurity would land on fertility. The use-by date of our reproductive systems is constantly shone in our eyes like an optician\u2019s torch. But nature doesn\u2019t always follow its own rules. Often until someone starts trying for a baby they have no idea how easy or hard it will be. If conceiving is hard, they might wish they\u2019d started looking into things earlier. This swimming sense of uncertainty can lead people to magical thinking; the belief that what we think, wish or do will affect our physical world realities. During the research process for my new book, Hormonal, I spoke to women who felt that if they didn\u2019t try everything on the market that might help with their fertility they\u2019d be shooting themselves in the foot. It is not hard to see how a woman who is anxious she may not conceive might see something like the \u201cfertility drip\u201d in her social media feed and be seduced by the idea. The company boasts having \u201cqualified doctors and nurses\u201d among its healthcare professionals and lists lots of scientific-sounding bumf. Capitalising on this tangle of fear and self-doubt women live with is nothing new. \u201cAlternative\u201d medicine, with its chakras and expensive supplements, has long done the same. Vitamin drips are just one of the newer products being offered, despite being routinely lambasted by medical professionals as false quick fixes. A one-off vitamin IV might have a nice placebo effect but is probably as helpful to our physical constitution as a shoehorn made of rhubarb. We must consider the driving forces behind the consumption of these products. There has been a powerful shift in the way women conceptualise and treat their health. The Global Wellness Institute reports that the wellness industry grew 10.6% from 2013 to 2015 and is now valued at $3.72tn. Many treatments have little evidence base beyond the anecdotal. The continued growth of the wellness industry is a clear response to a medical establishment that so often dehumanises and dismisses women. Tired of being dismissed, unheard, left in pain or forgotten, women in the western world have created their own alternative healthcare system. This industry has the female body at its centre, providing soft-lit, embracing and safe spaces that make women feel seen, heard and, crucially, an individual with individual needs. From light therapy to sound baths, shamans to yoni crystals, wellness interventions are designed to make women feel unique and treated as such. There are no doubt many practitioners in the field who are kind, dedicated people potentially making their clients feel a lot better about themselves. Yet even the term \u201cpractitioner\u201d is worthy of our suspicion \u2013 those with the self-appointed, proper-sounding title are charging women an absolute fortune for their perceived wisdom but often haven\u2019t studied long-term and don\u2019t have robust qualifications or legislative accountability. Use of the word \u201cwellness\u201d itself is also pernicious because it is nebulous and less open to being challenged by regulatory bodies that have started to home in on companies using words such as \u201cnatural\u201d as a marketing tool. These phrases rely on tapping into or creating a set of values. It can all feel rather sinister when you consider who is ultimately profiting \u2013 usually white, rich people. But it is not only the wellness industry that is selling fertility reassurance to women: the medical world continually monetises women\u2019s hopes in the private sector. I rang four Harley Street fertility clinics to inquire about fertility IVs. All offered them to \u201cboost\u201d fertility. One receptionist enthusiastically told me how the doctor would tailor the IV to suit my body\u2019s needs \u2013 \u201cnot the levels supplement companies and scientists say you should have\u201d. Again, our distrust and fear are exploited. It is the same with egg freezing. I\u2019ve written before on how the process has become hugely, perilously commercialised \u2013 81% of treatment cycles in 2016 were carried out in private clinics, costing, on average, \u00a33,350 a go. Yet rates of successful conception down the line are modest. Women should be supported in their decision-making but also made aware of how realistic their chances of pregnancy are. When it comes to money-making, they often aren\u2019t. Regulating bodies must start to engage more fully with questions around private companies profiting from women\u2019s fertility fears. This is true for other expensive products offering alluring reassurances, such as the \u201cfertility MOT\u201d: a blood test that measures anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) levels, giving an idea about a woman\u2019s ovarian reserve. The expensive test has been called \u201ca waste of time and money\u201d by the NHS because it cannot assess the quality of your eggs \u2013 the most important factor that, again, we don\u2019t really know about until we start trying for a baby. More literature is drawing attention to the systemic problems with the wellness industry and people are becoming quicker to call out acts of insensitive and immoral daylight robbery. But until any kind of paradigm-shift happens in women\u2019s health, private companies will continue to view our fears surrounding our bodies \u2013 including fertility \u2013 as capital to be exploited. \u2022 Eleanor Morgan is author of Hormonal: A Conversation About Women\u2019s Bodies, Mental Health and Why We Need to Be Heard, and is training to be a psychologist",

      "bodyText": "If anyone missed the depth of this national crisis, just look at the latest dire economic figures: we\u2019re plunging towards a recession of our own making, with Britain\u2019s first quarterly contraction in seven years. Meanwhile the two would-be prime ministers daily demonstrate their unfitness for office with ever wilder promises and preposterous claims. More fox hunting, more sugar? Both are now fatally boxed into a no-deal future with no escape hatch, hostages to Nigel Farage and the European Research Group of hardline Tory MPs. Each bids to persuade the Conservative membership that only they can bar Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s way to Downing Street. Jeremy Hunt claimed on Wednesday to be \u201cthe best person\u201d to stop \u201cthis clear and present danger\u201d, with Boris Johnson counter-boasting, as his lead narrows. But does the idea of Corbyn as a bogeyman to petrify all right-thinking citizens fly? Weakness, not red peril, is Labour\u2019s electoral problem. Nothing in Labour\u2019s last or next manifesto could be a fraction as radical as the earthquake the Brexiters have caused to Britain\u2019s economy, its union, its internal harmony or its standing in the world. The nearest to revolutionary terror is Labour\u2019s plan to raise the top level of tax for the richest 5% back to where it was in 2010. Popular plans to take back rail and the utilities to public ownership is hardly Venezuelan, since they leak as much money to shareholders as the water companies\u2019 three billion litres leaked daily from broken pipes. This week\u2019s Times report of malevolent leaks from top civil servants warning of Corbyn\u2019s physical and intellectual unfitness for office brought out Lord Kerslake, former head of the civil service, to tell the Today programme on Thursday that the culprits should be found and ejected. The wise and calming peer made exactly this point: the real and present danger facing the civil service and all of us is the imminent prospect of a no-deal EU crash-out. The danger of annihilation for Labour lies not in hidden civil service enemies but its own disastrous failure to respond to the Tory-created crisis, an opposition in name only. YouGov puts Labour at just 18%, its joint lowest-ever ranking. Incredibly, the Tories lead with 24%, Brexit party on 21%, Lib Dems on 20%, Greens at 9%, SNP 4%, Plaid 1%.

      "body": "<p>My nephew, Michael, died on 22 May 2019. He was 15 years old.</p> <p>He loved his family, tractors, lorries, tanks, spaceships and video games (mostly about tractors, lorries, tanks and spaceships), and confronted every challenge in his short, difficult life with a resolute will that earned him much love and respect. Online in his favourite game, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/16/elite-dangerous-classic-space-game-fans\">Elite Dangerous</a> by Frontier Developments, he was known as CMDR Michael Holyland.</p> <p>In Michael\u2019s last week of life, thanks to the Elite Dangerous player community, a whole network of new friends sprang up in our darkest hour and made things more bearable with a magnificent display of empathy, kindness and creativity.

It is an online spaceship simulator set in a 1:1 scale approximation of the Milky Way galaxy, giving each player the freedom to explore its vast, austere beauty. It could be quite tranquil and very time consuming. Michael revelled in it. For us, it was a lifeline: I spent time with Michael in the game world as he tried to escape the suffering of the real one.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t long before I was contacted by Paige Harvey, a community manager at Frontier Developments. Paige had seen my tweet and wanted to do something to lift Michael\u2019s spirits. She told me that she was scouring the office for \u201cgoodies to send\u201d. At this point, I hadn\u2019t made the gravity of Michael\u2019s circumstances clear on Twitter; Michael was pretty internet savvy and we decided to keep his terminal state from him to spare him avoidable emotional distress. Upon learning that Michael had only a few days to live, Paige moved things up a gear.</p> <p>The next day, she and her colleague Sally Morgan-Moore visited Michael on the Addenbrooke\u2019s oncology ward and, as promised, brought a bag of swag including a poster signed by many members of the Elite Dangerous team. They were absolutely brilliant with Michael, who could be quite abrupt and challenging at times. I had not seen him this elated for some time. Michael\u2019s Dad, Karl, got the gifts framed and mounted on his wall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"413eeca8988eaa98299abd019c7faf53403797f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/413eeca8988eaa98299abd019c7faf53403797f2/0_175_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sally Morgan-Moore and Paige Harvey from Frontier Developments, left, visit Michael and family in Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital.

Pictures reproduced with permission.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mathew James Westhorpe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The outpouring of empathy and support continued from all quarters. Scores of fellow Elite Dangerous players sent their best wishes; authors Drew Wagar, Kate Russell and their publisher Dan Grubb of Fantastic Books Publishing all got in touch; <a href=\"https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/David_Braben\">David Braben, creator</a> of the Elite series , tweeted his best wishes.</p> <p>Facebook groups, Twitter and a post on the <a href=\"https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/michaels-journey-through-the-stars.512013/\">Elite forum</a> (carefully tended by moderator TJ, to whom I owe many thanks for his diligence and diplomacy) were filled with other Elite players (CMDRs) clamouring to take Michael on excursions to the far side of the galaxy, to crew up and go to war, or to run rescue missions. CMDR Picard discovered a new Earth-like world, named it Michael\u2019s Rest and offered to take Michael there.</p> <p>Michael loved the attention. It was difficult to decide how much to share with him; his autism and experience of the last five years meant that his social tolerances were poor, so we tried to discourage too much contact with strangers on the internet. But the overwhelming kindness of this video game community was such a powerful, positive thing that it would have been a shame to keep Michael from it.</p> <p>The whole experience had Michael brimming with new found energy. He would spend hours either playing Elite or tinkering with ship designs in the companion site <a href=\"https://coriolis.io/\">Coriolis.io</a>. His buoyant mood helped him walk from the oncology ward down to the food concourse, a feat he hadn\u2019t managed for weeks.</p> <p>Michael had requested a visit to Frontier Studios on the other side of Cambridge, but his doctor advised against leaving hospital. Michael soon deteriorated again, his facial swelling becoming so severe that it was difficult for him to open his eyes at all. Frustratingly, his one available form of escapism was now under threat. While nurses and Michael\u2019s mum, Laura, did what they could to reduce his swollen eye tissue, Michael refused to give up and still managed to peer at the screen and tinker with his ship loadouts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"918a2d0f3a4fe220d2470390bebe2a987a2deb4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/918a2d0f3a4fe220d2470390bebe2a987a2deb4f/0_0_720_960/375.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cBravery, courage, unbowed in the face of overwhelming odds\u201d ...

Michael Holyland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mathew James Westhorpe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Saturday morning, three days after Paige and Sally\u2019s visit, Frontier\u2019s Zac Antonaci (one of the most vocal and entertaining viewers of Michael\u2019s Twitch streams) made a ludicrously ambitious suggestion: what if we could organise enough people to create a short story, set in the world of Elite, where Michael was the hero, something he could listen to and enjoy when he had difficulties with his vision?</p> <p>At first I declined Zac\u2019s offer, feeling that it would take more time than Michael had. But then Michael recovered enough to start making a hilariously overblown list of requests for his Elite account. He was now pushing for a Tony Stark-style tower on a moon orbiting the planet named for him.</p> <p>That Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.drewwagar.com/elite-dangerous-saga/michaels-story/\">Drew Wagar</a> wrote a brilliant 7,000-word script in a single day. By Monday, Zac had conscripted three professional voice actors to record the story: Richard Reed, Jay Britton and Amelia Tyler (who drove six hours in a day to get to the studio and back). On Tuesday, audio engineer Joe Hogan put it all together and by that evening, Zac and Paige were back at the hospital playing Michael an exceptional piece of <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/drewwa/michaels-story-an-elite-dangerous-audiobook\">bespoke Elite audio fiction</a>, preceded by a personal message from David Braben.</p> <p>Listening to it with Michael was an epic, bittersweet experience. There were nods to how he had faced his medical challenges, and the more obvious references made him beam with pride and happiness.</p> <p>The next day was Wednesday, the day Michael died.</p> <p>We were playing Elite together online. Michael and I had been preparing to broadcast an expedition to obtain special \u201cGuardian\u201d modules for my ships and were joined by a couple of new friends, CMDR UselessED and CMDR Eid LeWeise. Suddenly, Michael coughed and started to become distressed on comms. I cut the stream, made my apologies and headed for hospital.</p> <p>By the time I got there, he had been sedated and wasn\u2019t expected to recover consciousness. His mum, dad and I took turns to sit with him and hold his hand. While I was with him, I played his Elite audio story again. Some of Drew\u2019s words hit much harder the second time: \u201cbravery, courage, unbowed in the face of overwhelming odds\u201d.</p> <p>He took his last breath peacefully a few hours later. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fd7daee35b5e75cd1db7b5dd5005c59a9db44f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fd7daee35b5e75cd1db7b5dd5005c59a9db44f0/0_0_2048_1116/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The kindness of a video game community filled Michael\u2019s last week of life with unexpected happiness.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"545\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The kindness of a video game community filled Michael\u2019s last week of life with unexpected happiness.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mathew James Westhorpe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Michael\u2019s end was unjust and tragic, but the heroic kindness of a video game community filled his last week of life with unexpected happiness.

In an act of despondence, I sent a tweet, which started something bittersweet and amazing. Elite Dangerous had become a vital component of Michael\u2019s care package. It is an online spaceship simulator set in a 1:1 scale approximation of the Milky Way galaxy, giving each player the freedom to explore its vast, austere beauty. It could be quite tranquil and very time consuming. Michael revelled in it. For us, it was a lifeline: I spent time with Michael in the game world as he tried to escape the suffering of the real one. It wasn\u2019t long before I was contacted by Paige Harvey, a community manager at Frontier Developments. Paige had seen my tweet and wanted to do something to lift Michael\u2019s spirits. She told me that she was scouring the office for \u201cgoodies to send\u201d. At this point, I hadn\u2019t made the gravity of Michael\u2019s circumstances clear on Twitter; Michael was pretty internet savvy and we decided to keep his terminal state from him to spare him avoidable emotional distress. Upon learning that Michael had only a few days to live, Paige moved things up a gear. The next day, she and her colleague Sally Morgan-Moore visited Michael on the Addenbrooke\u2019s oncology ward and, as promised, brought a bag of swag including a poster signed by many members of the Elite Dangerous team. They were absolutely brilliant with Michael, who could be quite abrupt and challenging at times. I had not seen him this elated for some time. Michael\u2019s Dad, Karl, got the gifts framed and mounted on his wall. The outpouring of empathy and support continued from all quarters. Scores of fellow Elite Dangerous players sent their best wishes; authors Drew Wagar, Kate Russell and their publisher Dan Grubb of Fantastic Books Publishing all got in touch; David Braben, creator of the Elite series , tweeted his best wishes. Facebook groups, Twitter and a post on the Elite forum (carefully tended by moderator TJ, to whom I owe many thanks for his diligence and diplomacy) were filled with other Elite players (CMDRs) clamouring to take Michael on excursions to the far side of the galaxy, to crew up and go to war, or to run rescue missions. CMDR Picard discovered a new Earth-like world, named it Michael\u2019s Rest and offered to take Michael there. Michael loved the attention. It was difficult to decide how much to share with him; his autism and experience of the last five years meant that his social tolerances were poor, so we tried to discourage too much contact with strangers on the internet. But the overwhelming kindness of this video game community was such a powerful, positive thing that it would have been a shame to keep Michael from it. The whole experience had Michael brimming with new found energy. He would spend hours either playing Elite or tinkering with ship designs in the companion site Coriolis.io. His buoyant mood helped him walk from the oncology ward down to the food concourse, a feat he hadn\u2019t managed for weeks. Michael had requested a visit to Frontier Studios on the other side of Cambridge, but his doctor advised against leaving hospital. Michael soon deteriorated again, his facial swelling becoming so severe that it was difficult for him to open his eyes at all. Frustratingly, his one available form of escapism was now under threat. While nurses and Michael\u2019s mum, Laura, did what they could to reduce his swollen eye tissue, Michael refused to give up and still managed to peer at the screen and tinker with his ship loadouts. On Saturday morning, three days after Paige and Sally\u2019s visit, Frontier\u2019s Zac Antonaci (one of the most vocal and entertaining viewers of Michael\u2019s Twitch streams) made a ludicrously ambitious suggestion: what if we could organise enough people to create a short story, set in the world of Elite, where Michael was the hero, something he could listen to and enjoy when he had difficulties with his vision? At first I declined Zac\u2019s offer, feeling that it would take more time than Michael had. But then Michael recovered enough to start making a hilariously overblown list of requests for his Elite account. He was now pushing for a Tony Stark-style tower on a moon orbiting the planet named for him. That Sunday, Drew Wagar wrote a brilliant 7,000-word script in a single day. By Monday, Zac had conscripted three professional voice actors to record the story: Richard Reed, Jay Britton and Amelia Tyler (who drove six hours in a day to get to the studio and back). On Tuesday, audio engineer Joe Hogan put it all together and by that evening, Zac and Paige were back at the hospital playing Michael an exceptional piece of bespoke Elite audio fiction, preceded by a personal message from David Braben. Listening to it with Michael was an epic, bittersweet experience. There were nods to how he had faced his medical challenges, and the more obvious references made him beam with pride and happiness. The next day was Wednesday, the day Michael died. We were playing Elite together online. Michael and I had been preparing to broadcast an expedition to obtain special \u201cGuardian\u201d modules for my ships and were joined by a couple of new friends, CMDR UselessED and CMDR Eid LeWeise. Suddenly, Michael coughed and started to become distressed on comms. I cut the stream, made my apologies and headed for hospital. By the time I got there, he had been sedated and wasn\u2019t expected to recover consciousness. His mum, dad and I took turns to sit with him and hold his hand. While I was with him, I played his Elite audio story again. Some of Drew\u2019s words hit much harder the second time: \u201cbravery, courage, unbowed in the face of overwhelming odds\u201d. He took his last breath peacefully a few hours later. Michael\u2019s end was unjust and tragic, but the heroic kindness of a video game community filled his last week of life with unexpected happiness. On behalf of Michael and his family, I want to offer my eternal gratitude to everyone who contributed, from the players who stood ready to meet Michael online or took the time to send him an \u201co7\u201d salute, to the Frontier staff and associates who gave so much of their time, compassion and creative energy. You make the world \u2013 and the internet \u2013 a better place. \u2022 This article was republished with permission from Westhorpe.net.

      "body": "<p>In 1987, Fey von Hassell, younger daughter of the former German ambassador to Rome, published her memoirs. <em>A Mother\u2019s War</em> told the story of the vendetta carried out by Hitler against the families of the men implicated in the July 1944 coup plot \u2013 of which her father Ulrich von Hassell was one \u2013 and the survival, against all the odds, of herself and her small children. Catherine Bailey, author of two successful family biographies, has retold Fey\u2019s story, filling in gaps and setting it in a wider context. It is indeed an extraordinary tale.</p> <p>Ulrich von Hassell, an aristocrat and diplomat of the old school, was posted to Rome in 1932. From the first opposed to the Nazis, his opposition grew stronger as Europe moved towards war. Watched by the all too efficient German and Italian fascist spy networks, he was dismissed in December 1937 and returned to Germany to join the resistance. Von Hassell was one of the first men to be arrested after the failed coup, brought before the infamous People\u2019s Court and slowly strangled, the process filmed for Hitler to watch later. Then the Nazis moved on to the plotters\u2019 families, the \u201cbrood of vipers\u201d, under a directive known as <em>Sippenhaft</em>, which decreed that a traitor\u2019s family was also guilty.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bailey deftly sets her narrative against the background of the unfolding mayhem of the closing weeks of the war</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fey was then 24, married to an Italian called Detalmo Pirzio-Biroli and living on his family estate, Brazza, a 12th-century castle overlooking the plains of Venice, where local families made lace, kept silkworms and farmed. With her were her two sons, four-year-old Corrado and two-year-old Roberto. German soldiers were billeted in the castle, but Fey, as a German speaker, was treated civilly, though she lived in constant fear of being taken for a collaborator by the Italian resistance. As the allies, having landed in Salerno, were fighting their way up Italy, Pirzio-Biroli joined the partisans and disappeared. Bailey paints a vivid picture of the violence and chaos of Italy\u2019s civil war, with the partisans in the mountains, the fascists and the German occupiers carrying out reprisals, and Italian former soldiers and escaped allied prisoners of war trying to evade capture.</p> <p>On 27 September 1944, the Nazis came for Fey. In Innsbruck, her first place of detention, Corrado and Roberto were taken from her. She listened to their screams as they were bundled away. Instead of killing her, the Nazis made her one of their hostages, held with a group of important people by Himmler against possible future barter with the allies. Moved from prison to prison, camp to camp, for a while in a former hotel in which she and her companions played bridge and went for walks, later in special barracks attached to the camps of Stutthof, Buchenwald and Dachau, she caught typhoid and nearly died.

      "bodyText": "In 1987, Fey von Hassell, younger daughter of the former German ambassador to Rome, published her memoirs. A Mother\u2019s War told the story of the vendetta carried out by Hitler against the families of the men implicated in the July 1944 coup plot \u2013 of which her father Ulrich von Hassell was one \u2013 and the survival, against all the odds, of herself and her small children. Catherine Bailey, author of two successful family biographies, has retold Fey\u2019s story, filling in gaps and setting it in a wider context. It is indeed an extraordinary tale. Ulrich von Hassell, an aristocrat and diplomat of the old school, was posted to Rome in 1932. From the first opposed to the Nazis, his opposition grew stronger as Europe moved towards war. Watched by the all too efficient German and Italian fascist spy networks, he was dismissed in December 1937 and returned to Germany to join the resistance. Von Hassell was one of the first men to be arrested after the failed coup, brought before the infamous People\u2019s Court and slowly strangled, the process filmed for Hitler to watch later. Then the Nazis moved on to the plotters\u2019 families, the \u201cbrood of vipers\u201d, under a directive known as Sippenhaft, which decreed that a traitor\u2019s family was also guilty. Fey was then 24, married to an Italian called Detalmo Pirzio-Biroli and living on his family estate, Brazza, a 12th-century castle overlooking the plains of Venice, where local families made lace, kept silkworms and farmed. With her were her two sons, four-year-old Corrado and two-year-old Roberto. German soldiers were billeted in the castle, but Fey, as a German speaker, was treated civilly, though she lived in constant fear of being taken for a collaborator by the Italian resistance. As the allies, having landed in Salerno, were fighting their way up Italy, Pirzio-Biroli joined the partisans and disappeared. Bailey paints a vivid picture of the violence and chaos of Italy\u2019s civil war, with the partisans in the mountains, the fascists and the German occupiers carrying out reprisals, and Italian former soldiers and escaped allied prisoners of war trying to evade capture. On 27 September 1944, the Nazis came for Fey. In Innsbruck, her first place of detention, Corrado and Roberto were taken from her. She listened to their screams as they were bundled away. Instead of killing her, the Nazis made her one of their hostages, held with a group of important people by Himmler against possible future barter with the allies. Moved from prison to prison, camp to camp, for a while in a former hotel in which she and her companions played bridge and went for walks, later in special barracks attached to the camps of Stutthof, Buchenwald and Dachau, she caught typhoid and nearly died. With her were members of the other plotters\u2019 families \u2013 the von Stauffenbergs, the Goerdelers, the Hofackers. Fey was one of four women whose children had been taken from them. The youngest was a baby of nine months. Most of the hostages, at one time or another, became ill with scarlet fever, typhoid or bacillary dysentery. Towards the end, they were brought together with other eminent hostages, including the former French prime minister, Leon Blum, the pastor Martin Niem\u00f6ller and von Schuschnigg, the chancellor of Austria.

      "body": "<p>How does one cope with being reared by radical parents? It\u2019s a theme that has absorbed many dramatists including, most recently, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/04/apologia-review-stockard-channing-trafalgar-studios-london\">Alexi Kaye Campbell in Apologia</a>. But, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/01/jack-thorne-and-john-tiffany-interview-end-of-history\">Jack Thorne\u2019s new play</a> is avowedly personal, always interesting and beautifully staged by John Tiffany, it left me wishing for a deeper connection between the family foreground and the historical background.</p> <p>Thorne arouses such expectations in two ways: by taking the title of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/francis-fukuyama\">Francis Fukuyama</a>\u2019s book about the triumph of liberal democracies, and by using the structure of a famous Royal Court play, Arnold Wesker\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/jun/08/chicken-soup-with-barley-review\">Chicken Soup With Barley</a>, which followed the fortunes of an East End family over a 20-year period. In Thorne\u2019s case, we see the impact of two Newbury-based leftwing parents, Sal and David, on their offspring in three specific years: 1997, 2007 and 2017. Thorne, as he has shown in the past, writes well about the dynamics of family life. What I longed to see was how this combative, switched-on group reacted to public events.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"958e2da4acc3c03dc0504423df08eab4642f3555\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/958e2da4acc3c03dc0504423df08eab4642f3555/0_0_2966_4432/669.jpg\" alt=\"Political earnestness ... Lesley Sharp as Sal in The End of History.\" width=\"669\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Political earnestness ... Lesley Sharp as Sal in The End of History.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You get a hint of this in the first scene, set in October 1997, when Sal rushes to switch off the radio the second she hears the voice of Tony Blair. We quickly learn that she is a socialist whose passionate views are shared by her husband, David: they\u2019ve even named their three children, Carl, Polly and Tom, after would-be revolutionaries. But the focus is on how the family will react to Carl\u2019s introduction of his posh student girlfriend, Harriet. The result says a lot about the embarrassment of inquisitive intellectuals when confronted by wealth and privilege but, the reference to Blair aside, I felt the scene lacked historical particularity.</p> <p>The same can be said of the succeeding episodes. In 2007 we get a fascinating glimpse of how Sal and David, in disposing of their modest inheritance, judge their children. But it seems surprising that there is only the briefest allusion to Gordon Brown\u2019s rise at the expense of Tony Blair. And, although the final scene deals with a death in the family and charts the changed fortunes of the three children, Brexit is referred to obliquely. No dramatist is obliged to deal with the public world: it just seems odd that, in stark contrast to Wesker\u2019s play, the lives of this particular group are only marginally affected by politics.</p> <p>Tiffany, however, stages the play excellently, using Steven Hoggett\u2019s carefully choreographed movement to capture the ongoing domestic life between scenes. The performances, too, are very good. Lesley Sharp captures Sal\u2019s mix of political earnestness and private generosity. David Morrissey suggests shrewdly that his character, though he loves his children, rates them according to their keenness of mind.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/01/jack-thorne-and-john-tiffany-interview-end-of-history\">Jack Thorne and John Tiffany: 'You're the warrior, I'm the worrier!'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both make highly plausible, if somewhat demanding, parents and there is fine work from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/24/kate-o-flynn-taste-of-honey\">Kate O\u2019Flynn</a> as the clever, careerist Polly, Laurie Davidson as the renegade Tom, Sam Swainsbury as the underachieving Carl and Zoe Boyle as the outsider, Harriet. Thorne has written an alluring family saga.

      "bodyText": "How does one cope with being reared by radical parents? It\u2019s a theme that has absorbed many dramatists including, most recently, Alexi Kaye Campbell in Apologia. But, while Jack Thorne\u2019s new play is avowedly personal, always interesting and beautifully staged by John Tiffany, it left me wishing for a deeper connection between the family foreground and the historical background. Thorne arouses such expectations in two ways: by taking the title of Francis Fukuyama\u2019s book about the triumph of liberal democracies, and by using the structure of a famous Royal Court play, Arnold Wesker\u2019s Chicken Soup With Barley, which followed the fortunes of an East End family over a 20-year period. In Thorne\u2019s case, we see the impact of two Newbury-based leftwing parents, Sal and David, on their offspring in three specific years: 1997, 2007 and 2017. Thorne, as he has shown in the past, writes well about the dynamics of family life. What I longed to see was how this combative, switched-on group reacted to public events. You get a hint of this in the first scene, set in October 1997, when Sal rushes to switch off the radio the second she hears the voice of Tony Blair. We quickly learn that she is a socialist whose passionate views are shared by her husband, David: they\u2019ve even named their three children, Carl, Polly and Tom, after would-be revolutionaries. But the focus is on how the family will react to Carl\u2019s introduction of his posh student girlfriend, Harriet. The result says a lot about the embarrassment of inquisitive intellectuals when confronted by wealth and privilege but, the reference to Blair aside, I felt the scene lacked historical particularity. The same can be said of the succeeding episodes. In 2007 we get a fascinating glimpse of how Sal and David, in disposing of their modest inheritance, judge their children. But it seems surprising that there is only the briefest allusion to Gordon Brown\u2019s rise at the expense of Tony Blair. And, although the final scene deals with a death in the family and charts the changed fortunes of the three children, Brexit is referred to obliquely. No dramatist is obliged to deal with the public world: it just seems odd that, in stark contrast to Wesker\u2019s play, the lives of this particular group are only marginally affected by politics. Tiffany, however, stages the play excellently, using Steven Hoggett\u2019s carefully choreographed movement to capture the ongoing domestic life between scenes. The performances, too, are very good. Lesley Sharp captures Sal\u2019s mix of political earnestness and private generosity. David Morrissey suggests shrewdly that his character, though he loves his children, rates them according to their keenness of mind. Both make highly plausible, if somewhat demanding, parents and there is fine work from Kate O\u2019Flynn as the clever, careerist Polly, Laurie Davidson as the renegade Tom, Sam Swainsbury as the underachieving Carl and Zoe Boyle as the outsider, Harriet. Thorne has written an alluring family saga. I simply wish his play had explored more fully the idea that, in the New Labour era and its aftermath, we have witnessed the slow death of radical England. At the Royal Court, London, until 10 August.",

      "bodyText": "Water companies have been rapped on the knuckles over plans to charge customers \u201csignificantly\u201d more to cover their day-to-day costs from next year. The water regulator said it had substantial concerns over the business plans of Thames Water, Anglian Water, SES Water and Yorkshire Water for the early 2020s. Ofwat delivered the unexpected rebuke in a letter urging the suppliers to reconsider the cost hikes and to act \u201cin the best interests of customers\u201d. In total the four companies supply water to over 23 million customers. The regulator said it expects suppliers to deliver a \u201cstep-change in efficiency\u201d by 2025 so they can improve their service and protect the environment while keeping bills low. Instead, the companies are hiking the estimated cost of supplying water to their customers in an effort to spend \u201csignificantly more money than they currently spend\u201d on business-as-usual services. The regulator is reviewing the business plans for 2020-25 to determine how much the companies are allowed to claim back from their customers through their bills. Water bills in England and Wales are expected to average \u00a3415 this year, up by 2% from last year, according to Water UK. The industry group said that in real terms water bills have been falling in recent years, once inflation is taken into account. David Black, a senior director at Ofwat, said the regulator would scrutinise each and every plan in detail to make sure they were robust enough to deliver \u201ca high-quality, affordable and resilient service to customers in the next five years and beyond\u201d. \u201cWe are disappointed that revised proposals from Anglian Water, SES Water, Thames Water, and Yorkshire Water have not yet risen to the challenge we have set them,\u201d he said. \u201cFor this reason, we have taken the step of writing to these four companies now to allow them additional time to reconsider and ensure they are in the best interests of customers.\u201d The surprise shaming comes just weeks before Ofwat is scheduled to deliver an official verdict on the plans, and has \u201craised eyebrows\u201d within the industry, according to one senior water company source. The water companies were not immediately available to comment. Ofwat\u2019s crackdown on costs comes amid growing political scrutiny of the water sector\u2019s track record, and threats from the Labour party to renationalise the monopoly suppliers. This year Thames Water ousted its chief executive, Steve Robertson, after a series of run-ins with the regulator over customer service, leaky pipes and investor returns. Ofwat rebuffed Thames Water\u2019s plans to spend \u00a311.7bn in the first half of the next decade, saying the supplier should be able to deliver the same level of service for 20% less. In response Thames is axing 650 roles from the company to \u201cbe as efficient and productive as possible\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Nearly half of all global pay is scooped up by only 10% of workers, according to the International Labour Organization, while the lowest-paid 50% receive only 6.4%. The lowest-paid 20% \u2013 about 650 million workers \u2013 get less than 1% of total pay, a figure that has barely moved in 13 years, ILO analysis found. It used labour income figures from 189 countries between 2004 and 2017, the latest available data. A worker in the top 10% receives $7,445 a month (\u00a35,866), while a worker in the bottom 10% gets only $22. The average pay of the bottom half of the world\u2019s workers is $198 a month. Roger Gomis, an economist in the ILO statistics department, said: \u201cThe majority of the global workforce endures strikingly low pay and for many having a job does not mean having enough to live on. \u201cThe poorest 10% would need to work more than three centuries to earn the same as the richest 10% do in one year.\u201d The share of global pay received by the top 10% has actually fallen since 2004, from 55.5% to 48.9%. But within some countries, pay inequality is increasing, in particular in the UK. In the UK, much of the bottom 50% have suffered the largest losses of income between 2004 and 2017, while the increases for the top earners are much more pronounced than in the US or Germany, the report said. Inequality between countries has fallen, as growing prosperity in China and India has brought them closer to higher-income countries. However, this has not trickled down to the poorest in either country. The report said: \u201cEven if global pay inequality levels are very high, they have experienced a substantial reduction between 2004 and 2017. However, excluding India and China, the results point to a much slower reduction in labour income inequality. Interestingly, this does not indicate that in India or China inequality has decreased, indeed neither country registered a decline in inequality in the 2004-2017 span.\u201d Poorer countries tend to have much higher levels of pay inequality than richer nations. In sub-Saharan Africa, the bottom 50% of workers receive only 3.3% of total pay, compared with the European Union, where the same group receives 22.9% of the total income paid to workers. The countries with the most pay inequality are DR Congo, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia, Niger and Uganda, according to the report. The ILO said that in several high-income countries, including the UK, US and Germany, there were substantial losses in earnings for the middle and lower-middle class over the 13-year period, and large gains for the top. The share of pay going to the middle class \u2013 the middle 60% of workers \u2013 declined during this period, from 44.8% to 43%. At the same time the share paid to the top 20% of earners increased, from 51.3% to 53.5%. Countries where the top earners\u2019 share of national pay rose by at least one percentage point include Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Pakistan, the UK and the US. \u201cThe data show that in relative terms, increases in the top labour incomes are associated with losses for everyone else, with both middle-class and lower-income workers seeing their share of income decline,\u201d said Steven Kapsos, head of data production and analysis at the ILO. \u201cHowever, when the labour income shares of the middle- or lower-income workers increase, the gains tend to be widespread, favouring everyone except the top earners.\u201d Rising inequality in Britain means it could join the US in becoming one of the most unequal nations on earth, according to the Nobel-prize winning economist, Sir Angus Deaton.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya muslims in Myanmar are living in concentration camps and urban ghettos like those in Nazi-occupied Europe, a UN investigator has said. Christopher Sidoti, a member of the UN fact-finding mission into crimes against the Rohingya that last year accused Myanmar\u2019s military of genocide, warned the crisis is far from over for the persecuted minority. Sidoti said 128,000 people forced from their homes by violence are now in camps in central Rakhine and urban ghettos, living in conditions that he likened to those endured by Jewish people under the Nazis. Rohingya people remaining in Myanmar live in villages where their movements are severely curtailed and their rights to get married and have children are strictly controlled, he said. \u201cThere are concentration camps \u2013 let\u2019s call it what it is \u2013 with 128,000 internally displaced people in central Rakhine, outside Sittwe,\u201d said Sidoti. \u201cIn Sittwe, there are three areas where Rohingya people live and they have become urban ghettos like those Jews lived in under Nazi-occupied Europe.\u201d Sidoti, a keynote speaker at a conference on the Rohingya crisis at University College London on Thursday, added: \u201cThe mass expulsions and shootings may have stopped, the military may have achieved their purpose \u2013 the makeup of the Rakhine state has changed \u2013 but the crisis is not over.\u201d There are only an estimated 400,000 to 500,000 Rohingya left in Myanmar, he said, compared with 2 or 3 million in 2012. \u201cWe said a year ago there were circumstances to give rise to an inference of genocidal intent,\u201d Sidoti said. \u201cWhat has happened in the past two years has strengthened the genocidal intent. Villagers are still isolated, and their movement restricted; fishermen can\u2019t go to fish and kids can\u2019t go to school. They need written permission from the authorities to travel any distances, and permission to marry and have children. You might need six different written approvals, from six different authorities, to go to hospital. The whole thing has been calculated to watch them fade away.\u201d Sidoti said he expected the panel\u2019s new report, which will be published in the next few months, to say that the inference of genocide has \u201cstrengthened\u201d. His comments came as the UN warned that civilians in Rakhine and Chin states may be suffering fresh war crimes and human rights violations as fighting between military and rebel groups intensified. Speaking to the UN human rights council (UNHRC), Yanghee Lee, the UN special rapporteur on Myanmar, detailed accounts of abduction and torture of civilians by both the Myanmar army and the rebel insurgent group the Arakan Army, which is fighting for greater autonomy in the region. \u201cThe conflict with the Arakan Army in northern Rakhine state and parts of southern Chin state has continued over the past few months and the impact on civilians is devastating,\u201d Lee told the UNHRC on Tuesday. \u201cMany acts of the Tatmadaw [Myanmar armed forces] and the Arakan Army violate international humanitarian law and may amount to war crimes, as well as violating human rights.\u201d Speaking to the Guardian after her address to the council, Lee said the situation was worsening by the day and that the UN security council needed to draw up a resolution swiftly condemning the actions of the Myanmar military. It was in Rakhine state that the Myanmar military carried out its violent clampdown on the Muslim Rohingya community in August 2017, razing villages, killing thousands and sending almost 800,000 Rohingya over the border to Bangladesh in attacks that the UN has since described as ethnic cleansing and having \u201cgenocidal intent\u201d. The fresh wave of violence in the state is now between security forces and the rebel army of ethnic Rakhine Buddhist fighters, which has been escalating since January, resulting in more than 35,000 people fleeing their homes. With media and humanitarian organisations barred from entering the conflict areas, accurate information is hard to verify, though it is thought that the Tatmadaw have now posted about 35,000 troops in the area, with more arriving in recent days. Lee recounted numerous incidents of human rights violations, including reports of the Myanmar military opening fire from a helicopter on civilians collecting bamboo, forced labour, looting of houses and attacks on monasteries suspected of housing those fleeing violence. There have also been multiple deaths of civilians taken into custody by the Tatmadaw, most recently Zaw Win Hlaing, who was detained in mid-June and died from injuries on Monday, which his mother told local media had been caused by him being beaten by rocks. The Arakan Army was also culpable for abuses, added Lee, including the abduction of 12 construction workers in the village of Paletwa and another 52 villagers living near the Bangladesh border. In an unprecedented move, in June the Myanmar military ordered a telecommunications blackout across eight townships in Rakhine state and one in neighbouring Chin state, cutting access to phones and internet, which is still in place. Lee and other human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch and Fortify Rights said the blackout was being used to cover up the abuses being carried out in the region. It is thought the internet blackout is also being used by the Myanmar military to prevent financial transactions going through to the Arakan Army. Lee, who has been banned from visiting Myanmar by the government, repeated her previous call for Myanmar to be referred to the international criminal court (ICC) for war crimes. Myanmar is not a signatory to the Rome statute and is not under the jurisdiction of the ICC, but the court ruled last year that it could prosecute Myanmar for alleged crimes against humanity against the Rohingya people. Lee said: \u201cSo long as impunity for alleged atrocity crimes prevails, we will continue to bear witness to flagrant violations of rights perpetrated against ethnic minority populations in the name of counterinsurgency, entrenching grievances and prolonging insecurity and instability.\u201d On Thursday, Fatou Bensouda, the international criminal court prosecutor, filed a request to open a formal investigation of crimes against humanity allegedly committed against the Rohingya. Bensouda said she wants to investigate crimes of deportation, inhumane acts and persecution allegedly committed as the Rohingya fled Myanmar \u2013 which is not a member of the global court \u2013 into Bangladesh, which is an ICC member.",

Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix is an extraordinarily talented second striker, aged 19, already talked about as a future Ballon d\u2019Or winner, who scored 20 goals and provided 11 assists for Benfica last season, compared with Griezmann\u2019s 21 goals and 10 assists. But he also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/03/atletico-madrid-sign-benfica-teenager-joao-felix-for-fee-of-126m\" title=\"\">cost Atl\u00e9tico Madrid \u20ac126m</a>. That is more even than they will get for Griezmann, whose buyout clause dropped to \u20ac120m on 1 July, \u20ac24m of which is payable to Real Sociedad. It makes F\u00e9lix the most expensive player Atl\u00e9tico ever signed \u2013 and by \u20ac55m.</p> <p>That the previous record holder was Thomas Lemar this time last summer, Atl\u00e9tico paying \u20ac70m in return for a 70% share, speaks of market inflation. It speaks also of a shift at the club that made a philosophy of necessity and constructed an identity around humility. And that asks questions about F\u00e9lix\u2019s fit, his role within a team seemingly obliged to undergo significant change. But can they? Can their manager? And if so, can the young Portuguese lead it?</p> <p>Tapping into Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s historic identity, built around suffering over the previous decade and beyond, and articulated by the manager who was pulling them from the depression, Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s philosophy came to be called <em>Cholismo</em>, taking its title from Diego Simeone\u2019s <em>\u201cEl Cholo\u201d </em>nickname and finding an echo on the pitch as well as off it. In short, they were fighters, born to suffer, to battle against the odds. And that, it seemed, necessarily meant playing a particular way. It is a way that has proven persistent, hard to let go of; a way with which they felt comfortable, that felt right.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Atl\u00e9tico is synonymous with workers: brickies, taxi drivers, churros sellers</p> <footer> <cite>Germ\u00e1n Burgos</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The former midfielder Jos\u00e9 Movilla, a player in the early noughties, was a bin-man, which fit somehow, while the former goalkeeper Germ\u00e1n Burgos, Simeone\u2019s assistant now, is an AC/DC fan who once claimed: \u201cI couldn\u2019t play at [Real] Madrid because of how I look. They\u2019d make me cut my hair. Atl\u00e9tico is synonymous with workers: brickies, taxi drivers, churros sellers.\u201d When Atl\u00e9tico won an impossible league in 2014, Tiago likened them to \u201cRobin Hood\u201d. Simeone had sarcastically noted that the difference in budget between them and Spain\u2019s big two was \u201conly \u20ac400m\u201d. And upon the final whistle on the day they won the title, their eleven players out on the Camp Nou cost less than \u20ac40m. Cesc F\u00e0bregas alone cost more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/23/tiago-fight-real-madrid-atletico-champions-league-final\">\u2018Real are made to win, we are made to fight,\u2019 says Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s Tiago</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the celebrations, Simeone told a huge crowd: \u201cThis is not just a league. What this triumph transmits is much more important than that: if you believe and if you work, you can do it.\u201d At the end of that season, their top scorer left. The previous summer, their top scorer had left too. This summer, their top scorer will also leave. But it is not the same now, the context has changed, and soon those certainties might be gone. Those restrictions, too; Atl\u00e9tico learned to live with limitations but now there are fewer of them, gigantic though their rivals remain. It may be that the revolution <em>El Cholo</em> started is ultimately what ends, or transforms, <em>cholismo</em>. Or perhaps not.</p> <p>Over the past five years Atl\u00e9tico have spent \u20ac569m. This summer the shift has been even more significant. With F\u00e9lix\u2019s signing Atl\u00e9tico have already taken their summer expenditure to \u20ac180m. It has been driven by departures: Griezmann, Lucas Hern\u00e1ndez, Diego God\u00edn, Juanfran Torres, Rodrigo Hern\u00e1ndez. That, once Griezmann is confirmed, will have brought in \u20ac260m. The old guard has gone and a new team must be built, perhaps with a new identity. And yet it is reasonable to wonder if those players who are left, and those who come to join them, will be able to do so \u2013 if, indeed, they will be allowed to.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04b62049a7cb1e20fb957664a939e97d86f42e0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04b62049a7cb1e20fb957664a939e97d86f42e0b/97_82_3136_2354/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix made his international debut for Portugal against Switzerland in the Nations League in June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"751\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix made his international debut for Portugal against Switzerland in the Nations League in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Susana Vera/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is one of the most difficult projects we have had since we arrived,\u201d Simeone admitted to Fox Sports. \u201cLots of players are leaving and it is a difficult moment of transition.

And in another interview he said that the best coaches were the ones with a \u201cdefined style\u201d. Those are telling remarks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/03/manchester-city-pay-rodri-release-clause-atletico-madrid-transfer-window-football\">Manchester City pay \u00a362.8m release clause for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s Rodri</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In terms of age F\u00e9lix could be that player but the former Portugal forward Sim\u00e3o admitted his doubts this week. \u201cHonestly I think Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix doesn\u2019t fit Atl\u00e9tico with Simeone\u2019s way of playing,\u201d he said. \u201cGriezmann made a brutal effort in defence. Often he didn\u2019t have the fuel left to attack. Simeone\u2019s mentality is defend, defend, defend, and then attack.\u201d</p> <p>That may be unfair, and Simeone\u2019s conservatism has become something of a lazy clich\u00e9 at times, but it is true that his style is defined. And it is true that this is something that raises questions about F\u00e9lix\u2019s fit, his ability either to adapt or to transcend, helping take them somewhere else. But, however much he leads, the leader is on the bench and Simeone is a man of consistency, not given to change: black suit, black shoes, black tie, his way of playing. Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s way, he likes to insist, sometimes rather pointedly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>There have been moments when his Atl\u00e9tico have appeared ready to evolve but they have tended to get back to what they know, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/dec/07/atletico-madrid-la-liga-sid-lowe\" title=\"\">the evolution left incomplete</a>, distrusted. One of the reasons Rodri is leaving for City is his desire to play another way. El Pa\u00eds suggested that Griezmann complained to teammates: \u201cWe hoof it long a lot.\u201d And a small group of players confided their frustration at the style to an opponent after one game last season. Strikers have found it hard to find their place.</p> <p>When Simeone re-signed Diego Costa, it felt symbolic, as if it signalled that the new Atl\u00e9tico he sought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/sep/25/diego-costa-and-the-new-atletico-same-as-the-old-atletico\" title=\"\">was the old one</a>. It was natural, for example, that Simeone should return to Costa: his other signings, other ideas, had not always worked. It was as if they did not get it and their coach did not get them. Since Costa left the first time Atl\u00e9tico have signed a long list of strikers: Mario Mandzukic, Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, Griezmann, Jackson Mart\u00ednez, Luciano Vietto, K\u00e9vin Gameiro, Fernando Torres, Diego Costa again, Nikola Kalinic and \u00c1lvaro Morata. Only Griezmann can be considered an unqualified success (although Morata might prove to be). Even the second coming of Costa was not the same; the context had changed.</p> <p>But this time, given the scale of the changes, the men who are departing \u2013 Simeone\u2019s men \u2013 and the fact that there are so many of them, it might be different.

Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix is an extraordinarily talented second striker, aged 19, already talked about as a future Ballon d\u2019Or winner, who scored 20 goals and provided 11 assists for Benfica last season, compared with Griezmann\u2019s 21 goals and 10 assists. But he also cost Atl\u00e9tico Madrid \u20ac126m. That is more even than they will get for Griezmann, whose buyout clause dropped to \u20ac120m on 1 July, \u20ac24m of which is payable to Real Sociedad. It makes F\u00e9lix the most expensive player Atl\u00e9tico ever signed \u2013 and by \u20ac55m. That the previous record holder was Thomas Lemar this time last summer, Atl\u00e9tico paying \u20ac70m in return for a 70% share, speaks of market inflation. It speaks also of a shift at the club that made a philosophy of necessity and constructed an identity around humility. And that asks questions about F\u00e9lix\u2019s fit, his role within a team seemingly obliged to undergo significant change. But can they? Can their manager? And if so, can the young Portuguese lead it? Tapping into Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s historic identity, built around suffering over the previous decade and beyond, and articulated by the manager who was pulling them from the depression, Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s philosophy came to be called Cholismo, taking its title from Diego Simeone\u2019s \u201cEl Cholo\u201d nickname and finding an echo on the pitch as well as off it. In short, they were fighters, born to suffer, to battle against the odds. And that, it seemed, necessarily meant playing a particular way. It is a way that has proven persistent, hard to let go of; a way with which they felt comfortable, that felt right. The former midfielder Jos\u00e9 Movilla, a player in the early noughties, was a bin-man, which fit somehow, while the former goalkeeper Germ\u00e1n Burgos, Simeone\u2019s assistant now, is an AC/DC fan who once claimed: \u201cI couldn\u2019t play at [Real] Madrid because of how I look. They\u2019d make me cut my hair. Atl\u00e9tico is synonymous with workers: brickies, taxi drivers, churros sellers.\u201d When Atl\u00e9tico won an impossible league in 2014, Tiago likened them to \u201cRobin Hood\u201d. Simeone had sarcastically noted that the difference in budget between them and Spain\u2019s big two was \u201conly \u20ac400m\u201d. And upon the final whistle on the day they won the title, their eleven players out on the Camp Nou cost less than \u20ac40m. Cesc F\u00e0bregas alone cost more. At the celebrations, Simeone told a huge crowd: \u201cThis is not just a league. What this triumph transmits is much more important than that: if you believe and if you work, you can do it.\u201d At the end of that season, their top scorer left. The previous summer, their top scorer had left too. This summer, their top scorer will also leave. But it is not the same now, the context has changed, and soon those certainties might be gone. Those restrictions, too; Atl\u00e9tico learned to live with limitations but now there are fewer of them, gigantic though their rivals remain. It may be that the revolution El Cholo started is ultimately what ends, or transforms, cholismo. Or perhaps not. Over the past five years Atl\u00e9tico have spent \u20ac569m. This summer the shift has been even more significant. With F\u00e9lix\u2019s signing Atl\u00e9tico have already taken their summer expenditure to \u20ac180m. It has been driven by departures: Griezmann, Lucas Hern\u00e1ndez, Diego God\u00edn, Juanfran Torres, Rodrigo Hern\u00e1ndez. That, once Griezmann is confirmed, will have brought in \u20ac260m. The old guard has gone and a new team must be built, perhaps with a new identity. And yet it is reasonable to wonder if those players who are left, and those who come to join them, will be able to do so \u2013 if, indeed, they will be allowed to. \u201cThis is one of the most difficult projects we have had since we arrived,\u201d Simeone admitted to Fox Sports. \u201cLots of players are leaving and it is a difficult moment of transition. We have a challenge now. The renovation began last year but it\u2019s true that this is going to be complicated.\u201d He had previously noted that the man \u2013 the kid, as it turned out \u2013 who replaced Griezmann would not be \u201cthe finished article, a crack\u201d, but \u201ca Griezmann like the Griezmann who came to us from San Sebasti\u00e1n [five years ago, aged 23], a Griezmann for the future.\u201d He added that this has always been the way Atl\u00e9tico buy, seeking out players to develop. Simeone also said that he sought a player who could \u201cabsorb our ideas\u201d, \u201csimilar to the style we play\u201d. And in another interview he said that the best coaches were the ones with a \u201cdefined style\u201d. Those are telling remarks. In terms of age F\u00e9lix could be that player but the former Portugal forward Sim\u00e3o admitted his doubts this week. \u201cHonestly I think Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix doesn\u2019t fit Atl\u00e9tico with Simeone\u2019s way of playing,\u201d he said. \u201cGriezmann made a brutal effort in defence. Often he didn\u2019t have the fuel left to attack. Simeone\u2019s mentality is defend, defend, defend, and then attack.\u201d That may be unfair, and Simeone\u2019s conservatism has become something of a lazy clich\u00e9 at times, but it is true that his style is defined. And it is true that this is something that raises questions about F\u00e9lix\u2019s fit, his ability either to adapt or to transcend, helping take them somewhere else. But, however much he leads, the leader is on the bench and Simeone is a man of consistency, not given to change: black suit, black shoes, black tie, his way of playing. Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s way, he likes to insist, sometimes rather pointedly. There have been moments when his Atl\u00e9tico have appeared ready to evolve but they have tended to get back to what they know, the evolution left incomplete, distrusted. One of the reasons Rodri is leaving for City is his desire to play another way. El Pa\u00eds suggested that Griezmann complained to teammates: \u201cWe hoof it long a lot.\u201d And a small group of players confided their frustration at the style to an opponent after one game last season. Strikers have found it hard to find their place. When Simeone re-signed Diego Costa, it felt symbolic, as if it signalled that the new Atl\u00e9tico he sought was the old one. It was natural, for example, that Simeone should return to Costa: his other signings, other ideas, had not always worked. It was as if they did not get it and their coach did not get them. Since Costa left the first time Atl\u00e9tico have signed a long list of strikers: Mario Mandzukic, Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, Griezmann, Jackson Mart\u00ednez, Luciano Vietto, K\u00e9vin Gameiro, Fernando Torres, Diego Costa again, Nikola Kalinic and \u00c1lvaro Morata. Only Griezmann can be considered an unqualified success (although Morata might prove to be). Even the second coming of Costa was not the same; the context had changed. But this time, given the scale of the changes, the men who are departing \u2013 Simeone\u2019s men \u2013 and the fact that there are so many of them, it might be different. And one thing is certain: Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix is different too.",

      "body": "<p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/nov/26/features.review2\">Casino Royale</a>, the novel in which Ian Fleming introduced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesbond\">James Bond</a> to the world, the hero ruminates at length about the perfect outdoor cocktail, by which he means summer cocktail. I\u2019ll paraphrase wildly, adding injunctions of my own, since so much of Bond\u2019s alcohol preference is related to his masculinity. Worrying about the size of your dick while you\u2019re deciding on cocktails is the surest way to end up drunk.</p> <p>So, it\u2019s summer: nothing too strong because you\u2019ll be dehydrated; nothing too wussy or fruity because they go down too easily; nothing too boring because this will likely be your main taste experience of the evening; nothing too unnatural in colour, because these are always too sweet; and no Pimm\u2019s, for reasons. Bond settles on an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americano_(cocktail)\" title=\"\">Americano</a>: Campari, sweet vermouth and club soda. In that bitters market, I would prefer a Campari and soda: cleaner and fresher without vermouth, and with zero chance that someone will accidentally fetch you a cup of coffee. Let me quickly take down Pimm\u2019s: the problem is not merely that it doesn\u2019t taste like alcohol. It tastes so unlike alcohol that it edges towards the most childish zone of the soft drinks arena, and if you are happy to drink cream soda with bits in all evening, why not do that? Proving, perhaps, that a lot of drunkenness depends on taste, you don\u2019t even feel drunk while you\u2019re drinking it. The first you get to hear about its alcohol content is when you fall over.</p> <p>Sangria is fine to make, but never drink a stranger\u2019s as you never know what you\u2019ll be getting. My Mr makes it with two bottles of red wine, one of ros\u00e9, a glass of brandy, two litres of Fanta and frozen berries, producing a solid session drink that I would never argue with. My excellent friend, meanwhile, makes it with all those things, except instead of Fanta, honey. Not two litres of honey, two spoons. This is the opposite of a session drink; it\u2019s more like spiking yourself. Yet it tastes exactly like regular sangria, so it\u2019s like spiking yourself invisibly.</p> <p>At the Diageo summer party in Westminster last week \u2013 as a globalised drinks company, it ought to know its spirits \u2013 there was a negroni fountain. Mishearing that as \u201cPeroni fountain\u201d and expecting something the colour of a very light beer, I went and stuck my glass in the actual fountain, made of water. But that is a perfectly fine misunderstanding. Negronis are, give or take the odd bit of zest and bitters, entirely composed of mostly very strong alcohol, which is the worst thing you can do to yourself, because they are delicious. </p> <p>The place you really want to go, for ideas if not for originality, is the past, where they knew a thing or two about drinking. What was your grandfather\u2019s favourite cocktail? What did your uncle want at his funeral? (Mine wanted black velvets: Guinness topped with champagne \u2013 an excellent winter drink and an even better funeral drink, but simply not cold enough for summer.)

      "bodyText": "In Casino Royale, the novel in which Ian Fleming introduced James Bond to the world, the hero ruminates at length about the perfect outdoor cocktail, by which he means summer cocktail. I\u2019ll paraphrase wildly, adding injunctions of my own, since so much of Bond\u2019s alcohol preference is related to his masculinity. Worrying about the size of your dick while you\u2019re deciding on cocktails is the surest way to end up drunk. So, it\u2019s summer: nothing too strong because you\u2019ll be dehydrated; nothing too wussy or fruity because they go down too easily; nothing too boring because this will likely be your main taste experience of the evening; nothing too unnatural in colour, because these are always too sweet; and no Pimm\u2019s, for reasons. Bond settles on an Americano: Campari, sweet vermouth and club soda. In that bitters market, I would prefer a Campari and soda: cleaner and fresher without vermouth, and with zero chance that someone will accidentally fetch you a cup of coffee. Let me quickly take down Pimm\u2019s: the problem is not merely that it doesn\u2019t taste like alcohol. It tastes so unlike alcohol that it edges towards the most childish zone of the soft drinks arena, and if you are happy to drink cream soda with bits in all evening, why not do that? Proving, perhaps, that a lot of drunkenness depends on taste, you don\u2019t even feel drunk while you\u2019re drinking it. The first you get to hear about its alcohol content is when you fall over. Sangria is fine to make, but never drink a stranger\u2019s as you never know what you\u2019ll be getting. My Mr makes it with two bottles of red wine, one of ros\u00e9, a glass of brandy, two litres of Fanta and frozen berries, producing a solid session drink that I would never argue with. My excellent friend, meanwhile, makes it with all those things, except instead of Fanta, honey. Not two litres of honey, two spoons. This is the opposite of a session drink; it\u2019s more like spiking yourself. Yet it tastes exactly like regular sangria, so it\u2019s like spiking yourself invisibly. At the Diageo summer party in Westminster last week \u2013 as a globalised drinks company, it ought to know its spirits \u2013 there was a negroni fountain. Mishearing that as \u201cPeroni fountain\u201d and expecting something the colour of a very light beer, I went and stuck my glass in the actual fountain, made of water. But that is a perfectly fine misunderstanding. Negronis are, give or take the odd bit of zest and bitters, entirely composed of mostly very strong alcohol, which is the worst thing you can do to yourself, because they are delicious. The place you really want to go, for ideas if not for originality, is the past, where they knew a thing or two about drinking. What was your grandfather\u2019s favourite cocktail? What did your uncle want at his funeral? (Mine wanted black velvets: Guinness topped with champagne \u2013 an excellent winter drink and an even better funeral drink, but simply not cold enough for summer.) The mermaid\u2019s kiss was a fabled summer cocktail of the seafaring forces, but the original version has completely fallen out of fashion; now all you get when you look it up is a load of blue Cura\u00e7ao (too colourful, way too colourful).

      "body": "<p>At first glance the timing is all off. Chelsea\u2019s ambitions have been severely constricted as a transfer embargo chokes incoming business, a sanction that could grip through two windows depending on how long it takes the court of arbitration for sport to adjudicate on an appeal. In the meantime the best player, Eden Hazard, has been sold, exiting the squad\u2019s WhatsApp group and parading in the gold-trimmed white shirt of Real Madrid.</p> \n<p>Two of the first-team\u2019s most talented academy graduates, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, are in long-term rehabilitation from achilles tendon ruptures and it may be optimistic to expect either to be back in contention this calendar year. A cluttered schedule lies ahead, from pre-season fixtures in Japan to a return to the Champions League. Retreat only a couple of campaigns and Antonio Conte, a far more experienced manager, found that slog too much of a stretch for his title winners, with a fifth-place finish reflecting a collective slip in standards.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ca7c32bc-cfdf-41a8-898e-6135d21b8b0a\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Frank Lampard was welcomed back with open arms but can he buck the trend of short tenures for Chelsea managers appointed under Roman Abramovich?

A year in the Championship with Derby \u2013 his team started well, tailed off badly mid-season, then rallied late to finish sixth before succumbing in the play-off final to Aston Villa \u2013 is hardly sufficient preparation for all this. The 41-year-old will know that, for all the assurances that may be delivered from on high and the talk of sympathy at the overall predicament \u2013 pledges of patience rarely afforded to his predecessors \u2013 standards will not be permitted to dip much further.</p> \n<p>Champions League qualification remains the minimum requirement expected of Maurizio Sarri\u2019s successor, as of every manager appointed by Roman Abramovich. The need to comply with Uefa\u2019s fair-play regulations will ensure revenues of up to \u00a370m cannot simply be waived while the new man adjusts to life in the dugout at the higher level. The club\u2019s record goalscorer witnessed a dissatisfied Abramovich sack seven managers over the 11 years the midfielder spent under the oligarch. He knows the culture well enough.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8b9817e2dd497c5c24282a0a31fe52abfec4334\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8b9817e2dd497c5c24282a0a31fe52abfec4334/0_62_4256_2770/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Lampard celebrates Chelsea\u2019s Champions League triumph of 2012.

A couple more years learning how best to cope with the vagaries of a brutal industry would have served him well. Yet, ultimately, both he and Chelsea still consider this an opportunity that cannot be passed up.</p> \n<p>For the club this is a bright, young manager whose appointment would lift the mood after a difficult \u2013 if nonetheless successful \u2013 year under Sarri. The fans were split over the Italian and his style of play, the disconnect more pronounced than ever between match-going supporters and those far less regular visitors to Stamford Bridge. The hierarchy had been dismayed by anti-Sarri chants as the team were knocked out of the FA Cup, and an away contingent in open mutiny as they laboured at Cardiff. The poison was similar to that to which Rafael Ben\u00edtez was subjected during his stint in interim charge in 2012-13, the simmering discontent omnipresent even as the team achieved their creditable third\u2011place finish or C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta hoisted the Europa League trophy in Baku.</p> \n<p>But throw in the anticipated arrivals of the coaches Jody Morris and Chris Jones, or the mooted addition of Didier Drogba or Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 to the backroom staff, along with that of Petr Cech, who will work with Marina Granovskaia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/21/chelsea-cech-lampard-technical-and-performance-director\" title=\"\">as technical and performance adviser</a>, and the revamp could be restorative in terms of the mood. This can be packaged as a return of the old guard. It is hard to contemplate an appointment that would be welcomed more heartily. That, in itself, may buy the new regime some time should there be inconsistency in results, for all that the board will be wary of everything Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has experienced at Old Trafford.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"656680f0-1222-4da0-a18c-21bebeeae226\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5E3pEZbY19Y?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Who else could Chelsea hope to entice? Massimiliano Allegri or Erik ten Hag would surely have wanted to add elite players to fill the void left by Hazard and bridge the chasm to Manchester City and Liverpool. A summer window where Christian Pulisic is the sole new face, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/27/chelsea-set-to-complete-permanent-signing-of-mateo-kovacic-for-45m\" title=\"\">\u00a344.8m is spent on Mateo Kovacic</a> and an array of loanees return \u2013 from Michy Batshuayi to Tiemou\u00e9 Bakayoko and Kurt Zouma \u2013 would be far from appealing. Lampard, on the other hand, knows the setup and may be more amenable to work with what he inherits. He may even be attracted by the prospect of tapping into the academy graduates\u2019 potential.</p> \n<p>He eked the best from Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori at Derby and watched Tammy Abraham and Reece James thrive at rival Championship clubs. Morris, who benefited from a crop of lavishly talented players in his previous role as the Chelsea Under-18s coach, would be a familiar face to help shape the next phase of their development. Plenty at this club have craved the chance to blood the youth.

      "bodyText": "At first glance the timing is all off. Chelsea\u2019s ambitions have been severely constricted as a transfer embargo chokes incoming business, a sanction that could grip through two windows depending on how long it takes the court of arbitration for sport to adjudicate on an appeal. In the meantime the best player, Eden Hazard, has been sold, exiting the squad\u2019s WhatsApp group and parading in the gold-trimmed white shirt of Real Madrid. Two of the first-team\u2019s most talented academy graduates, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, are in long-term rehabilitation from achilles tendon ruptures and it may be optimistic to expect either to be back in contention this calendar year. A cluttered schedule lies ahead, from pre-season fixtures in Japan to a return to the Champions League. Retreat only a couple of campaigns and Antonio Conte, a far more experienced manager, found that slog too much of a stretch for his title winners, with a fifth-place finish reflecting a collective slip in standards. It is hardly an appealing scenario, not least with Chelsea having finished 26 points off the top last time round, and that is before one even acknowledges Frank Lampard\u2019s coaching career is in its infancy. A year in the Championship with Derby \u2013 his team started well, tailed off badly mid-season, then rallied late to finish sixth before succumbing in the play-off final to Aston Villa \u2013 is hardly sufficient preparation for all this. The 41-year-old will know that, for all the assurances that may be delivered from on high and the talk of sympathy at the overall predicament \u2013 pledges of patience rarely afforded to his predecessors \u2013 standards will not be permitted to dip much further. Champions League qualification remains the minimum requirement expected of Maurizio Sarri\u2019s successor, as of every manager appointed by Roman Abramovich. The need to comply with Uefa\u2019s fair-play regulations will ensure revenues of up to \u00a370m cannot simply be waived while the new man adjusts to life in the dugout at the higher level. The club\u2019s record goalscorer witnessed a dissatisfied Abramovich sack seven managers over the 11 years the midfielder spent under the oligarch. He knows the culture well enough. Lampard will have spent the past few weeks weighing up all those concerns, conscious that, in an ideal world, he would be approaching this emotional return to Stamford Bridge having spent longer cutting his teeth at Pride Park. A couple more years learning how best to cope with the vagaries of a brutal industry would have served him well. Yet, ultimately, both he and Chelsea still consider this an opportunity that cannot be passed up. For the club this is a bright, young manager whose appointment would lift the mood after a difficult \u2013 if nonetheless successful \u2013 year under Sarri. The fans were split over the Italian and his style of play, the disconnect more pronounced than ever between match-going supporters and those far less regular visitors to Stamford Bridge. The hierarchy had been dismayed by anti-Sarri chants as the team were knocked out of the FA Cup, and an away contingent in open mutiny as they laboured at Cardiff. The poison was similar to that to which Rafael Ben\u00edtez was subjected during his stint in interim charge in 2012-13, the simmering discontent omnipresent even as the team achieved their creditable third\u2011place finish or C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta hoisted the Europa League trophy in Baku. But throw in the anticipated arrivals of the coaches Jody Morris and Chris Jones, or the mooted addition of Didier Drogba or Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 to the backroom staff, along with that of Petr Cech, who will work with Marina Granovskaia as technical and performance adviser, and the revamp could be restorative in terms of the mood. This can be packaged as a return of the old guard. It is hard to contemplate an appointment that would be welcomed more heartily. That, in itself, may buy the new regime some time should there be inconsistency in results, for all that the board will be wary of everything Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has experienced at Old Trafford. Who else could Chelsea hope to entice? Massimiliano Allegri or Erik ten Hag would surely have wanted to add elite players to fill the void left by Hazard and bridge the chasm to Manchester City and Liverpool. A summer window where Christian Pulisic is the sole new face, \u00a344.8m is spent on Mateo Kovacic and an array of loanees return \u2013 from Michy Batshuayi to Tiemou\u00e9 Bakayoko and Kurt Zouma \u2013 would be far from appealing. Lampard, on the other hand, knows the setup and may be more amenable to work with what he inherits. He may even be attracted by the prospect of tapping into the academy graduates\u2019 potential. He eked the best from Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori at Derby and watched Tammy Abraham and Reece James thrive at rival Championship clubs. Morris, who benefited from a crop of lavishly talented players in his previous role as the Chelsea Under-18s coach, would be a familiar face to help shape the next phase of their development. Plenty at this club have craved the chance to blood the youth. Lampard\u2019s appointment will have the academy coaching staff fist\u2011pumping in delight, not least with early talk of greater integration between senior and younger squads at Cobham, and the elevation of Joe Edwards to the first-team coaching staff. It will be intriguing to see how the new head coach fares. He may wonder whether his reputation would actually be that damaged if things go pear-shaped, given the circumstances in which he has taken up the reins. Regardless, there is always the prospect of the deficiencies of others \u2013 Manchester United, Arsenal \u2013 benefiting Chelsea in their pursuit of another top-four finish. Whatever happens, he is home. In that respect, the timing is irrelevant.",

      "bodyText": "1) The 106th edition of the Tour de France kicks off this weekend. You can get accustomed to this year\u2019s route with this snazzy 3D snake through every stage, while here\u2019s the best on board footage from 2018. The Tour was a different beast 70 years ago, when beer, cigarettes and a blatant disregard for health and safety were the order of the day. A rare and terrifying Tourmalet summit finish is back on the menu in 2019. There was an epic battle between Alberto Contador and Andy Schleck in 2010, as the two left the field behind and chased one another to the top of the daunting mountain. And Geraint Thomas defends his title this year. Here\u2019s a recap of how the Welshman won the Le Tour in 2018. 2) Marcus Trescothick has announced his forthcoming retirement from cricket aged 43. He broke down barriers around the discussion of mental health in sport and it\u2019s hard not to get a lump in your throat watching the Against The Odds video he made with Somerset last year. He was a fine Test cricketer whose highlights include 213 against South Africa for England in 2003 and 193 against Pakistan in 2005. He was no slouch in ODIs either. Here\u2019s his century against Australia in the buildup to the Ashes in 2005 and his 100 not out off just 76 balls against Bangladesh. And here\u2019s a little video celebrating his incredible of achievement of having scored 50 centuries for Somerset. 3) It\u2019s the Women\u2019s World Cup final this weekend. Look back on finals past, including the avalanche of goals when USA beat Japan in 2015, the nail-biting penalty-shootout when Japan beat USA in 2011, Germany being brilliant against Brazil in 2007, Nia K\u00fcnzer\u2019s golden goal for Germany in 2003 and the USA (again!) winning the 1999 final in front of 90,000 fans at the Rose Bowl, this time against China. 4) The Cricket World Cup match between Sri Lanka and South Africa came to a halt when a swarm of bees invaded Chester-le-Street. Bees have a habit of causing havoc at all manner of sport events: here they are stinging footballers in Brazil, causing golfer Pablo Larrazabal to jump into a lake, making competitors in the Tropical Bike Motril race ditch their mountain bikes and leg it after a terrifying Hitchcockian attack in the foothills of Spain. 5) While the Africa Cup of Nations struggles to contend with searing Egyptian temperatures, Kenya\u2019s Michael Olunga drops a bicycle kick into the cauldron against Tanzania. Mo Salah found the sweet spot with a free-kick against Uganda. It\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s found that inside corner this tournament, either. 6) German referee Deniz Aytekin encourages Mike Dean to buy a set of turntables and raise his game. Our favourites from below the line last week 1) England\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup (unofficial) squad \u2013 of which more info here \u2013 reunited by The One Show. 2) More notable long-range hi-jinks: nothing but net from Oxford\u2019s Peter Leven against Port Vale, while Wigan\u2019s Maynor Figueroa takes a quick free-kick from his own half against Stoke, that stays quick all the way in. Meanwhile, Xabi Alonso thinks fast for Liverpool and Newcastle\u2019s Steve Harper scrambles slow for this memorable effort, and FC United\u2019s Rory Patterson lines up straight from the kick-off against Silsden. 3) Prize flukes from last year\u2019s World Snooker Championship. 4) Well-told Wimbledon tales of yore in the Join The Story series of shorts, including Boris Becker and Steffi Graf: German Joy and John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg: Two Kings.

From 2019, however, all floodlit meetings were required to have a final race no later than 8.30pm. This, the BHA said last year, was a move \u201cto support jockeys and racing staff\u201d, and \u201cdesigned to help alleviate some of the demands that the fixture list might place on their physical and mental wellbeing through extensive travel and late working hours.\u201d</p> \n<p>An extension of this policy to include high-summer turf meetings would force many more tracks to change the scheduling of their last race and, as a result, of their first race too.</p> \n<p>Ripon, for example, ran its final race on 19 June at 9.20pm, while Ayr, Bath, Ffos Las, Hamilton, Aintree, Pontefract and Perth have all staged cards already this summer at which the last race was later than 9pm. Nine more tracks, including Newmarket, where Friday evening cards attract huge crowds, have run meetings with a last race at 9pm.</p> \n<p>Some smaller tracks rely heavily on bumper crowds on summer evenings to balance their books and will be concerned that an earlier start could have an impact on attendance as racegoers struggle to get to the course after work. With the BHA committed to doing all it can to ease the pressures of racing\u2019s workload wherever possible, however, the racecourses will have little option but to comply with the new policy.</p> \n<p>The number of \u201ccode-free\u201d days is also likely to rise next year. The 2019 fixture list included a six-day break for Flat racing in November and another five-day break in March, while there is also at least one code-free Sunday per month in the summer months. Jumping, meanwhile, currently has two breaks of eight days and five days. A four-day \u201cblank\u201d between from 22 December to Christmas day this year could also be retained.</p> \n<p>Will Lambe, the BHA\u2019s executive director, said on Wednesday that \u201cthe whole of British racing should be grateful\u201d to Duncan \u201cfor speaking so openly, and powerfully.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lambe added: </p> \n<p>\u201cAs with the <a href=\"https://racingwelfare.co.uk/mental-health-research-report/\">recent report Racing Welfare commissioned</a>, the picture Roderick paints is, sadly, not an unfamiliar one. The flip side of a sport in many ways sustained by the passion of those working within it is one that can become all-encompassing and create considerable pressures on individuals.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the short term, removing the stigma associated with talking about mental ill-health will go a long way, as will those within British racing doing a little more to understand and respect others\u2019 positions. We all have a role to play in this, including the racing media.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Thursday\u2019s best bets</h2> \n<p>Twelve winners from 28 rides in seven days have moved Danny Tudhope alongside Oisin Murphy at the top of the three-way race for the jockeys\u2019 championship, and he is now no bigger than 5-1 to win his first title having been a 25-1 shot at the end of May.</p> \n<p>Tudhope is lagging behind both Murphy and Silvestre de Sousa in terms of the number of rides he has taken this season, which is never a positive sign when a rider is hoping to be crowned champion. His strike-rate, though, remains exceptional at no less than 25pc \u2013 55 wins from 219 rides \u2013 which has allowed him to match Murphy\u2019s total so far of 55 from 311.</p> \n<p>Tudhope will be hoping to maintain his momentum today, when he has just two rides on the card at Haydock ahead of a Friday and Saturday on the northern circuit.</p> \n<p><strong>Tukhoom (3.30)</strong> looks like his best chance of a winner, when the six-year-old makes his first start for the in-form David O\u2019Meara having switched stables after a four-length win in a claimer at Redcar on 21 June. He registered a very decent time in that race and has been competitive off higher ratings than his current mark of 77 in the past.</p> \n<p>Tudhope has a live contender for the feature race too in Southern Rock, but <strong>Dal Horrisigle (4.00) </strong>looked like a horse on a rapid rise when successful at Nottingham last time and should extend his winning streak to three. <strong>Battle Of Wills (2.00)</strong> also has strong claims at the same meeting, while <strong>Chitra (8.00)</strong> and <strong>Sir Busker (7.45)</strong> look best on the strong evening cards at Newbury and Epsom Downs respectively.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cbe453aa-a114-477b-a29b-667e00715017\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Haydock Park&nbsp;</b>2.00 Battle Of Wills,&nbsp;2.30 Buhturi,&nbsp;3.00 Path Of Thunder,&nbsp;3.30 Tukhoom&nbsp;4.00 Dal Horrisigle (nap)&nbsp;4.30 Arletta Star&nbsp;5.00 Dapper Man&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Perth</b>&nbsp;2.10 Mega Double,&nbsp;2.40 Angel's Envy 3.10 Welcome Ben&nbsp;3.40 Frightened Rabbit&nbsp;4.10 Viens Chercher&nbsp;4.40 Roll Of Thunder&nbsp;5.10 Amalfi Doug&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Yarmouth</b>&nbsp;2.20 Precious Plum, 2.50 Iffraaz, 3.20 Cape Victory, 3.50 Waqt (nb), 4.20 Magical Ride, 4.50 Cheng Gong, 5.20 Banksy's Art&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Newbury</b>&nbsp;5.45 Edged Out,&nbsp;6.20 So Sharp,&nbsp;6.55 Ethic, 7.25 Logician, 8.00 Chitra,&nbsp;8.30 Carp Kid,&nbsp;9.00 Mandocello&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Epsom Downs&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>6.05 Be Perfect,&nbsp;6.40 Diva Kareem,&nbsp;7.15 Handytalk,&nbsp;7.45 Sir Busker,&nbsp;8.20 Hermocrates,&nbsp;8.50 Ashazuri&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

Will Lambe, the BHA\u2019s executive director, said on Wednesday that \u201cthe whole of British racing should be grateful\u201d to Duncan \u201cfor speaking so openly, and powerfully.\u201d Lambe added: \u201cAs with the recent report Racing Welfare commissioned, the picture Roderick paints is, sadly, not an unfamiliar one. The flip side of a sport in many ways sustained by the passion of those working within it is one that can become all-encompassing and create considerable pressures on individuals. \u201cIn the short term, removing the stigma associated with talking about mental ill-health will go a long way, as will those within British racing doing a little more to understand and respect others\u2019 positions. We all have a role to play in this, including the racing media.\u201d Thursday\u2019s best bets Twelve winners from 28 rides in seven days have moved Danny Tudhope alongside Oisin Murphy at the top of the three-way race for the jockeys\u2019 championship, and he is now no bigger than 5-1 to win his first title having been a 25-1 shot at the end of May. Tudhope is lagging behind both Murphy and Silvestre de Sousa in terms of the number of rides he has taken this season, which is never a positive sign when a rider is hoping to be crowned champion. His strike-rate, though, remains exceptional at no less than 25pc \u2013 55 wins from 219 rides \u2013 which has allowed him to match Murphy\u2019s total so far of 55 from 311. Tudhope will be hoping to maintain his momentum today, when he has just two rides on the card at Haydock ahead of a Friday and Saturday on the northern circuit. Tukhoom (3.30) looks like his best chance of a winner, when the six-year-old makes his first start for the in-form David O\u2019Meara having switched stables after a four-length win in a claimer at Redcar on 21 June. He registered a very decent time in that race and has been competitive off higher ratings than his current mark of 77 in the past. Tudhope has a live contender for the feature race too in Southern Rock, but Dal Horrisigle (4.00) looked like a horse on a rapid rise when successful at Nottingham last time and should extend his winning streak to three. Battle Of Wills (2.00) also has strong claims at the same meeting, while Chitra (8.00) and Sir Busker (7.45) look best on the strong evening cards at Newbury and Epsom Downs respectively.",

Hunt\u2019s attempts to talk up a backstory as an 'underestimated' entrepreneur can fall flat given he is also the son of an admiral and was head boy at Charterhouse.

At 3:56 am on Monday morning \u2013 nearly four hours ahead of schedule \u2013 Armstrong, the lunar module commander, opened the hatch and clambered slowly down to the surface of the moon. Minutes later Aldrin followed him down the steps of the ladder \u2013 already renamed Tranquility Base \u2013 to join in this moving, clumsy culmination of eight years of intense dedication. It was the fulfilment of a dream which men have shared since the beginning of recorded history.</p> <p>The decision to walk early was made three hours after the lunar module Eagle had made a perfect landing at 9:17pm, four miles downrange from the chosen site. The spacecraft was steered manually to clear a boulder-strewn crater \u201cthe size of a football pitch\u201d. It was a moment of extraordinary tension and silence.</p> <p>The lunar module curved gently down over the Sea of Tranquility, the drama heightened by the calm, almost casual voices of the astronauts and the mission controller at Houston.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jul/04/buzz-aldrin-moon-space-apollo\">The man who fell to earth: Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The casualness was deceptive: from 500ft above the surface and all too aware that an error could lead to irretrievable disaster, Aldrin brought the spacecraft down under Armstrong\u2019s direction. At the moment of approach Armstrong\u2019s heartbeat rose from its normal 70 to 156. Yet his voice was calm and flat: \u201cContact light: engines stopped? The Eagle has landed.\u201d</p> <p>The landing was perfect. Spaceflight Centre and the world seemed momentarily stunned by emotion: only Armstrong, Aldrin \u2013 and above them, Collins \u2013 seemed unmoved at the end of the drama which began with a characteristically laconic acceptance of the \u201cgo\u201d for separation of the lunar module shortly before 7 p.m.</p> <p>\u201cYou got a bunch of guys who\u2019re about to turn blue\u201d, said the Houston space controller, when the module had landed. \u201cWe\u2019re breathing again.

And from there, in the Sea of Tranquility, the colourful earth is simply bright. \u201cIt\u2019s big, and bright and beautiful,\u201d said Armstrong.</p> <p>They said they had no difficulty in adapting to the moon\u2019s gravity.

The world waited for the static-filled radio silence to be broken by an astronaut\u2019s affirmative. After what seemed on earth to be an age, the disappointed millions who had hoped to watch the first steps of separation on television, at last heard a calm and distant Armstrong confirm that the landing trajectory was good. The first minor miracle had been performed.</p> <p>From that moment, with the tension mounting second by second and with the minimum of interrogation from earth, or from the orbiting Collins, the lunar module bore Armstrong and Aldrin downward, using its motor as a brake and slowly tilting until it was upright and ready for landing.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Bloody Sunday</strong> | 5 February 1972 edition</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"203f5710b5f6012a2bbfc7034796946dda20c47c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/203f5710b5f6012a2bbfc7034796946dda20c47c/11_44_2672_1603/1000.jpg\" alt=\"British paratroopers take away civil rights demonstrators after the paratroopers opened fire on a civil rights march in Derry, killing 14 civilians, 30 January 1972\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">British paratroopers take away civil rights demonstrators after the paratroopers opened fire on a civil rights march in Derry, killing 14 civilians, 30 January 1972</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Writing in the Guardian in 2010, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/15/derry-bloody-sunday-northern-ireland\">reporter Simon Winchester recalled the \u201c90 minutes [that] will stay with me for as long as I live\u201d</a>.

The army reported two military casualties and said that its soldiers had arrested between 50 and 60 people who had been allegedly involved in the illegal protest march.</p> <p>The shooting lasted for about 25 minutes in and around the Rossville Flats area of Bogside. Where only moments before, thousands of men and women had been drifting slowly towards a protest meeting to be held at Free Derry Corner, there was a handful of bleeding bodies, some lying still, others still moving with pain, on the white concrete of the square.</p> <p>The army\u2019s official explanation for the killing was that their troops had fired in response to a number of snipers who had opened up on them from below the flats. But those of us at the meeting heard only one shot before the soldiers opened up with their high-velocity rifles. And, while it is impossible to be sure, one came away with the firm impression, reinforced by dozens of eyewitnesses, that the soldiers, men of the 1st Battalion the Parachute Regiment, may have fired needlessly into the huge crowd.</p> <p>The death toll at 7.30pm, three hours after the shooting, was confirmed as 13, all men [another died four months later from gunshot injuries]. An Army statement at 7.30pm said that after an hour of heavy stoning, men of the 1st Battalion the Parachute Regiment moved into the William Street and Rossville Street areas. \u201cThey went in to arrest people in the crowd and chased several men who were running away,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhile this operation was in progress, gunmen operated up from the rubble at the base of the Rossville Flats and soldiers returned the fire. Casualty returns are still coming in.\u201d</p> <p>At about 3.30pm, men of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Greenjackets, in William Street, endured ten minutes of heavy stoning before opening up on the mob with CS gas and a large water cannon, drenching hundreds of marchers and journalists in purple, indelible dye. Until about 4.15 the mob was engaged in a fierce tussle with soldiers. Huge quantities of gas and hundreds of rubber bullets were fired at this stage and many of the rioters were injured. Then, at 4.05pm, a single shot was fired in William Street, presumably by an IRA man.

I saw three men fall to the ground. One was still alive, with blood pumping from his leg.

What went wrong? Too many arrived too late. Hold-ups on the motorway. Too many, from Liverpool, were siphoned into the smaller end of the ground. There were no early checks, as was normal and expected, for ticket holders. So there was a frantic scrum outside the ground, before the choked turnstiles, which threatened life. A gate was opened. A great surge of late fans poured into the central pen, crushing scores \u2013 mostly kids \u2013 who had arrived early, with tickets, against the wired remembrances of East Berlin that now ring our soccer grounds. Police central control \u2013 with TV monitors \u2013 could not even control the death toll. The melee outside became a melee inside whilst, on adjacent terracing, there was space a\u2019plenty. The public address system produced scant relevant information for almost an hour. Life-saving equipment wasn\u2019t to hand or in working order. Ambulances didn\u2019t realise the dimension of the disaster.</p> <p>There will be a public inquiry. It will pass harsh judgement on the performance of the police, condemning the decision to give Liverpool fans the smaller ticket allocation, the lack of barriers away from the turnstiles, the confusion on the ground and the paucity of coordination on high. But that is only the beginning. After [the 1987 fire on the London Underground at] King\u2019s Cross, heads rolled and millions have been spent to make sure such a horror does not recur. After [the bombing of a Pan Am airliner over] Lockerbie, the entire fabric of airport security has been taken apart and woven together again. Sheffield on Saturday demands as serious a response.</p> <p>Football has been scarred by increasing violence. That was a social and a political problem. From Hillsborough you may piece together the story of how one problem gave birth to another. Liverpool fans were nonsensically given the Leppings Lane end because, since they had to be segregated, that was the easiest for traffic flow from Merseyside. The perimeter fences against which they died were there to stop them, like their predecessors, pouring onto the pitch. But, in the process, a trap was sprung upon dozens of innocent victims.</p> <p>Football fans are not animals. The iron pens, which prevent escape, have to be dismantled. The European system of moats, allowing access in desperation to the pitch, has to be adopted. If that \u2013 or any parallel relaxation \u2013 produces additional hooliganism, so be it. The game, only a game, can always be stopped.</p> <p>Terraces on our big grounds pack in more spectators than the seated areas where no surges can occur. Installing all seats would cost money. So what? The clubs have never struck a balance between transfer fees and civilised facilities for the millions whose five pounds a time make them possible. If Hillsborough, with a good safety record, can stage a tragedy of this dimension, how many more of our decaying stadiums are waiting in line?</p> <p>Unless there is now a mighty response to refurbish our football grounds \u2013 and to accept that any additional risk of hooliganism will spell nemesis for the game \u2013 it will surely happen again.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>The fall of the Berlin Wall</strong> | 19 November 1989 edition</h2> <p>On 9 November 1989, the most potent symbol of a divided Europe was torn down. After months of protests, the East German communist authorities announced that their citizens could travel freely to West Germany, 28 years after the erection of the 3.6-metre-high wall that became synonymous with the iron curtain. A stream turned to a torrent as East Germans flooded across the border. In one night, the political map of Europe was redrawn.</p> <p>Within weeks, the communist regimes of Czechoslovakia and Romania fell.

Those flickering black-and-white images of the Berlin airlift can go back to the film archive room. The long-obvious truth is now openly revealed. Politics, not weapons, kept Europe divided. Our own former defence secretary, Mr George Younger, seen briefly yesterday going on about the \u201cabsolute preponderance of Soviet troops in Europe, needs to take a deep breath and have a word with his American friends, who have themselves fallen into reflective silence.</p> <p>Anyone who now proposes to modernise short-range nuclear weapons should have his (or her) head examined. Perhaps it will need a tactical redeployment of generals without jobs. But we should start the advance planning for the decommissioning of the deterrence machine now.</p> <p>There is no denying that the centre of European gravity is going to shift as a result of the German earthquake. No one can be quite sure that some new fault line will not appear. It is very important not to encourage, in appearance or reality, a situation where East Germany simply joins \u201cthe western camp\u201d. That would be to create a fresh imbalance \u2013 another reason why the dissolution of one monolith must be accompanied by that of the other. It would be the surest way of providing Mr Gorbachev\u2019s critics with destructive ammunition. The Soviet Union (unlike, we should note, the US) has always insisted that it is a European power, and will be rightly alarmed if a new Germany merely enlarges the other Europe. It is preferable to see the re-emergence of a Germany linked to the rest of Europe, but essentially its own arbiter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/06/-sp-fall-berlin-wall-what-it-meant-to-be-there\">The fall of the Berlin Wall: what it meant to be there | Timothy Garton Ash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are shadows in many minds, of course there are shadows.

He pulled at her clothes as she looked at the foreign soldiers in the desperate, terrified hope that they could save her from her death.</p> <p>But none of the troops moved. \u201cIt\u2019s not our mandate,\u201d said one, leaning against his jeep as he watched the condemned woman, the rain splashing at his blue United Nations badge.</p> <p>The 3,000 foreign troops now in Rwanda are no more than spectators to the savagery which aid workers say has seen the massacre of 15,000 people \u2013 mainly from the traditionally dominant Tutsi minority.</p> <p>The killing started after President Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana and his Burundian counterpart \u2013 both from the majority Hutu tribe \u2013 died in a rocket attack on their plane last week while returning from peace talks. His presidential guard and the Hutu-dominated army unleashed a campaign of terror. Opposing them is the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front, dominated by Tutsis.</p> <p>The Belgian and French troops are here to get foreigners out. So far they have ferried about 1,000 from an assembly point at the French school to military aircraft. Rwandans, including staff of international organisations, are left to their fate.</p> <p>About 275 Rwandans staying in one hotel have been barred from leaving on European military aircraft, a Belgian Red Cross employee said yesterday. \u201cAll of them are Tutsi. They are going to be assassinated. It\u2019s disgusting that they don\u2019t take them. We are going to publish [their names] when we get to Belgium,\u201d he said, before being evacuated with his Rwandan wife.</p> <p>The splintering of the city between the RPF and different sections of the armed forces has perpetuated the anarchy. Evacuation convoys between the school and the French-controlled airport travel via muddy backroads to avoid the city centre which is -controlled by civilian and military bandits intent on killing and stealing from whoever falls into their hands.</p> <p>Less than a mile from the airport yesterday army trucks filled with foreign evacuees were blocked when they drove into a massacre where machete- and knife-wielding Rwandans lined the roads smiling as their victims lay dying. On the way to pick up the evacuees, the convoy had passed the bodies of two newly killed men sprawled in the muddy courtyard of a house. As the convoy returned past the same house less than an hour later, the body of a woman and two more men lay with the two already dead, their eyes wide open. The woman had had one of her legs cut off.</p> <p>Watching the convoy were the killers \u2013 young men, two women with clubs, old men and children. Close to one body stood a man with a clipboard in office clothes. Beside him stood a well-armed government soldier in smart uniform.</p> <p>At Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry school, French troops lay on the roof with guns trained on the deserted road outside as the names of evacuees were read out in the courtyard below. Halfway up a hill less than a mile away lay a pile of corpses. From nearby houses women, old and young, were casually led to the pile and forced to sit down on it. Men with clubs then beat the dead and dying bodies which surrounded the women as they sat, screaming, pleading for their lives.</p> <p>Suddenly the men turned on the women.

      "bodyText": "The Apollo 11 moon landing | 24 July 1969 edition As the peak of the space race, and perhaps the crowning glory of the American century, the arrival of two US astronauts on the moon on 20 July, provided a chance for writers such as Anthony Tucker to write a first draft of history. His account of the Eagle\u2019s landing remains thrilling 50 years on. Meanwhile, Alistair Cooke, the Guardian\u2019s famous US correspondent from the mid-40s until 1972, took in the response from those in the US watching, for days on end, on television. Other stories in this edition include optimistic news about France no longer standing in the way of the UK joining the common market and news that the Sun newspaper, founded five years earlier, would likely fold by the end of the year. Of course, Rupert Murdoch bought the title a few months later and the rest is \u2026 history. * * * 3.56am: man steps on the moon By Anthony Tucker Men are on the moon. At 3:56 am on Monday morning \u2013 nearly four hours ahead of schedule \u2013 Armstrong, the lunar module commander, opened the hatch and clambered slowly down to the surface of the moon. Minutes later Aldrin followed him down the steps of the ladder \u2013 already renamed Tranquility Base \u2013 to join in this moving, clumsy culmination of eight years of intense dedication. It was the fulfilment of a dream which men have shared since the beginning of recorded history. The decision to walk early was made three hours after the lunar module Eagle had made a perfect landing at 9:17pm, four miles downrange from the chosen site. The spacecraft was steered manually to clear a boulder-strewn crater \u201cthe size of a football pitch\u201d. It was a moment of extraordinary tension and silence. The lunar module curved gently down over the Sea of Tranquility, the drama heightened by the calm, almost casual voices of the astronauts and the mission controller at Houston. The casualness was deceptive: from 500ft above the surface and all too aware that an error could lead to irretrievable disaster, Aldrin brought the spacecraft down under Armstrong\u2019s direction. At the moment of approach Armstrong\u2019s heartbeat rose from its normal 70 to 156. Yet his voice was calm and flat: \u201cContact light: engines stopped? The Eagle has landed.\u201d The landing was perfect. Spaceflight Centre and the world seemed momentarily stunned by emotion: only Armstrong, Aldrin \u2013 and above them, Collins \u2013 seemed unmoved at the end of the drama which began with a characteristically laconic acceptance of the \u201cgo\u201d for separation of the lunar module shortly before 7 p.m. \u201cYou got a bunch of guys who\u2019re about to turn blue\u201d, said the Houston space controller, when the module had landed. \u201cWe\u2019re breathing again. Thanks a lot.\u201d [\u2026] Ten minutes after landing Aldrin radioed: \u201cWe\u2019ll get to the details of what\u2019s around here, but it looks like a collection of just about every kind of rock. Colour depends on what angle you\u2019re looking at?\u201d The close look already began to bile the image gained from centuries of examining lunar reflectivity \u2013 for that is what we see by \u2013 and the more detailed examination from orbit by man and camera. And from there, in the Sea of Tranquility, the colourful earth is simply bright. \u201cIt\u2019s big, and bright and beautiful,\u201d said Armstrong. They said they had no difficulty in adapting to the moon\u2019s gravity. The conversation from the moon\u2019s surface came through loud and clear. Separation began on this side of the moon, but the descent itself \u2013 the journey to which President Kennedy committed his nation eight years ago \u2013 began with a firing of the lunar module\u2019s motor after a long separating half-orbit on the far side of the moon and out of touch with the control centre back at Houston. The world waited for the static-filled radio silence to be broken by an astronaut\u2019s affirmative. After what seemed on earth to be an age, the disappointed millions who had hoped to watch the first steps of separation on television, at last heard a calm and distant Armstrong confirm that the landing trajectory was good. The first minor miracle had been performed. From that moment, with the tension mounting second by second and with the minimum of interrogation from earth, or from the orbiting Collins, the lunar module bore Armstrong and Aldrin downward, using its motor as a brake and slowly tilting until it was upright and ready for landing. * * * Bloody Sunday | 5 February 1972 edition Writing in the Guardian in 2010, reporter Simon Winchester recalled the \u201c90 minutes [that] will stay with me for as long as I live\u201d. Shortly after 4pm on Sunday 30 January 1972, during a Civil Rights Association march in the Bogside area of Derry, 14 people were killed by gunfire from British paratroopers \u2013 one of the defining horrors of the Troubles. As well as Winchester\u2019s eyewitness story, this edition of the Weekly featured Les Gibbard\u2019s cover cartoon lamenting the deaths; Simon Hoggart\u2019s report on the aftermath in Bogside; and Ian Aitken on the establishment of the tribunal run by the Lord Chief Justice. The battle for justice for those killed on Bloody Sunday continues, with an unnamed British paratrooper being charged with murder in March 2019. * * * The Derry Killings By Simon Winchester, Derry The tragic and inevitable Doomsday situation which has been universally forecast for Northern Ireland arrived in Londonderry on Sunday afternoon when soldiers, firing into a large crowd of civil rights demonstrators, shot and killed 13 civilians. Fifteen more people, including a woman, were wounded by gunfire and another woman was seriously injured after being knocked down by an armoured car. The army reported two military casualties and said that its soldiers had arrested between 50 and 60 people who had been allegedly involved in the illegal protest march. The shooting lasted for about 25 minutes in and around the Rossville Flats area of Bogside. Where only moments before, thousands of men and women had been drifting slowly towards a protest meeting to be held at Free Derry Corner, there was a handful of bleeding bodies, some lying still, others still moving with pain, on the white concrete of the square. The army\u2019s official explanation for the killing was that their troops had fired in response to a number of snipers who had opened up on them from below the flats. But those of us at the meeting heard only one shot before the soldiers opened up with their high-velocity rifles. And, while it is impossible to be sure, one came away with the firm impression, reinforced by dozens of eyewitnesses, that the soldiers, men of the 1st Battalion the Parachute Regiment, may have fired needlessly into the huge crowd. The death toll at 7.30pm, three hours after the shooting, was confirmed as 13, all men [another died four months later from gunshot injuries]. An Army statement at 7.30pm said that after an hour of heavy stoning, men of the 1st Battalion the Parachute Regiment moved into the William Street and Rossville Street areas. \u201cThey went in to arrest people in the crowd and chased several men who were running away,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhile this operation was in progress, gunmen operated up from the rubble at the base of the Rossville Flats and soldiers returned the fire. Casualty returns are still coming in.\u201d At about 3.30pm, men of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Greenjackets, in William Street, endured ten minutes of heavy stoning before opening up on the mob with CS gas and a large water cannon, drenching hundreds of marchers and journalists in purple, indelible dye. Until about 4.15 the mob was engaged in a fierce tussle with soldiers. Huge quantities of gas and hundreds of rubber bullets were fired at this stage and many of the rioters were injured. Then, at 4.05pm, a single shot was fired in William Street, presumably by an IRA man. The Provisional [IRA] had been under strict local orders to keep their guns at home and the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association stewards did their best to keep order and look out for gunmen. Shortly before 4.15pm Mr Kevin McCorry, the civil rights organiser, began to walk through the crowd, telling them through a megaphone that Miss [Bernadette] Devlin, Mr [Ivan] Cooper, and Lord Brockway were to speak [at Free Derry Corner]. As this meeting was getting under way four or five armoured cars appeared in William Street square, and people began to run away. Paratroops piled out of their vehicles, many ran forward to make arrests, but others rushed to the street corners. It was these men, perhaps 20 in all, who opened fire with their rifles. I saw three men fall to the ground. One was still alive, with blood pumping from his leg. The others, both apparently in their teens, seemed dead. * * * The Hillsborough tragedy | 23 April 1989 edition On 15 April 1989, 96 Liverpool fans travelled to Sheffield for a football match and never came home. The crush in the Leppings Lane end of the Hillsborough stadium ruined hundreds of lives and changed British football for ever. The chaos at the ground and the failures by police were highlighted in a Guardian editorial published two days after the disaster. It addressed the opening of gate C (which led to the crush), the organisational and policing failures, and foresaw some of the modernising conclusions of the 1990 Taylor report. It took until April 2016, after the longest inquest in British legal history, to determine that the victims were unlawfully killed and that failings by the police and ambulance services contributed to their deaths. * * * Down the tunnel to total disaster Guardian editorial It was, individual acts of heroism apart, a tragedy without any redeeming feature. It was a professional event, organised by professionals. And it was the most awful, dislocated, deadly botch. If you look for an image to remember it by, think of the inert bodies carried to ambulances on advertising hoardings, because no one had enough stretchers. Nothing went right at Hillsborough on Saturday. What went wrong? Too many arrived too late. Hold-ups on the motorway. Too many, from Liverpool, were siphoned into the smaller end of the ground. There were no early checks, as was normal and expected, for ticket holders. So there was a frantic scrum outside the ground, before the choked turnstiles, which threatened life. A gate was opened. A great surge of late fans poured into the central pen, crushing scores \u2013 mostly kids \u2013 who had arrived early, with tickets, against the wired remembrances of East Berlin that now ring our soccer grounds. Police central control \u2013 with TV monitors \u2013 could not even control the death toll. The melee outside became a melee inside whilst, on adjacent terracing, there was space a\u2019plenty. The public address system produced scant relevant information for almost an hour. Life-saving equipment wasn\u2019t to hand or in working order. Ambulances didn\u2019t realise the dimension of the disaster. There will be a public inquiry. It will pass harsh judgement on the performance of the police, condemning the decision to give Liverpool fans the smaller ticket allocation, the lack of barriers away from the turnstiles, the confusion on the ground and the paucity of coordination on high. But that is only the beginning. After [the 1987 fire on the London Underground at] King\u2019s Cross, heads rolled and millions have been spent to make sure such a horror does not recur. After [the bombing of a Pan Am airliner over] Lockerbie, the entire fabric of airport security has been taken apart and woven together again. Sheffield on Saturday demands as serious a response. Football has been scarred by increasing violence. That was a social and a political problem. From Hillsborough you may piece together the story of how one problem gave birth to another. Liverpool fans were nonsensically given the Leppings Lane end because, since they had to be segregated, that was the easiest for traffic flow from Merseyside. The perimeter fences against which they died were there to stop them, like their predecessors, pouring onto the pitch. But, in the process, a trap was sprung upon dozens of innocent victims. Football fans are not animals. The iron pens, which prevent escape, have to be dismantled. The European system of moats, allowing access in desperation to the pitch, has to be adopted. If that \u2013 or any parallel relaxation \u2013 produces additional hooliganism, so be it. The game, only a game, can always be stopped. Terraces on our big grounds pack in more spectators than the seated areas where no surges can occur. Installing all seats would cost money. So what? The clubs have never struck a balance between transfer fees and civilised facilities for the millions whose five pounds a time make them possible. If Hillsborough, with a good safety record, can stage a tragedy of this dimension, how many more of our decaying stadiums are waiting in line? Unless there is now a mighty response to refurbish our football grounds \u2013 and to accept that any additional risk of hooliganism will spell nemesis for the game \u2013 it will surely happen again. * * * The fall of the Berlin Wall | 19 November 1989 edition On 9 November 1989, the most potent symbol of a divided Europe was torn down. After months of protests, the East German communist authorities announced that their citizens could travel freely to West Germany, 28 years after the erection of the 3.6-metre-high wall that became synonymous with the iron curtain. A stream turned to a torrent as East Germans flooded across the border. In one night, the political map of Europe was redrawn. Within weeks, the communist regimes of Czechoslovakia and Romania fell. On 3 October 1990, Germany was reunified and Chancellor Helmut Kohl was poised to lead the union of east and west. This editorial looked ahead with optimism to a post-cold war Europe. * * * The Berlin Wall crumbles into history Guardian editorial They crossed the border with incredible joy, amazement, tears and good humour. They sang and sparkled, above, below and beside the Berlin Wall. It was one of those very rare, absolutely electrifying, moments when the ordinary lay people take over and all the professionals \u2013 from prognosticators to border guards \u2013 get quietly out of the way. From the sidelines we should now be thinking big, electric thoughts about a future where so much, as yet barely definable, is possible. Germany is a country on the verge of reunification in spirit \u2013 never mind yet about the jurisdictional details. The process under way simply sweeps aside the natural hesitations of history about seeing one Germany once again. It also sweeps aside any real chance of tanks or troops or anyone else standing in the way. The victims of Beijing died so that everyone else would realise that this is now the unacceptable and dead-end alternative. The crumbling of the Berlin Wall also signifies definitively the end of the superpowers\u2019 cold war in Europe. Those flickering black-and-white images of the Berlin airlift can go back to the film archive room. The long-obvious truth is now openly revealed. Politics, not weapons, kept Europe divided. Our own former defence secretary, Mr George Younger, seen briefly yesterday going on about the \u201cabsolute preponderance of Soviet troops in Europe, needs to take a deep breath and have a word with his American friends, who have themselves fallen into reflective silence. Anyone who now proposes to modernise short-range nuclear weapons should have his (or her) head examined. Perhaps it will need a tactical redeployment of generals without jobs. But we should start the advance planning for the decommissioning of the deterrence machine now. There is no denying that the centre of European gravity is going to shift as a result of the German earthquake. No one can be quite sure that some new fault line will not appear. It is very important not to encourage, in appearance or reality, a situation where East Germany simply joins \u201cthe western camp\u201d. That would be to create a fresh imbalance \u2013 another reason why the dissolution of one monolith must be accompanied by that of the other. It would be the surest way of providing Mr Gorbachev\u2019s critics with destructive ammunition. The Soviet Union (unlike, we should note, the US) has always insisted that it is a European power, and will be rightly alarmed if a new Germany merely enlarges the other Europe. It is preferable to see the re-emergence of a Germany linked to the rest of Europe, but essentially its own arbiter. There are shadows in many minds, of course there are shadows. But West Germany, over 40 years, has developed the most prudent of democratic credentials, the most wise and cautious of voting patterns. Germany with its entirely new human face is the formidable economic power on the European \u2013 and world \u2013 scene. If reunification is a challenge, it can only be met by wider European cooperation. Looking even further ahead (but if ever there was a stimulus to vision it is now) we begin to understand the potential behind the idea of Mr Gorbachev\u2019s common European home. A Europe where national rivalries are subsumed by economic cooperation, where military budgets are cut to ceremonial levels, where the wealth is at last available not only to tackle long-neglected evils at home but to pay for a genuine fight against poverty, injustices and ecological disaster in the rest of the world. * * * Genocide in Rwanda | 17 April 1994 edition Hundreds of thousands had already died in the bloody quarter-century of conflict between majority Hutus and minority Tutsis in Rwanda and Burundi. Then, on 6 April 1994, a plane crash killed the neighbouring countries\u2019 presidents, both Hutu \u2013 this became the flashpoint for a Hutu-led genocidal campaign against Tutsis (and moderate Hutus). Between 500,000 and a million people were slaughtered before the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front brought the worst of the violence to an end in July. Mark Huband\u2019s report from Kigali (first published in the Guardian on 12 April) covers the initial explosion of violence, in which 15,000 people were killed in just a few days as United Nations troops stood by. * * * Rwanda gripped by death By Mark Huband, Kigali A few yards from the French troops, a Rwandan woman was being hauled along the road by a young man with a machete. He pulled at her clothes as she looked at the foreign soldiers in the desperate, terrified hope that they could save her from her death. But none of the troops moved. \u201cIt\u2019s not our mandate,\u201d said one, leaning against his jeep as he watched the condemned woman, the rain splashing at his blue United Nations badge. The 3,000 foreign troops now in Rwanda are no more than spectators to the savagery which aid workers say has seen the massacre of 15,000 people \u2013 mainly from the traditionally dominant Tutsi minority. The killing started after President Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana and his Burundian counterpart \u2013 both from the majority Hutu tribe \u2013 died in a rocket attack on their plane last week while returning from peace talks. His presidential guard and the Hutu-dominated army unleashed a campaign of terror. Opposing them is the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front, dominated by Tutsis. The Belgian and French troops are here to get foreigners out. So far they have ferried about 1,000 from an assembly point at the French school to military aircraft. Rwandans, including staff of international organisations, are left to their fate. About 275 Rwandans staying in one hotel have been barred from leaving on European military aircraft, a Belgian Red Cross employee said yesterday. \u201cAll of them are Tutsi. They are going to be assassinated. It\u2019s disgusting that they don\u2019t take them. We are going to publish [their names] when we get to Belgium,\u201d he said, before being evacuated with his Rwandan wife. The splintering of the city between the RPF and different sections of the armed forces has perpetuated the anarchy. Evacuation convoys between the school and the French-controlled airport travel via muddy backroads to avoid the city centre which is -controlled by civilian and military bandits intent on killing and stealing from whoever falls into their hands. Less than a mile from the airport yesterday army trucks filled with foreign evacuees were blocked when they drove into a massacre where machete- and knife-wielding Rwandans lined the roads smiling as their victims lay dying. On the way to pick up the evacuees, the convoy had passed the bodies of two newly killed men sprawled in the muddy courtyard of a house. As the convoy returned past the same house less than an hour later, the body of a woman and two more men lay with the two already dead, their eyes wide open. The woman had had one of her legs cut off. Watching the convoy were the killers \u2013 young men, two women with clubs, old men and children. Close to one body stood a man with a clipboard in office clothes. Beside him stood a well-armed government soldier in smart uniform. At Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry school, French troops lay on the roof with guns trained on the deserted road outside as the names of evacuees were read out in the courtyard below. Halfway up a hill less than a mile away lay a pile of corpses. From nearby houses women, old and young, were casually led to the pile and forced to sit down on it. Men with clubs then beat the dead and dying bodies which surrounded the women as they sat, screaming, pleading for their lives. Suddenly the men turned on the women. They beat them until they no longer moved, then went to find more people to kill, within view of the school where the evacuees packed their children, pet dogs, teddy bears and suitcases into trucks. * * * \u2022 Part one: the Wall Street Crash to the Suez crisis \u2022 Part three: the 9/11 attacks to the election of Trump",

      "bodyText": "The government will be forced to explain the conduct of two of its senior ministers \u2013 Angus Taylor and Josh Frydenberg \u2013 in relation to critically endangered grasslands at the centre of an investigation involving companies part-owned by Taylor. A Greens motion to compel the explanation passed the Senate with support from Labor, Centre Alliance, One Nation and Jacqui Lambie on Thursday. During the next sitting period, the government\u2019s leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, will have to explain the actions of both ministers \u201cand how it is not a breach of the ministerial standards\u201d. He will also have to say whether there has been or will be an investigation into the conduct of Taylor and Frydenberg. Last month a Guardian Australia investigation revealed Taylor held talks with Frydenberg\u2019s office and senior environment department officials about the protection of the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands. At the time of the meetings, Taylor was the minister for cities and Frydenberg was the environment minister. The meetings were requested via Frydenberg\u2019s office. At the same time federal and state investigations were under way into the alleged poisoning of 30 hectares that contained the grassland on a property in the Monaro region of New South Wales owned by Jam Land Pty Ltd. One of the directors of that company is Richard Taylor, the minister\u2019s brother, and the minister himself holds an interest in the firm via his family investment company, Gufee. Emails obtained by Guardian Australia showed that Frydenberg\u2019s office raised the grasslands protection with the Department of the Environment and Energy on 8 March, a day after officials from the same department met Jam Land to discuss potential contraventions of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. An investigator from the unit that examines breaches under national environment law was also present at the meeting with Taylor and Frydenberg\u2019s office on 20 March 2017. After lobbying by Taylor, Frydenberg\u2019s office sought advice on whether protection of the grasslands could be watered down without first seeking the advice of the independent threatened species scientific committee, and whether this could be done secretly. The Greens had initially hoped to have both ministers examined through Rex Patrick\u2019s proposed inquiry into ministerial conduct, a vote on which has now been deferred until the next sitting period. But they have been unable to gain support from Labor for a number of amendments they proposed for that inquiry and instead moved a separate motion on Thursday. \u201cThere are serious questions ministers Taylor and Frydenberg need to answer about whether their behaviour complies with ministerial standards,\u201d the Greens\u2019 deputy leader, Larissa Waters, said. \u201cThe Greens motion means we will now get an explanation from the government\u2019s leader in the Senate about his cabinet colleagues\u2019 behaviour instead of the \u2018nothing to see here\u2019 we\u2019ve been getting from the PM on this issue.\u201d The Greens motion noted that ministers must \u201cmake arrangements to avoid conflicts arising from their private interests, also having regard to interests held by family members\u201d and they must \u201cnot use public office for private purposes\u201d. Taylor has repeatedly stated he asked for a briefing in his capacity as the member for Hume and the compliance action was not discussed. He said the purpose was to understand the technical aspects of the grasslands protection and its impact on his constituents. The natural temperate grassland of the south-east highlands is mainly found on the Monaro plains, which are not in Hume. However, some communities of the grassland are found in Taylor\u2019s electorate. Frydenberg has not answered questions put to him by Guardian Australia in recent weeks. He has provided a single statement saying Taylor sought a meeting to discuss the upgrading of the grasslands\u2019 status to critically endangered. \u201cFollowing the briefing and since, no changes to the listing have been made,\u201d he said. Taylor\u2019s sister-in-law, the NSW MP and minister Bronwyn Taylor, has also faced questions in the NSW parliament over whether she sought to influence the state government\u2019s submissions on the upgrading of the grasslands protection. Documents tabled in the NSW parliament last week revealed Bronwyn Taylor lobbied in a personal capacity the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage to drop a separate investigation into alleged illegal clearing of native grasslands on another property she owns with her husband, Duncan Taylor. The office ultimately found no evidence that the clearing was illegal.",

The national security legislation<strong> Peter Dutton</strong> wants has some committee work ahead of it as well.</p> <p>Beyond that?</p> <p>I guess we wait and see.</p> <p>The tax package will be

oil and gas industry is not a huge fan of Centre Alliance\u2019s gas plan.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>APPEA Chief Executive <strong>Andrew McConville </strong>said industry recognises its important role in supplying energy to Australians and the role a secure and competitive natural gas supply plays for households and businesses.</p> <p>\u201cThere have been numerous reforms to the gas market in recent years. Sensible reforms can improve the efficiency of the gas market and improve its operation,\u201d Mr McConville said.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, market interventions could adversely affect confidence in the oil and gas sector as well as discourage new market entrants and supply diversity.</p> <p>\u201cOngoing investment is crucial for economic growth and being able to fund the very tax cuts Federal Parliament is debating. Investment will only continue if businesses are confident they can manage the risk associated with the investment.</p> <p>\u201cThere is enough supply in the market, according to the Australian Energy Market Operator, so we see no need for changes to the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism (ADGSM) at this time. The ADGSM is up for a review in 2020 and the gas market transparency work will follow on from ACCC recommendations recently made public.\u201d</p> <p>The oil and gas industry \u2013 which underpins around 80,000 direct and indirect jobs \u2013 has recently announced billions of dollars in new investment to bring more gas into the market, supporting domestic gas consumption and gas export projects that are underpinning Australia\u2019s growth.</p> <p>\u201cToday, we have seen another new gas sales deal announced by the Australia Pacific LNG venture with manufacturers Orica and Orora. This highlights the importance of developing new gas resources and the response industry is taking to accelerate the delivery of more supply.</p> <p>\u201cThe new supply also adds to the significant number of new gas agreements announced in the past three years to domestic customers.\u201d</p> <p>Recently there have been announcements from Arrow Energy, Shell Australia, Senex, Cooper Energy, Strike Energy, GLNG and Santos to provide new supply in various parts of eastern Australia.</p> <p>Mr McConville said rather than intervention measures by government, the best way to put downward pressure on gas prices is more gas from more suppliers.</p> <p>\u201cMore gas supply into the Australian domestic market helps make a significant difference to the millions of homes and thousands of businesses that use gas,\u201d Mr McConville said. \u201cIncreasing supply should be the focus of government, industry and all Australian businesses that rely on sustainable gas supply.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-04T07:23:16.733Z\">at 8.23am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1da0b68f08efcbe532c884\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-04T06:46:38.722Z\">7.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ed Husic </strong>may not be on Twitter any more, so he\u2019s saving his social media burns for Instagram.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AmyRemeikis/status/1146671256755814400\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The BETRAYAL is real <a href=\"https://t.co/2AD37jA4wf\">pic.twitter.com/2AD37jA4wf</a></p>&mdash; Amy Remeikis (@AmyRemeikis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmyRemeikis/status/1146671256755814400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 4, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-04T07:24:09.503Z\">at 8.24am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1d9f5f8f0825326e4790b4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-04T06:42:06.666Z\">7.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On <strong>Samantha Maiden\u2019s</strong> New Daily story about <strong>John Setka\u2019s </strong>attempt to take the ALP to court over his forthcoming expulsion, <strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>says:<br></p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be advocating as a member of the Labor party after July 15.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-04T07:24:39.784Z\">at 8.24am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1d9f4f8f08efcbe532c87d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-04T06:40:25.696Z\">7.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Greens will call for a division on this vote, because it will want it on the record that Labor voted for this tax package. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d1d9ef78f08c35bf8032e63\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-04T06:39:54.362Z\">7.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cOur first priority, we have said very clear, is to ensure more money gets in the hands of workers,\u201d <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> says, on why Labor will vote for the whole package, even though it doesn\u2019t agree with the final stage. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-04T07:25:05.469Z\">at 8.25am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1d9e978f0825326e4790b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-04T06:38:41.517Z\">7.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cWhat we are saying is we will examine, just as the government will ...

We raised a number of issues, one of which was energy prices. That won\u2019t be surprising to Senator Wong; she knows that electricity prices in South Australia are the highest in the country. Senator Cormann then invited me to come across to Western Australia to sit down with Senator Canavan, which I did, and we started talking about ways in which gas prices in this country could be brought down. Senator Canavan brought to the table a whole range of things that he was already working on. We talked about a number of things that we thought would be useful. We\u2019ve had a dialogue backwards and forwards. It turns out some of the things that we thought might be useful can\u2019t be implemented because it wouldn\u2019t be lawful to do so, and some of the things that we have suggested be done can\u2019t technically be achieved; they don\u2019t actually give you the outcome that you want. So we\u2019ve had a running dialogue with the government over the last three or four weeks, going backwards and forwards, having conversations about the details. <strong>At the moment \u2013 and I\u2019m sure Senator Cormann will confirm this \u2013 they have a draft outline of how they want to approach things. It\u2019s not fully developed. </strong>As Senator Wong would know, having been a minister in government, tabling something or producing something that is not completed can actually be harmful. The government is still working through a whole range of options and it needs to do a whole bunch of checking-off on those options. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-04T06:03:38.769Z\">at 7.03am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1d930e8f08efcbe532c85c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-04T05:48:47.258Z\">6.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So back on the Senate tax debate, it seems that <strong>Jacqui Lambie</strong> is counting on good faith that something will happen, and Centre Alliance has been given some sort of draft \u2018we\u2019ll do something\u2019 from the government, but there are no guarantees and no official deals.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-04T05:50:53.847Z\">at 6.50am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1d92298f0825326e47908a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-04T05:45:24.508Z\">6.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">John Setka commences court action to stop Labor party expulsion \u2013 report</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Samantha Maiden</strong> at the New Daily published this just a short time ago:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Union leader <strong>John Setka </strong>has commenced court action to quash Anthony Albanese\u2019s attempt to expel him from the Labor Party, claiming it is illegal.</p> <p>Mr Setka claims the Labor leader\u2019s public statements confirming he will be expelled denied him due process and natural justice.

The exact date is going to court \u2013 might depend on the consultation that will happen between now leading up to December, indeed. It is always good to get a tipoff. It is the case that those surveys have been published, and they do indicate that this is an area that requires significant work. </p> <p>It is also the case that we must remember that Australia is consistently ranked by Transparency International as one of the least corrupt countries in the world, but we are committed, absolutely committed, absolutely committed to a commonwealth integrity commission. </p> <p>You will of course recall that on 13 December 2018 the prime minister and I announced the establishment of a commonwealth integrity commission, we released a very detailed public consultation paper with respect to the model that we have put forward. </p> <p>The model is one in two parts, where the law enforcement integrity division will have the same functions and powers as the current Australian commission for law enforcement integrity, but broader jurisdiction. The second, an entirely new part of the organisation, will be the public sector integrity division. That will investigate alleged criminal corruption involving the remainder of the public sector, including departments and their staff, parliamentarians and their staff, the staff of federal judicial officers and in appropriate circumstances recipients of commonwealth funds, and will have a very broad jurisdiction. </p> <p>It would not escape the member\u2019s notice that in the last budget the forward estimates now show $145.2m committed to this body, that is $104.5m of new funding and includes the existing budget of $40.7m. I might note in evidence of the commitment of the government to this organisation, that is funding well in excess of what members opposite had budgeted for their variant model of this body. During the consultation process that has happened so far, we have had 78 submissions and they were with respect to the very detailed draft discussion paper that we had out, the next part of this phase will be to take a basic drafting out and consult with a range of stakeholders and then of course cabinet, but we are totally committed to this.

The national drought fund was brought into this parliament before the election, it was the product of the national drought summit that was intended to provide ongoing permanent support to build drought resilience in this country.</p> <p>I hope the opposition now on the other side of the election will change their position and support this initiative. And provide a much-needed support and encouragement to people and families in rural and regional Australia, whether they are on the farm or living in farming communities, this parliament should support that initiative and the many other initiatives we brought to address the ongoing drought, Mr Speaker.</p> <p>The leader of the opposition interjects but, Mr Speaker, the leader of the opposition was part of the same shadow cabinet before the last election which voted against the national drought fund. They said they would oppose it, they were not supported. And they sent an appalling message. So, Mr Speaker, they may wish to reconsider that matter and I would ask the minister for water resources.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>David Littleproud:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let me go to the point around the water market. Obviously as I have got around and done meetings with irrigators up and down the basin in the north and south, one of the great concerns that I was hearing, particularly exacerbated by the drought, is the cost of water. Ninety three per cent of trades happen in the southern basin where a lot of the conjecture are. Fourteen per cent of those that own water licences don\u2019t own land. When state government separated water from land, I don\u2019t know whether that was the intent of where the market has evolved itself to now. So the government took swift action after listening to people on the ground. The real people. In farmers\u2019 sheds listening to their concerns.</p> <p>And I have now nearly finalised with the treasurer a terms of reference for the ACCC to get under the bonnet of the water market, to make sure that the original intent of how this market was created is still working, and that small farming families are not taken out of it. This is a responsible step to make sure that we understand the market if you are aware of what it was intended to be and we will make sure that the terms of reference are broad enough so that the ACCC can give confidence to everybody, the transparency that is required within this basic plan is seen through, and it states also...</p> </blockquote> <p>Albanese interrupts to say the question was very specific and Littleproud has not answered it.</p> <p><strong>Littleproud:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I will simplify it for the leader of the opposition. Within that 14% are international players. Not running away from that and that is why the ACCC will look at it. They will be taken into this inquiry by the ACCC. That 14% are part of the cohort we are looking at, they are responsible actions of a government that listens to the people, not just the bureaucrats, with those in the sheds and listen to real people.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-04T05:29:10.788Z\">at 6.29am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1d889f8f08efcbe532c83e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-04T05:05:26.660Z\">6.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> to <strong>Scott Morrison:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Will the prime minister work with me to work in a way that is consistent for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for mentioning the Constitution in a way that is consistent with the Uluru Statement from the Heart.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Morrison:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have discussed since the last election this matter. There is definitely a spirit of cooperation we are seeking to establish. When it comes to advancing these issues, we had the historic opening of this parliament, not only that the first cabinet minister to be an Indigenous Australian but the first minister was an Indigenous person in the unique opportunity that is presented by the fact that the shadow minister for Indigenous Australians is also an Indigenous Australian. </p> <p>This gives us a great opportunity and we should not limit our options and how we continue to progress this. The government endorsed the bipartisan Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition and we are going to continue to implement the outcomes of that report and the recommendations it provided. </p> <p>We have agreed to work together with the opposition to that end but to all parties, all members of this parliament and the other place, I would say that we are seeking a non-partisan perspective on this, not just a bipartisan one, and we welcome everyone to the table in seeking to advance this agenda and we have allocated $7.3m for a co-design process to include local and regional decision-making. </p> <p>We have set aside $160m in the contingency reserve for a future referendum once a model has been determined, so we are serious about progressing in this matter. The ultimate models and options that are considered by the government will be a process of this ongoing consultation for Indigenous Australians and the shadow minister. </p> <p>As important as this issue is, the priority for my government is addressing the terrible curse of Indigenous suicide. This is heartbreaking. The rates of Indigenous suicide in remote regional communities is just unthinkable but it is real. </p> <p>In the program as we have announced to address that, in the funding that we have provided, I know is supported by the opposition. </p> <p>I think also the former leader of the opposition.

Mr Speaker, business confidence has been restored as a result of the re-election of this government and the reason it was under threat was because of the prospect of a Labor government. </p> <p>If it\u2019s under threat, because of the biggest risk to the Australian economy, was those that sat opposite and the good grace and wisdom of the Australian people who go out everywhere. </p> <p>... In a note, Mr Speaker, whether it was on the retiree tax or the housing tax or the small business taxes and the plethora of taxes, they all remain the Labor party\u2019s policy. As I look down the front bench of the Labor party, I see the same old faces. </p> <p>The same old faces in the same old arrogance in the same old class envy in the same old smugness, which says we don\u2019t think Australians should keep more of what they earn. They think the answer to a stronger economy is higher taxes.</p> <p>The Australian people don\u2019t agree with them. They disagree with them and they voice their disagreement by telling them in the lowest primary vote for the Labor party in 100 years as sick to death of Labor seeking to kill aspiration in this country.</p> <p>This is a Labor party which has more in common with <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> than<strong> Paul Keating</strong>. </p> <p>Because we\u2019ve seen the Snapchat and Instagram posts, they are buddies in arms, all part of the new Labor agenda, which would take this country back decades and decades and decades. </p> <p>Our plan for a stronger economy was taken to the Australian people. The Australian people rejected this mob, Mr Speaker. They rejected them absolutely and with good cause because Labor\u2019s policies, which remain unchanged, are to undercut, to douse the aspiration of hard-working Australians. </p> <p>On this side of the house, we will always stand up for them and put forward policies that respect them and encourage them, while on that side Labor have learned absolutely nothing by their rejection at the last election.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Albanese:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I seek leave to table an article from Thursday 20 June 2019, ABC News, a growing number of small businesses struggling with economic downturn.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-04T04:58:14.427Z\">at 5.58am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1d83ce8f0825326e479063\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-04T04:45:33.436Z\">5.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Andrew Hastie </strong>gives us our first dose of \u2018just how safe are you\u2019 starring<strong> Peter Dutton</strong>, who surely has to be running out of steam on \u2018it\u2019s Labor\u2019s fault or Labor is best mates with the boogie man, don\u2019t cha know\u2019 now that he is about to enter his third term of government.</p> <p>Apparently not.</p> <p>He starts off by calling Hastie one of the \u201csmartest minds\u201d in the parliament on national security.</p> <p>He also talks about needing Labor to support the temporary exclusion laws \u2013 you know, the ones that are now super urgent, despite having been in the UK since 2015, when Dutton had been in the parliament for almost two years.

Because those on low and middle incomes spend money. When you don\u2019t have enough money to make ends meet, such as those on the piddling Newstart allowance, which passes as \u201cassistance\u201d in this country, you will spend every single extra cent you receive catching up, and paying for, you know, life.</p> <p>So that puts more money into the economy. Which is what the economy needs. It is why this tax plan is suddenly urgent, despite the hesitation over stage three, because the government really, really wants you to spend that $1,080 eligible earners will receive.</p> <p>Labor thinks raising Newstart should be looked at. The Greens want it raised by at least $75 a week. Other members of the crossbench are on board. The government is like ... maybe we\u2019ll look at it? But is not making any promises either way.</p> <p>And why is that?</p> <p>Because it has promised a surplus at a time when the national accounts are showing the slowest economic growth since the GFC. Iron ore prices are currently propping up the (operating) surplus, but even then, it\u2019s only $7bn. That is not a lot of money for an almost $2 trillion economy. That\u2019s a natural disaster or two in terms of spending.</p> <p>So the government can\u2019t commit to raising Newstart because that will hit the budget at a time where it\u2019s losing money to tax cuts, while also promising a surplus. It is pure politics, but it\u2019s also the reality. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-03T23:51:17.219Z\">at 12.51am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1d3bf58f08efcbe532c78a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-03T23:39:00.292Z\">12.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mathias Cormann</strong> has moved the hours motion \u2013 which basically moves the Senate agenda around, to clear the decks to get the tax debate done.

The head of the National Farmers\u2019 Federation, Fiona Simson, said a survey of members found single farm losses of up to $2m because of the shortage of labour. Basically, the fruit is rotting on the vines. From her statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Typically, international workers take up farm work via a Working Holidaymaker Visa (often used by backpackers) or the Seasonal Worker Programme, which provides employment opportunities to citizens of Pacific countries and Timor Leste.</p> <p>\u2018While both programmes are successful to an extent, they cannot adequately meet agriculture\u2019s labour needs, with only 12 per cent of the survey respondents using the Seasonal Worker Programme.<br></p> <p>\u2018Most farmers choose the allegedly easier, cheaper and less fraught employment option of hiring workers directly and one fifth said they prefer to use labour-hire contractors,\u2019 Ms Simson said.<br></p> <p>63 per cent of respondents opted to instead employ non-residents on their farms. Many said it was necessary because permanent residents were either not available in sufficient numbers, or found farm work too difficult or not to their liking.<br></p> <p>In fact, farmers found that non-residents were largely perceived as more reliable than permanent residents. <br></p> <p>\u2018This is mainly because farm work is labour intensive, not available all year around and therefore not suited to some Australian job seekers.<br></p> <p>\u2018Australian farmers are known to be fair employers and the stats show it, with almost all of the survey respondents paying their employees more than what\u2019s required by the applicable Award.<br></p> <p>\u2018Annual employment costs for most farmers range between $100,000 and $500,000 and in some cases almost $2 million,\u2019 Ms Simson said.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>Simson says an agriculture-specific visa would \u201cdiversify the countries from which workers can be sourced, and allow visa holders to move between different farm businesses \u2013 depending where and when the work is available\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s intended to complement the Working Holidaymaker Visa, the Seasonal Worker Programme and the many initiatives designed to see more Australians take up farm jobs.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-03T23:19:28.997Z\">at 12.19am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1d35848f08efcbe532c769\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-03T23:10:43.142Z\">12.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rex Patrick </strong>plans on moving his motion calling for an inquiry into <strong>Christopher Pyne\u2019s </strong>new job (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/04/palladium-aid-sector-concerned-about-rise-of-private-contractor-employing-julie-bishop\">and I guess Julie Bishop\u2019s as well</a>) at 11.45.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-03T23:17:44.332Z\">at 12.17am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1d34e68f0825326e478f80\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-03T23:06:22.473Z\">12.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At least someone is happy</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/auspolwatch/status/1146555414194139136\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">MathiasCormann liked this tweet: <a href=\"https://t.co/ctUKH0sDPy\">https://t.co/ctUKH0sDPy</a></p>&mdash; Auspolwatch (@auspolwatch) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/auspolwatch/status/1146555414194139136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 3, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d1d330a8f08c35bf8032d48\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-03T23:01:09.994Z\">12.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Why is what Labor will do in the tax bill important, considering its vote is meaningless, at least as far as the legislation matters?</p> <p>It\u2019s all about the next election.

That\u2019s one-third of the lowest that interest rates got during the global financial crisis. The greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</p> <p>The fact is that if a tax cut, by increasing the 37% threshold is good policy, from $90,000 to $120,000 in 2022, why isn\u2019t it good policy in 2019? The government should be supporting that amendment. </p> <p>And might I say \u2013 the crossbenchers are doing themselves a disservice if they don\u2019t support the separating out of stage three of the tax cuts. </p> <p>This has been a bluff by the government, saying, threatening to hold up tax cuts.

      "bodyText": "A big thank you to Mike Bowers and his work experience kid, Lyndal Curtis, as well as Sarah Martin and Katharine Murphy for dragging me across the line. A very big thank you to everyone who read along this week. I know it was a bit weird, given there were three days of ceremony, but it looks like the parliament is all back on track from now on. We\u2019ll be back with your usual general news updates from tomorrow, so stay tuned for the wrap up of tonight and the inevitable fallout. I hope you have a lovely few weeks, and stay warm. I was back home in Queensland recently and had to reach for a cardigan, so I mean that for everyone. Take care of you. And on that note, we are going to wrap up the blog. There is no parliament until 22 July, when both chambers will sit for two weeks. Now that tax is done, who the hell knows what the parliament will be talking about. The medevac repeal has been sent to committee until October. The national security legislation Peter Dutton wants has some committee work ahead of it as well. Beyond that? I guess we wait and see. The tax package will be legislated by next week, and the ATO has already said it will have the structures in place to pass on the first rebate \u2013 up to $1,215, depending on how much you earn \u2013 by next week. How Mike Bowers saw question time: Now the Senate hangs around until all the tax bill amendments are introduced, debated and then rejected, before getting to the vote, where it will pass. The royal assent will come pretty quickly after that and then BOOM \u2013 the entire tax package is legislated. Amanda Rishworth, who is about a million weeks pregnant, has been granted parental leave until 13 October. In the least surprising news since the cancellation of Lindsay Lohan\u2019s latest reality TV show, the oil and gas industry is not a huge fan of Centre Alliance\u2019s gas plan. APPEA Chief Executive Andrew McConville said industry recognises its important role in supplying energy to Australians and the role a secure and competitive natural gas supply plays for households and businesses. \u201cThere have been numerous reforms to the gas market in recent years. Sensible reforms can improve the efficiency of the gas market and improve its operation,\u201d Mr McConville said. \u201cHowever, market interventions could adversely affect confidence in the oil and gas sector as well as discourage new market entrants and supply diversity. \u201cOngoing investment is crucial for economic growth and being able to fund the very tax cuts Federal Parliament is debating. Investment will only continue if businesses are confident they can manage the risk associated with the investment. \u201cThere is enough supply in the market, according to the Australian Energy Market Operator, so we see no need for changes to the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism (ADGSM) at this time. The ADGSM is up for a review in 2020 and the gas market transparency work will follow on from ACCC recommendations recently made public.\u201d The oil and gas industry \u2013 which underpins around 80,000 direct and indirect jobs \u2013 has recently announced billions of dollars in new investment to bring more gas into the market, supporting domestic gas consumption and gas export projects that are underpinning Australia\u2019s growth. \u201cToday, we have seen another new gas sales deal announced by the Australia Pacific LNG venture with manufacturers Orica and Orora. This highlights the importance of developing new gas resources and the response industry is taking to accelerate the delivery of more supply. \u201cThe new supply also adds to the significant number of new gas agreements announced in the past three years to domestic customers.\u201d Recently there have been announcements from Arrow Energy, Shell Australia, Senex, Cooper Energy, Strike Energy, GLNG and Santos to provide new supply in various parts of eastern Australia. Mr McConville said rather than intervention measures by government, the best way to put downward pressure on gas prices is more gas from more suppliers. \u201cMore gas supply into the Australian domestic market helps make a significant difference to the millions of homes and thousands of businesses that use gas,\u201d Mr McConville said. \u201cIncreasing supply should be the focus of government, industry and all Australian businesses that rely on sustainable gas supply.\u201d Ed Husic may not be on Twitter any more, so he\u2019s saving his social media burns for Instagram. On Samantha Maiden\u2019s New Daily story about John Setka\u2019s attempt to take the ALP to court over his forthcoming expulsion, Anthony Albanese says: \u201cHe won\u2019t be advocating as a member of the Labor party after July 15.\u201d The Greens will call for a division on this vote, because it will want it on the record that Labor voted for this tax package. \u201cOur first priority, we have said very clear, is to ensure more money gets in the hands of workers,\u201d Anthony Albanese says, on why Labor will vote for the whole package, even though it doesn\u2019t agree with the final stage. \u201cWhat we are saying is we will examine, just as the government will ... [stage three],\u201d Anthony Albanese says. He thinks they are irresponsible, at this point, but won\u2019t make a formal decision on any part of stage three (there is a bit already legislated) for another three years. Anthony Albanese says Labor is saying \u201cvery clearly\u201d that at this stage it is against stage three, but the party will make a final decision on its position on that 2024 stage closer to the next election (in three years\u2019 time). So Labor is saying it will pass this whole package \u2013 even the bits it doesn\u2019t like \u2013 but reserves the right to possibly repeal the last stage. Meanwhile, the Law Council of Australia has welcomed some of the amendments the government will make to the temporary exclusion order legislation, at the behest of the intelligence committee. But it wants the bill reviewed again. From Arthur Moses: The TEO Bill has made some substantial amendments relating to the process for the making, varying and revoking of either a TEO or a Return Permit and in relation to the process of review through the establishment of a reviewing authority to review the making of a temporary exclusion order. Given the significance of these amendments, including around questions of possible constitutional validity of the new reviewing authority process, the Law Council calls on the Parliament to refer the amended Bill to the PJCIS for inquiry and report. This would help mitigate the chance of unintended consequences that could arise from the Bill in its current form. There are also several instances where PJCIS recommendations have either not been implemented or only partly implemented and the amendments need to be carefully scrutinised by the PJCIS regarding their adequacy to meet the initial concerns by the Committee. The official statement on that has just dropped: Labor\u2019s highest priority throughout this tax cut debate has been to get more money into the hands of more workers, sooner, to boost an economy which is floundering under the Liberals. We took to the election bigger, fairer tax cuts for people on low and middle incomes and after the election we proposed amendments which were all about passing the first two stages, bringing forward part of Stage Two, and removing Stage Three from the Bill. We fought hard for these responsible, sensible changes but ultimately they weren\u2019t supported in either House. The Government even voted against their own tax cuts being delivered sooner. When it became impossible to get everything we wanted, we had to prioritise what matters most. We will not oppose the passage of the legislation because we want to make sure Australians receive their tax cut now and that the benefits of the first stage start circulating through the economy and aren\u2019t further delayed. The Government\u2019s highest priority was to commit to a $95 billion tax cut in five years without revealing what they will cut to pay for it or knowing what the Budget and economy will look like at that point. We have argued that it is irresponsible to commit to Stage Three five years out, and that remains our view. A Government which has already broken its core election promise to introduce tax cuts by 1 July can hardly guarantee it will deliver more expensive tax cuts five years and five Budgets from now. We will review Stage Three closer to the next election and propose our own policies which take into account the economic and budget conditions at the time. So the short version of that \u2013 Labor will let the whole tax package go through when the amendments fail, so that the first two stages are legislated immediately. They will vote for it. Anthony Albanese began by talking about the amendments Labor wants on the tax bill \u2013 bringing stage two (already legislated) forward, bring forward infrastructure spending (a lot of it is happening in the forwards and beyonds) and delaying the third tranche of this part of the tax package (30% flat tax for those earning between $45,000 and $200,000 from 2024). Those amendments won\u2019t be going anywhere, because the crossbench has already come on board. And so, Albanese says, if not successful, Labor will \u201cnot oppose the package\u201d. It looks like Labor has come to a position on what to do with the tax cuts (it\u2019s just a political decision at this point). Jim Chalmers and Anthony Albanese will speak to the media in about 10 minutes. So if it\u2019s not a deal, what is it? Rex Patrick: We are now quite satisfied that the government is moving in a really good direction in relation to gas prices. That\u2019s the status of things. There is no written agreement that says, \u2018You do this, and we will support tax cuts.\u2019 I can absolutely assure you of that. There is a dialogue that\u2019s taken place, and there have been emails exchanged. There\u2019s a draft policy document, but, once again, it would be irresponsible to table something that is a draft and is not fully considered. Rex Patrick returned to the Senate chamber to try to explain what understanding Centre Alliance has struck with the government, given Mathias Cormann\u2019s insistence there was no written deal: I have heard what\u2019s been said in the chamber over the last 10 or 15 minutes. I\u2019ll just explain to you what has happened. Senator Cormann came down to Adelaide a few weeks ago and had a bit of a chat to us about things that were of concern to us. We raised a number of issues, one of which was energy prices. That won\u2019t be surprising to Senator Wong; she knows that electricity prices in South Australia are the highest in the country. Senator Cormann then invited me to come across to Western Australia to sit down with Senator Canavan, which I did, and we started talking about ways in which gas prices in this country could be brought down. Senator Canavan brought to the table a whole range of things that he was already working on. We talked about a number of things that we thought would be useful. We\u2019ve had a dialogue backwards and forwards. It turns out some of the things that we thought might be useful can\u2019t be implemented because it wouldn\u2019t be lawful to do so, and some of the things that we have suggested be done can\u2019t technically be achieved; they don\u2019t actually give you the outcome that you want. So we\u2019ve had a running dialogue with the government over the last three or four weeks, going backwards and forwards, having conversations about the details. At the moment \u2013 and I\u2019m sure Senator Cormann will confirm this \u2013 they have a draft outline of how they want to approach things. It\u2019s not fully developed. As Senator Wong would know, having been a minister in government, tabling something or producing something that is not completed can actually be harmful. The government is still working through a whole range of options and it needs to do a whole bunch of checking-off on those options. So back on the Senate tax debate, it seems that Jacqui Lambie is counting on good faith that something will happen, and Centre Alliance has been given some sort of draft \u2018we\u2019ll do something\u2019 from the government, but there are no guarantees and no official deals. Samantha Maiden at the New Daily published this just a short time ago: Union leader John Setka has commenced court action to quash Anthony Albanese\u2019s attempt to expel him from the Labor Party, claiming it is illegal. Mr Setka claims the Labor leader\u2019s public statements confirming he will be expelled denied him due process and natural justice. He says they pre-judged the outcome of the expulsion process. The New Daily has confirmed the CFMMEU leader issued legal proceedings in the Victorian Supreme Court on Thursday. Setka was to be expelled tomorrow when Labor\u2019s national executive met, but he asked for a delay \u2013 and was granted 10 days. So Labor won\u2019t consider this until 15 July. The tax debate has resumed in the Senate. It will go until it\u2019s passed, today. The many moods of question time, as performed by Anthony Albanese: There\u2019s been a bit of excitement over Cory Bernardi telling the ABC that \u201cthat is a safe bet\u201d in response to a question about him being unlikely to see out his Senate term. Bernardi has said repeatedly he would leave the Senate when he is 50. He turns 50 at the end of the year. He also confirmed what we reported yesterday \u2013 that his Senate spot would be likely to go to the Liberals. That\u2019s because he was elected as a Liberal. When he steps down, it goes back to them. The SA parliament technically sends the senator, but it\u2019s only been Joh Bjelke-Petersen who has ignored the will of the party. Shocking, I know. Scott Morrison told the chamber that Alek Sigley is now inside the Australian embassy in Beijing, effectively meaning he is on Australian soil. Question time ends. The Australian reported this: Centre Alliance has received a written guarantee outlining the Morrison government\u2019s gas policy, which the key minor party demanded in exchange for its support for the $158 billion personal income tax cuts package. The copy of the draft gas policy, which has been signed by the government, was given to Centre Alliance senators last night ahead of a crucial vote in the Senate today on the tax cut. Which Murray Watt just asked about in Senate question time: My question is to the minister representing the prime minister, Senator Cormann. I refer to breaking reports from The Australian that Centre Alliance has received a written guarantee outlining the Morrison government\u2019s gas policy. Does the written guarantee provide a guarantee that the price of gas will be reduced to $7 a gigajoule, as promised this morning by Senator Patrick? If so, will the minister be upfront with the Senate and undertake to table a copy of the written guarantee in this place? And Mathias Cormann denied: I think it\u2019s always prudent not to believe everything you read in the newspaper. Over in the Senate, Kimberley Kitching has been asking Mathias Cormann about when the prime minister decided to write to his head of department over Christopher Pyne\u2019s new job: KK: My question is to the minister representing the prime minister, Senator Cormann. Former minister for defence Christopher Pyne announced he had taken a position with EY stating that he was \u2018looking forward to providing strategic advice to Ernst &amp; Young as the firm looks forward to expanding its footprint in the defence industry\u2019. In response, the minister for trade, tourism and investment, Senator Birmingham, warned that everybody should adhere to that code of conduct, and that includes Christopher. I note the statement made by a minister, and to the Senate earlier today. When did the prime minister write to his secretary asking him to investigate Mr Pyne\u2019s employment with Ernst and Young? MC: As Senator Kitching has quite rightly outlined, the prime minister has written to Dr Parkinson in the terms I advised to the chamber earlier. In fact, he wrote to him on 3 July. KK: Senator Abbott has said: people do expect a standard from the ministers, and then former ministers, to ensure that that which they have learnt and gleaned from their ministerial roles are not imported into other roles on which they can potentially gain financially. Has the prime minister or his office discussed Mr Pyne\u2019s employment with EY with Mr Pyne? If so, when and with whom did the discussion take place? MC: I am aware of a public statement that former Minister Pyne issued in relation to some of these other matters. But I will take them on notice. But, as I have indicated to the Senate, the prime minister has written to Dr Parkinson seeking advice on these matters, as appropriate. And, as I have indicated to the chamber, we will provide an update on these matters in due course. KK: The Liberal member for Barker, Tony Pasin, has said: what I do know is the fact we are talking about it is indicative that it just doesn\u2019t pass the pump test. While the prime minister\u2019s secretary is investigating Mr Pyne\u2019s employment with Ernst &amp; Young, what arrangements are in place to ensure Mr Pyne does not take advantage of information obtained due to his former ministerial responsibilities? MC: There is absolutely no indication that former minister Christopher Pyne has or is acting in breach of the statement of ministerial standards, but the prime minister has sought advice in relation to these matters, as I have indicated to the chamber \u2013 KK: My question was not whether there had been a breach. My question was in relation to what arrangements are in place to ensure that there isn\u2019t one. MC: As I have indicated to the chamber, the prime minister sought advice from Dr Parkinson and I\u2019ll provide an update at the appropriate time. With that, I ask that further questions be placed on the notice paper. The government tries to take the question after Sharkie\u2019s, but the Speaker, Tony Smith, says he isn\u2019t interested in those games and hands it back to the leader of the opposition. Anthony Albanese: Why has the national economy fallen from the eighth fastest growing economy in the OECD when they were elected in 2013 to the 20th today? Morrison: I am pleased to see the leader of the opposition is being very inclusive with his new team today, very inclusive. Apparently they are a team of one on that side. A team of one. I suspect that speaks volumes about the support that the leader of the opposition. Mr Speaker, GDP growth, the growth of the economy today is stronger than every G7 economy except the United States. We are in the 28th year of uninterrupted growth. Our economy, when I was recently at the G20, is the economy that other world leaders want to know more about because of its success, and one of the reasons they want to know that is because 1.4 million jobs have been created on the watch of this government since we were first elected in 2013. Albanese interrupts with a point of order, but Smith says he believes the prime minister is in order \u2013 that there can be more than one reason. Morrison moves on to the Labor party being obsessed with tax. Tony Burke gets up for his first challenge of a ruling. Smith says he believes Morrison is in order. Morrison continues: The Australian people have had their say on the economy, and they voted with the Coalition. Rebekha Sharkie gets a question and it is on a federal integrity commission: My question is to the attorney general. A March 2019 poll by the Australia Institute found 80% of Australians support the establishment of a commission to prevent, investigate and expose corruption. Sixty seven per cent polled said they held a low to very low trust in politicians in our federal parliament. When will the government introduce legislation to create an integrity commission with real powers to reduce corruption and hopefully restore public trust in us in this chamber? Christian Porter: I thank the member for Mayo for her question and I am glad I asked who her second independent question was to come and when she said it was to me, that was very useful. The exact date is going to court \u2013 might depend on the consultation that will happen between now leading up to December, indeed. It is always good to get a tipoff. It is the case that those surveys have been published, and they do indicate that this is an area that requires significant work. It is also the case that we must remember that Australia is consistently ranked by Transparency International as one of the least corrupt countries in the world, but we are committed, absolutely committed, absolutely committed to a commonwealth integrity commission. You will of course recall that on 13 December 2018 the prime minister and I announced the establishment of a commonwealth integrity commission, we released a very detailed public consultation paper with respect to the model that we have put forward. The model is one in two parts, where the law enforcement integrity division will have the same functions and powers as the current Australian commission for law enforcement integrity, but broader jurisdiction. The second, an entirely new part of the organisation, will be the public sector integrity division. That will investigate alleged criminal corruption involving the remainder of the public sector, including departments and their staff, parliamentarians and their staff, the staff of federal judicial officers and in appropriate circumstances recipients of commonwealth funds, and will have a very broad jurisdiction. It would not escape the member\u2019s notice that in the last budget the forward estimates now show $145.2m committed to this body, that is $104.5m of new funding and includes the existing budget of $40.7m. I might note in evidence of the commitment of the government to this organisation, that is funding well in excess of what members opposite had budgeted for their variant model of this body. During the consultation process that has happened so far, we have had 78 submissions and they were with respect to the very detailed draft discussion paper that we had out, the next part of this phase will be to take a basic drafting out and consult with a range of stakeholders and then of course cabinet, but we are totally committed to this. This is something that absolutely has to be got right, it is detailed and the price of getting it wrong is to decrease public confidence in all of us and our civil service and we will not let that happen. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Given the severity of the drought, what is the Morrison government doing to address international regulators in the water market putting up the price of water for farmers? Morrison: Thank you. I will make a brief remark then hand over to the minister for water resources. The national drought fund was brought into this parliament before the election, it was the product of the national drought summit that was intended to provide ongoing permanent support to build drought resilience in this country. I hope the opposition now on the other side of the election will change their position and support this initiative. And provide a much-needed support and encouragement to people and families in rural and regional Australia, whether they are on the farm or living in farming communities, this parliament should support that initiative and the many other initiatives we brought to address the ongoing drought, Mr Speaker. The leader of the opposition interjects but, Mr Speaker, the leader of the opposition was part of the same shadow cabinet before the last election which voted against the national drought fund. They said they would oppose it, they were not supported. And they sent an appalling message. So, Mr Speaker, they may wish to reconsider that matter and I would ask the minister for water resources. David Littleproud: Let me go to the point around the water market. Obviously as I have got around and done meetings with irrigators up and down the basin in the north and south, one of the great concerns that I was hearing, particularly exacerbated by the drought, is the cost of water. Ninety three per cent of trades happen in the southern basin where a lot of the conjecture are. Fourteen per cent of those that own water licences don\u2019t own land. When state government separated water from land, I don\u2019t know whether that was the intent of where the market has evolved itself to now. So the government took swift action after listening to people on the ground. The real people. In farmers\u2019 sheds listening to their concerns. And I have now nearly finalised with the treasurer a terms of reference for the ACCC to get under the bonnet of the water market, to make sure that the original intent of how this market was created is still working, and that small farming families are not taken out of it. This is a responsible step to make sure that we understand the market if you are aware of what it was intended to be and we will make sure that the terms of reference are broad enough so that the ACCC can give confidence to everybody, the transparency that is required within this basic plan is seen through, and it states also... Albanese interrupts to say the question was very specific and Littleproud has not answered it. Littleproud: I will simplify it for the leader of the opposition. Within that 14% are international players. Not running away from that and that is why the ACCC will look at it. They will be taken into this inquiry by the ACCC. That 14% are part of the cohort we are looking at, they are responsible actions of a government that listens to the people, not just the bureaucrats, with those in the sheds and listen to real people. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Will the prime minister work with me to work in a way that is consistent for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for mentioning the Constitution in a way that is consistent with the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Morrison: We have discussed since the last election this matter. There is definitely a spirit of cooperation we are seeking to establish. When it comes to advancing these issues, we had the historic opening of this parliament, not only that the first cabinet minister to be an Indigenous Australian but the first minister was an Indigenous person in the unique opportunity that is presented by the fact that the shadow minister for Indigenous Australians is also an Indigenous Australian. This gives us a great opportunity and we should not limit our options and how we continue to progress this. The government endorsed the bipartisan Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition and we are going to continue to implement the outcomes of that report and the recommendations it provided. We have agreed to work together with the opposition to that end but to all parties, all members of this parliament and the other place, I would say that we are seeking a non-partisan perspective on this, not just a bipartisan one, and we welcome everyone to the table in seeking to advance this agenda and we have allocated $7.3m for a co-design process to include local and regional decision-making. We have set aside $160m in the contingency reserve for a future referendum once a model has been determined, so we are serious about progressing in this matter. The ultimate models and options that are considered by the government will be a process of this ongoing consultation for Indigenous Australians and the shadow minister. As important as this issue is, the priority for my government is addressing the terrible curse of Indigenous suicide. This is heartbreaking. The rates of Indigenous suicide in remote regional communities is just unthinkable but it is real. In the program as we have announced to address that, in the funding that we have provided, I know is supported by the opposition. I think also the former leader of the opposition. We\u2019ll continue to work each and every day. Towards zero. That must be our goal. The fact that young Indigenous Australians see taking their life as the way forward. There are the challenges of Indigenous education. These will always be front and centre in my government, our government and our parliament. Albanese: I think the prime minister for his answer, and thank him for the spirit in which he has reached out to the opposition to work particularly with the new minister, and I congratulate the minister for on his employment and shadow minister and I am sure they can advance in a united way and work together to try and achieve some outcomes for something that frankly has been intractable for a very long period of time, and I am sure that if this parliament, this 46th parliament can advance this agenda, both in terms of constitutional recognition and practical reconciliation, I think that would be a marvellous achievement. Someone just asked Stuart Robert a dixer, reminding us all of his existence. Moving on. And Scott Morrison\u2019s official statement: We are pleased to announce that Mr Alek Sigley has today been released from detention in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK). He is safe and well. Swedish authorities advised the Australian Government that they met with senior officials from the DPRK yesterday and raised the issue of Alek\u2019s disappearance on Australia\u2019s behalf. Earlier this morning we were advised that the DPRK had released Alek from detention, and he has now safely left the country. On behalf of the Australian Government, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to Swedish authorities for their invaluable assistance in securing Alek\u2019s prompt release. This outcome demonstrates the value of the discreet, behind the scenes work of officials in resolving complex and sensitive consular cases, in close partnership with other governments. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased that we not only know where Alek is, but that he is safe. The Senate has also acknowledged Alek Sigley\u2019s freedom: Marise Payne: Following from the prime minister\u2019s comments in the House of Representatives I am very pleased to advise the Senate that young Australian Mr Alek Sigley has today been released from detention in North Korea. He is safe and he is well. Swedish authorities advised the Australian government they met with senior officials from the DPRK yesterday and raised the issue of Alek\u2019s disappearance on Australia\u2019s behalf. Earlier today, we were advised the DPRK has released him from detention and he has now safely left the country. May I express our deepest gratitude to Swedish authorities for their prompt action to secure Alek\u2019s release. It does demonstrate the value of careful, behind-the-scenes work by officials in resolving cases like this in close partnership with other governments. I won\u2019t be making further comment out of respect for Alek\u2019s privacy and his family, but I can say his father has been advised. He is enormously relieved and grateful and has asked me to convey, the family has asked that we convey the thanks to everyone who has expressed support to them for the last few days. Penny Wong: On behalf of the opposition, can I welcome this announcement and share in the foreign minister\u2019s thanks to the Swedish authorities for their valuable work to secure Mr Sigley\u2019s release and also acknowledge all officers for their work. I thank the minister for her cooperation, and the approach the opposition takes, as you will have seen on public statement, is a bipartisan and public approach and we are very pleased this matter has been resolved satisfactorily. Tony Smith just told Angus Taylor that if he didn\u2019t know the answer to take it on notice. This is the greatest thing to happen this week. We are now 1.5 minutes into [the answer], and I say to the minister, he needs to address the specifics of the question. No longer address the general policy topic or simply wind up his answer or take it on notice. Taylor: We will continue to work for more affordable gas prices for Australians. Anthony Albanese offers to answer the question for Taylor, but sadly, Smith has to tell him that is not in the standing orders. Better than a shot of karsk. Angus Taylor takes this question for the prime minister: Have the government committed to gas prices of $7 per gigajoule or less for Australian households? He launches into some Angus Taylorisms on electricity, and Tony Smith is all \u2013 yeah, nah \u2013 stop talking about electricity, the question was on gas. Taylor is a Rhodes scholar don\u2019t ya know ladies and gentlemen. Michael McCormack was literally dancing in his seat as Scott Morrison gave that answer. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: The chief economist of the National Australia Bank has said we are getting readings that are basically as bad if not worse than the bottom of the GFC. What does that say about the economy on his watch, particularly for small business? Morrison: Mr Speaker, the National Australia Bank business survey that came out after the election saw business confidence rise seven points following the election and that is the largest single monthly increase since the time of the 2013 election. Mr Speaker, business confidence has been restored as a result of the re-election of this government and the reason it was under threat was because of the prospect of a Labor government. If it\u2019s under threat, because of the biggest risk to the Australian economy, was those that sat opposite and the good grace and wisdom of the Australian people who go out everywhere. ... In a note, Mr Speaker, whether it was on the retiree tax or the housing tax or the small business taxes and the plethora of taxes, they all remain the Labor party\u2019s policy. As I look down the front bench of the Labor party, I see the same old faces. The same old faces in the same old arrogance in the same old class envy in the same old smugness, which says we don\u2019t think Australians should keep more of what they earn. They think the answer to a stronger economy is higher taxes. The Australian people don\u2019t agree with them. They disagree with them and they voice their disagreement by telling them in the lowest primary vote for the Labor party in 100 years as sick to death of Labor seeking to kill aspiration in this country. This is a Labor party which has more in common with Jeremy Corbyn than Paul Keating. Because we\u2019ve seen the Snapchat and Instagram posts, they are buddies in arms, all part of the new Labor agenda, which would take this country back decades and decades and decades. Our plan for a stronger economy was taken to the Australian people. The Australian people rejected this mob, Mr Speaker. They rejected them absolutely and with good cause because Labor\u2019s policies, which remain unchanged, are to undercut, to douse the aspiration of hard-working Australians. On this side of the house, we will always stand up for them and put forward policies that respect them and encourage them, while on that side Labor have learned absolutely nothing by their rejection at the last election. Albanese: I seek leave to table an article from Thursday 20 June 2019, ABC News, a growing number of small businesses struggling with economic downturn. Andrew Hastie gives us our first dose of \u2018just how safe are you\u2019 starring Peter Dutton, who surely has to be running out of steam on \u2018it\u2019s Labor\u2019s fault or Labor is best mates with the boogie man, don\u2019t cha know\u2019 now that he is about to enter his third term of government. Apparently not. He starts off by calling Hastie one of the \u201csmartest minds\u201d in the parliament on national security. He also talks about needing Labor to support the temporary exclusion laws \u2013 you know, the ones that are now super urgent, despite having been in the UK since 2015, when Dutton had been in the parliament for almost two years. And the ones that the super smart Hastie-led committee only tabled recommendations for in April. Those super urgent laws. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Would an increase in the rate of Newstart stimulate consumer demand and economic activity and therefore jobs? \u201cYou voted against it,\u201d yells someone from the government \u2013 referring to Labor having voted against the motion in the Senate to raise the rate by $75 a week. Morrison: At the last election, we put forward very clearly our plans to ensure that we can boost the incomes of Australians on a priority provided for that was for working Australians through the delivery of tax relief. That was the priority we set out. The opposition at that election did not put forward any plans to increase the rate of Newstart. In fact, they never set out any potential cost that that might impose on the budget. It was not our plan to do that. It was our plan to continue to go through the six monthly indexation of such payments, Mr Speaker, and that is the process we will continue to follow in relation to those social security payments. So we have no plans to increase social security payments for Newstart beyond what is the normal six monthly indexation using the measures that are always in place, which is the same policy that was taken to the election by the Labor party. Labor committed to reviewing the payment, to see how it interacted with other payments (like rental assistance), before committing to any increase. Interesting move. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: What programs and services will be cut to fund stage three of the government\u2019s tax cuts? Morrison: None. That\u2019s not me being brief, that\u2019s the whole answer. \u201cOh well done,\u201d says some teacher\u2019s pet from the government benches. I guess there are some fairly low bars in this place, so answering a question is probably worthy of praise in that world. Angus Taylor is back, Angus Tayloring his way through a dixer. Which he has to read. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: did the prime minister tell voters that of the $18.75m set aside for a rural road, the first dollar won\u2019t be spent until 2026? Morrison, after talking about the \u201csmugness\u201d of the Labor party, and referencing its lowest primary vote in 100 years (the Coalition received it\u2019s third \u2013 very close to the second \u2013 worst primary vote in about the same time frame) says it was in the budget papers. I think Rob Mitchell just became the first MP thrown out under section 94a. Ken O\u2019Dowd inflicts Michael McCormack on us with a dixer. It is like heading to the breakfast buffet and discovering it is only continental. Scott Morrison: Swedish authorities advised they met with senior officials with the DPRK and raise the issue of Alek\u2019s disappearance. We were advised that the DPRK have released him from detention and he has safely left the country and I can confirm that he has arrived safely. On behalf of the Australian government I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to the Swedish authorities for their invaluable assistance in securing Alek\u2019s prompt release, which demonstrates the value of discreet behind-the-scenes work by officials in solving sensitive consular cases in close partnership with other governments. I\u2019m sure we all could not be more pleased. We know where he is now safe. Anthony Albanese: I join with the prime minister in welcoming this announcement and thank him for yesterday the private discussion that we had again discreetly talking about this very issue. I\u2019d also like to add our thanks to the Swedish authorities. ... Indeed it is good news for our nation. Angus Taylor, the minister for emissions reduction, and maybe lowering electricity prices, is taking a question from Adam Bandt, giving Labor its first happy moment of the parliament. \u201cFantastic job, Angus, well done,\u201d the Labor benches are yelling. Anthony Albanese has the next question for Scott Morrison, with a question on deeming rates: when was the last time it changed? When Morrison was social services minister, apparently, but it is under review. We have had a consistency in cash rate positions for some time, and it has been a record for the consistency of cash rate. There have been two changes to the cash rates most recently and that is what prompted the minister for social services by encouragement to bring forward a submission to the ERC and asked the Department of Social Services to review the deeming rate once again. That matter will be considered by ERC in the normal course of events, it will be done so responsibly and in accordance with the government\u2019s overall fiscal strategy. Nicolle Flint, who has lost her prime position behind the despatch box and is now banished to the same bench as Kevin Andrews and Ian Goodenough at the back, has the next dixer. It\u2019s about the amazing surplus, and gives Josh Frydenberg a chance to once again say the budget is \u201cback in the black and back on track\u201d, and my eyes roll down my spine and into the courtyard below. Anthony Albanese is back: Would a tax cut at just over $1,000 a year for a pharmacy worker in my electorate have more of a positive impact if the penalty rate cut the prime minister supports wasn\u2019t taking more than $5,000 a year off the same worker? Scott Morrison: The government endorses the industrial arrangements put in place by the Fair Work Commission that were introduced by those opposite, Mr Speaker, when Labor supported the independence of the Fair Work Commission to consider matters and to come to judgments. We do not believe the politicians should set people\u2019s wages, we believe that should be done through the fair and transparent process that provides the certainty for investment and engagement in the national economy. It would seem that the leader of the opposition may have changed names but the same old class warfare he is seeking to perpetuate in this place is all just the same. BIG news if true: The member for Bass, Bridget Archer, gets the first dixer. It includes the term \u201caspiration\u201d. I will continue my tradition of not transcribing the dixers*, unless they include actual information not found in a press release. #deathtodixers *And yes, I would have done this for a Labor government as well. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison with a short and quick first question: Which of his policies on wages, consumer demand, interest rates and productivity is working the best? Morrison: All of them are all working together, and all by the Australian people at the last election for the economic plan that we took to this country. We took to this country, Mr Speaker, to address the serious economic challenges that the country faces, Mr Speaker, and I can tell you the biggest rift to the domestic economy in this country that presented itself this year was relegated at the last election with the defeat of the Labor party, Mr Speaker. This was a Labor party that at the last election achieved, Mr Speaker... Albanese jumps up to say: As you will appreciate, increasingly as time goes on, no preamble, no rhetoric, just a simple question for which of the economic indicators does the prime minister think is working the best? Morrison repeats: \u201cAll of them.\u201d Then he moves on to talk about jobs, jobs, jobs. Claressa Surtees, the current deputy clerk of the House of Representatives, will be the new clerk when David Elder finishes up in August. Surtees will be the first female clerk in the Australian House of Reps. The government will be forced to explain to the Senate the conduct of senior ministers Angus Taylor and Josh Frydenberg and whether discussions over critically endangered grasslands breached ministerial standards. The Greens and Labor have accused both ministers of misconduct over meetings between Taylor and Frydenberg\u2019s office in 2017, when Taylor was the minister for cities and Frydenberg the minister for environment. A Greens motion calling for an explanation during the next sitting period from the government\u2019s leader in the Senate, Mathias Corman, has passed the Senate. A Guardian Australia investigation revealed Taylor sought and received a meeting with Frydenberg\u2019s office and senior environment officials to discuss critically endangered grasslands that were at the centre of an investigation into alleged illegal landclearing by a company he holds an interest in. An investigator from the unit examining the case was also present at the meeting in March 2017. Following lobbying by Taylor, Frydenberg\u2019s office sought advice from the environment department as to whether protection of the grasslands could be weakened and kept secret. There is a moment of condolence for Bob Hawke to begin. And then we are under way. Angus Taylor, the minister for lowering electricity prices \u2013 as dubbed by the prime minister \u2013 has told Sydney radio 2GB \u201cwe never said that\u201d. Talking to Steve Price about the price cap for standing offers which came into effect on 1 July, Taylor said that will bring down prices. Price asked whether that is really feasible \u2013 to get everyone\u2019s rate and then use that to bargain with their providers. \u201cYour promise was to lower energy prices, your promise wasn\u2019t to ring around,\u201d Price said. \u201cThe more you do it, you\u2019ll tend to get a better price,\u201d says Taylor. That led to this exchange: AT \u201cIf you ring up and ask for a better price, you should be able to get one. There\u2019s lots of ways of doing that.\u201d SP \u201cBut you told us you\u2019d do that!\u201d AT: \u201cWell, no, we never said that, Steve.\u201d SP: \u201cYou were painted as the minister for bringing down electricity prices by your own prime minister!\u201d AT: \u201cYeah absolutely, and you will see standing offers reduced from the 1st of July. And I say, if there are people who haven\u2019t seen those reduced, we would like to hear about it.\u201d Don\u2019t worry, though, Taylor says this is just the \u201cfirst of many\u201d measures the government is looking at. In the Senate, both Labor and the Coalition just voted down Rachel Siewert\u2019s motion to increase Newstart by $75 a week. The first question time for the 46th parliament is about to get under way. May Rihanna have mercy on our souls. Too busy for definite articles, apparently: Dispatches from the Senate: Things are going great: Told you there were faces: As well as attempts made at sentences. I\u2019m told that the Senate vote on Kristina Keneally\u2019s press freedom vote came down to this: Ayes - Labor, Centre Alliance, the Greens. Noes - Coalition, Cory Bernardi, Jacqui Lambie. One Nation abstained. Just caught Janet Rice making faces as Malcolm Roberts stood up and tried making sentences in the Senate. It\u2019s going to be that sort of parliament. Labor did not get the numbers to set up a separate press freedom inquiry \u2013 this is one that would have included the crossbench and would have been a lot more wide ranging than just national security. The New Daily published this, this morning: Agriculture Minister Bridget McKenzie charged taxpayers more than $500,000 to relocate her electorate office 300 kilometres from Bendigo to Wodonga before the election. Figures obtained by The New Daily show the bulk of the charges came from beautifying and remodelling the new digs, and also included $6026 for what was described only as a \u201cfolding machine bench\u201d. The office move parachuted the Victorian senator into the heart of the marginal lower house seat of Indi, then represented by independent MP Cathy McGowan, intensifying speculation at the time that Ms McKenzie was weighing up a tilt at a House of Representatives spot and a possible party leadership challenge. Senator McKenzie, whose senate term ends in 2022, eventually decided against the election gamble, and independent Helen Haines went on to win Indi with a margin of 2816 votes. Senators can locate their offices anywhere they want within the state they represent. McKenzie hasn\u2019t given up on her lower house ambitions (makes it easier to be deputy prime minister, you see) and that was effectively the only reason for this move. Mehreen Faruqi has introduced a bill in the Senate to ban live exports: \u201cLive export cannot be made safe for sheep, cattle or any animal. It is a business model built on cruelty and is simply incompatible with animal welfare. \u201cThe Greens have long argued that we should ban all live export for slaughter and introducing this bill is part of the campaign to make that a reality. \u201cWe make no apologies for standing up for the welfare of animals. We need a phased ban with a structural adjustment assistance fund which can transition the industry to the chilled meat trade. \u201cThe Government and the industry think our outrage will die down and we will become silent about the abomination and cruelty of live exports. The people of Australia have been steadfast in their compassion for animals and their welfare and we won\u2019t stop until the live export industry is consigned to the dustbin of history.\u201d There is not a lot of support for this, and certainly not in the House. So I think you know where this will end up. The Senate \u2013 Labor, Greens and enough of the crossbench \u2013 have just agreed to this motion from Kristina Keneally: Mr President I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move that there be laid on the table by the minister representing the minister for home affairs, by no later than 12pm on 23 July 2019, the following documents: 1. Any correspondence, emails, and notes of discussion between the Department of Home Affairs and; a. Paladin, including Paladin Holdings Pte. Ltd., Paladin Solutions Group, Paladin Group Australia or Paladin Australia Pte. Ltd., and any individuals either employed by, or holding a financial interest in, Paladin. i. In particular, any correspondence, emails, and notes of discussion that include Mr Dermot Casey. b. NKW Holdings, including NKW Holdings Australia Pte. Ltd, and any individuals either employed by, or holding a financial interest in, NKW. 2. Any formal contracts between the Department of Home Affairs and any of the above-mentioned companies to provide services in Papua New Guinea or Manus Island, with commercially sensitive information redacted. 3. Any reports prepared by external auditors, particularly Ernst and Young (EY) or KPMG, regarding operations undertaken by the above-mentioned companies, or the tendering process that secured those services, with commercially sensitive information redacted. 4. Any formal briefings, talking points, or question time briefings prepared by the Department of Home Affairs in relation to the performance or activities of any of the above-mentioned companies, or the tendering process that secured those services. The MP who told us House MPs were paid fortnightly instead of monthly may not actually need to check their bank account (probably should have expected that) because apparently there are a bunch of House MPs out there who are also paid monthly. All I know is that they earn a lot more than me. And that for some of them don\u2019t know when they get paid, but I guess the paycheck to paycheck lifestyle isn\u2019t much of a thing for the 1% So it\u2019s not a \u2018no\u2019 on the inquiry into Christopher Pyne and Julie Bishop\u2019s new jobs, given they were ministers about two seconds ago, but it\u2019s a let\u2019s wait and see what the prime minister\u2019s department says. The next sitting day is not until 22 July. Rex Patrick has delayed entering in his motion calling for an inquiry into Christopher Pyne\u2019s job with EY because Mathias Cormann has announced that Scott Morrison has written to Martin Parkinson (head of Prime Minister and Cabinet) seeking advice over whether there is any breach of standards. \u201cI have therefore postponed my motion to the next sitting day,\u201d Patrick said. Fun fact \u2013 House of Representatives MPs get paid fortnightly, and senators get paid monthly. If you see a senator with their credit card out, it is because they won\u2019t get paid until the end of the month. #thoughtsandprayers I am having massive John Howard DJ meme flashbacks Annnnnd the Ensuring Integrity bill is back in the House. This has also been introduced: The Morrison government is today delivering on its election commitment to protect the privacy of Australian farmers and primary producers by introducing legislation to protect them from the unlawful actions of animal activists. The Criminal Code Amendment (Agricultural Protection) bill 2019 introduces new offences for the incitement of trespass, property damage, or theft on agricultural land. Attorney general Christian Porter said incidents of trespass by animal activists, such as those we saw earlier this year, have impacted on Australian farmers and their businesses, prompting this stronger action to deter those who incite this behaviour. \u2018There must be consequences for this unacceptable behaviour,\u2019 the attorney general said. \u2018Farmers should not be subjected to the illegal invasion of their property and their privacy. \u2018The bill introduces serious criminal penalties to ensure that farmers and their families are protected, with offenders facing up to five years\u2019 imprisonment. \u2018The bill includes exemptions for journalists and whistle-blowers who expose instances of animal cruelty. \u2018The bill also covers other private agricultural businesses such as fishers and foresters.\u2019 Peter Dutton is introducing the bill to repeal medevac, which he says was just a bid to win green voters at the last election, and is not needed. He\u2019s saying the medevac law failed to include any provisions to return refugees or asylum seekers to a regional processing centre. Probably worth mentioning that during Senate estimates we learned that the vast majority of people who have been transferred to Australia for medical treatment, even before these laws were in place, are still here. The 46th parliament may have just begun \u2013 and Scott Morrison\u2019s win is still being digested by a lot of people within the Labor caucus (and beyond) but independent crossbencher Andrew Wilkie has been around long enough that he is keeping an eye on the future. And that future includes a reminder that the government holds just 77 seats. Which, with the Speaker, is a one-seat majority \u2013 exactly where it was following the 2016 election. He told Sky News he believes Morrison is just as aware of the precarious nature of a slim majority. \u201cThe numbers are still pretty tight,\u201d he said. \u201cJust that one bad byelection would mean the government would have to rely on the casting vote of the Speaker.\u201d Wilkie also said Morrison invited the crossbench to his office for a drink last night. Barnaby Joyce is speaking on Sky about the need to do something about water \u2013 and the need to build dams. Goodness. If only he had been in a position to do something about this at some point in time. Like, if he had been deputy prime minister? And the leader of the Nationals? And a longterm parliamentarian? It\u2019s incredible how these are all fairly recent issues. *thinking face emoji* Lyndal Curtis is back in the House, following along as Mike Bower\u2019s \u201cwork experience kid\u201d. It\u2019s a joke that, as two of the longest serving gallery members, they like to share. You get to reap the benefits though, as Lyndal practices her photography. Listening to the chambers, it seems like you are going to hear this phrase over and over and over and over again from Labor: \u201cthis third-term government\u201d. Why? Because it is trying to counter the feeling that Scott Morrison\u2019s win is a fresh start \u2013 and a first-term government. Will it work? Given how little actual attention most people pay to politics, no, it probably won\u2019t. Maiden speeches have begun in the House of Representatives. The new LNP MP for Herbert, Phil Thompson, is up first. The tax debate has started in the Senate. It will go on until 11.45am, when the notices of motion pop up. That will go for an hour. Then it\u2019s back to tax. Then question time at 2pm. Then back to tax at 3.30pm until the bitter end. There are a lot of noises about \u201clet\u2019s look at raising Newstart\u201d happening again. As we explained yesterday, even the RBA (indirectly) and the business community (directly) are on board. Because those on low and middle incomes spend money. When you don\u2019t have enough money to make ends meet, such as those on the piddling Newstart allowance, which passes as \u201cassistance\u201d in this country, you will spend every single extra cent you receive catching up, and paying for, you know, life. So that puts more money into the economy. Which is what the economy needs. It is why this tax plan is suddenly urgent, despite the hesitation over stage three, because the government really, really wants you to spend that $1,080 eligible earners will receive. Labor thinks raising Newstart should be looked at. The Greens want it raised by at least $75 a week. Other members of the crossbench are on board. The government is like ... maybe we\u2019ll look at it? But is not making any promises either way. And why is that? Because it has promised a surplus at a time when the national accounts are showing the slowest economic growth since the GFC. Iron ore prices are currently propping up the (operating) surplus, but even then, it\u2019s only $7bn. That is not a lot of money for an almost $2 trillion economy. That\u2019s a natural disaster or two in terms of spending. So the government can\u2019t commit to raising Newstart because that will hit the budget at a time where it\u2019s losing money to tax cuts, while also promising a surplus. It is pure politics, but it\u2019s also the reality. Mathias Cormann has moved the hours motion \u2013 which basically moves the Senate agenda around, to clear the decks to get the tax debate done. The Senate will sit until the legislation is passed. That is an inevitability, but there will be a lot of \u201cwe don\u2019t like stage three, hopefully we can repeal it\u201d from one side, and a lot of \u201chow good is tax cuts\u201d from the other before we get to that point. The bells are ringing \u2013 it is all about to begin. That agricultural visa is not a new issue. It\u2019s been kicking around since just after the Coalition was elected in 2013. And still, no ag-visa. Or workable solution. Again, if only there was a party dedicated to representing farmers\u2019 interests in this place. Farmers still want an agricultural visa to deal with work shortages. The head of the National Farmers\u2019 Federation, Fiona Simson, said a survey of members found single farm losses of up to $2m because of the shortage of labour. Basically, the fruit is rotting on the vines. From her statement: Typically, international workers take up farm work via a Working Holidaymaker Visa (often used by backpackers) or the Seasonal Worker Programme, which provides employment opportunities to citizens of Pacific countries and Timor Leste. \u2018While both programmes are successful to an extent, they cannot adequately meet agriculture\u2019s labour needs, with only 12 per cent of the survey respondents using the Seasonal Worker Programme. \u2018Most farmers choose the allegedly easier, cheaper and less fraught employment option of hiring workers directly and one fifth said they prefer to use labour-hire contractors,\u2019 Ms Simson said. 63 per cent of respondents opted to instead employ non-residents on their farms. Many said it was necessary because permanent residents were either not available in sufficient numbers, or found farm work too difficult or not to their liking. In fact, farmers found that non-residents were largely perceived as more reliable than permanent residents. \u2018This is mainly because farm work is labour intensive, not available all year around and therefore not suited to some Australian job seekers. \u2018Australian farmers are known to be fair employers and the stats show it, with almost all of the survey respondents paying their employees more than what\u2019s required by the applicable Award. \u2018Annual employment costs for most farmers range between $100,000 and $500,000 and in some cases almost $2 million,\u2019 Ms Simson said. Simson says an agriculture-specific visa would \u201cdiversify the countries from which workers can be sourced, and allow visa holders to move between different farm businesses \u2013 depending where and when the work is available\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s intended to complement the Working Holidaymaker Visa, the Seasonal Worker Programme and the many initiatives designed to see more Australians take up farm jobs.\u201d Rex Patrick plans on moving his motion calling for an inquiry into Christopher Pyne\u2019s new job (and I guess Julie Bishop\u2019s as well) at 11.45. At least someone is happy Why is what Labor will do in the tax bill important, considering its vote is meaningless, at least as far as the legislation matters? It\u2019s all about the next election. And while that is a good three years away now, the decision Labor makes will impact what it decides to do in the next term, if there is a change of government. Repealing a tax cut you helped legislate is not a great sell, politically. Hence the wringing of hands within caucus. But then to vote for it is to overturn six years of policy foundation. To not vote for it means not voting for stage one and two, which everyone is in agreement about. Cool beans. Here is all the legislation the government plans on introducing into the House of Reps today: Criminal Code Amendment (Agricultural Protection) Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment (Ensuring Integrity) National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Crimes Legislation Amendment (Police Powers at Airports) Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Amendment (Sunsetting of Special Powers Relating to Terrorism Offences) Migration Amendment (Repairing Medical Transfers) Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) (Consequential Amendments) Migration Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing Cohort) Higher Education Support (Charges) Higher Education Support (Cost Recovery) Water Amendment (Indigenous Authority Member) Farm Household Support Amendment Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendment Passenger Movement Charge Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Single Treatment Pathway) Migration Amendment (Streamlining Visa Processing) Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test) Treasury Laws Amendment (Combating Illegal Phoenixing) Treasury Laws Amendment (2018 Measures No. 2) Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Multinationals Pay Their Fair Share of Tax in Australia and Other Measures) Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Members\u2019 Interests First) Customs Amendment (Immediate Destruction of Illicit Tobacco) The ones in bold are Peter Dutton specials. You may have noticed medevac on that list. There is no way on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s green earth that will hit the Senate today. Mostly because it\u2019s a bit awks, the government just having struck a deal with Centre Alliance, which is against repealing medevac. But if the government left repealing medevac off the list, then it would have to explain why it is off the list. So it\u2019s more of a \u201chere-it-is-please-ignore-it-for-now-please-and-thank-you\u201d. But it\u2019s a-comin\u2019. Basically, the Senate is where it is at today. It\u2019s not often I write that sentence. There\u2019s also this today. From Katharine Murphy: Labor will move a motion calling on Scott Morrison to take appropriate action against Christopher Pyne and Julie Bishop for taking commercial appointments immediately after leaving politics. The Labor motion is in addition to a separate proposal from the Centre Alliance to establish a Senate inquiry into compliance with ministerial standards, triggered by the controversy around the former defence minister\u2019s decision to take a position with consulting giant EY to help the consulting group expand its defence business. The motion, to be debated on what is expected to be a gruelling Senate sitting day to consider the Morrison government\u2019s $158bn tax package, seeks information on when Morrison became aware that his former colleagues had accepted the roles with EY and in Bishop\u2019s case, a job on the board of international consultancy firm Palladium, and what action he has taken in response. If an answer isn\u2019t forthcoming, the motion requires the government Senate leader, Mathias Cormann, to provide an explanation. Mathias Cormann is very \u201cgrateful\u201d to Cory Bernardi, Jacqui Lambie, Rex Patrick and Stirling Griff. He who said he would not deal on this previously will not go into the details of the deal he struck with the crossbenchers, although Lambie already confirmed a deal had been made. Everyone across that? We\u2019re always prepared to discuss with non-government senators policy issues of concern to them and their constituents. And we\u2019re always prepared to consider the issues they raise with us, and make judgments as appropriate. But these judgments have to be made on their own merit. Today is about income tax relief for millions of hardworking Australians. The issues that have been raised with us, we will deal with in good time. But what I can say to you today is that, while the Labor party was engaged in political games and division, I mean, even in petty student political games, like moving amendments to the title of the bill in the House of Representatives. I mean, what were they thinking? And while the crossbench which is about to pass stage three of the tax cuts is uncomfortable with stage three of the tax cuts, all those who are iffy on them can agree on is that they are not great. It\u2019s like marrying someone you\u2019re just OK with by hoping they\u2019ll improve (spoiler \u2013 they don\u2019t). Everyone is cool friends. Jim Chalmers spoke to ABC TV this morning but didn\u2019t give any indication of how Labor plans to move forward after its amendments fail: We will attempt to get our amendments supported in the Senate. Those amendments are about the things that I\u2019ve been talking about, including trying to take stage three out of the tax package, because it does saddle the government with a massive cost. The government fails to predict how the economy will be travelling five minutes from now. The idea that they\u2019ll know what the budget and economy will look like in five years is absurd. Oh, and the media bosses had a chat with Christian Porter and Paul Fletcher late yesterday \u2013 tl;dr, nothing has changed. We had a constructive discussion with Attorney-General Christian Porter and Minister for Communications Paul Fletcher today but we remain frustrated that a month after search warrants were carried out by the Australian Federal Police the fate of our journalists remains unclear. While our strong preference was for immediate action rather than inquiries, we will engage with any processes that seek to address the issues we have raised. We will continue to push for real outcomes that strengthen the Australian public\u2019s fundamental right to know. We have committed to making further direct submissions both on the fate of our journalists and on the specific areas where freedom of the press has been eroded and we have agreed to meet with the Attorney-General and Minister for Communications again in three months\u2019 time. We stressed in today\u2019s meeting the importance of the Federal Government taking a leadership position on the public\u2019s right to be informed and to set the tone for a less secret and more open democracy. This statement is attributable to David Anderson, ABC Managing Director, on behalf the joint media organisations that met with Mr Porter and Mr Fletcher today. The organisations were: the ABC, Nine, News Corp, Free TV, SBS and Seven West Media. Rex Patrick will also move this motion: (1) That the Senate notes \u2014 (a) the Prime Minister\u2019s Statement of Ministerial Standards of 30 August 2018, at paragraph 2.25 concerning post-ministerial employment, states that \u201cMinisters are required to undertake that, for an eighteen month period after ceasing to be a Minister, they will not lobby, advocate or have business meetings with members of the government, Parliament, public service or defence force on any matters on which they have had official dealings as Minister in their last eighteen months in office. Ministers are also required to undertake that, on leaving office, they will not take personal advantage of information to which they have had access as a Minister, where that information is not generally available to the public\u201d; (b) that Mr Christopher Maurice Pyne served as the Minister for Defence Industry from 19 July 2016 to 28 August 2018, and as the Minister for Defence from 28 August 2018 to 11 April 2019; (c) that Mr Pyne has taken employment with consulting firm EY and that, in his own words, he is \u201clooking forward to providing strategic advice to EY, as the firm looks to expand its footprint in the defence industry\u201d; (d) that media reports indicate that AusTender government contract notices show that over the past four years EY has secured over 830 contracts with the Australian Government worth more than $370 million, including 138 contracts with the Department of Defence worth $148 million; (e) that EY has publicly identified the Australian Government\u2019s investment in new defence capabilities, including the future submarines project and the future frigate project as major business opportunities; (f) EY\u2019s statement that Mr Pyne will help build EY\u2019s defence-related business in South Australia and elsewhere, including helping to \u201clead conversations about what all states need to do to meet the challenges and opportunities this defence investment will bring\u201d; (g) EY\u2019s subsequent statement that Mr Pyne \u201cwill not be lobbying or meeting with public sector MPs, public service or defence in his EY role\u201d and that he will be \u201csupporting the private sector side of the business\u201d; and (h) Mr Pyne\u2019s further statement that he intends \u201cto ensure that anyone I provide advice to has rigorous processes and procedures in place to ensure that I am not put in a position where the Ministerial Code might be breached\u201d. (2) That the following matter be referred to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee for inquiry and report by 10 September 2019: (a) compliance by former Ministers of State with the requirements of paragraph 2.25 of the Prime Minister\u2019s Statement of Ministerial Standards, dated 30 August 2018, including, but not limited to the undertakings given by Ministers to comply with their obligations concerning post-ministerial employment, and action taken by the Prime Minister and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to ensure full compliance by former Ministers with paragraph 2.25 of the Ministerial Standards; and (b) any related matters. The Senate will sit at 9.30, where the first order of business is an hours motion from the government \u2013 essentially setting up the day for the Senate to sit for as long as it takes to pass the tax cuts. Given that the crossbench is now on board, that will get the go-ahead, and then we will have a lot of speeches before the inevitable conclusion that the whole tax package will go through unamended. Which means the ridiculously named Treasury Laws Amendment (tax relief so working Australians keep more of their money) bill 2019 will be passed by the end of the day. And that, as they say folks, is that. The next big battle for the government then, is repealing the medevac legislation. Centre Alliance, which was integral to it being passed in the last parliament, have said it won\u2019t budge. One Nation is all for it. That makes Jacqui Lambie the deciding vote (Cory Bernardi will vote with the government) On that, Lambie says she hasn\u2019t decided as yet: I have spent two weeks up here, two weeks to clean, I only got staff, I didn\u2019t even have toilet paper Monday, sweetie, so that\u2019s where we are at. Centre Alliance were on board as of late last night. Rex Patrick, Stirling Griff and Rebekha Sharkie put out this release early this morning: After lengthy negotiations with the Government to address concerns that Centre Alliance has about rising energy costs, and particularly the high electricity costs in South Australia, Centre Alliance has agreed to support the Government\u2019s personal tax cuts legislation. Supporting the tax cuts will reward Australian taxpayers and provide a stimulus to the economy that almost all economists have called for, including the Reserve Bank Governor. Centre Alliance has worked with the Government on both short and long term reforms to deal with gas market concerns. The full package of reforms will be announced by Government in the coming weeks but will include changes to the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism (ADGSM) to deal with current pricing, market transparency measures, measures to deal with the monopoly nature of East Coast gas pipelines and longer term measures to ensure future gas projects deliver surplus supply to the Australian market. Centre Alliance will not support the splitting off of stage three, noting that the Government have steadfastly refused to split the bill and that any split will be rejected in the lower house. In respect of the negotiations on gas, the following is noted: Energy is used in every sector of the economy. Uncompetitive energy costs mean an uncompetitive economy. 51% of SA\u2019s electricity is generated from gas. Gas prices set the electricity price in SA, Victoria and Tasmania. ACCC Chairman, Rod Sims, has forecast that gas prices will rise. Centre Alliance went to the election with a promise to reduce energy prices. Gas facts In 2013 \u2013 14 Australians paid $3 - $4 GJ for gas. 6 LNG trains have since been built in Gladstone QLD to facilitate export of gas. Production of gas in Australia has tripled. In 2017 SA couldn\u2019t even get gas offers, let alone a good price. Centre Alliance negotiated the ADGSM with the Government to ensure a minimum domestic supply. The ADGSM has worked to ensure there is enough supply, but has not dealt with price. Despite a tripling of production, the price of gas in Australia has tripled (to around $9 GL). Australians are now paying 20% more for our gas than consumers in the Asian market are paying for our gas. Many companies are deferring investment, and in some cases not investing, in Australia because of our high gas prices. There has been a market failure and Government must intervene. So why did Jacqui Lambie come on board? It is a very smart play up here, you have to think, \u2018I grab this for Tasmania now, and we do what we can on the goodwill,\u2019 or do we wait for Labor to actually bend over, because this is what the public seem to want, business and those other people getting tax cuts, and muck around with this for another four weeks, or get this [done] so these guys can have their cheques back in the next week. Jacqui Lambie says she still has concerns over the third stage of the tax cuts. I still have concerns about stage three, there is no doubt about that. That is five or six years away and we have another election. I, you know, what they are saying in black and white up here is certainly not translating down to the ground here and it certainly doesn\u2019t look that pretty. At this stage, where I see the economy going, I am not an economist, but I am not sure that we are heading in the right direction and I am sure from public perception and whatever else, when it gets to that, if we just don\u2019t have the money, then that deal will have to go wayside. In the meantime though, what it will give is many others out there tax relief that they can go and spend in those rural and regional areas, within their local communities. I have small businesses down there suffering, and I am not sitting around on this for another four or five weeks while we play argy bargy, that is another thing. I can tell you now, 18 months out there, they have absolutely had a gutful of no decisions being made up here and getting things done, and getting the job done, and getting on with it and delivering. Lambie says there is no guarantee that stage three will be abandoned if the budget can\u2019t take the hit. But I can tell you now, from the public perception, this is the way it works in Australia and if you really don\u2019t have the money and you can\u2019t afford it and we are that far under, then those tax cuts are just not going to happen. But what about not having the deal in writing? You know what, it comes down to good faith, I\u2019m sure they are very aware and Centre Alliance is exactly the same, it not going to do any good by showing goodwill and then reneging on that. That is not going to help anyone. They know that. I think we are all very upfront about that. They have paid the price for that in the past, so look, I just want to get on and deliver for Tasmania, what needs to be done. It is not just public housing crisis that we have down there ... we also have a massive health problem. We probably have one of the worst in the country. So one step at a time, but I need those kids and their families and into warm houses. I just want to make sure that relationship stays intact and we walk through the next six to eight weeks in goodwill, so we can get those results we need to, for Tasmania, so I can get those people off the streets, so I can get them and their kids into housing and make sure they have got a roof over their heads, and also have warmth. It is a really big problem in Tasmania at the moment, and I know they have been trying to do what they can. I have had 18 months out there, I want them to see it from my direction. I have been terribly concerned in the past when I\u2019ve delivered money straight to the state government that it has not been spent wisely, so I want the targeted deals that I do up here, I want them better targeted so they are delivered straight to where they need to go, so we can get on with the job. That\u2019s Jacqui Lambie on why she made the deal. Anthony Albanese has responded to the tax deal \u2013 Labor will still try to get its amendments through. There is no point though. So then it comes down to what Labor does \u2013 does it abstain, vote in favour, or vote against? But that\u2019s just politics. The tax cuts are done. Albanese: This morning, we\u2019ll consider the tax package. Labor will be pursuing our amendments before the Senate, because they represent good economic policy. We saw the Reserve Bank of Australia just this week lower interest rates to a cash rate of just 1%. That\u2019s one-third of the lowest that interest rates got during the global financial crisis. The greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The fact is that if a tax cut, by increasing the 37% threshold is good policy, from $90,000 to $120,000 in 2022, why isn\u2019t it good policy in 2019? The government should be supporting that amendment. And might I say \u2013 the crossbenchers are doing themselves a disservice if they don\u2019t support the separating out of stage three of the tax cuts. This has been a bluff by the government, saying, threatening to hold up tax cuts. It was there for 2025. That\u2019s why Labor argued for more tax cuts sooner in every worker\u2019s hand right now. That\u2019s what the economy needs. That\u2019s what Labor will be pursuing in the Senate. It seems like Jacqui Lambie believes a future government can just repeal the stage three tax cuts if the budget can\u2019t handle it. She says if Australia doesn\u2019t have the money for them they won\u2019t happen. That seems like a lot of faith in a future government. So she remains concerned but wants the lower and middle income tax cuts passed now. Well, as we predicted yesterday, the tax cuts are a done deal. Jacqui Lambie has given her support to the government, as has Centre Alliance. The government will get its package through the Senate, without Labor\u2019s support. Mathias Cormann says there were no deals. But Lambie will get something done on social housing in Tasmania and Centre Alliance gets something done on gas. Nothing is in writing. Lambie says it \u201ccomes down to faith\u201d and she believes the government will follow through with its promises. So, strap in for a marathon day, but it is done. Mike Bowers and the Guardian brains trust are on board and we\u2019ll bring you the first real day of sitting to you as it happens. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

It would appear that \u2013 right up there with grumpy cats and happy dogs \u2013 peeling produce \u201cthe right way\u201d is a surefire means of grabbing the world\u2019s attention. The garlic and pineapple videos have now racked up tens of millions of views (23.8m and 13.4m, respectively). Of course, it is entirely possible that this owes less to culinary curiosity than to our phone addiction. As the New Yorker\u2019s Helen Rosner put it, the videos hit \u201call the same tension-and-release dopamine levers as (uggghhh) pimple-popping videos\u201d.

      "bodyText": "\u201cExpectation management\u201d is a well-known tactic in politics, in which a party or politician\u2019s own side plays down hopes to ensure that even the most average performance can be spun into a sign of success. Would-be prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s entire political career appears to be an example of this: in which a toxic mix of entitlement, class privilege and enablement by sections of the press has cast the smallest achievement \u2013 say, a new haircut and a smattering of Latin \u2013 as proof of worthiness for the highest office of state. And yet I can\u2019t help but think such psychology is crossing into new territory. No longer saved for just individual politicians or parties, increasingly, expectation management could be said to describe Britain itself. Brexit is in many ways the poster child for this phenomenon, in which leading Brexiteers \u2013 once promising the earth \u2013 now buoyantly boast \u201cthere will be drinking water\u201d after the 31 October deadline to leave the EU. But this reframing of expectations spreads much further. Take life expectancy. Medics often use life expectancy as a barometer of the health of a nation and by official measures, Britain is getting sicker. For the first time in 100 years, Britons are dying earlier, leading a team of specialists to meet at University College London this month to investigate it. The UK now has the worst health trends in western Europe, with experts stating that austerity is a major factor. This is no coincidence considering that consecutive Conservative-led governments chose far deeper cuts in the wake of the 2008 global crash than many other European countries, opting for dramatic reductions in funding for anything from meals on wheels, to NHS spending and social security. Even babies are not immune to such political failings. The infant mortality rate in England and Wales is rising after more than a century of continuous improvement. As child poverty grows, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health estimates infant mortality rates could be 140% higher here than in comparable wealthy countries by 2030. Or take local services. This week, the Local Government Association (LGA) warned one in five councils in England face making further drastic funding cuts in the coming months, just to fend off bankruptcy. Nearly a decade of hollowing out town hall budgets has seen the most basic parts of society reframed as unaffordable: libraries, Sure Start centres, parks, youth services, schooling for children with special educational needs and disabilities, social care. One in three councils surveyed by the LGA said prospects were now so bleak that within three years they will be unable to meet even their statutory duty to provide core services \u2013 that\u2019s anything from child protection to homelessness prevention. Consider the recent spread of rough sleeping camps around the country and it gives a hint at where we\u2019re heading: a nation with such warped standards that for the unlucky, tents and garden sheds are a home. In any reasonable country, such a crisis would be dominating the front pages and yet we trundle on, blindly wandering into a future weighted by resignation that this is somehow the best we can do. Jeremy Hunt\u2019s muted admission in the last leadership debate that \u201csome cuts\u201d to social care went too far was typical of the restricted scope of the new politics. Forget visions for change; tomorrow\u2019s leaders are barely staving off disaster and expecting applause for it. That this fatigue exists in a climate where ultra-Brexiteers spout British exceptionalism is a bitter irony. Theirs is the hollowest version of greatness \u2013 the type of grandeur that can puff its chest at Britain\u2019s birthright as a global leader while a record number of its populace queue at food banks. The power of figures such as Johnson is that each failure, far from being their undoing, often makes them stronger. Each untruth, each scandal, each charge of hypocrisy not only sets expectations lower for the general public but is actively embraced by their supporters. Racial slurs are \u201ccharacter\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Legislation to repeal the medevac transfer process cannot pass the parliament before late October because it will go to a Senate inquiry, a process giving supporters of the current arrangements a public platform to argue for their retention. The repeal legislation, introduced to the House of Representatives on Thursday, will now proceed to an inquiry by the Senate\u2019s Legal and Constitutional Legislative Committee, with a report date of 18 October. Guardian Australia understands the Morrison government did not argue against either the inquiry or the reporting date. The Coalition has declared it wants to repeal the medical transfers regime it was forced to accept during the period of minority parliament, but it has to tread carefully because of dynamics in the Senate. The Centre Alliance senator Stirling Griff earlier this week put the Morrison government on notice that repealing the medical evacuations bill would \u201csully the relationship\u201d between himself and the Coalition. The Morrison government will on Thursday achieve the passage of its income tax cuts package with the support of the Centre Alliance bloc of two senators. Post election, the government needs support from four crossbenchers to pass any legislation that Labor and the Greens oppose. The medevac legislation sets out conditions by which sick refugees and asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus Island can be transferred to Australia for medical treatment. In the event of medical advice from two or more treating doctors that a person needs to be evacuated, the home affairs minister has grounds for refusal. Centre Alliance has been a strong supporter of the procedures that enhance the status of clinicians in determining whether medical transfers occur. Labor has also declined to support scrapping medevac. If the government proceeds with the repeal, it will need the vote of the Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie, who has thus far refused to articulate her position on the issue. Lambie told the ABC on Thursday she sill needed a few more weeks to determine her view. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The government will have support from the One Nation bloc of two and independent Cory Bernardi to achieve repeal of medevac, but requires one more vote to get it through the Senate. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, told parliament on Thursday as he introduced the repeal legislation that \u201cas a nation it is imperative we are able to determine who enters Australia and whether they should remain in our borders permanently\u201d. But earlier in the week Griff was adamant the current procedures were working. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a brave move for the government to repeal a process that is working well and only applies to existing asylum seekers who require critical medical treatment that is not available on Nauru,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t opened the asylum seeker floodgates.

      "bodyText": "The federal government has sought advice on covering the cost of autopsies on stillborn babies under Medicare as part of a $50m response to a parliamentary inquiry that found the rate of stillbirths in Australia had been unchanged for 20 years. The announcement coincided with the release of a report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) into the rates of stillbirths and neonatal deaths in 2015 and 2016, which found that rates of perinatal death had remained \u201crelatively constant since 1997\u201d. There were 4,263 stillbirths in 2015 and 2016 in Australia, or about six stillbirths per day. Half of those deaths occurred between 20 and 26 weeks gestation and rates were higher for Indigenous mothers, very young mothers, mothers aged over 40 and multiple births. Almost one-third of stillbirths were attributed to congenital anomalies but 19.6% were \u201cunexplained\u201d. \u201cThe hard truth is that the national stillbirth toll dwarfs the national road toll, and if this report is not a call to arms for governments, policy-makers and the medical profession, I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d the Stillbirth Foundation Australia chief executive, Kate Lynch, said. The parliamentary inquiry into research and education around stillbirths delivered its final report in December, setting out what it said was a roadmap for reducing the rate of stillbirth by 20% within three years. According to the AIHW, the rate of perinatal death in Australia in 2015 and 2016 was 9.1 per 1,000 births. The rate of stillbirth was 6.8 per 1,000 births. On Tuesday, the health minister, Greg Hunt, gave full or in-principle support to all of its 16 recommendations, including seeking advice from the Medical Services Advisory Committee on whether the cost of conducting an autopsy following a stillbirth should be added to the Medicare benefits schedule to increase the rate of investigations following perinatal deaths. Currently autopsies for babies who were stillborn are not covered under Medicare, and cost about $4,000. According to the AIHW report, autopsies were conducted following about 45% of stillbirths and 30% of neonatal deaths in 2015 and 2016. Hunt said the federal government would work with state and territory governments to develop a national stillbirth action and implementation plan, based on the parliamentary report. He announced $43.9m in funding, on top of $7.2m announced last year, to support organisations which provide stillbirth education and awareness, perinatal mental health, loss and bereavement services, and improved research. Hunt said reducing the rate of stillbirths was a \u201chealth and wellbeing priority\u201d. \u201cWe understand the importance of this issue not only for the women affected, but for their partners, families and the broader community,\u201d he said. Labor, which initiated the inquiry in the Senate in March last year, has welcomed the government\u2019s response. In a joint statement with Labor\u2019s health spokesman, Chris Bowen, senators Kristina Keneally, Malarndirri McCarthy and Catryna Bilyk, who sat on the inquiry, offered their bipartisan support. \u201cThe truth is, there is nothing that can be done to ease the pain for those families who have gone through the trauma and are living with the grief of a stillbirth,\u201d they said. \u201cWe must take action now and continue to work together to prevent stillbirth so we can save babies\u2019 lives.\u201d",

After a national uproar, charges against Jones were dropped. But the Jones indictment is part of a larger trend, both in Alabama and nationwide, of states engaging in hostile surveillance of pregnant women, often with the collusion of doctors, and criminalizing women for their pregnancy outcomes. The campaign is the product of a mass moral panic based on a flimsy and misogynistic ethical calculation in which women have few claims to their own rights, dignity or freedom, but are burdened with greater and greater responsibilities to protect, care for and hold themselves accountable for the actions of others.</p> <p>This moral calculus can be seen in the growing number of prosecutions of women, predominantly women of color, found to have used drugs while pregnant. In Jones\u2019s home state of Alabama, a draconian provision called <a href=\"https://www.publichealthpost.org/viewpoints/chemical-endangerment-laws-hurt-pregnant-women/\">\u201cchemical endangerment\u201d</a> has been used to imprison women who are addicted to drugs for the crime of endangering their fetuses. In some cases, women are <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/californialawreview/vol102/iss4/4/\">tested for drugs without their consent</a> and reported to police by their doctors. According to <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/when-the-womb-is-a-crime-scene\">ProPublica</a>, the chemical law has led to 479 arrests in Alabama.</p> <p>\u201cChemical endangerment\u201d can be invoked against women who test positive for drugs even if their pregnancies are perfectly fine. But the statute is wielded with specific cruelty against those who lose their pregnancies through miscarriage or stillbirth. In 2011, a woman who gave birth to a stillborn boy took a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/opinion/alabama-pregnant-woman-shot.html\">plea deal of 10 years in prison</a> for the stillbirth; this was to avoid a life sentence. Laws against \u201cfetal endangerment\u201d have also been used against <a href=\"https://rewire.news/article/2013/08/02/plea-deal-reached-in-bei-bei-shuai-prosecution/\">women who attempt suicide</a>; other laws have been used to prosecute women who miscarry and are found to have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/28/opinion/pregnancy-women-pro-life-abortion.html\">illegally disposed of fetal remains</a>. Theoretically, they can enable prosecutions of pregnant women engaged in perfectly legal, nonviolent and even accidental activities, like drinking wine, playing sports or tripping down some steps \u2013 even when those activities do not end the pregnancy.</p> <p>In order for prosecutions like that of Marshae Jones to make sense, the fetus needs to be considered not only a person, but a special class of person, one with not only all the same rights and privileges of living, sentient, autonomous human beings, but quite a few extra rights and privileges on top of those. Writing in the <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n10/sally-rooney/an-irish-problem\">London Review of Books</a>, the novelist Sally Rooney reflected on the 2018 Irish abortion referendum: \u201cIf the foetus is a person, it is a person with a vastly expanded set of legal rights, rights available to no other class of citizen: the foetus may make free, non-consensual use of another living person\u2019s uterus and blood supply, and cause permanent, unwanted changes to another person\u2019s body.\u201d</p> <p>When the fetus is considered a person it not only has these rights over its mother, but also the right to have its interests represented \u2013 it is not uncommon in these cases for the state to appoint a lawyer to represent the interests of the fetus. It has the right to have these interests represented even though it does not articulate these interests itself: the fetus cannot speak, and if it could it is not clear that it would have anything to say. Instead, its rights are determined by third parties, often church groups or Republican state legislators, who presume to speak for the fetus, and do so by speaking over the voice of the person who would otherwise be considered the fetus\u2019s next of kin: the woman pregnant with it.</p> <p>As fetal rights expand even beyond those of real people, women\u2019s rights contract into something significantly less than legal personhood. Pregnant women lose the freedom to determine their own lives, to choose what to eat and how to exercise and where to go. And they gain a substantial burden for the welfare of others \u2013 specifically for the fetus, which is recognized as a person but not endowed with any responsibility to itself or to the woman who carries it. In Jones\u2019s case, the pregnant woman is assigned responsibility for not only her own actions but for those of other people who choose to hurt her.</p> <p>In choosing to indict Marshae Jones, the state of Alabama has blamed her for her own shooting, employing the same misogynistic, victim-blaming logic that asks a rape victim what she was wearing. One wonders what kind of life a woman would have to lead to meet the unusually high bar for personal safety and responsibility these cases set for pregnant women. I can only imagine that the lives these laws want pregnant women to lead are very limited indeed. That seems to be the point.</p> <ul> <li><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

Pregnant women lose the freedom to determine their own lives, to choose what to eat and how to exercise and where to go. And they gain a substantial burden for the welfare of others \u2013 specifically for the fetus, which is recognized as a person but not endowed with any responsibility to itself or to the woman who carries it. In Jones\u2019s case, the pregnant woman is assigned responsibility for not only her own actions but for those of other people who choose to hurt her. In choosing to indict Marshae Jones, the state of Alabama has blamed her for her own shooting, employing the same misogynistic, victim-blaming logic that asks a rape victim what she was wearing. One wonders what kind of life a woman would have to lead to meet the unusually high bar for personal safety and responsibility these cases set for pregnant women. I can only imagine that the lives these laws want pregnant women to lead are very limited indeed. That seems to be the point. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist",

      "bodyText": "Rowan Clarke on Clevedon, Somerset As an outdoor swimmer and swimming coach, Rowan is often found on the side of Clevedon Marine Lake giving guidance to all ability levels. She is on the Board of Trustees for Marlens, the charity that looks after the Marine Lake and a member of the South West Seals winter swimmers. \u201cNot renowned for its swimming, the Somerset coastline is characteristically brown and turgid. Clevedon has a historic bathing tradition \u2013 the famous Long Swim is now in its 91st year \u2013 while Clevedon Marine Lake has just marked its 90th birthday. Swimming from Clevedon beach feels like being part of the town\u2019s fabric. You can only swim here around high tide but the joy of this small window is that all of Clevedon\u2019s sea-swimming community comes together. Clevedon has one of the highest tidal ranges in the world, never letting the silty sea bed settle and this makes conditions variable. Depending on conditions and tide, you can swim under the pier\u2019s legs or around its end. You will always come out smiling.\u201d Refuel Survived the silty swim? Get the most epic bowl of porridge, a decent bacon sandwich or, of course, cake at Scarlett\u2019s, just by the pier on Alexandra Road. Anna Deacon on Gullane, East Lothian Swimming and documenting beautiful places is Anna\u2019s job: as a photographer she has swum across Scotland snapping other swimmers. She is well known in her tribe, the Wild Ones in Edinburgh. They swim every Sunday at the local beach Wardie Bay. Taking The Plunge: The Healing Power of Wild Swimming for Mind, Body and Soul by Anna Deacon and Vicky Allan will be published in November 2019 by Black &amp; White Publishing. \u201cI have swum in some extraordinary places but my favourite is closer to home, Gullane. The beach is on a stunning piece of coastline than runs from Edinburgh to the Borders. There are beaches after beaches but Gullane has everything: it stretches on for what seems like miles, there are amazing rockpools, sand dunes to run down, secret caves to explore and, best of all, beautifully clear sea. There have been dolphins spotted and, sometimes, minke whales have made an appearance.\u201d Refuel Seek sustenance in Drift, an old shipping container perched on the headland with a view over to Bass Rock, huge windows and brilliant cakes. Laura Evans on West Penwith, Cornwall You might not know her name but you may have heard about the St Ives Mermaid: Laura Evans. She swims daily, often found leaping off the harbour wall or washed up with her tail at beaches around the Cornish town, delighting children and adults alike. \u201cWest Penwith \u2013 from Porthmeor Cove to Nanjizal \u2013 is my favourite stretch of coastline. The landscape seems to change as you round every headland: from granite formations to lush greenery surrounding old mining ruins. There are secluded coves and tidal pools, meaning you are spoilt for choice when it comes to seeking a swim and more often than not you will have it all to yourself. I love Porth Nanven, also known as Cot valley and Dinosaur Egg Beach; it\u2019s named due to the sea turning the granite into ovals.\u201d \u2022 Laura has recently founded a new St Ives Swimmers group \u2013 why not join them if you\u2019re staying nearby? Refuel After seeking dinosaur eggs, carry on down the South West Coast Path to Sennen Cove and grab a pint at sunset in the Old Success Inn. Jane Hardy on the North Sea, Northumberland Jane is a member of the Alnwick Sea Swimmers and swims all seasons in the North Sea off the Northumberland coast. She tries to go daily and often organises longer-distance swims from the Farne Islands or to Holy Island. From the mainland to Holy Island is just under a mile in distance but challenged by strong currents, so Jane organises support for those who wish to swim the stretch. \u201cI am incredibly lucky. The stretch of coastline I swim is mostly in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. White sandy beaches, clean water, wildlife \u2013 and mostly free parking! The beaches are often deserted and I often have the company of seals, birds and occasionally dolphins if I\u2019m really lucky. Among my favourites is Football Hole, one of Northumberland\u2019s secrets. It is a bit of a walk but no one else is ever there. I mostly swim parallel to shore but, when the tides permit, I swim down the River Aln.

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories today.</p> <p>The anti-Brexit minister David Gauke <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/03/minister-predicts-his-own-sacking-in-speech-attacking-populists\">has launched a veiled attack on Boris Johnson by criticising \u201cpopulist politicians\u201d</a> who deceive the public by telling them what they think they want to hear. With his likely exit from the cabinet just weeks away, the justice secretary used a speech to the annual judges\u2019 dinner in the City of London to attack colleagues who \u201cpour poison into our national conversation\u201d. He said deterioration in the national discourse had led to a \u201cgrowing distrust of our institutions \u2013 whether that be parliament, the civil service, the mainstream media or the judiciary\u201d.</p> <p>As Johnson and Jeremy Hunt face more hustings in the Tory leadership race today, Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/03/may-to-warn-successor-greatest-duty-is-to-strengthen-union\">has pledged to create 20,000 new police officers</a> with particular emphasis on rural areas. His rival was also pitching for votes in the countryside by promising a parliamentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/04/jeremy-hunt-promises-vote-on-repeal-of-foxhunting-ban\">vote to repeal the foxhunting ban</a>. The pair also face a warning from the woman they are vying to succeed. Theresa May will say in a speech in Scotland today that the duty of the next PM is to hold the union together amid a possible no-deal Brexit.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Drink problem \u2013 </strong>The shocking impact on the NHS from alcohol abuse is laid bare today by research revealing that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/04/staggering-cost-nhs-alcohol-abuse-report\">one in 10 people in a hospital bed in the UK are alcohol-dependent </a>and one in five inpatients are doing themselves harm by their drinking. While it is estimated that heavy drinking costs the NHS \u00a33.5bn a year, the numbers of people treated has been unclear. But a major review published in the journal Addiction has collated 124 previous studies involving 1.6 million hospital inpatients and shows that 20% use alcohol harmfully while 10% are dependent. More than 80 people die every day in the UK from alcohol abuse. Cuts to alcohol services in the NHS and the community have made the situation worse, it says.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Diplomacy double \u2013 </strong>Donald Trump has issued a Twitter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/04/trump-warns-iran-nuclear-threats-will-come-back-to-bite-you\">warning to Iran to be \u201ccareful with threats\u201d</a> after Tehran said it will exceed within days its uranium enrichment level agreed under the 2015 nuclear deal. President Hassan Rouhani blamed the development on the failure by other parties to the deal to keep up their promises and provide Iran relief from the US sanctions. But, amid heightened tensions in the Middle East, the US president said threats \u201ccan come back to bite you like nobody has been bitten before!\u201d. He also faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/04/north-korea-says-us-hell-bent-on-sanctions-despite-trump-kim-talks\">diplomatic pushback on Thursday from another victim of US sanctions, </a>North Korea, when the Pyongyang regime complained in a letter to UN that Washington was \u201chellbent\u201d on using trade bans to target the country.</p> <p>Also in North Korea, an Australian student missing in the country for a week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/04/alek-sigley-australian-student-released-from-north-korea-reports\">is \u201csafe and sound\u201d</a> and is on his way to Japan. Alek Sigley, 29, was studying at university in Pyongyang.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Osborne comeback? \u2013 </strong>George Osborne has told friends he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/04/george-osborne-aiming-for-new-role-as-head-of-imf\">wants to be considered as the next boss of the International Monetary Fund</a>, according to reports.

      "bodyText": "Top story: May says successor \u2018must protect union\u2019 Good morning briefers. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories today. The anti-Brexit minister David Gauke has launched a veiled attack on Boris Johnson by criticising \u201cpopulist politicians\u201d who deceive the public by telling them what they think they want to hear. With his likely exit from the cabinet just weeks away, the justice secretary used a speech to the annual judges\u2019 dinner in the City of London to attack colleagues who \u201cpour poison into our national conversation\u201d. He said deterioration in the national discourse had led to a \u201cgrowing distrust of our institutions \u2013 whether that be parliament, the civil service, the mainstream media or the judiciary\u201d. As Johnson and Jeremy Hunt face more hustings in the Tory leadership race today, Johnson has pledged to create 20,000 new police officers with particular emphasis on rural areas. His rival was also pitching for votes in the countryside by promising a parliamentary vote to repeal the foxhunting ban. The pair also face a warning from the woman they are vying to succeed. Theresa May will say in a speech in Scotland today that the duty of the next PM is to hold the union together amid a possible no-deal Brexit. * * * Drink problem \u2013 The shocking impact on the NHS from alcohol abuse is laid bare today by research revealing that one in 10 people in a hospital bed in the UK are alcohol-dependent and one in five inpatients are doing themselves harm by their drinking. While it is estimated that heavy drinking costs the NHS \u00a33.5bn a year, the numbers of people treated has been unclear. But a major review published in the journal Addiction has collated 124 previous studies involving 1.6 million hospital inpatients and shows that 20% use alcohol harmfully while 10% are dependent. More than 80 people die every day in the UK from alcohol abuse. Cuts to alcohol services in the NHS and the community have made the situation worse, it says. * * * Diplomacy double \u2013 Donald Trump has issued a Twitter warning to Iran to be \u201ccareful with threats\u201d after Tehran said it will exceed within days its uranium enrichment level agreed under the 2015 nuclear deal. President Hassan Rouhani blamed the development on the failure by other parties to the deal to keep up their promises and provide Iran relief from the US sanctions. But, amid heightened tensions in the Middle East, the US president said threats \u201ccan come back to bite you like nobody has been bitten before!\u201d. He also faced diplomatic pushback on Thursday from another victim of US sanctions, North Korea, when the Pyongyang regime complained in a letter to UN that Washington was \u201chellbent\u201d on using trade bans to target the country. Also in North Korea, an Australian student missing in the country for a week is \u201csafe and sound\u201d and is on his way to Japan. Alek Sigley, 29, was studying at university in Pyongyang. * * * Osborne comeback? \u2013 George Osborne has told friends he wants to be considered as the next boss of the International Monetary Fund, according to reports. The former chancellor, who was sacked after the Brexit referendum, is the editor of the Evening Standard. But taking the top job at the Washington-based organisation would be a dramtic return to the public arena. The position will become vacant when Christine Lagarde leaves to become head of the European Central Bank. He will face stiff competition for the job but the Financial Times reports that he believes his connections in Washington and Beijing make him a strong contender. * * * Hong Kong arrests \u2013 Police in Hong Kong have arrested at least 12 people after protesters stormed the city\u2019s parliamentary building in a break-in involving hundreds of pro-democracy activists who vandalised offices and the main chamber. The incident marred largely peaceful protests on Monday. The 11 men and one woman face charges ranging from \u201cpossession of offensive weapons, unlawful assembly, assaulting a police officer and obstructing a police officer\u201d. The oldest was 31 and the youngest 14. It comes as the Foreign Office called in the Chinese ambassador to London after he accused foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt of \u201cgross and unacceptable interference\u201d in Chinese affairs for comments about the protests. * * * Trust us \u2013 The National Trust is divesting its \u00a31bn fossil fuel assets in an attempt to help tackle the escalating climate crisis. The heritage organisation said it would sell the vast majority of its investments within 12 months, and the whole lot within three years. A Guardian investigation last year revealed the trust had invested tens of millions of pounds in oil, gas and mining companies despite having pledged to cut down its own use of fossil fuels and warning about the impact of climate change. Today in Focus podcast Kamala Harris was the big winner of the first round of Democratic party debates in the US. This week, her poll numbers surged and so did donations to her campaign. But as Lauren Gambino in Washington tells the podcast, it was bad news for the frontrunners as Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders faltered.

      "bodyText": "Stephen Walker had been running a youth crisis centre in the Dandenongs when he first encountered a weird station transmitting out of RMIT University. He later remembered passing an aerial out of his bathroom window, tilting it in exactly the right position until he received a signal. \u201cIt felt like we were kind of eavesdropping on a culture,\u201d he said. Walker, who died on Wednesday from cancer, would go on to shape the sound of independent Melbourne. Music fans, particularly those of a certain generation, will remember him as The Ghost Who Talks, presenting Skull Cave on Friday evenings on Triple R for more than 30 years. As well as broadcasting, he served as program manager for 14 years, helping establish Triple R as the most successful public station in the southern hemisphere. It\u2019s easy to forget that not so very long ago you could only hear artists like Nick Cave, Iggy Pop and Patti Smith on alternative stations. Before the internet, before Spotify and social media, Australians who wanted to hear music that didn\u2019t fit commercial playlists relied utterly on radio DJs. Stephen Walker was one of the best. His sense of outsiderdom (\u201cI felt like a hick from the sticks\u201d) in relation to a predominantly inner-city music scene helped shape his own on-air persona \u2013 and later the station as a whole. Walker began broadcasting in 1981, opening his first show with Cabaret Voltaire and closing with Pere Ubu \u2013 a selection that epitomised his distinctive aesthetic. Yet he sought, from the start, to introduce others to the music he loved. Post-punk culture could be deeply intimidating, a scene almost designed to repel anyone associated with the hated mainstream. Walker, by contrast, sounded like a knowledgeable elder brother, inviting you to check out his vast record collection and then gently steering you to tracks he thought you should like. Walker called his first show From the Bunker, borrowing the title from a book about William Burroughs (another of his long-term favourites). In 1982, he hosted a show for young people called Survival Talkback. On one occasion, he arrived at the studio to be told he wouldn\u2019t be taking calls \u2013 Triple R hadn\u2019t managed to pay its phone bill. Walker became program manager in 1984 and helped establish a degree of stability for what had previously been a precarious, punk-rock venture. As Mark Phillips explains in Radio City, his history of Triple R, Walker identified an idealised listener for the station: \u201cA modern-day renaissance man or woman who tuned in for both Film Buffs\u2019 Forecast and hardcore punk music, someone who had a rock\u2019n\u2019roll attitude to spoken word and an intellectual attitude to music.\u201d Whether or not this paragon actually existed was neither here nor there: the point was to make radio that didn\u2019t patronise its audience but assumed a willingness and enthusiasm to engage with unfamiliar \u2013 even difficult \u2013 sounds and ideas. Walker\u2019s own show, Skull Cave, exemplified this approach. Broadcasting as The Ghost Who Talks (\u201cNemesis of mediocre radio everywhere\u201d), Walker presented Melbourne with a smorgasbord of underground culture, combining proto-punks such as the Stooges with jazz artists like John Coltrane, experimentalists such as Laurie Anderson, the hip-hop of Public Enemy and a regular array of spoken word weirdness. Britain had John Peel; Melbourne had Stephen Walker. He gave as good as he got in Triple R\u2019s sometimes fractious internal disputes. But even those who disagreed with his programming choices recognised the importance of his insistence that community radio could and should produce high-quality content. A diagnosis of multiple sclerosis eventually forced him to step back from the day-to-day running of the station. In 2010, a benefit concert for his medical expenses demonstrated the feeling towards him in the musical community: the remarkable lineup included Nick Cave with the Dirty Three, Gareth and Dan from the Drones, Dave Graney and the Lurid Yellow Mist, Ron S Peno, Sand Pebbles, DJ Max Crawdaddy and the Skull Cave All Stars. Walker\u2019s health forced him to abandon broadcasting last year. But you can still hear his distinctive sensibility in the show now presented by Woody McDonald in the same time slot.

But what made this conversation about egg whites noteworthy is that it was not taking place among people, but artificial intelligence (AI) bots.</p> <p>The egg whites thread is just one in a growing archive of conversations on a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SubSimulatorGPT2/\">subreddit</a> \u2013 a Reddit forum dedicated to a specific topic \u2013 that is made up entirely of bots trained to emulate the style of human Reddit contributors. This simulated forum was created by a Reddit user called <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/disumbrationist/\">disumbrationist</a> using a tool called GPT-2, a machine learning language generator that was unveiled in February by OpenAI, one of the world\u2019s leading AI labs.</p> <p>Jack Clark, policy director at OpenAI, told me that chief among these concerns is how the tool might be used to spread false or misleading information at scale. In a <a href=\"https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/clark_deepfakes_sfr.pdf\">recent testimony</a> given at a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lArPEDS0GTA\">House </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lArPEDS0GTA\">intelligence </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lArPEDS0GTA\">committee hearing</a> about the threat of AI-generated fake media, Clark said he foresees fake text being used \u201cfor the production of [literal] \u2018fake news\u2019, or to potentially impersonate people who had produced a lot of text online, or simply to generate troll-grade propaganda for social networks\u201d.</p> <p>GPT-2 is an example of a technique called language modeling, which involves training an algorithm to predict the next most likely word in a sentence. While previous language models have struggled to generate coherent longform text, the combination of more raw data \u2013 GPT-2 was trained on 8m online articles \u2013 and better algorithms has made this model the most robust yet.</p> <p>It essentially works like <a href=\"https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/106230?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en\">Google </a><a href=\"https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/106230?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en\">auto-complete</a> or <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-predictive-text-iphd4ea90231/ios\">predictive text</a> for messaging. But instead of simply offering one-word suggestions, if you prompt GPT-2 with a sentence, it can generate entire paragraphs of language in that style. For example, if you feed the system a line from Shakespeare, it generates a Shakespeare-like response. If you prompt it with a news headline, it will generate text that almost looks like a news article.</p> <p>Alec Radford, a researcher at OpenAI, told me that he also sees the success of GPT-2 as a step towards more fluent communication between humans and machines in general. He says the intended purpose of the system is to give computers greater mastery of natural language, which may improve tasks like speech recognition, which is used by the likes of Siri and Alexa to understand your commands; and machine translation, which is used to power Google Translate.</p> <p>But as GPT-2 spreads online and is appropriated by more people like disumbrationist \u2013 amateur makers who are using the tool to create everything from Reddit threads, to <a href=\"https://desert.glass/newsletter/week-22/\">short stories</a> and <a href=\"https://boingboing.net/2019/03/15/digital-lit.html\">poems</a>, to <a href=\"https://github.com/pwendel3/worlds_51st_best/blob/master/Worlds_50_Best_Scraper.ipynb\">restaurant reviews</a> \u2013 the team at OpenAI are also grappling with how their powerful tool might flood the internet with fake text, making it harder to know the origins of anything we read online.</p> <p>Clark and the team at OpenAI take this threat so seriously that when they unveiled GPT-2 in February this year, they released <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/\">a blog</a><a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/\">post alongside it stating</a> that they weren\u2019t releasing the full version of the tool due to \u201cconcerns about malicious applications\u201d. (They have since released a larger version of the model, which is being used to create the fake Reddit threads, poems and so on.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It will just get harder to offer guarantees about the truth of information in the future</p> <footer> <cite>Jack Clark</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Clark, convincing machine text like the variety GPT-2 is capable of pose a similar threat to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/12/deep-fakes-fake-news-truth\">deepfakes</a>\u201d \u2013 machine-learning generated fake images and videos that can been used to make people appear to do things they never did, say things they never said (like this video of former president <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ54GDm1eL0\">Barack Obama</a>). \u201cThey are essentially the same,\u201d Clark told me. \u201cYou have technology that makes it cheaper and easier to fake something, which means that it will just get harder to offer guarantees about the truth of information in the future.\u201d</p> <p>However, some feel that this overstates the threat of fake text. According to Yochai Benkler, co-head of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard, the most damaging instances of fake news are written by political extremists and trolls, and tend to be about controversial topics that \u201ctrigger deep-seated hatred\u201d, like election fraud or immigration. While a system like GPT-2 can produce semi-coherent articles at scale, it is a long way from being able to replicate this type of psychological manipulation. \u201cThe simple ability to generate false text at scale is not likely to affect most forms of disinformation,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>Other experts have <a href=\"https://www.skynettoday.com/briefs/gpt2\">suggested</a> that OpenAI exaggerated the malicious potential of GPT-2 in order to create hype around their research. For Zack Lipton, professor of business technologies at Carnegie Mellon University, the assessment of the risk of the technology was disingenuous.</p> <p>\u201cOf all the bad uses of AI \u2013 from recommender systems that lead to filter bubbles and the racial consequences that emerge from automated categorization \u2013 I would put the threat of language modeling at the bottom of the list,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat OpenAI have done is commandeered the discourse and fear about AI and used it to generate hype around their product.\u201d</p> <p>OpenAI\u2019s concerns are being taken seriously by some. A team of researchers from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence recently developed a tool to <a href=\"https://grover.allenai.org/\">detect</a> \u201cneural fake news\u201d. Yejin Choi, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington who worked on the project, told me that detecting synthetic text is actually \u201cfairly easy\u201d due to the fact that generated text has a \u201cstatistical signature\u201d, almost like a fingerprint, that can be easily identified.</p> <p>While such digital forensics are useful, Britt Paris, a researcher at New York-based institute Data &amp; Society, worries that such solutions misleadingly frame fake news as a technological problem when, in fact, most misinformation is created and spread online without the help of sophisticated technologies.</p> <p>\u201cWe already have a ton of ways for generating false information and people do a pretty good job of circulating this stuff without the help of machines,\u201d she said. Indeed, the most prominent instances of fake content online \u2013 such as the \u201cdrunk Nancy Pelosi\u201d video <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/24/facebook-leaves-fake-nancy-pelosi-video-on-site\">released</a> earlier this year \u2013 were created using rudimentary editing techniques that have been around for decades.</p> <p>Benkler agrees, adding that fake news and disinformation are \u201cfirst and foremost political-cultural problems, not technological problems\u201d. Tackling the problem, he says, requires not better detection technologies, but an examination of the social conditions that have made fake news a reality.</p> <p>Whether or not GPT-2, or a similar technology, becomes the misinformation machine that OpenAI are anxious about, there is a growing consensus that considering the social implications of a technology before it is released is good practice. At the same time, predicting precisely how technologies will be used and misused is notoriously difficult. Who would have thought 10 years ago that a recommendation algorithm for watching videos online would turn into a powerful <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/opinion/sunday/youtube-politics-radical.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fzeynep-tufekci&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=opinion&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=8&amp;pgtype=collection\">radicalizing</a> instrument?</p> <p>Given the difficulty of predicting the potential harm of a technology, I thought I would see how GPT-2 faired in assessing its own capacity for spreading misinformation. \u201cDo you think that you will be used to spread fake news and further imperil our already degraded information eco-system?\u201d I prompted the machine.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that we can\u2019t find the name of who actually post the article is a great clue,\u201d it responded. \u201cHowever, this person is still using social media sites to post the fake news with a clear purpose.\u201d</p>",

According to Yochai Benkler, co-head of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard, the most damaging instances of fake news are written by political extremists and trolls, and tend to be about controversial topics that \u201ctrigger deep-seated hatred\u201d, like election fraud or immigration. While a system like GPT-2 can produce semi-coherent articles at scale, it is a long way from being able to replicate this type of psychological manipulation. \u201cThe simple ability to generate false text at scale is not likely to affect most forms of disinformation,\u201d he told me. Other experts have suggested that OpenAI exaggerated the malicious potential of GPT-2 in order to create hype around their research. For Zack Lipton, professor of business technologies at Carnegie Mellon University, the assessment of the risk of the technology was disingenuous. \u201cOf all the bad uses of AI \u2013 from recommender systems that lead to filter bubbles and the racial consequences that emerge from automated categorization \u2013 I would put the threat of language modeling at the bottom of the list,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat OpenAI have done is commandeered the discourse and fear about AI and used it to generate hype around their product.\u201d OpenAI\u2019s concerns are being taken seriously by some. A team of researchers from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence recently developed a tool to detect \u201cneural fake news\u201d. Yejin Choi, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington who worked on the project, told me that detecting synthetic text is actually \u201cfairly easy\u201d due to the fact that generated text has a \u201cstatistical signature\u201d, almost like a fingerprint, that can be easily identified. While such digital forensics are useful, Britt Paris, a researcher at New York-based institute Data &amp; Society, worries that such solutions misleadingly frame fake news as a technological problem when, in fact, most misinformation is created and spread online without the help of sophisticated technologies. \u201cWe already have a ton of ways for generating false information and people do a pretty good job of circulating this stuff without the help of machines,\u201d she said. Indeed, the most prominent instances of fake content online \u2013 such as the \u201cdrunk Nancy Pelosi\u201d video released earlier this year \u2013 were created using rudimentary editing techniques that have been around for decades. Benkler agrees, adding that fake news and disinformation are \u201cfirst and foremost political-cultural problems, not technological problems\u201d. Tackling the problem, he says, requires not better detection technologies, but an examination of the social conditions that have made fake news a reality. Whether or not GPT-2, or a similar technology, becomes the misinformation machine that OpenAI are anxious about, there is a growing consensus that considering the social implications of a technology before it is released is good practice. At the same time, predicting precisely how technologies will be used and misused is notoriously difficult. Who would have thought 10 years ago that a recommendation algorithm for watching videos online would turn into a powerful radicalizing instrument? Given the difficulty of predicting the potential harm of a technology, I thought I would see how GPT-2 faired in assessing its own capacity for spreading misinformation. \u201cDo you think that you will be used to spread fake news and further imperil our already degraded information eco-system?\u201d I prompted the machine. \u201cThe fact that we can\u2019t find the name of who actually post the article is a great clue,\u201d it responded. \u201cHowever, this person is still using social media sites to post the fake news with a clear purpose.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Who rules the underworld today, and where do they conduct their business? Once there were the familiar mugshots and Runyonesque nicknames, the clubs and pubs where the usual suspects gathered, plotted and schemed. Now organised crime is run like any other business, and its leading figures look like every other broker or tycoon. We have entered into a world of what Sir Rob Wainwright, until recently Europe\u2019s most senior police officer, calls \u201canonymised\u201d crime. The underworld has become the overworld.</p> <p>The National Crime Agency has estimated that \u00a390bn of criminal money is being laundered through the UK every year, 4% of the country\u2019s GDP. London has become the global capital of money-laundering and the beating heart of European organised crime. English is now the international underworld\u2019s lingua franca. Crime is an essential part of the British economy, providing hundreds of thousands of jobs, not just for professional criminals \u2013 the NCA reckons there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/11/police-cuts-organised-crime-national-crime-agency\" title=\"\">4,629 organised crime groups</a> in operation \u2013 but for police and prison officers, lawyers and court officials, and a security business that now employs more than half a million people.</p> <p>Just as the names of familiar shops have been departing from the high street, the old family firms of criminals are disappearing, whether in London, Glasgow, Newcastle or Manchester. And just as British football fans have had to learn how to pronounce the names of the legions of new foreign players, detectives have had to learn to do the same for the increasing number of new criminals. Britain was once dealing with drugs imports from half a dozen countries; now it is more than 30. A young person who would in the past have sought an apprenticeship in a trade or industry may now find that drug dealing offers better career prospects. And, apart from drugs and guns, British trading channels now facilitate the trafficking of women from eastern Europe and Africa for prostitution and children from Vietnam as low-level drug workers.</p> <p>The underworld\u2019s modus operandi has shifted in the past quarter century. \u201cThe international nature of crime and technology are probably the two biggest changes,\u201d says Steve Rodhouse, the NCA\u2019s head of operations. Speaking at the NCA\u2019s unprepossessing headquarters in Vauxhall, south London, Rodhouse explains how the agency\u2019s work has mushroomed. \u201cPretty much all of the NCA\u2019s most significant \u2018high-harm\u2019 operations now involve people, commodities or money transferring across international borders. The days of having a drugs gang, a firearms gang or a people-trafficking gang have changed because of the concept of polycriminality. Groups satisfying criminal markets, whatever they may be, is now much more common. These are businesses and people are looking to exploit markets, so why confine yourself to one market?\u201d</p> <p>Wainwright, who served as Europol chief for nine years, has also noted this internationalisation of crime. Addressing a Police Foundation gathering just after his retirement last year, he said that Europol, the European equivalent of Interpol, having expanded since its foundation in 1998 when \u201cit consisted literally, of two men and a dog \u2013 admittedly, a sniffer dog \u2013 in Luxembourg,\u201d now dealt with 65,000 cases a year. By 2018, he reckoned that 5,000 organised crime groups were operating across Europe and the mafia model had been replaced by a \u201cmore nimble\u201d model, with 180 different nationalities operating, mixing legal with illegal business and working with between 400 and 500 major money-launderers. This was multinational business with specialists in recruitment, movement, money-laundering and the forging of documents.</p> <p>The internet, of course, is a major factor. Wainwright likened its effect on crime to that of the motorcar in the 1920s and 30s, when suddenly criminals could escape at speed and take advantage of new markets. He cited the dark web, which he said was selling 350,000 different illegal items \u2013 60% of which were drugs \u2013 but including everything from guns to pornography and even operating a ratings system for speed of dispatch and quality. The combination of new faces of whom the British police \u2013 and often Interpol and Europol \u2013 were unaware, along with an increasingly tech-savvy pool of criminals able to disguise their identities, made for a toxic cocktail. Crooks anonymous.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>One group with little interest in anonymity are the Hellbanianz, a gang of cocky young Albanians based in Barking, east London. They went online in spectacular fashion in 2017 via Instagram and YouTube rap videos to flaunt their ill-gotten wealth and firepower.</p> <p>Their most prominent member, Tristen Asllani, who lived in Hampstead, was jailed for 25 years in 2016 for drug dealing and firearms offences which included possessing a \u0160korpion submachine gun. He was caught after a police chase in north London which ended when he crashed his car into a computer repair shop in Crouch End. A photo of Asllani, showing him stripped to the waist after he had apparently spent long hours in the prison gym, appeared on a social media page called My Albanian in Jail, with a caption saying \u201cEven inside the prison we have all conditions, what\u2019s missing are only whores\u201d.</p> <p>The flashy cars and bundles of banknotes on display in the Hellbanianz videos were the result of the importation of cocaine and cannabis, but the gang was also involved in the weapons trade. The pictures showed \u00a350 notes wrapped around a cake and their HB logo written in cannabis. After they were arrested and jailed, other gang members have posted pictures of themselves, taken with smuggled mobile phones, from inside prison where they cheerfully inscribe their gang name on the walls.</p> <p>Muhamed Veliu, an Albanian investigative journalist, who knows London well, says that the Hellbanianz have been on the crime scene in east London for many years. \u201cThey are sending a bad message to young Albanians. By seeing such photos, they think the streets of UK are paved with gold \u2026 Bizarrely, despite the fact they are in the prison, they show the outside world photos of their life behind the bars.\u201d He said that there was a concern that the British media stereotyped all Albanians as criminals but, he added, the 2006 Securitas robbery, in which two Albanians played <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jan/29/ukcrime.topstories31\" title=\"\">key roles</a> in the theft of \u00a353m from a depot in Kent, was regarded with some national pride back home. \u201cIt was \u2018the crime of the century\u2019, it was seen as very different from making money from prostitution, which is the lowest form of crime. It is wrong, of course, but they did need bravery to get involved, and at least they went for a bank \u2013 that was the feeling in the Albanian community.\u201d There are currently around 700 Albanians in British jails.</p> <p>\u201cAlbania is Europe\u2019s largest producer of cannabis,\u201d says Tony Saggers, the former head of drugs threat and intelligence at the NCA. \u201cIt is important not to stereotype, but the Kosovan war led to Albanians pretending to be Kosovan in order to get asylum in the UK. Many of the people who came just wanted a better life, but there were criminals among them who were able to set up illicit networks \u2026 The UK criminal has a get-rich-quick mentality while the Albanians\u2019 strategy was get-rich-slow, so they have driven down the price of cocaine in the UK. They knew that if they expanded, they could undercut the market.\u201d It helped that their reputation preceded them. \u201cThe Albanian criminals may be ruthless and potentially murderous when controlling their organised crime,\u201d said Saggers, \u201cbut when they come to the UK they try to be more charismatic and they use fear \u2013 \u2018We\u2019re here, we need to get on,\u2019 that sort of approach. So there is little violence from the older Albanian criminals in the UK, because they know that violence attracts more attention.\u201d</p> <p>The Albanians had already established themselves in a darker fashion when 26-year-old Luan Plackici was jailed in 2003 and said to have made more than \u00a31m from trafficking \u201cpoor, naive and gullible\u201d young women who thought they were on their way to jobs as waitresses or barmaids. Some had to service up to 20 men a day to pay for the \u00a38,000 \u201ctravel bill\u201d from Romania and Moldova.</p> <p>The international nature of people-trafficking was exposed fully in 2014 by a trial of a gang that imported more than 100 women into Britain. The trial ended with the gang leader, Vishal Chaudhary, being jailed for 12 years. Chaudhary, who lived the high life in Canary Wharf in London, contacted young women through social networks in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, offering work as receptionists, nannies or cleaners in England. But when they got to the UK, the women were forced to work in brothels. Chaudhary\u2019s team, all of whom were jailed, consisted of his brother, Kunal, who worked for Deloitte in Manchester, a Hungarian heavy called Krisztian Abel and the latter\u2019s sister, Szilvia, who helped recruit the women.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5f9fb941927554ced12bdf7cd81e08e6075176a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f9fb941927554ced12bdf7cd81e08e6075176a0/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cannabis farm discovered in a house in Oldham in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cannabis farm discovered in a house in Oldham in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are numbers of young people involved in what the legal system terms \u201cforced criminality\u201d. The lawyer Philippa Southwell has specialised in such cases, which apply in particular to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/31/trafficked-beaten-ensaved-life-of-cannabis-farmer-vietnam\" title=\"\">young Vietnamese people</a> brought illegally into the UK by traffickers and forced to work in cannabis farms to pay back debts of up to \u00a330,000 that their parents have undertaken in order for them to have a new life in Europe. </p> <p>\u201cThe modus operandi of criminal organisations is to target children or young adults, trafficking them across the world in a journey that can take months,\u201d Southwell says. \u201cThose being trafficked from Vietnam, often transit via Russia, Germany and France, by boat, lorry and even by foot. Once at their destination, they will be locked in a premises and made to tend the cannabis plants, by watering them and ensuring the lighting is on. These cannabis grows are sophisticated multi-million-pound drug operations, with the electricity often being extracted illegally and high-value equipment used. The windows of the buildings may be nailed shut. The farms normally operate in rural areas where the chance of detection is reduced.\u201d</p> <p>The boys and young men were in a form of debt bondage, but no matter how hard they worked, their debt never seemed to be paid off. \u201cThere is a misconception within the criminal justice system that they are free to leave because the doors may not always be locked,\u201d says Southwell, \u201cbut the reality is that they have nowhere to go \u2013 they are controlled through threats of violence, debt bondage, isolation, fear and other complex control methods that are regularly used by traffickers.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>From the Chinese opium dealers in the 1920s, the Italian gangsters in the 30s, the Maltese pimps in the 50s, the West Indian Yardies in the 60s, the Turkish heroin dealers in the 70s to the east Europeans gangsters and Nigerian fraudsters today, there has long been an unfair tendency to blame foreigners as dominant figures in the underworld. While they may have all had their parts to play, the homegrown British villain \u2013 whether artful dodger or ruthless kingpin \u2013 has always been the bedrock of the underworld.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone wants to be a gangster,\u201d says BX, a young former gang member from north-west London. \u201cEveryone\u2019s seen it on TV and that\u2019s what they want to be. They look at music videos and it looks like the people in them are making hundreds of thousands of pounds, although the reality is that they are still living at their mum\u2019s house. Most of them come from estates and they see their parents going to work, struggling to pay the bills. They come home, their mum\u2019s not there, and all the places where kids could play are closing down. Nine times out of 10, they leave school without qualifications. So if you\u2019re broke, if you can\u2019t get a job, you\u2019re going to take the opportunity. My parents had no clue what I was up to \u2013 I didn\u2019t come back with any marks on my face.\u201d</p> <p>The recent upsurge in knife attacks has focused attention on gangs. At one stage last year, there were six separate knife murder trials underway at the Old Bailey, all gang-related, all involving more than one defendant, none older than 22. \u201cIt\u2019s not a black thing, it\u2019s not a white thing, everyone\u2019s doing it,\u201d says BX. \u201cThere\u2019s no: \u2018I\u2019m black, he\u2019s white, we can\u2019t get along\u2019 any more.\u201d There were still ample opportunities for smaller-time dealers: \u201cYou can make a grand a week.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"afa972377d302592d0b6a21e08b0fc17e363899a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afa972377d302592d0b6a21e08b0fc17e363899a/0_0_2000_1376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An organised gang carrying out robberies on scooters in London in 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An organised gang carrying out robberies on scooters in London in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MET Police</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hierarchy of gangs remained a key factor. \u201cIf you\u2019re a drug dealer, you have to find people who will do your dirty work for you. The way it works is the elders, who are, say, 24 or 25, they see you doing well, so they might take you under their wing. The young kids acting as look-outs, they\u2019re thinking: \u2018I\u2019m part of that guy\u2019s enterprise. That could be me in however many years, I could get promotion.\u2019 As they say, loyalty brings forth royalty.\u201d</p> <p>Territory is important commercially. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing five keys (kilos) a week and then suddenly you\u2019re only doing three a week, it doesn\u2019t take long to realise that someone\u2019s out there taking your customers. So you have to eliminate the opposition. How do you do that? By either taking them out, or tipping off the police. You are never supposed to snitch, but I know one guy, from Southall, who\u2019s a millionaire now; he was in competition with a guy from the same area so he informed the police.\u201d There\u2019s a not-unfounded suspicion that some informers have continued to commit crimes while under police protection. \u201cAll the old-school rules \u2013 they\u2019re gone. I know people who work with the police to get immunity for themselves. I know one who everyone knows works with the police, he\u2019s even been shooting people, but you type his name into Google you won\u2019t find anything about him and, believe me, his record is way longer than my arm.\u201d</p> <p>The risks are high. \u201cOf the people I grew up with, only three of us haven\u2019t been to jail, although I\u2019ve been arrested many times. My older brother has been in and out of jail \u2013 nine months here, six weeks there. But there are less police than ever, so that gives you the incentive, and even if you get arrested, you\u2019re not going to do that long.\u201d</p> <p>While the young gangs have largely replaced the old family-based crews, so have young, helmeted, scooter-riding robbers smashing their ways into jewellers and mobile phone shops taken on the role of the old sawn-off shotgun-wielding bank robbers.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>While those smalltime home-grown villains may still thrive, an increasing number of members of the British underworld have followed old imperial traditions and headed abroad to cut out the middle-man, establishing themselves not only in the traditional bolt-hole of Spain, but in the Netherlands, Thailand and South Africa. The person who was to rewrite the rulebook on drug dealing is the street-smart Liverpudlian Curtis Warren, better known by his nicknames Cocky or the Cocky Watchman. Born in 1963, his criminal career started at the age of 12 with a conviction for car theft. By 16, he was on his way to borstal for assaulting the police. Other offences followed, but it was only when he moved into the drugs business, working out of Amsterdam, that he established his reputation as one of the most prolific traffickers of modern times \u2013 Interpol\u2019s \u201cTarget One\u201d and the subject of a joint British\u2013Dutch investigation codenamed Operation Crayfish.</p> <p>While Warren\u2019s move to Amsterdam, where fellow British dealers also established themselves, seemed like a smart idea in that he was less exposed to the British police, it was also a weakness, because the Dutch authorities were able to tap his phone without restriction and secure the evidence they needed. (Although they also required English help in translating Liverpudlian for them.) In October 1996, police in the Netherlands seized 400kg of cocaine, 60kg of heroin, 1,500kg of cannabis, handguns and false passports. Nine Britons and a Colombian were arrested, and Warren was soon portrayed as the biggest fish in the net. He was jailed for 12 years for a conspiracy to import what was claimed to be \u00a3125m of drugs into Britain. The Observer suggested he was \u201cthe richest and most successful British criminal who has ever been caught\u201d, and he was the only drug dealer to make it on to the Sunday Times rich list. T-shirts with an old mugshot of Warren on them were still for sale in Liverpool 20 years after Operation Crayfish.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"001733c3c79dcd1c8b7c89f02d75618828eaf3c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/001733c3c79dcd1c8b7c89f02d75618828eaf3c1/0_137_1001_1251/800.jpg\" alt=\"Curtis Warren.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Curtis Warren.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After his release from jail in the Netherlands in June 2007, Warren was only a free man for five weeks. He headed to Jersey, but was under constant surveillance and soon arrested. In 2009, he was convicted of conspiring to import \u00a31m of cannabis into Jersey and jailed for 13 years. Warren was alleged to have invested his wealth in everything from petrol stations to vineyards, football clubs to hotels. A Jersey court ordered him to pay \u00a3198m after he failed to prove his business empire was not built on the proceeds of cocaine trafficking. Detectives had secretly recorded him boasting during a 2004 prison visit of funnelling huge amounts of cash via a money launderer. \u201cFuckin\u2019 \u2019ell, mate, sometimes we\u2019d do about \u00a310m or \u00a315m in a week,\u201d he told some of his visitors. \u201cI was bragging like an idiot and just big-talking in front of them,\u201d was Warren\u2019s explanation later. The Jersey attorney general, Timothy Le Cocq QC, described him as \u201cone of Europe\u2019s most notorious organised criminals\u201d. His failure to pay the money resulted in a further 10 years\u2019 jail time.</p> <p>He told Guardian journalist Helen Pidd, when she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/30/curtis-cocky-warren-anti-drugs-believe\" title=\"\">interviewed him</a> in jail in Jersey, that he disapproved of drugs: \u201cI\u2019ve never had a cigarette in my life or a drink. I\u2019ve never tasted alcohol or anything. No interest.\u201d His ambition after he was freed was to leave England \u2013 \u201cand never come back\u201d. He added: \u201cI just wish I\u2019d not been such a worry to me mum.\u201d</p> <p>Few people were better qualified to comment on Warren than former NCA man Tony Saggers, who was an expert witness in Warren\u2019s trial and proceeds hearing. \u201cCurtis Warren was a forerunner,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get people like him who come from a tough background, a council-house environment, and he had a sort of bare-faced courage in some respects, to put himself in places like Venezuela and Colombia, which were probably even more dangerous then than they are now. He put himself at the other end of the supply chain, and in a way established that pattern for the elite drug trafficker. But nowadays, high-level, high-profile criminals play less and less of a role, and make use of others below them in a detached way.\u201d</p> <p>Other British criminals have also cast their nets wide during the past two decades. One of the best-known was Brian Wright, once one of Britain\u2019s most active cocaine smugglers, who was nicknamed The Milkman \u2013 because he always delivered. He operated from both Turkish-controlled Northern Cyprus and Spain. In 1998, he was alleged to have imported almost two tonnes of the drug, with the result, according to one customs investigator, that \u201cthe cocaine was coming in faster than people could snort it\u201d. The Dublin-born Wright owned a villa near Cadiz, which he named El Lechero \u2013 the Spanish for milkman \u2013 and had a box at Ascot, a flat in Chelsea\u2019s King\u2019s Quay and used some of his proceeds to fix races on which he then bet, thus laundering his drug profits. Finally arrested in Spain, he was brought back to England and, in 2007, at the age of 60, found guilty at Woolwich crown court of conspiracy to supply drugs and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/apr/03/drugsandalcohol.ukcrime\" title=\"\">jailed for </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/apr/03/drugsandalcohol.ukcrime\" title=\"\">30 years</a>.</p> <p>Some very successful scams have been perpetrated on elderly Britons. John Palmer, who had been involved in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jun/08/ukcrime\" title=\"\">Brink\u2019s-Mat bullion robbery</a> (from whence he got his nickname \u201cGoldfinger\u201d) made his fortune in a crooked timeshare business in Tenerife. A ruthless operator, he took advantage of thousands of gullible souls, many of them elderly holidaymakers, who believed his spiel about the fortunes they could make by investing in timeshare apartments that were never built. Outwardly, he appeared to have it all: the yacht, the cars with the personalised number plates, dozens of properties. He even made it to No 105 in the Sunday Times rich list. \u201cRemember the golden rule,\u201d was the motto he loved to quote, \u201che who has the gold makes the rules.\u201d But in 2001, he was convicted of a timeshare fraud in which 16,000 victims lost an estimated \u00a333m and served eight years in prison.</p> <p>Then, in 2015, Palmer was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/03/john-goldfinger-palmer-too-many-wounds-too-many-enemies\" title=\"\">shot dead</a> by a hitman in his garden in Essex. There were rumours that he was killed because he might have been cooperating with the Spanish police over another fraud case. His co-accused were convicted in Spain in May this year and the police in Britain have duly issued a fresh appeal for help to find his killer \u2013 with a reminder that there is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/21/john-goldfinger-palmer-murder-hunt-police-photos-partner\" title=\"\">\u00a3100,000 reward</a> on offer in case that tempts an elderly underworld grass.</p> <p>Any notion that Spain might still be a safe haven for expat criminals was dispelled in 2018 when Brian Charrington \u2013 a close associate of Curtis Warren and regarded as one of the major international drug dealers of his generation \u2013 was <a href=\"https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/11/14/inenglish/1542189923_692684.html\" title=\"\">jailed for </a><a href=\"https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/11/14/inenglish/1542189923_692684.html\" title=\"\">15 years</a> for trafficking and money-laundering in Alicante in 2018. Described in the Spanish press as \u201c<em>el narco que escrib\u00eda en Wikipedia</em>\u201d, because of his reputation for updating and correcting his Wikipedia entry, the former car-dealer from Middlesbrough had been arrested in 2013 at his villa in Calpe, on the Costa Blanca, an area where some estate agents offer bulletproof glass as a special feature along with the spa bath and barbecue area. There had been wild rumours of crocodiles in his swimming pool, but disappointingly, the police found none.</p> <p>Charrington was alleged to have brought vast quantities of drugs into Spain via a yacht docking in Altea, north of Benidorm. He claimed his money came legitimately. \u201cI buy and sell villas and I pay my taxes,\u201d he told the court, but was still fined nearly \u00a330m. Following a lengthy investigation involving Spanish, British, Venezuelan, Colombian and French police, his assets, including a dozen houses and his cars and boats, were impounded. After his sentence, his Wikipedia entry was speedily updated.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The titles of true crime memoirs published in the past decade or so tell their own tale. The Last Real Gangster by Freddie Foreman came out in 2015; The Last Gangster: My Final Confession by Charlie Richardson arrived just after his death in 2012; The Last Godfather, the Life and Crimes of Arthur Thompson, was published in Glasgow in 2007. A requiem for the old British underworld.</p> <p>In many ways, it was already slipping into a haze of nostalgia. The television series Peaky Blinders has spawned its own fashion accessory industry. You can now buy Peaky Blinders cufflinks shaped like razor-blades, or wear a Peaky Blinders cap and waistcoat from the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jan/06/david-beckhams-menswear-label-doffs-cap-peaky-blinders-kent-curwen\" title=\"\">David Beckham clothing line</a>, something that might have prompted a dark smile from the ruthless and acquisitive 1920s Birmingham gang on whom the series was based. The website henorstag.com even recommends \u201cthe Peaky Blinders look\u201d as perfect for a stag night: \u201cFor a theme the ladies will love, you will need to capture the stylish world of the early 20th century with black peak caps, stylish grey or black suits with waistcoat, as well as a dusty black coat and shoes in order to complete the look.\u201d (Add a cosh and a cut-throat razor and you\u2019ll really slay \u2019em.)</p> <p>While the Kray twins brand continues as the underworld\u2019s equivalent of Marks &amp; Spencer \u2013 a framed letter from Ronnie Kray in Broadmoor is currently on offer on eBay for \u00a3650 \u2013 changes in the law have made criminals less prepared to boast about past crimes. In the old days, under the \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d rule, once you were acquitted of a murder, you could never be tried for it again. That rule was overturned with the 2003 Criminal Justice Act, so the days when a villain could explain in their memoirs how they got away with a crime have gone. The 2009 Coroners and Justice Act made it an offence for criminals to profit from accounts of their crimes, so they could no longer sell their stories, or at least officially. The 2002 Proceeds of Crime Act and its increasing use against career criminals has meant that illicit incomes can be seized.</p> <p>No wonder the Hatton Garden burglary of 2015 \u2013 that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/23/one-last-job-inside-story-of-the-hatton-garden-heist\" title=\"\">one last job</a>\u201d carried out by the elderly \u201cdiamond wheezers\u201d \u2013 received such attention.

      "bodyText": "Who rules the underworld today, and where do they conduct their business? Once there were the familiar mugshots and Runyonesque nicknames, the clubs and pubs where the usual suspects gathered, plotted and schemed. Now organised crime is run like any other business, and its leading figures look like every other broker or tycoon. We have entered into a world of what Sir Rob Wainwright, until recently Europe\u2019s most senior police officer, calls \u201canonymised\u201d crime. The underworld has become the overworld. The National Crime Agency has estimated that \u00a390bn of criminal money is being laundered through the UK every year, 4% of the country\u2019s GDP. London has become the global capital of money-laundering and the beating heart of European organised crime. English is now the international underworld\u2019s lingua franca. Crime is an essential part of the British economy, providing hundreds of thousands of jobs, not just for professional criminals \u2013 the NCA reckons there are 4,629 organised crime groups in operation \u2013 but for police and prison officers, lawyers and court officials, and a security business that now employs more than half a million people. Just as the names of familiar shops have been departing from the high street, the old family firms of criminals are disappearing, whether in London, Glasgow, Newcastle or Manchester. And just as British football fans have had to learn how to pronounce the names of the legions of new foreign players, detectives have had to learn to do the same for the increasing number of new criminals. Britain was once dealing with drugs imports from half a dozen countries; now it is more than 30. A young person who would in the past have sought an apprenticeship in a trade or industry may now find that drug dealing offers better career prospects. And, apart from drugs and guns, British trading channels now facilitate the trafficking of women from eastern Europe and Africa for prostitution and children from Vietnam as low-level drug workers. The underworld\u2019s modus operandi has shifted in the past quarter century. \u201cThe international nature of crime and technology are probably the two biggest changes,\u201d says Steve Rodhouse, the NCA\u2019s head of operations. Speaking at the NCA\u2019s unprepossessing headquarters in Vauxhall, south London, Rodhouse explains how the agency\u2019s work has mushroomed. \u201cPretty much all of the NCA\u2019s most significant \u2018high-harm\u2019 operations now involve people, commodities or money transferring across international borders. The days of having a drugs gang, a firearms gang or a people-trafficking gang have changed because of the concept of polycriminality. Groups satisfying criminal markets, whatever they may be, is now much more common. These are businesses and people are looking to exploit markets, so why confine yourself to one market?\u201d Wainwright, who served as Europol chief for nine years, has also noted this internationalisation of crime. Addressing a Police Foundation gathering just after his retirement last year, he said that Europol, the European equivalent of Interpol, having expanded since its foundation in 1998 when \u201cit consisted literally, of two men and a dog \u2013 admittedly, a sniffer dog \u2013 in Luxembourg,\u201d now dealt with 65,000 cases a year. By 2018, he reckoned that 5,000 organised crime groups were operating across Europe and the mafia model had been replaced by a \u201cmore nimble\u201d model, with 180 different nationalities operating, mixing legal with illegal business and working with between 400 and 500 major money-launderers. This was multinational business with specialists in recruitment, movement, money-laundering and the forging of documents. The internet, of course, is a major factor. Wainwright likened its effect on crime to that of the motorcar in the 1920s and 30s, when suddenly criminals could escape at speed and take advantage of new markets. He cited the dark web, which he said was selling 350,000 different illegal items \u2013 60% of which were drugs \u2013 but including everything from guns to pornography and even operating a ratings system for speed of dispatch and quality. The combination of new faces of whom the British police \u2013 and often Interpol and Europol \u2013 were unaware, along with an increasingly tech-savvy pool of criminals able to disguise their identities, made for a toxic cocktail. Crooks anonymous. * * * One group with little interest in anonymity are the Hellbanianz, a gang of cocky young Albanians based in Barking, east London. They went online in spectacular fashion in 2017 via Instagram and YouTube rap videos to flaunt their ill-gotten wealth and firepower. Their most prominent member, Tristen Asllani, who lived in Hampstead, was jailed for 25 years in 2016 for drug dealing and firearms offences which included possessing a \u0160korpion submachine gun. He was caught after a police chase in north London which ended when he crashed his car into a computer repair shop in Crouch End. A photo of Asllani, showing him stripped to the waist after he had apparently spent long hours in the prison gym, appeared on a social media page called My Albanian in Jail, with a caption saying \u201cEven inside the prison we have all conditions, what\u2019s missing are only whores\u201d. The flashy cars and bundles of banknotes on display in the Hellbanianz videos were the result of the importation of cocaine and cannabis, but the gang was also involved in the weapons trade. The pictures showed \u00a350 notes wrapped around a cake and their HB logo written in cannabis. After they were arrested and jailed, other gang members have posted pictures of themselves, taken with smuggled mobile phones, from inside prison where they cheerfully inscribe their gang name on the walls. Muhamed Veliu, an Albanian investigative journalist, who knows London well, says that the Hellbanianz have been on the crime scene in east London for many years. \u201cThey are sending a bad message to young Albanians. By seeing such photos, they think the streets of UK are paved with gold \u2026 Bizarrely, despite the fact they are in the prison, they show the outside world photos of their life behind the bars.\u201d He said that there was a concern that the British media stereotyped all Albanians as criminals but, he added, the 2006 Securitas robbery, in which two Albanians played key roles in the theft of \u00a353m from a depot in Kent, was regarded with some national pride back home. \u201cIt was \u2018the crime of the century\u2019, it was seen as very different from making money from prostitution, which is the lowest form of crime. It is wrong, of course, but they did need bravery to get involved, and at least they went for a bank \u2013 that was the feeling in the Albanian community.\u201d There are currently around 700 Albanians in British jails. \u201cAlbania is Europe\u2019s largest producer of cannabis,\u201d says Tony Saggers, the former head of drugs threat and intelligence at the NCA. \u201cIt is important not to stereotype, but the Kosovan war led to Albanians pretending to be Kosovan in order to get asylum in the UK. Many of the people who came just wanted a better life, but there were criminals among them who were able to set up illicit networks \u2026 The UK criminal has a get-rich-quick mentality while the Albanians\u2019 strategy was get-rich-slow, so they have driven down the price of cocaine in the UK. They knew that if they expanded, they could undercut the market.\u201d It helped that their reputation preceded them. \u201cThe Albanian criminals may be ruthless and potentially murderous when controlling their organised crime,\u201d said Saggers, \u201cbut when they come to the UK they try to be more charismatic and they use fear \u2013 \u2018We\u2019re here, we need to get on,\u2019 that sort of approach. So there is little violence from the older Albanian criminals in the UK, because they know that violence attracts more attention.\u201d The Albanians had already established themselves in a darker fashion when 26-year-old Luan Plackici was jailed in 2003 and said to have made more than \u00a31m from trafficking \u201cpoor, naive and gullible\u201d young women who thought they were on their way to jobs as waitresses or barmaids. Some had to service up to 20 men a day to pay for the \u00a38,000 \u201ctravel bill\u201d from Romania and Moldova. The international nature of people-trafficking was exposed fully in 2014 by a trial of a gang that imported more than 100 women into Britain. The trial ended with the gang leader, Vishal Chaudhary, being jailed for 12 years. Chaudhary, who lived the high life in Canary Wharf in London, contacted young women through social networks in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, offering work as receptionists, nannies or cleaners in England. But when they got to the UK, the women were forced to work in brothels. Chaudhary\u2019s team, all of whom were jailed, consisted of his brother, Kunal, who worked for Deloitte in Manchester, a Hungarian heavy called Krisztian Abel and the latter\u2019s sister, Szilvia, who helped recruit the women. There are numbers of young people involved in what the legal system terms \u201cforced criminality\u201d. The lawyer Philippa Southwell has specialised in such cases, which apply in particular to young Vietnamese people brought illegally into the UK by traffickers and forced to work in cannabis farms to pay back debts of up to \u00a330,000 that their parents have undertaken in order for them to have a new life in Europe. \u201cThe modus operandi of criminal organisations is to target children or young adults, trafficking them across the world in a journey that can take months,\u201d Southwell says. \u201cThose being trafficked from Vietnam, often transit via Russia, Germany and France, by boat, lorry and even by foot. Once at their destination, they will be locked in a premises and made to tend the cannabis plants, by watering them and ensuring the lighting is on. These cannabis grows are sophisticated multi-million-pound drug operations, with the electricity often being extracted illegally and high-value equipment used. The windows of the buildings may be nailed shut. The farms normally operate in rural areas where the chance of detection is reduced.\u201d The boys and young men were in a form of debt bondage, but no matter how hard they worked, their debt never seemed to be paid off. \u201cThere is a misconception within the criminal justice system that they are free to leave because the doors may not always be locked,\u201d says Southwell, \u201cbut the reality is that they have nowhere to go \u2013 they are controlled through threats of violence, debt bondage, isolation, fear and other complex control methods that are regularly used by traffickers.\u201d * * * From the Chinese opium dealers in the 1920s, the Italian gangsters in the 30s, the Maltese pimps in the 50s, the West Indian Yardies in the 60s, the Turkish heroin dealers in the 70s to the east Europeans gangsters and Nigerian fraudsters today, there has long been an unfair tendency to blame foreigners as dominant figures in the underworld. While they may have all had their parts to play, the homegrown British villain \u2013 whether artful dodger or ruthless kingpin \u2013 has always been the bedrock of the underworld. \u201cEveryone wants to be a gangster,\u201d says BX, a young former gang member from north-west London. \u201cEveryone\u2019s seen it on TV and that\u2019s what they want to be. They look at music videos and it looks like the people in them are making hundreds of thousands of pounds, although the reality is that they are still living at their mum\u2019s house. Most of them come from estates and they see their parents going to work, struggling to pay the bills. They come home, their mum\u2019s not there, and all the places where kids could play are closing down. Nine times out of 10, they leave school without qualifications. So if you\u2019re broke, if you can\u2019t get a job, you\u2019re going to take the opportunity. My parents had no clue what I was up to \u2013 I didn\u2019t come back with any marks on my face.\u201d The recent upsurge in knife attacks has focused attention on gangs. At one stage last year, there were six separate knife murder trials underway at the Old Bailey, all gang-related, all involving more than one defendant, none older than 22. \u201cIt\u2019s not a black thing, it\u2019s not a white thing, everyone\u2019s doing it,\u201d says BX. \u201cThere\u2019s no: \u2018I\u2019m black, he\u2019s white, we can\u2019t get along\u2019 any more.\u201d There were still ample opportunities for smaller-time dealers: \u201cYou can make a grand a week.\u201d The hierarchy of gangs remained a key factor. \u201cIf you\u2019re a drug dealer, you have to find people who will do your dirty work for you. The way it works is the elders, who are, say, 24 or 25, they see you doing well, so they might take you under their wing. The young kids acting as look-outs, they\u2019re thinking: \u2018I\u2019m part of that guy\u2019s enterprise. That could be me in however many years, I could get promotion.\u2019 As they say, loyalty brings forth royalty.\u201d Territory is important commercially. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing five keys (kilos) a week and then suddenly you\u2019re only doing three a week, it doesn\u2019t take long to realise that someone\u2019s out there taking your customers. So you have to eliminate the opposition. How do you do that? By either taking them out, or tipping off the police. You are never supposed to snitch, but I know one guy, from Southall, who\u2019s a millionaire now; he was in competition with a guy from the same area so he informed the police.\u201d There\u2019s a not-unfounded suspicion that some informers have continued to commit crimes while under police protection. \u201cAll the old-school rules \u2013 they\u2019re gone. I know people who work with the police to get immunity for themselves. I know one who everyone knows works with the police, he\u2019s even been shooting people, but you type his name into Google you won\u2019t find anything about him and, believe me, his record is way longer than my arm.\u201d The risks are high. \u201cOf the people I grew up with, only three of us haven\u2019t been to jail, although I\u2019ve been arrested many times. My older brother has been in and out of jail \u2013 nine months here, six weeks there. But there are less police than ever, so that gives you the incentive, and even if you get arrested, you\u2019re not going to do that long.\u201d While the young gangs have largely replaced the old family-based crews, so have young, helmeted, scooter-riding robbers smashing their ways into jewellers and mobile phone shops taken on the role of the old sawn-off shotgun-wielding bank robbers. * * * While those smalltime home-grown villains may still thrive, an increasing number of members of the British underworld have followed old imperial traditions and headed abroad to cut out the middle-man, establishing themselves not only in the traditional bolt-hole of Spain, but in the Netherlands, Thailand and South Africa. The person who was to rewrite the rulebook on drug dealing is the street-smart Liverpudlian Curtis Warren, better known by his nicknames Cocky or the Cocky Watchman. Born in 1963, his criminal career started at the age of 12 with a conviction for car theft. By 16, he was on his way to borstal for assaulting the police. Other offences followed, but it was only when he moved into the drugs business, working out of Amsterdam, that he established his reputation as one of the most prolific traffickers of modern times \u2013 Interpol\u2019s \u201cTarget One\u201d and the subject of a joint British\u2013Dutch investigation codenamed Operation Crayfish. While Warren\u2019s move to Amsterdam, where fellow British dealers also established themselves, seemed like a smart idea in that he was less exposed to the British police, it was also a weakness, because the Dutch authorities were able to tap his phone without restriction and secure the evidence they needed. (Although they also required English help in translating Liverpudlian for them.) In October 1996, police in the Netherlands seized 400kg of cocaine, 60kg of heroin, 1,500kg of cannabis, handguns and false passports. Nine Britons and a Colombian were arrested, and Warren was soon portrayed as the biggest fish in the net. He was jailed for 12 years for a conspiracy to import what was claimed to be \u00a3125m of drugs into Britain. The Observer suggested he was \u201cthe richest and most successful British criminal who has ever been caught\u201d, and he was the only drug dealer to make it on to the Sunday Times rich list. T-shirts with an old mugshot of Warren on them were still for sale in Liverpool 20 years after Operation Crayfish. After his release from jail in the Netherlands in June 2007, Warren was only a free man for five weeks. He headed to Jersey, but was under constant surveillance and soon arrested. In 2009, he was convicted of conspiring to import \u00a31m of cannabis into Jersey and jailed for 13 years. Warren was alleged to have invested his wealth in everything from petrol stations to vineyards, football clubs to hotels. A Jersey court ordered him to pay \u00a3198m after he failed to prove his business empire was not built on the proceeds of cocaine trafficking. Detectives had secretly recorded him boasting during a 2004 prison visit of funnelling huge amounts of cash via a money launderer. \u201cFuckin\u2019 \u2019ell, mate, sometimes we\u2019d do about \u00a310m or \u00a315m in a week,\u201d he told some of his visitors. \u201cI was bragging like an idiot and just big-talking in front of them,\u201d was Warren\u2019s explanation later. The Jersey attorney general, Timothy Le Cocq QC, described him as \u201cone of Europe\u2019s most notorious organised criminals\u201d. His failure to pay the money resulted in a further 10 years\u2019 jail time. He told Guardian journalist Helen Pidd, when she interviewed him in jail in Jersey, that he disapproved of drugs: \u201cI\u2019ve never had a cigarette in my life or a drink. I\u2019ve never tasted alcohol or anything. No interest.\u201d His ambition after he was freed was to leave England \u2013 \u201cand never come back\u201d. He added: \u201cI just wish I\u2019d not been such a worry to me mum.\u201d Few people were better qualified to comment on Warren than former NCA man Tony Saggers, who was an expert witness in Warren\u2019s trial and proceeds hearing. \u201cCurtis Warren was a forerunner,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get people like him who come from a tough background, a council-house environment, and he had a sort of bare-faced courage in some respects, to put himself in places like Venezuela and Colombia, which were probably even more dangerous then than they are now. He put himself at the other end of the supply chain, and in a way established that pattern for the elite drug trafficker. But nowadays, high-level, high-profile criminals play less and less of a role, and make use of others below them in a detached way.\u201d Other British criminals have also cast their nets wide during the past two decades. One of the best-known was Brian Wright, once one of Britain\u2019s most active cocaine smugglers, who was nicknamed The Milkman \u2013 because he always delivered. He operated from both Turkish-controlled Northern Cyprus and Spain. In 1998, he was alleged to have imported almost two tonnes of the drug, with the result, according to one customs investigator, that \u201cthe cocaine was coming in faster than people could snort it\u201d. The Dublin-born Wright owned a villa near Cadiz, which he named El Lechero \u2013 the Spanish for milkman \u2013 and had a box at Ascot, a flat in Chelsea\u2019s King\u2019s Quay and used some of his proceeds to fix races on which he then bet, thus laundering his drug profits. Finally arrested in Spain, he was brought back to England and, in 2007, at the age of 60, found guilty at Woolwich crown court of conspiracy to supply drugs and jailed for 30 years. Some very successful scams have been perpetrated on elderly Britons. John Palmer, who had been involved in the Brink\u2019s-Mat bullion robbery (from whence he got his nickname \u201cGoldfinger\u201d) made his fortune in a crooked timeshare business in Tenerife. A ruthless operator, he took advantage of thousands of gullible souls, many of them elderly holidaymakers, who believed his spiel about the fortunes they could make by investing in timeshare apartments that were never built. Outwardly, he appeared to have it all: the yacht, the cars with the personalised number plates, dozens of properties. He even made it to No 105 in the Sunday Times rich list. \u201cRemember the golden rule,\u201d was the motto he loved to quote, \u201che who has the gold makes the rules.\u201d But in 2001, he was convicted of a timeshare fraud in which 16,000 victims lost an estimated \u00a333m and served eight years in prison. Then, in 2015, Palmer was shot dead by a hitman in his garden in Essex. There were rumours that he was killed because he might have been cooperating with the Spanish police over another fraud case. His co-accused were convicted in Spain in May this year and the police in Britain have duly issued a fresh appeal for help to find his killer \u2013 with a reminder that there is a \u00a3100,000 reward on offer in case that tempts an elderly underworld grass. Any notion that Spain might still be a safe haven for expat criminals was dispelled in 2018 when Brian Charrington \u2013 a close associate of Curtis Warren and regarded as one of the major international drug dealers of his generation \u2013 was jailed for 15 years for trafficking and money-laundering in Alicante in 2018. Described in the Spanish press as \u201cel narco que escrib\u00eda en Wikipedia\u201d, because of his reputation for updating and correcting his Wikipedia entry, the former car-dealer from Middlesbrough had been arrested in 2013 at his villa in Calpe, on the Costa Blanca, an area where some estate agents offer bulletproof glass as a special feature along with the spa bath and barbecue area. There had been wild rumours of crocodiles in his swimming pool, but disappointingly, the police found none. Charrington was alleged to have brought vast quantities of drugs into Spain via a yacht docking in Altea, north of Benidorm. He claimed his money came legitimately. \u201cI buy and sell villas and I pay my taxes,\u201d he told the court, but was still fined nearly \u00a330m. Following a lengthy investigation involving Spanish, British, Venezuelan, Colombian and French police, his assets, including a dozen houses and his cars and boats, were impounded. After his sentence, his Wikipedia entry was speedily updated. * * * The titles of true crime memoirs published in the past decade or so tell their own tale. The Last Real Gangster by Freddie Foreman came out in 2015; The Last Gangster: My Final Confession by Charlie Richardson arrived just after his death in 2012; The Last Godfather, the Life and Crimes of Arthur Thompson, was published in Glasgow in 2007. A requiem for the old British underworld. In many ways, it was already slipping into a haze of nostalgia. The television series Peaky Blinders has spawned its own fashion accessory industry. You can now buy Peaky Blinders cufflinks shaped like razor-blades, or wear a Peaky Blinders cap and waistcoat from the new David Beckham clothing line, something that might have prompted a dark smile from the ruthless and acquisitive 1920s Birmingham gang on whom the series was based. The website henorstag.com even recommends \u201cthe Peaky Blinders look\u201d as perfect for a stag night: \u201cFor a theme the ladies will love, you will need to capture the stylish world of the early 20th century with black peak caps, stylish grey or black suits with waistcoat, as well as a dusty black coat and shoes in order to complete the look.\u201d (Add a cosh and a cut-throat razor and you\u2019ll really slay \u2019em.) While the Kray twins brand continues as the underworld\u2019s equivalent of Marks &amp; Spencer \u2013 a framed letter from Ronnie Kray in Broadmoor is currently on offer on eBay for \u00a3650 \u2013 changes in the law have made criminals less prepared to boast about past crimes. In the old days, under the \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d rule, once you were acquitted of a murder, you could never be tried for it again. That rule was overturned with the 2003 Criminal Justice Act, so the days when a villain could explain in their memoirs how they got away with a crime have gone. The 2009 Coroners and Justice Act made it an offence for criminals to profit from accounts of their crimes, so they could no longer sell their stories, or at least officially. The 2002 Proceeds of Crime Act and its increasing use against career criminals has meant that illicit incomes can be seized. No wonder the Hatton Garden burglary of 2015 \u2013 that \u201cone last job\u201d carried out by the elderly \u201cdiamond wheezers\u201d \u2013 received such attention. Even one of the \u201clast of the last\u201d, Fred Foreman, was hoping he was going to be offered a role in it. \u201cI heard that Terry (Perkins, one of the ringleaders) was looking for me, not long before the burglary took place, so I presume that would have been what it was about,\u201d he says. Perkins died in his cell in Belmarsh prison last year. Foreman, who made his name with the Krays in the 1960s, now lives in sheltered accomodation in west London. He doubts that the current generation of gangsters will ever write their memoirs: \u201cI don\u2019t think that anyone who has turned to crime these days is going to live long enough to build up a reputation, are they?\u201d But the recruiting sergeants of the underworld \u2013 poverty, greed, boredom, envy, peer pressure, glamour \u2013 will never be short of volunteers, whether they live long enough to make a name for themselves or not.

It\u2019s a work of architectural history and criticism but it can also be read as a history of baseball or of America and its cities. To Goldberger, the game and the buildings dedicated to it are as essential to American society as they are symbolic products of it.</p> <h2>The beginnings</h2> <p>Discussing baseball\u2019s beginnings, Goldberger says: \u201cIt did not spring like Athena from the head of Zeus.\u201d It\u2019s an appropriate phrase, as he\u2019s speaking from a Greek island where he\u2019ll deliver a lecture.</p> <p>Versions of the game came together over time. The familiar story that baseball was devised by <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Abner_Doubleday\">Abner Doubleday</a> and \u201cplayed in the fields in Cooperstown, New York\u201d, Goldberger says, is \u201ca longstanding myth that has its roots in a very conscious attempt in the late 19th century to position the game as connected to a more elite and already vanished America\u201d.</p> <p>As he shows, much early baseball was in fact suburban, played in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/book-review/ballpark-baseball\">elysian fields</a>\u201d nonetheless close to the margins of cities. It was rackety and contradictory and competing groups fought to exert control. Like America itself.</p> <p>In the early 20th century the game shifted gears, building beloved city ballparks like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/27/how-the-brooklyn-dodgers-and-baseball-shaped-bernie-sanders-world-view\">Ebbetts Field in Brooklyn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ballparksofbaseball.com/ballparks/shibe-park/\">Shibe Park in Philadelphia</a>.

But they generally evolve in fits and starts and steps, not in one single project after which everything else is completely different. But that certainly was the case with Camden Yards.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Baseball integrates beautifully into cities</p> <footer> <cite>Paul Goldberger</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/orioles/ballpark\">Oriole Park at Camden Yards</a>, to give it its full name, replaced <a href=\"https://www.ballparksofbaseball.com/ballparks/memorial-stadium/\">Memorial Stadium</a>, a towering suburban venue.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThe ballpark,\u201d Paul Goldberger says, \u201cis a symbolic resolution of two things that remain unresolved in American culture.\u201d The Pulitzer-winning critic is referring to urban and rural life, the city and the country, tensions he explores in his new book, Ballpark: Baseball and the American City. It is an engrossing read, starting in the teeming 19th century, soaring through baseball\u2019s gilded age in the first half of the 20th and ending among the roofs, aircon and policed corporate spaces of the new millennium. It\u2019s a work of architectural history and criticism but it can also be read as a history of baseball or of America and its cities. To Goldberger, the game and the buildings dedicated to it are as essential to American society as they are symbolic products of it. The beginnings Discussing baseball\u2019s beginnings, Goldberger says: \u201cIt did not spring like Athena from the head of Zeus.\u201d It\u2019s an appropriate phrase, as he\u2019s speaking from a Greek island where he\u2019ll deliver a lecture. Versions of the game came together over time. The familiar story that baseball was devised by Abner Doubleday and \u201cplayed in the fields in Cooperstown, New York\u201d, Goldberger says, is \u201ca longstanding myth that has its roots in a very conscious attempt in the late 19th century to position the game as connected to a more elite and already vanished America\u201d. As he shows, much early baseball was in fact suburban, played in \u201celysian fields\u201d nonetheless close to the margins of cities. It was rackety and contradictory and competing groups fought to exert control. Like America itself. In the early 20th century the game shifted gears, building beloved city ballparks like Ebbetts Field in Brooklyn and Shibe Park in Philadelphia. Both are gone but in Chicago and Boston, Wrigley Field and Fenway Park continue to pull in the fans. Then came the mid-20th century when the game went national, the stakes were raised and what Goldberger calls \u201cconcrete doughnuts\u201d, multi-use stadiums that sacrificed character to the car in seas of suburban parking, were the decidedly soulless result. The modern age Baltimore plays a key part in Goldberger\u2019s book, its ballpark, built in 1992, showing how the game returned to the cities. \u201cAll types of buildings evolve,\u201d he says. \u201cAirports, hospitals, houses, schools and so on. But they generally evolve in fits and starts and steps, not in one single project after which everything else is completely different. But that certainly was the case with Camden Yards.\u201d Oriole Park at Camden Yards, to give it its full name, replaced Memorial Stadium, a towering suburban venue. The new building did not have to host football too so its architects considered the best of traditional ballparks as well as the fans and their corporate masters. They took an industrial site in a post-industrial city and used it without sacrificing heritage or history. \u201cOne cannot underestimate its importance,\u201d Goldberger says. \u201c[The political commentator] George Will said there were three great defining events in baseball in postwar America. There was Jackie Robinson [the first African American to play in the majors, in 1947] and the integration of major league teams with the [Brooklyn] Dodgers. There was the arrival of free agency and the change in the whole economic structure in 1975. And there was the opening of Camden Yards in 1992. I think he\u2019s absolutely right.\u201d Camden Yards is on an old rail site, which leads to another key point. \u201cWhile the railroads did not need baseball,\u201d Goldberger says, \u201cbaseball needed the railroads. At first the various teams around Brooklyn and New York all played each other and could easily organize that. But you couldn\u2019t organize a regular league with teams in Philadelphia playing teams in Cincinnati, which in turn would play a team in St Louis and Chicago, and Boston, and so forth, without the rise of inter-city train travel. So they went hand in hand. \u201cIn the same way, it\u2019s no accident that the move of the Dodgers out of Brooklyn [to Los Angeles] and the [New York] Giants\u2019 move to California came [in 1958], when transcontinental jet travel became a practicality. \u201cSo you know, while [transportation] is not an important social issue in the way that racial issues, issues of immigration and class tensions are, it is just further reminder that baseball seems to connect in unexpected ways to all kinds of other things.\u201d The future At the end of his book, Goldberger considers the privatisation of public space, a concern in many cities today. He casts an eye over SunTrust Park in Atlanta, an exurban setting where the Braves have built a facsimile of an urban space, ersatz, controllable and financially worth their while. Back in New York, there\u2019s Hudson Yards and a ballpark that never was. The Yankees and Mets looked at the railroad site on the west side of Manhattan but nothing came together. What did open this year: a mesh of condo towers and malls with a sculpture dropped in the middle. Goldberger contends that unlike condos, offices and malls, \u201cbaseball integrates beautifully into cities\u201d, which is \u201creally the essential point of the book\u201d. In short, he wishes the Yankees or Mets had succeeded. \u201cI would love to have seen it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would have inoculated the developer very successfully against the not unreasonable claims that Hudson Yards is an enclave for the rich. It would have created a far better reason than Thomas Heatherwick\u2019s sculpture for people to show up, to come there and walk around. \u201cIt would\u2019ve left plenty of room for gazillion-dollar condos. It would not have gotten in the way, it would not have presented the programme of Hudson Yards that we now see. It would\u2019ve just been integrated a little bit more effectively, you know? \u201cImagine if we had had a ballpark instead of a shopping mall, which is the last thing anybody needs or wants.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

It\u2019s my job.\u201d \u201cIt must be so stressful,\u201d I replied. \u201cIt is very stressful,\u201d he agreed. I rub shoulders and share studios all the time with politicians whose job it is to make difficult decisions as to who gets what. Must be tough, but not half as tough as being one of the many public sector workers who have to make the big calls on the ground, while breathing the same air as those they sit in judgment on. We shook hands and I asked him what he was up to that evening. \u201cJust telly, I suppose,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s a school night.\u201d \u2022 Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>It is a bold and often ostentatious choice, but historical dressing can be more than just a novelty means of self-expression. As with any clothes, they are a way of presenting ourselves to the world. And for some, that means wearing top hats, breeches, doublets, or Bakelite jewellery. Below, six period dressers explain their choices:</p> <h2>Zack MacLeod Pinsent, 25<br>Regency period<br></h2> <p>These are everyday clothes of the early 19th century. I never leave the house without a hat and I tend to walk around with a cane, too. A lot of what I wear at the moment is Regency style.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been dressing alternatively since I was 14 because modern fashion has never appealed to me. I wanted to look back to a time when things were of a higher quality and wear clothes that would make me stand out. I began wearing late-Victorian and Edwardian stuff bought in vintage shops in Brighton and it made me genuinely happy. I got into the Regency look because I was invited to a Regency ball in London and had nothing to wear. I tried to make something myself, but realised it was terrible since I couldn\u2019t find the right fabrics, so I decided to research the history and develop my own skills.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b01S7EBQztk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b01S7EBQztk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>   <p>The Regency period was the last hurrah of men\u2019s fun with fashion, when people could be loud with colour and exuberant. The jackets, cravats, trousers \u2013 all of it is just wonderful to wear. It\u2019s comfortable, too, and since I make it all myself, it makes me proud to have it on. It\u2019s also a great ice-breaker.</p> <p>My clothes take time and it\u2019s all about learning to be slow, rather than buying into fast fashion, which is unethical and so removed from the production process. You are who you are and you have to get on with it; I feel very much at home in what I wear and how I wear it.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t really had any backlash \u2013 people have been very inquisitive and polite to me.

When I was in my early 20s, I was living in Australia and I started going to secondhand shops because I didn\u2019t have much money. I realised I could buy all the princess dresses that I loved as a little girl cheaply; so I started with 1980s clothes and then worked my way back, before settling on the 40s as my style. It\u2019s more comfortable for me and it\u2019s very girly; when I cut my hair short, I didn\u2019t want to look boyish, so these clothes are lovely and feminine.</p> <p>When I dress, it makes me feel like myself. I\u2019m in awe of people who look good in just a white T-shirt and jeans, but this style gives me that comfort. Dressing up brings so much joy into my life: sometimes, when I\u2019m sad, I just want to wear colourful clothes because they cheer me up and make me want to go out.</p> <p>In my experience, it\u2019s rare to see people of colour in the vintage scene. I think it might be because we\u2019re already minorities, so we don\u2019t want to draw more attention to ourselves by virtue of the clothes we\u2019re wearing. I grew up with being westernised as the goal, and vintage clothing from my culture highlights the fact that I\u2019m different and, in the current political climate, perhaps sometimes we don\u2019t want to be different.</p> <p>The most important thing is that people wear clothes that are more sustainable and that they use them.

It\u2019s a far more glamorous era than the one we live in now; things can feel so scruffy with just T-shirts and jeans around. Wearing those clothes makes me feel as if I\u2019m inhabiting a different time and they\u2019re such exciting, unique pieces to own. It is important to buy clothes that suit you and your shape, which also bring something distinctive to your day.",

The researchers found witness testimony suggesting there were more than 70 prisoners per barrack, more than double the official number of 30.</p> <p>In common with other prisoner of war camps in Britain, Lodge Moor saw its share of drama.

One prisoner, Gerhardt Rettig, was chased around the Nissen huts by hundreds of inmates and beaten to a pulp after being suspected of tipping off Allied guards about a planned break-out in March 1945. Rettig later died in prison and his alleged killers were put on trial in London later that year. Two men, Armin Keuhne, 18, and Emil Schmittendorf, 31, were found guilty of his murder and executed by hanging at Pentonville prison in November 1945.</p> <p>The students involved in the study said they hoped their findings would be used to preserve and restore the site and the surrounding woodland. Georgina Goodison, an archaeology student involved in the project, said: \u201cIt was a big eye opener for me, as I didn\u2019t realise that Lodge Moor camp even exists. The woodland hides it well. It hides the secrets of all the thousands of men who were housed there merely decades ago.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The forgotten history of what was once Britain\u2019s biggest prisoner of war camp has been unearthed by archaeologists in the South Yorkshire countryside. At its peak in the second world war, Lodge Moor camp near Sheffield held more than 11,000 mostly German captives. Its extraordinary stories have been overlooked for more than 60 years as its moss-covered remains were shrouded in thick woodland. Research by archaeology students shows the camp was used to hold the most fanatical of prisoners during the second world war, many of whom were from Germany, Italy and the Ukraine. Analysing camp records, witness statements and surveying the prison\u2019s weathered remains for the first time, the University of Sheffield students found the camp held more than 11,000 people at its peak in 1944. But it was during the first world war that the prison, formally known as Prisoner of War Camp 17, held its most infamous inmate. Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz was the captain of several German U-boats who was captured by Allied forces when his vessel, U-boat 68, was forced to surface in October 1918. The admiral spent about six weeks at the Sheffield camp, according to the research, before feigning mental illness to avoid being treated as a war criminal. D\u00f6nitz was released back to Germany, where he rose to become commander of Hitler\u2019s U-boats and head of the German navy, before going on to succeed Hitler as president of the German Reich. Lodge Moor was one of about 1,500 prisoner of war camps in Britain during the second world war but its significance, in terms of its huge size and type of prisoner, was not widely known. Only partial remains exist of the site, now a popular dog-walking spot about five miles west of Sheffield on the edge of the Peak District. Its history is occasionally discussed by local residents on internet forums but this research, by the University of Sheffield and the Sheffield Lakeland Landscape Partnership, is thought to be the first study of its kind of Lodge Moor. At the beginning of the second world war, the camp was occupied mostly by Italian prisoners, who were put to work on local farms and appeared to enjoy good relations with their Yorkshire neighbours, who would share with them their limited supplies of tea. However, quality of life in the camp deteriorated sharply with the sudden influx of German prisoners. Rob Johnson, one of the archaeology students who surveyed the site, said: \u201cThe prisoners were fed food out of galvanised dustbins, had to stand outside in the mud, rain and cold for several hours a day during roll call, and since it was so overpopulated as a transit camp, they were squashed into tents or the barracks with little personal space.\u201d The study unearthed investigations into conditions at the camp by the International Committee for the Red Cross, which, in 1944, described it as \u201cinsufficient/uninhabitable\u201d with half of the captives in huts and the other half in tents. The researchers found witness testimony suggesting there were more than 70 prisoners per barrack, more than double the official number of 30. In common with other prisoner of war camps in Britain, Lodge Moor saw its share of drama. On 20 December 1944 a group of German prisoners managed to escape the site \u2013 but were captured in nearby Rotherham just 24 hours later. Another escape plan ended in grisly fashion. One prisoner, Gerhardt Rettig, was chased around the Nissen huts by hundreds of inmates and beaten to a pulp after being suspected of tipping off Allied guards about a planned break-out in March 1945. Rettig later died in prison and his alleged killers were put on trial in London later that year. Two men, Armin Keuhne, 18, and Emil Schmittendorf, 31, were found guilty of his murder and executed by hanging at Pentonville prison in November 1945. The students involved in the study said they hoped their findings would be used to preserve and restore the site and the surrounding woodland. Georgina Goodison, an archaeology student involved in the project, said: \u201cIt was a big eye opener for me, as I didn\u2019t realise that Lodge Moor camp even exists. The woodland hides it well. It hides the secrets of all the thousands of men who were housed there merely decades ago.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The National Trust is divesting its \u00a31bn portfolio from fossil fuels in an attempt to help tackle the escalating climate crisis. The organisation, which looks after 780 miles (1,250km) of coastline, 248,000 hectares (612,000 acres) of land and more than 500 historic houses, castles, monuments and parks, said it would withdraw the vast majority of its investments from fossil fuels within 12 months, and the entirety within three years. A Guardian investigation last year revealed the trust had invested tens of millions of pounds in oil, gas and mining companies, despite having previously pledged to cut down its own use of fossil fuels and warning about the impact of climate change. Hilary McGrady, the director general of the trust, said returns from its investments were vital to allow the organisation to \u201ccare for special places across the nation\u201d. But she added in the announcement on Wednesday: \u201cThe impacts of climate change pose the biggest long-term threat to the land and properties we care for, and tackling this is a huge challenge for the whole nation. \u201cWe know our members and supporters are eager to see us do everything we can to protect and nurture the natural environment for future generations.\u201d The trust had announced in 2015 that none of its investments would be made directly in companies that \u201cderive more than 10% of their turnover from the extraction of thermal coal or oil from oil sands\u201d. The trust said fossil fuel investments made up \u00a345m of its portfolio. The divestment campaign is gathering momentum around the world. Earlier this year, Norway\u2019s national oil fund began to refocus on renewable energy. About two-thirds of the UK\u2019s university pension funds, as well as other public pension funds, have also either divested or changed their rules, though some have retained their fossil fuel focus despite strong public pressure. Other funds to have divested include the Irish infrastructure fund, the New York state pension fund, and Waltham Forest and Southwark councils in the UK. Peter Vermeulen, the trust\u2019s chief financial officer, said many organisations had been working hard to persuade fossil fuel companies to invest in green alternatives, without success. \u201cThese companies have made insufficient progress and now we have decided to divest from fossil fuel companies,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we will seek to invest in green startup businesses and other suitable portfolios that deliver benefits for the environment, nature and people.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Customers at Joe Nicchi\u2019s ice-cream truck have increasingly had the same demand: give us your ice-cream for free. CVT Soft Serve, a popular truck in Los Angeles, has started to receive weekly requests from self-proclaimed Instagram \u201cinfluencers\u201d who promise to post a photo of Nicchi\u2019s ice-cream \u2013 if they don\u2019t have to pay. Nicchi has always said no, but this week he found an unusual way to profit off of the influencers: he publicly told them to go away. Nicchi went viral after posting a sign that said \u201cinfluencers pay double\u201d, writing on Instagram that he would \u201cnever give you a free ice-cream in exchange for a post\u201d. The image, tagged #InfluencersAreGross, spread around the globe, and now Nicchi says his business is booming, attracting fans across southern California who share his disdain of influencers. \u201cWe\u2019re the anti-influencer influencers,\u201d he told the Guardian on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s weird \u2026 but I think it\u2019s really fun. I hope it inspires small businesses to hold their own and tell people to fuck off.\u201d Some brands and businesses now rely on Instagram \u201cstars\u201d to advertise their products and services, giving away free meals and hotel stays to people who post positively about the experience. The phenomenon has become so pervasive that some Instagrammers can easily scam companies. One Instagram influencer recently staged a \u201csurprise\u201d wedding engagement but had actually sent an itinerary to marketers months prior. It\u2019s so trendy to be an influencer that some people have taken to pretending their content is sponsored when it\u2019s not. Nicchi understands the importance of promotion. He\u2019s a working actor in LA, who started CVT Soft Serve in 2014 as a way to supplement his income. \u201cThis is a money-making thing. I can\u2019t give away my ice-cream for free,\u201d he said, noting that he had paid for his first truck with his salary from shooting a commercial. The soft serve at CVT (which stands for his three flavor offerings: chocolate, vanilla, or twist) and his vintage-looking truck are very Instagrammable. Influencers quickly noticed. In his first year, he got a small handful of influencer offers, typically people emailing suggesting promotional deals in exchange for free ice-cream. \u201cThey love using the word \u2018exposure\u2019. It\u2019s so ridiculous,\u201d he said. But the frequency of the requests began to escalate \u2013 and became more uncomfortable as they started happening in person, said Nicchi: \u201cThe most painful thing for me is when they approach me at the truck.\u201d It never made sense to him: \u201cAre you out of your mind? This is four dollars. But obviously they wouldn\u2019t be asking if people weren\u2019t saying yes.\u201d At times, the requests were particularly offensive. He said an assistant to a famous actor \u2013 a woman on a television show who he declined to name \u2013 recently asked if he would donate ice-cream to the cast and crew.

      "bodyText": "Rising near Ashe in Hampshire and flowing for around 40 miles before converging with the Itchen, the Test supports a rich diversity of aquatic life. More than 12 species of freshwater fish inhabit its fast-flowing, gin-clear waters, from tiny minnows to monster pike, but this chalk stream is world renowned for its wild salmonids \u2013 trout, salmon and grayling. Crossing the river, I look down from the bridge and notice a hover of seven mature brown trout (Salmo trutta) languidly finning midstream. They are beauties, 30 to 40 centimetres in length, with sleek torpedo-shaped bodies. Their brassy flanks are speckled with dark brown spots, each spot surrounded by a pale silver halo. Though there are a few medium olives (Baetis vernus) dancing above the water in first faltering flight, the mayfly hatch has all but finished. After the past two months gorging on their emergent subimagos and imagos (the sub-adult and mature forms of these ethereal insects), the trout have changed their diet and are now occupying \u201cfeeding lies\u201d, places in the river where converging currents slow and funnel food into a concentrated area. The trout effortlessly hold their position in the water column, their pectoral fins jutting out like wings, their bodies fluttering like flags on the breeze, as they wait to intercept larvae, nymphs and shrimps. Every so often a terrestrial insect falls from the overhanging weeping willows, provoking a fish to punctuate the surface with a ripple of concentric circles as it slurps down its drowning prey.

      "bodyText": "Alek Sigley, the 29-year-old Australian who was missing in North Korea for more than a week, has left the country and arrived safely in China. An upbeat Sigley briefly spoke to a throng of reporters waiting for him at the airport in Beijing on Thursday, saying: \u201cI\u2019m OK, I\u2019m OK, yeah. I\u2019m good. I\u2019m very good.\u201d. Speaking in Perth, his father, Gary Sigley, said the family were \u201cover the moon\u201d that his son was safe, saying he understood his son had been \u201cin constant good spirits and well the whole time\u201d. Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Marise Payne, said Sigley\u2019s release would not have happened without the help of Sweden. Sigley\u2019s detention was confirmed overnight by the Swedish envoy to North Korea, Payne told 2GB radio. On Thursday morning the Swedish ambassador told Australia\u2019s Seoul diplomatic post there was a \u201cstrong possibility that Alek may be able to be handed over to their Swedish delegation at the airport as they were leaving the DPRK [North Korea]\u201d. \u201cThe timeline was very tight and very short, and without the support and help of our counterparts in the Swedish government this would not have been possible, so we are deeply deeply grateful to them,\u201d Payne said. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, had given the first public confirmation that Sigley was safe, telling parliament on Thursday afternoon that the 29-year-old had been released from detention by the repressive regime and had arrived safely in China. \u201cSwedish authorities advised they met with senior officials with the DPRK [North Korea] and raised the issue of Alex\u2019s disappearance,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cWe were advised that the DPRK have released him from detention and he has safely left the country and I can confirm that he has arrived safely. \u201cOn behalf of the Australian government I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to the Swedish authorities for their invaluable assistance in securing Alek\u2019s prompt release, which demonstrates the value of discreet behind-the-scenes work by officials in solving sensitive consular cases in close partnership with other governments. \u201cI\u2019m sure we all could not be more pleased. We now know where he is [and] we know he is safe.\u201d Sigley\u2019s father told reporters outside his home in Perth he was \u201cover the moon\u201d to hear his son was safe. \u201cOn behalf of Alek\u2019s family we are extremely pleased that Alek now is safe and sound in Beijing,\u201d Gary Sigley said. \u201cI\u2019m sure he will reunited with his wife very soon and we hope to see him in the not-too-distant future as well and give him a big hug and kiss. \u201cWe\u2019re over the moon that he\u2019s safe and sound and I\u2019m sure in the coming days [and] weeks there will be more information about what has transpired. \u201cOf course the last week has been a very difficult week for Alek\u2019s immediate family. We were very worried we didn\u2019t have any news about his situation [so] we\u2019re just so happy that situation has been resolved and we know he\u2019s safe and sound in Beijing.\u201d He said he had missed a call from his son while he was shopping and had not yet been able to speak to him, but that he understood he had been \u201cin constant good spirits and well the whole time\u201d. Sigley was expected to travel to Tokyo, where his wife Yuka Morinaga lives, later on Thursday. The Swedish special envoy arrived in Pyongyang earlier this week. Payne said on Wednesday that Australia had asked the envoy to raise Sigley\u2019s case with the North Korean government. Sigley had been studying for a master\u2019s degree in Korean literature at Kim Il Sung university, and runs a tour company that organises trips for foreign students. He first traveled there in 2014. He was believed to be the only Australian living in North Korea. In March, Sigley wrote for Guardian Australia about his experience living there, saying that as a long-term foreign resident on a student visa he had \u201cnearly unprecedented access to Pyongyang\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m free to wander around the city, without anyone accompanying me,\u201d he said. \u201cInteraction with locals can be limited at times, but I can shop and dine almost anywhere I want.\u201d It remains unclear why Sigley was detained. Richard Broinowski, a former Australian diplomat to South Korea, told ABC radio he did not think Sigley had been doing anything that would \u201craise North Korean suspicions\u201d. \u201cI\u2019d be very doubtful he had anything to do with espionage,\u201d Broinowski said. His detention might have been related to the summit between Donald Trump and the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un last week, but that was also unlikely, Broinowski said. He said Australia should reopen a diplomatic posting in North Korea. \u201cI think it\u2019s always a good thing to have diplomatic accreditation in the country that you want to influence,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison will write to his departmental head, Martin Parkinson, seeking information about whether the former defence minister has breached the ministerial standards by taking a job with a major consultancy firm. The decision to seek information follows controversy over Christopher Pyne\u2019s decision to take a position with EY to help the consulting giant expand its defence business. The government is also seeking information from Parkinson about the appointment of the former foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop to the board of the international consultancy firm Palladium. The government\u2019s move to seek guidance from the bureaucracy on Thursday is an attempt to head off the motion from the Centre Alliance to establish a Senate inquiry into compliance with the ministerial standards. But the micro-party is continuing to keep its options open, postponing its motion until the next sitting fortnight in July. The current federal ministerial standards require that ministers do not lobby, advocate for or have business meetings with government, parliamentarians or the defence force on \u201cany matters on which they have had official dealings\u201d in the past 18 months. The standards, which are not enforceable and rarely policed, also say that ministers should not use information they have obtained in office for private gain. Pyne, whose actions have been queried by former government colleagues including Eric Abetz and Tony Pasin, issued a statement on Sunday saying he was aware of his responsibilities under the code and intended to abide by them. He argued the providing of occasional high-level strategic advice did not equate to lobbying or using information he had acquired in his portfolio. The government Senate leader, Mathias Cormann, told the Senate that Morrison had asked Parkinson to provide advice on actions that can be taken \u201cto ensure compliance with the code\u201d of conduct. Bishop told the Australian Financial Review earlier this week: \u201cI am obviously aware of the obligations of the ministerial guidelines and I am entirely confident that I am and will remain compliant with them.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The return of parliament has been dominated by one key issue \u2013 tax cuts \u2013 with Labor and the Coalition at odds over the government\u2019s $158bn tax cut package. Even before Jacqui Lambie indicated she would give her crucial support to the tax package on Thursday morning, taxpayers earning up to $126,000 were in line for a bonus when they lodge their tax returns for the 2018-19 financial year, anytime from this week. But the amount will change once the government\u2019s tax plan passes through the Senate. The government is trying to legislate the 10-year plan that it announced in the April budget, which builds on tax cuts that were already legislated in the last parliament. Already locked in and due to flow from 1 July this year is a lump-sum payment of up to $530 \u2013 called an \u201coffset\u201d for low- and middle-income earners \u2013 which applies to the 2018-19 financial year. This payment, which will flow to more than 10 million Australians, is supported by Labor, has passed parliament, and will be paid for each of the next three years (until the 2021-22 financial year). Those earning up to $37,000 will receive a payment of up to $200, those earning between $37,000 and $47,999 will get between $200 and $530, while those earning between $48,000 and $90,000 will get the full benefit of $530. The payment then gradually reduces down to $1 for those earning up to $125,333. In the April budget the government proposed increasing this offset payment to $1,080, which would see the payment range from $255 for those earning less than $37,000 to $1,080 for those earning between $48,000 and $90,000. It will likewise gradually reduce to zero for those earning $126,000. If the legislation passes this week, then 4.5 million Australians will get the full payment of $1,080. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg says the Australian Taxation Office has already changed its systems in preparation for payments flowing from next week. Does the plan have bipartisan support? The two parties\u2019 position on the tax package diverges with stage two and three. Stage two, which is due to come into effect in 2022-23, is aimed at addressing bracket creep. The part which has already been legislated increases the low-income tax offset from $445 to $645 and lifts the top threshold for the 19% tax rate from $37,000 to $41,000. It also lifts the top threshold for the 32.5% tax rate from $90,000 to $120,000. Labor has called on the government to bring forward the change to the 32.5% tax threshold to this year, saying it will give \u201cmore tax cuts sooner\u201d than the government is offering. In this year\u2019s budget, the government outlined further changes to stage two, increasing the top threshold for the 19% tax bracket to $45,000 and increasing the low-income tax offset to $700. Prior to the election, Labor opposed stage two, but has now agreed to support these changes. The stumbling block for getting stage one and stage two passed is the controversial stage three of the government\u2019s tax plan which is not due to come into effect until July 2024. Already legislated is the government\u2019s 2018-19 budget pledge to get rid of the 37% tax bracket, putting in place a 32.5% tax rate for everyone earning between $41,000 and $200,000. This also lifted the threshold for the top tax rate of 45% from $180,000 to $200,000. Labor had pledged to repeal this had they won the election. In this year\u2019s budget, the government went further, pledging to reduce the tax rate for those earning between $45,000 and $200,000 from 32.5% to 30%. Labor remains opposed to this stage. It is concerned that about a third of the $95bn cost of the third stage will flow to those earning more than $180,000. It has also raised concerns about locking in expensive tax cuts in a softening economy. But it has not yet decided how it will vote when the full tax package comes to the Senate for a vote on Thursday. Regardless, the government secured the crossbench support it needs to pass its full package on Thursday morning. Lambie confirmed she has agreed to back the plan, after demanding Tasmania\u2019s $157m public housing debt be wiped. Centre Alliance \u2013 which carries two votes \u2013 has also confirmed it will back the full tax package. Former Liberal senator Cory Bernardi had always backed the full package.

On a suffocating morning, during a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/24/hell-is-coming-week-long-heatwave-begins-across-europe\"> heatwave across Europe that has broken new records</a>, Melbourne-based choreographer and dancer Jack Riley, 24, performs his duet Duplex with his partner.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyieR4QNyxc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PyieR4QNyxc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Behind him is the mould of the Gates of Paradise, which took the Florentine sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti more than twenty years to complete in the early 1400s.</p> <p>\u201cPerfection is this singular state,\u201d says Riley, who dances topless, in baggy martial arts trousers, while his partner, Nikki Tarling, wears a glinting PVC black leotard. \u201cIt\u2019s a fixed point which doesn\u2019t exist; you\u2019re always changing and growing, dying and decaying.\u201d Arching their bodies together, they slot into an enticing whole.</p> <p>\u201cWe just put in some kick-ass dancing because I love to be physical,\u201d Riley says with a shrug.</p> <p>Just a few doors down at the Museo Galleria dell\u2019Accademia, David stands frozen and sublime, as some of the 1.5 million visitors the sculpture receives annually traipse past.

The vast stone mass was rejected by other artists because of its blemishes; it was only decades later that Michelangelo decided to use it.</p> <p>Then there are other so-called imperfections in the statue. Despite the Judaic origins of the biblical story, this David has foreskin on his penis. Meanwhile, his right hand seems overly elongated, like that of a chimpanzee. (The sometimes off-proportions of the sculpture might have been deliberate: David was originally commissioned to sit high up in Florence cathedral and was therefore designed to be gazed at from afar).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52e12e6a04ed62acccce554741be7085ed545dc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52e12e6a04ed62acccce554741be7085ed545dc0/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Esther Stewart's response to First Commissions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Esther Stewart\u2019s work was one of many which responded to the commission by highlighting imperfection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: University of Melbourne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPerfection is actually in the difference and in the flaw,\u201d says Matthew Delbridge, associate dean of fine arts and music at the University of Melbourne, and an organiser of First Commissions. \u201cDavid is actually completely imperfect. Its hands are out of scale. The marble was flawed. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily accidental.\u201d</p> <p>Musician Samuel Kreusler, among the artists commissioned, also sees beauty in imperfections. For his piece, It\u2019s Not Fair Having 13 Strings, the 24-year-old composer researched artists and athletes who have used perceived imperfections to their advantage. They include the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2012/sep/06/us-paralympics-aimee-mullins-video\">athlete and model Aimee Mullens</a>, who lost both her legs to amputation at the age of one, and jazz musician Django Reinhardt, who played with just two working fingers on his left hand after the others were damaged in a fire.</p> <p>Both personalities, rather than seeing themselves as restricted, used their \u201cimperfections\u201d to re-write the rulebook.

      "bodyText": "\u201cAfter seeing this no one need wish to look at any other sculpture or the work of any other artist,\u201d wrote Giorgio Vasari, the Italian 16th century historian, about Michelangelo\u2019s David. Such is the beauty of Michelangelo\u2019s masterpiece \u2013 showing a David just before or after defeating Goliath, with creamy marble skin, taut stomach and determined gaze \u2013 that it remains today an embodiment of virile physical perfection. As Italian author Antonio Forcellino declared of the 1504 sculpture, unveiled when Michelangelo was just 26: this was \u201cthe new god of male beauty\u201d. So when University of Melbourne honours student Danna Yun, 22, received a commission to create an artwork that personified physical perfection \u2013 based on the original brief given to Michelangelo, and to be shown a stone\u2019s throw away from it in Italy \u2013 it was, to put it mildly, a tall task. \u201cI was like: I\u2019m screwed!\u201d says the classical composer and singer-songwriter (known by her pseudonym Pekoe) over lunch in Florence. \u201cIt means your piece, in a way, had to be \u2018perfect\u2019. The more I did, the more \u2018perfection\u2019 got further and further away from me.\u201d Yun stares hard at her coffee as if it might reveal the answer, and then grimaces. \u201cI felt a tug in my gut,\u201d she says, speaking fast. \u201cI was almost sick.\u201d Yun is among 30 student and alumni artists from the University of Melbourne who have been asked to reinterpret historic commissions \u2013 from Tchaikovsky\u2019s Sleeping Beauty to Frida Kahlo\u2019s Self Portrait with Monkey \u2013 for a new project championing emerging artists, titled First Commissions. Funded by the University of Melbourne to celebrate the opening of its $109 million Ian Potter Southbank Centre, which includes a new Conservatorium of Music, an exhibition, alongside a series of live performances, opens in Florence this week. A second, larger exhibition will be held at the Southbank campus from 27 July. Five of those artists, ranging in disciplines from dance to visual art to music, were given Michelangelo\u2019s original commission by the Republic of Florence \u2013 but disguised so that they did not know which artwork it referred to. A distilled version ordered the artists to \u201ccreate a vision of human physical perfection\u201d. This Wednesday, the David-inspired artworks were unveiled in the iconic Academy of Fine Arts in Florence, founded by the Medici family in 1563. On a suffocating morning, during a heatwave across Europe that has broken new records, Melbourne-based choreographer and dancer Jack Riley, 24, performs his duet Duplex with his partner. Behind him is the mould of the Gates of Paradise, which took the Florentine sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti more than twenty years to complete in the early 1400s. \u201cPerfection is this singular state,\u201d says Riley, who dances topless, in baggy martial arts trousers, while his partner, Nikki Tarling, wears a glinting PVC black leotard. \u201cIt\u2019s a fixed point which doesn\u2019t exist; you\u2019re always changing and growing, dying and decaying.\u201d Arching their bodies together, they slot into an enticing whole. \u201cWe just put in some kick-ass dancing because I love to be physical,\u201d Riley says with a shrug. Just a few doors down at the Museo Galleria dell\u2019Accademia, David stands frozen and sublime, as some of the 1.5 million visitors the sculpture receives annually traipse past. Naked, his head tilted slightly down, his eyes gazing ahead, he holds a sling in one hand, propped up on his shoulder, and a stone in the other. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But while David might seem to embody perfection, the artwork is enticing because of its flaws, not in spite of them \u2013 including the single block of marble from which Michelangelo carved his creation. The vast stone mass was rejected by other artists because of its blemishes; it was only decades later that Michelangelo decided to use it. Then there are other so-called imperfections in the statue. Despite the Judaic origins of the biblical story, this David has foreskin on his penis. Meanwhile, his right hand seems overly elongated, like that of a chimpanzee. (The sometimes off-proportions of the sculpture might have been deliberate: David was originally commissioned to sit high up in Florence cathedral and was therefore designed to be gazed at from afar). \u201cPerfection is actually in the difference and in the flaw,\u201d says Matthew Delbridge, associate dean of fine arts and music at the University of Melbourne, and an organiser of First Commissions. \u201cDavid is actually completely imperfect. Its hands are out of scale. The marble was flawed. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily accidental.\u201d Musician Samuel Kreusler, among the artists commissioned, also sees beauty in imperfections. For his piece, It\u2019s Not Fair Having 13 Strings, the 24-year-old composer researched artists and athletes who have used perceived imperfections to their advantage. They include the athlete and model Aimee Mullens, who lost both her legs to amputation at the age of one, and jazz musician Django Reinhardt, who played with just two working fingers on his left hand after the others were damaged in a fire. Both personalities, rather than seeing themselves as restricted, used their \u201cimperfections\u201d to re-write the rulebook. Likewise, Kreusler decided that for his seven-minute guitar piece, he would give himself an obstruction \u2013 a common compositional tool. \u201cWhat\u2019s a significant physical imperfection in a musical context?\u201d he asks. \u201cTake a classical guitar and remove every second string.\u201d The result is a work where technical proficiency is sacrificed for innovation and new sounds. \u201cI think that things need to be constantly improving for originality, for excitement and for exploring \u2013 and there needs to be a balance between the tradition of following rules and breaking them,\u201d Kreusler says. Other artists, too \u2013 including visual artist Esther Stewart, who has previously collaborated with Italian fashion house Valentino \u2013 have highlighted the imperfect, perhaps unsurprisingly given the pressure of attempting to follow in the footsteps of a masterpiece. In Anthology of Human Physical Perfection, artist Ashley Perry, 27, inserted three words into Google: \u201cHuman\u201d, \u201cPhysical\u201d and \u201cPerfection\u201d, creating his own algorithm.

Hecs applies a flat percentage to the whole of your earnings. As you earn more, that flat rate goes up.

You are now paying 2% Hecs, but it\u2019s applied to your whole $53,000 earnings, not just the raise.</p> <p>So you\u2019re now paying $1,060 to Hecs. That\u2019s $550 more, out of a $2,000 raise \u2013 and that\u2019s not even counting the extra tax.

You\u2019re actually now $35 worse off.</p> <p>In the conversation about bracket creep, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/25/coalitions-bracket-creep-tax-plan-found-to-give-most-to-workers-who-need-it-least\">which is essentially the reason for stage three of the tax cuts,</a> nobody ever mentions Hecs. But Hecs has one of the most oversized footprints on a person\u2019s marginal repayment rate \u2013 and it hits you when you\u2019re starting out, not when you\u2019re ready to retire.</p> <p>Many people will point out a flaw in this argument. That Hecs is not a tax, and the two shouldn\u2019t be confused. That\u2019s true. Wealth isn\u2019t being taken from you when you pay Hecs, it goes to something you already needed to pay down.</p> <p>But the issue is that it affects your take-home pay, at a low income, when you \u2013 and the economy \u2013 need it the most.</p> <p>People will also say that Hecs is something you should pay back quickly, without complaining, and that education isn\u2019t free (any more).</p> <p>But why lower the threshold now, in the headwinds of a recession, when the Reserve Bank is asking for wages to rise and for spending to increase?

That\u2019s $550 more, out of a $2,000 raise \u2013 and that\u2019s not even counting the extra tax. That\u2019s $650 more. You\u2019re left with only $800 of your $2,000 raise. The bracket creep-fearers and the high-income earners who say \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of making more if just means more tax\u201d would faint if that happened to them. In a more extreme case, if you earned $52,500 a year and got a $500 raise, you\u2019d go from paying $525 in Hecs to $1,060. You\u2019re actually now $35 worse off. In the conversation about bracket creep, which is essentially the reason for stage three of the tax cuts, nobody ever mentions Hecs. But Hecs has one of the most oversized footprints on a person\u2019s marginal repayment rate \u2013 and it hits you when you\u2019re starting out, not when you\u2019re ready to retire. Many people will point out a flaw in this argument. That Hecs is not a tax, and the two shouldn\u2019t be confused. That\u2019s true. Wealth isn\u2019t being taken from you when you pay Hecs, it goes to something you already needed to pay down. But the issue is that it affects your take-home pay, at a low income, when you \u2013 and the economy \u2013 need it the most. People will also say that Hecs is something you should pay back quickly, without complaining, and that education isn\u2019t free (any more). But why lower the threshold now, in the headwinds of a recession, when the Reserve Bank is asking for wages to rise and for spending to increase? When the government\u2019s tax cut is explicitly for \u201cworking Australians to keep more of their money\u201d? Everybody \u2013 from the Business Council to the RBA to John Howard \u2013 is saying that to revive the economy we need to keep disposable income in the hands of low-income households. On Monday we did the opposite, slugging our lowest income earners, young people just starting in the workforce, $9 a week at minimum. And people on $45,881 are more likely to tighten their spending than those on $52,000 and $56,000. Back in 2017, the Hecs threshold was lowered as a budget-saving measure. To restore it to $56,000, as it was two years ago, would cost the government $345.7m. But giving out tax cuts is the same thing \u2013 it\u2019s the government choosing to pass up a payment it was scheduled to receive, because it\u2019s better off staying in the economy. The new tax cuts costs the budget $8bn. What would Philip Lowe do for that $9 a week to be back in the economy, or for that $2,000 raise to stay intact, circulating, keeping things afloat? Lowering the Hecs threshold on Monday has undone a lot of what good the tax cuts could have done. \u2022 Naaman Zhou is a reporter for Guardian Australia",

And why should we care?</p> <p>These are the questions facing New South Wales right now following the minister for the arts Don Harwin\u2019s announcement that artist peer assessment for arts grants <a href=\"https://www.create.nsw.gov.au/news-and-publications/news/simpler-nsw-arts-funding-launched-with-call-for-expert-artform-boards-2/\">has been replaced by \u201cart form boards\u201d of his choosing</a>, and that dedicated funding for artistic projects no longer exists. Artists will now have to compete directly with requests for major capital infrastructure in one and the same funding round, making NSW likely the only government in the world to end its commitment to artists as central to funding programs.</p> <p>The announcement last Friday has concerned artists and sector bodies, especially given the minister\u2019s direct interference in past funding rounds to prioritise capital expenditure or specific electorates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/sep/28/stop-stealing-from-us-nsws-demoralising-raid-on-arts-funding-should-concern-the-nation\">\u2018Stop stealing from us\u2019: NSW's demoralising raid on arts funding should concern the nation | Ben Eltham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last year Harwin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/sep/28/stop-stealing-from-us-nsws-demoralising-raid-on-arts-funding-should-concern-the-nation\">redirected </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/sep/28/stop-stealing-from-us-nsws-demoralising-raid-on-arts-funding-should-concern-the-nation\">$400,000 out of an already peer-assessed project funding round</a> towards the capital infrastructure needs of one organisation, the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. That interference was revealed only through <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-26/arts-groups-miss-out-as-minister-funds-special-project/10298452\">exhaustive freedom of information research by the ABC</a>. The Sydney Symphony Orchestra <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/sydney-symphony-orchestra-harwin-arts-grant-20181220-p50ngf.html\">returned the money soon afterwards</a>. Earlier this year, the minister took<a href=\"https://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-14/nsw-ministers-accused-of-pork-barrelling-over-regional-arts-fund/10898154\"> money from two future funding rounds to give it to projects in Liberal or National electorates ahead of the NSW election</a>, which was also revealed by the ABC.</p> <p>The reintroduction of art form boards creates a great deal of confusion. Since the Australia Council rejected that structure following an independent review in 2012 in response to <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-09-21/30204\">long-held artist and sector concerns</a>,<strong> </strong>Australia\u2019s funding bodies have assessed projects through peer review. This means a diverse pool of arts practitioners with extensive art form and industry knowledge debate funding decisions rigorously, based on ongoing engagement with the work of their peers.</p> <p>Art form-specific boards present problems. How do you define an art form? What if an artist works across more than one? Given the NSW government hasn\u2019t proposed funding programs specific to each board, will the applications be assessed multiple times, first by an art form board then in a separate shortlisting process? Will there instead be art form-specific quotas? Or will there be art form-specific funding pools within each round? How would such amounts be determined?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Artists and organisations are reluctant to speak out for fear of the consequences</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, it\u2019s artists and not governments who determine art forms. Which \u201cart form\u201d board would Wiradjuri conceptual artist Amala Groom choose for her socially engaged practice across diverse media? Or Justine Youssef, who works across performance, video, scent and collaboration? What about Skye Gellman, whose practice shifts between stage, installation, circus, site-specific, photography and video work?</p> <p>These NSW artists are known regionally, nationally and internationally and have won multiple awards \u2013 but what about artists who are only just emerging? Which box do they tick? And if they can\u2019t decide, or if they tick the wrong one, what disadvantage will befall their career when people who are not their peers judge their work \u2013 whether that assessment results in funding or not?</p> <p>That question of judgment is fraught, especially in a situation where political interference has already marred such judgment.</p> <p>When a minister <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/largest-arts-funding-shake-up-in-a-decade-announced-20190627-p521rc.html\">chooses 10 \u201cart form\u201d boards, selects the chair of each one and works with that chair to appoint members,</a> it\u2019s difficult for taxpayers to have confidence in the integrity of their decisions. Especially with arts projects and capital infrastructure requests now explicitly in the one funding pool, so there\u2019s no longer any need for the minister to hide non-artistic grants.</p> <p>Despite applications currently being open to join an art form board, all artists and organisations who\u2019ve raised this new framework with me are reluctant to speak out for fear of the consequences. Indeed, with no dedicated funding stream, it\u2019s difficult to understand where artists fit in this structure. At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.copyright.com.au/2018/06/nsw-government-non-payment-an-update-from-our-ceo/\">the NSW government is in court with the Copyright Agency</a>: NSW is the only state or territory in Australia that refuses to pay writers and visual artists fairly for the use of their intellectual property. And it\u2019s the only government that actively <a href=\"http://apraamcos.com.au/news/2019/february/nsw-australias-new-festival-free-zone/\">jeopardises its live music and festivals industries</a> through unworkable regulation.</p> <p>Of course, only a small fraction of artists seek or earn public investment through grants. Yet all artists look to arts and cultural policies as a marker of how their work is valued by society. And all arts organisations expect governments to set policies that help creative businesses thrive. Otherwise, remaining in NSW becomes less and less practical for artists.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/nov/03/years-of-savage-cuts-leave-australian-cultural-institutions-struggling-to-survive\">Australian cultural institutions struggle to survive as War Memorial gets half-billion dollar upgrade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The NSW government already spends less on arts and cultural activity per capita than other state governments and just over half of Victoria\u2019s spend, <a href=\"https://www.create.nsw.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Economic-Value-of-Arts-Screen-and-Culture-2018-Report.pdf\">according to KPMG analysis</a>.

These trends suggest the clear and urgent priorities for the arts in NSW which are not at all addressed by the new framework.</p> <p>Courageous ministers with ambition place their confidence in artists, recognising artists\u2019 power to create the invigorating experiences, indelible images and compelling stories as our society\u2019s conscience and cultural record.

These are the questions facing New South Wales right now following the minister for the arts Don Harwin\u2019s announcement that artist peer assessment for arts grants has been replaced by \u201cart form boards\u201d of his choosing, and that dedicated funding for artistic projects no longer exists. Artists will now have to compete directly with requests for major capital infrastructure in one and the same funding round, making NSW likely the only government in the world to end its commitment to artists as central to funding programs. The announcement last Friday has concerned artists and sector bodies, especially given the minister\u2019s direct interference in past funding rounds to prioritise capital expenditure or specific electorates. Last year Harwin redirected $400,000 out of an already peer-assessed project funding round towards the capital infrastructure needs of one organisation, the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. That interference was revealed only through exhaustive freedom of information research by the ABC. The Sydney Symphony Orchestra returned the money soon afterwards. Earlier this year, the minister took money from two future funding rounds to give it to projects in Liberal or National electorates ahead of the NSW election, which was also revealed by the ABC. The reintroduction of art form boards creates a great deal of confusion. Since the Australia Council rejected that structure following an independent review in 2012 in response to long-held artist and sector concerns, Australia\u2019s funding bodies have assessed projects through peer review. This means a diverse pool of arts practitioners with extensive art form and industry knowledge debate funding decisions rigorously, based on ongoing engagement with the work of their peers. Art form-specific boards present problems. How do you define an art form? What if an artist works across more than one? Given the NSW government hasn\u2019t proposed funding programs specific to each board, will the applications be assessed multiple times, first by an art form board then in a separate shortlisting process? Will there instead be art form-specific quotas? Or will there be art form-specific funding pools within each round? How would such amounts be determined? Of course, it\u2019s artists and not governments who determine art forms. Which \u201cart form\u201d board would Wiradjuri conceptual artist Amala Groom choose for her socially engaged practice across diverse media? Or Justine Youssef, who works across performance, video, scent and collaboration? What about Skye Gellman, whose practice shifts between stage, installation, circus, site-specific, photography and video work? These NSW artists are known regionally, nationally and internationally and have won multiple awards \u2013 but what about artists who are only just emerging? Which box do they tick? And if they can\u2019t decide, or if they tick the wrong one, what disadvantage will befall their career when people who are not their peers judge their work \u2013 whether that assessment results in funding or not? That question of judgment is fraught, especially in a situation where political interference has already marred such judgment. When a minister chooses 10 \u201cart form\u201d boards, selects the chair of each one and works with that chair to appoint members, it\u2019s difficult for taxpayers to have confidence in the integrity of their decisions. Especially with arts projects and capital infrastructure requests now explicitly in the one funding pool, so there\u2019s no longer any need for the minister to hide non-artistic grants. Despite applications currently being open to join an art form board, all artists and organisations who\u2019ve raised this new framework with me are reluctant to speak out for fear of the consequences. Indeed, with no dedicated funding stream, it\u2019s difficult to understand where artists fit in this structure. At the same time, the NSW government is in court with the Copyright Agency: NSW is the only state or territory in Australia that refuses to pay writers and visual artists fairly for the use of their intellectual property. And it\u2019s the only government that actively jeopardises its live music and festivals industries through unworkable regulation. Of course, only a small fraction of artists seek or earn public investment through grants. Yet all artists look to arts and cultural policies as a marker of how their work is valued by society. And all arts organisations expect governments to set policies that help creative businesses thrive. Otherwise, remaining in NSW becomes less and less practical for artists. The NSW government already spends less on arts and cultural activity per capita than other state governments and just over half of Victoria\u2019s spend, according to KPMG analysis. Meanwhile, artists\u2019 incomes are falling, it\u2019s taking longer for them to become established in their field, and their career prospects are dwindling, according to research by the Australia Council. These trends suggest the clear and urgent priorities for the arts in NSW which are not at all addressed by the new framework. Courageous ministers with ambition place their confidence in artists, recognising artists\u2019 power to create the invigorating experiences, indelible images and compelling stories as our society\u2019s conscience and cultural record. The power of the artist should not be feared; it should be welcomed and embraced by policy that\u2019s ambitious and fair. \u2022 Esther Anatolitis is the executive director of the National Association for the Visual Arts",

      "bodyText": "The Australian government has asked a Swedish special envoy to raise missing 29-year-old Alek Sigley directly with the North Korean regime. North Korean state media announced this week that Kent Rolf Magnus Harstedt, a special envoy of the Swedish government, had arrived in North Korea. He met with the regime\u2019s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, and, according to DPRK state media, the two exchanged \u201copinions on the development of bilateral relations and the present situation on the Korean peninsula\u201d. The special envoy\u2019s arrival comes following the disappearance of Sigley, 29, an Australian who has been living and studying in Pyongyang since April 2018. Sigley has not been in touch with friends and family for more than a week, and there are fears he may have been detained by authorities in the repressive state. The Australian government has not had an embassy in North Korea since 1975, and has been working with Sweden and the UK to try to confirm Sigley\u2019s whereabouts. On Wednesday the foreign minister, Marise Payne, confirmed the Australian government has asked the Swedes to raise Sigley with the North Korean government. \u201cOne piece of information, which I think is very important in terms of the current discussions, is that Sweden\u2019s special envoy is making a regularly scheduled visit to North Korea this week and, as I\u2019ve said, we\u2019re working very closely with them on this matter and we\u2019re seeking their support to raise this directly,\u201d she said in a radio interview. \u201cBut we keep all our avenues under review, in terms of other options and other countries we might be able to work with to seek information.\u201d Payne said the government was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about Sigley\u2019s welfare. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been in contact with his family and that is definitely out of character,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are aware of the reports that have suggested he might have been detained by North Korean authorities. We are doing all we can to confirm his location and his welfare [and] are making urgent enquiries with North Korean authorities. \u201cWe have to do that through the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang. They look after consular matters in North Korea on our behalf.\u201d There has been no confirmation of Sigley\u2019s whereabouts since he was last in contact with family and friends last Tuesday. \u201cHe remains out of digital contact with friends and family, and Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to seek clarification as to his whereabouts and welfare,\u201d his family said in a statement last week. \u201cAlek\u2019s family and friends hope to hear from him soon.\u201d Sigley had been studying a master\u2019s degree in Korean literature at Kim Il Sung University and runs a tour company that organises trips for foreign students. He first traveled to the DPRK in 2014. He is believed to be the only Australian living in North Korea. In March, Sigley wrote for Guardian Australia about his experience living there, saying that as a long-term foreign resident on a student visa he had \u201cnearly unprecedented access to Pyongyang\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m free to wander around the city, without anyone accompanying me,\u201d he said. \u201cInteraction with locals can be limited at times, but I can shop and dine almost anywhere I want.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Richard Lowenstein\u2019s long-gestating documentary Mystify: Michael Hutchence has finally arrived after a decade in the works. In a sense, the veteran indie auteur has been chipping away at the film even longer than that, since the early days of his career, having directed several music videos for INXS \u2013 the Australian rock band the renowned singer-songwriter fronted.</p> <p>Lowenstein also helmed the endearingly scuzzy 1986 sharehouse drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/aug/08/dogs-in-space-rewatched-michael-hutchence-in-a-couch-crashing-classic\">Dogs in Space</a>. This bong water-soaked, couch-crashing classic features a rare leading performance from Hutchence himself, with whom the director was friends. Lowenstein <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/30/michael-hutchence-mystify-richard-lowenstein-inxs-film\">has described</a> Mystify as an apology for not being there for the late musician, who took his own life in a Sydney hotel room in November 1997.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/30/michael-hutchence-mystify-richard-lowenstein-inxs-film\">Searching for the real Michael Hutchence: 'He identified with the quiet types'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In this sense, then, it\u2019s no surprise Lowenstein seems to struggle to determine the best narrative hooks with which to frame Hutchence\u2019s story: a case, perhaps, of a film-maker being too close to his material. Mystify is a heavyhearted portrait of a highly talented and complex person, who soared to great heights and plummeted to dreadful lows. How much viewers will get out of it will depend (as is the case with most films about real-life musicians) partly on how much they admire Hutchence going in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9983fc2b9503ebff6669c286a468c72a07c75bba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9983fc2b9503ebff6669c286a468c72a07c75bba/0_0_6291_6067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Hutchence in Mystify\" width=\"1000\" height=\"964\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Hutchence in Mystify.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Madman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Loads of home footage, clips from performances and a wide range of interviews with people close to the subject make the film a must-see for lovers of INXS. Sadly, it pales in comparison with the director\u2019s other documentaries \u2013 including the captivating Autoluminescent: Rowland S Howard and the deeply engrossing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/17/ecco-homo-review-an-intense-surreal-look-at-elusive-australian-artist-troy-davis\">Ecco Homo</a>. The latter, which explores the life of another friend and collaborator of Hutchence, the elusive artist Peter Vanessa \u201cTroy\u201d Davies, was inventively framed as part detective story and part freaky eulogy, etched in the post-punk, drug-washed haze of Melbourne circa the 80s.</p> <p>Davies was not a superstar like Hutchence, so Lowenstein\u2019s challenge involved explaining why his story matters and what this man\u2019s life signified in a broader cultural context. Those elements are lacking in Mystify.

      "bodyText": "Richard Lowenstein\u2019s long-gestating documentary Mystify: Michael Hutchence has finally arrived after a decade in the works. In a sense, the veteran indie auteur has been chipping away at the film even longer than that, since the early days of his career, having directed several music videos for INXS \u2013 the Australian rock band the renowned singer-songwriter fronted. Lowenstein also helmed the endearingly scuzzy 1986 sharehouse drama Dogs in Space. This bong water-soaked, couch-crashing classic features a rare leading performance from Hutchence himself, with whom the director was friends. Lowenstein has described Mystify as an apology for not being there for the late musician, who took his own life in a Sydney hotel room in November 1997. In this sense, then, it\u2019s no surprise Lowenstein seems to struggle to determine the best narrative hooks with which to frame Hutchence\u2019s story: a case, perhaps, of a film-maker being too close to his material. Mystify is a heavyhearted portrait of a highly talented and complex person, who soared to great heights and plummeted to dreadful lows. How much viewers will get out of it will depend (as is the case with most films about real-life musicians) partly on how much they admire Hutchence going in. Loads of home footage, clips from performances and a wide range of interviews with people close to the subject make the film a must-see for lovers of INXS. Sadly, it pales in comparison with the director\u2019s other documentaries \u2013 including the captivating Autoluminescent: Rowland S Howard and the deeply engrossing Ecco Homo. The latter, which explores the life of another friend and collaborator of Hutchence, the elusive artist Peter Vanessa \u201cTroy\u201d Davies, was inventively framed as part detective story and part freaky eulogy, etched in the post-punk, drug-washed haze of Melbourne circa the 80s. Davies was not a superstar like Hutchence, so Lowenstein\u2019s challenge involved explaining why his story matters and what this man\u2019s life signified in a broader cultural context. Those elements are lacking in Mystify. From its introductory moments, depicting Hutchence performing Never Tear Us Apart in front of an adoring crowd in a smoky, packed-out venue, there is a sense of reverence and implied genius that runs throughout the film. Frustratingly, Lowenstein doesn\u2019t let the musician\u2019s talent speak for itself. The film includes snippets of many of his performances, but they are clipped and come and go quickly: a few moments on the stage here and there. I found myself regularly wishing that the director would slow down the pace and let these moments breathe, allowing the audience to savour Hutchence\u2019s vitalising presence and charisma \u2013 and, of course, that bewitching voice. Martin Scorsese included near-complete renditions of several songs in his Bob Dylan documentary, Rolling Thunder Revue. The effect was striking, like a kind of editing room equaliser: allowing rhythm and energy to be momentarily driven by the artist himself, rather than part of the more pressure-packed, chopped-up style of a film like Mystify \u2013 a film cut six ways to Sunday. It finally hits its stride towards the end, when it obtains an interesting journalistic quality.

Such laws aim to criminalize abortions as early as six weeks after conception, when electrical activity can be detected in an embryo. </p> <p>Anti-abortion activists refer to this activity as a \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d but such language is not medically accurate. An embryo at that stage does not have a heart and is not a fetus.</p> <p>The activists and legislators who have pressed for these extreme abortion restrictions are well aware that the laws are unconstitutional under current <strong>Supreme Court</strong> precedent. They hope to create test cases for the newly conservative court to reconsider <strong>Roe v Wade</strong>. </p> <p>In his ruling, <strong>Judge Michael R Barrett</strong> nodded to that strategy and passed the buck, writing: \u201cTo the extent that the State of Ohio \u2018is making a deliberate effort to overturn Roe [v.Wade] and established constitutional precedent,\u2019 ... those arguments must be made to a higher court.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d1d0be48f08c35bf8032cbb\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-03T20:46:28.367Z\">9.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand:</p> <ul> <li>A district judge in New York has told the government to clarify its position on including a citizenship question on the 2020 Census by 6pm ET after Donald Trump contradicted government lawyers Wednesday by saying he was still pushing for inclusion.</li> <li>Trump was criticized for planning a military spectacle on the National Mall to mark July 4th, estimated to cost the Pentagon and Park Service millions, and for distributing tickets to Republican donors.</li> <li>The acting homeland security secretary said he has opened an investigation into a secret Facebook group on which border agents allegedly posts threats and abuse against migrants and members of Congress.</li> <li>Trump dismissed documentation of squalid conditions inside migrant detention camps by blaming Democrats and saying the conditions could act as a deterrent.</li> <li>Trump congratulated a Navy SEAL acquitted on murder charges in the killing of a wounded Islamic State captive under his care in Iraq in 2017.</li> <li>The latest national political polling showed Joe Biden ahead of the field but slumping after the first Democratic debate, while a poll in Iowa had Biden third behind senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris.</li> <li> Republicans celebrated the announcement that Marianne Williamson, the self-help author, had qualified for the second Democratic debate.<br></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d1d0f628f08efcbe532c6c9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-03T20:30:16.772Z\">9.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Donald Trump is responding</strong> to the recent damning documentation of horrible conditions at migrant border detention centers by blaming Democrats, arguing that the migrants were accustomed to squalor and insecurity worse than at the centers, and arguing that the filthy conditions are not a problem because they act as a deterrent to asylum claims.

      "bodyText": "Thanks to everyone who tuned in as we \u2013 and the government\u2019s attorneys \u2013 tried to figure out what the government\u2019s position on the census is! Here\u2019s a rundown of the day\u2019s biggest stories: The acting head of DHS opened an investigation into a Facebook group in which border patrol officers made abusive and hateful statements about migrants and members of congress. Trump contradicted his own commerce secretary, who announced yesterday that the government was no longer seeking to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. Joe Biden released his fundraising numbers, which were good, but not as good as Pete Buttigieg\u2019s. The American Academy of Pediatrics released drawings made my children being held in detention centers. The drawings depict children in cages. An Ohio judge blocked the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban from going into effect next week. Attorneys for the justice department told federal judges that they, too, were surprised by Trump\u2019s census tweet. They now say they are seeking a \u201cpath\u201d that is consistent with the supreme court\u2019s ruling but will still allow them to add the question. Have a happy fourth of July! ACLU attorney Dale Ho, who argued the case before the Supreme Court, has this response to the government\u2019s reversal on the census citizenship question today. The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration\u2019s effort to add a census citizenship question was illegal because it was based on a \u2018contrived\u2019 rationale. Despite that, and despite DOJ\u2019s repeated statements that the census questionnaire cannot be changed after June 30, the administration is now examining whether it can concoct a \u2018new rationale\u2019 for its citizenship question. The answer is no, it cannot \u2014 at least not a legal one. Any attempt at an end run around the Supreme Court\u2019s decision will be unsuccessful, and will be met swiftly in court. Or, as Ho put it on Twitter: To further elucidate what is happening with the census, here\u2019s a very basic timeline of recent events: Thursday 27 June: The Supreme Court blocks the Trump administration from including a citizenship question on the 2020 US Census. Tuesday 2 July: The Justice Department and the Commerce Department both confirm that a citizenship question will not be included on the 2020 census. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross says that it has begun the process of printing census forms. Wednesday 3 July: At 8:06am Eastern, Trump called news reports citing official announcements by his own cabinet secretary \u201cFAKE!\u201d in a tweet, and says \u201cwe are absolutely moving forward, as we must, because of the importance of the answer to this question.\u201d Plaintiffs in the case quickly demanded a hearing to clarify the government\u2019s position in light of the president\u2019s tweet. At 3:30pm Eastern, the conference call with Judge Hazel took place. During the call, one government attorney, Joshua Gardner, said that Trump\u2019s tweet was the \u201cfirst I had heard of the president\u2019s position\u201d and that he had confirmed that the census bureau was continuing to print forms without the citizenship question. \u201cThat process has not been stopped.\u201d Later in the call, however, another government attorney, Joseph Hunt, revealed that the DOJ was now looking into a \u201cpath\u201d toward including the citizenship question. At 6:00pm Eastern, government attorneys filed a letter to a different judge providing slightly more detail on the new \u201cpath\u201d: attorneys for the commerce and justice departments are now performing an \u201canalysis\u201d to determine whether they have any legal case to continue pushing for the citizenship question. What\u2019s next? Judge Hazel has given the government attorneys a deadline of 2pm Friday to either stipulate once and for all that there will not be a census question on the census \u2013 or move forward with discovery for another aspect of the litigation related to equal protection. Asked whether the government could delay the deadline until Monday in light of the July 4th holiday, the judge responded \u201cNo.\u201d Twice. Judge Hazel also offered this analogy for the peculiar situation: If you were Facebook and an attorney for Facebook told me one thing, and then I read a press release from Mark Zuckerberg telling me something else, I would be demanding that Mark Zuckerberg appear in court with you the next time because I would be saying I don\u2019t think you speak for your client anymore. Following their 3:30pm conference call with Judge Hazel, attorneys for the Trump administration sent a letter to another federal judge involved in the census question, Judge Jesse Furman, which provides a bit more detail on the government\u2019s current position, such as it is: The Departments of Justice and Commerce have now been asked to reevaluate all available options following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and whether the Supreme Court\u2019s decision would allow for a new decision to include the citizenship question on the 2020 Decennial Census. The agencies are currently performing the analysis requested, and, if they determine that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision does allow any path for including such a decision, DOJ may file a motion with the Supreme Court seeking further procedural guidance for expediting litigation on remand. In the event that the Commerce Department adopts a new rationale for including the citizenship question on the 2020 Decennial Census consistent with the decision of the Supreme Court, the Government will immediately notify this Court so that it can determine whether there is any need for further proceedings or relief. A lawyer for the Department of Justice told a federal judge on Wednesday that the agency has \u201cbeen instructed to examine whether there is a path forward\u201d to include a citizenship question on the census in 2020. Joseph Hunt, assistant attorney general for the civil division, made her remarks on a conference call with Judge George Hazel that was convened to address Trump\u2019s tweets this morning contradicting his administration\u2019s own announcement yesterday that it would concede on the citizenship question and begin printing the census forms without it. If you\u2019re confused, you\u2019re not alone. On the call, responding to queries from the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys as to whether the court could prevent various representatives of the administration from issuing confusing and contradictory statements, the judge expressed some consternation at the situation, saying: \u201c I assume, although maybe I\u2019m wrong about this, that the parties aren\u2019t suggesting I can enjoin the President of the United States from tweeting things. Maybe you are suggesting that. But I will say my initial reaction to that is to have some concern.\u201d Later he added: \u201cThis is an odd place for the judiciary to be.\u201d Hello everyone! This is Julia Carrie Wong picking up the politics blog in San Francisco, where the holiday weekend hasn\u2019t started yet. A federal judge in Ohio has issued a preliminary injunction preventing Ohio\u2019s six-week abortion ban from going into effect as scheduled, next week. The Ohio measure was signed into law by Republican governor Mike DeWine in April, amid a spate of similar laws from Republican-controlled statehouses around the country. Such laws aim to criminalize abortions as early as six weeks after conception, when electrical activity can be detected in an embryo. Anti-abortion activists refer to this activity as a \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d but such language is not medically accurate. An embryo at that stage does not have a heart and is not a fetus. The activists and legislators who have pressed for these extreme abortion restrictions are well aware that the laws are unconstitutional under current Supreme Court precedent. They hope to create test cases for the newly conservative court to reconsider Roe v Wade. In his ruling, Judge Michael R Barrett nodded to that strategy and passed the buck, writing: \u201cTo the extent that the State of Ohio \u2018is making a deliberate effort to overturn Roe [v.Wade] and established constitutional precedent,\u2019 ... those arguments must be made to a higher court.\u201d Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: A district judge in New York has told the government to clarify its position on including a citizenship question on the 2020 Census by 6pm ET after Donald Trump contradicted government lawyers Wednesday by saying he was still pushing for inclusion. Trump was criticized for planning a military spectacle on the National Mall to mark July 4th, estimated to cost the Pentagon and Park Service millions, and for distributing tickets to Republican donors. The acting homeland security secretary said he has opened an investigation into a secret Facebook group on which border agents allegedly posts threats and abuse against migrants and members of Congress. Trump dismissed documentation of squalid conditions inside migrant detention camps by blaming Democrats and saying the conditions could act as a deterrent. Trump congratulated a Navy SEAL acquitted on murder charges in the killing of a wounded Islamic State captive under his care in Iraq in 2017. The latest national political polling showed Joe Biden ahead of the field but slumping after the first Democratic debate, while a poll in Iowa had Biden third behind senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris. Republicans celebrated the announcement that Marianne Williamson, the self-help author, had qualified for the second Democratic debate. Donald Trump is responding to the recent damning documentation of horrible conditions at migrant border detention centers by blaming Democrats, arguing that the migrants were accustomed to squalor and insecurity worse than at the centers, and arguing that the filthy conditions are not a problem because they act as a deterrent to asylum claims. It\u2019s all here in his Twitter feed if you want to read it. Trump concludes, bafflingly: Seemingly accepting the assertion that Trump\u2019s tweet about the Census citizenship question has created confusion, District court Judge Jesse M Furman in the Southern District of New York has ordered the government to state its \u201cposition and intentions\u201d in the Census question case by 6pm ET. Furman ordered: The Court is aware that there is a telephone conference scheduled for 3:30 p.m. today before Judge Hazel in the District of Maryland. Promptly after that conference, but no later than 6:00 p.m. TODAY, Defendants shall file a response to Plaintiffs\u2019 letter. The response shall include an account of what transpired during the conference before Judge Hazel and a statement of Defendants\u2019 position and intentions. After reviewing Defendants\u2019 letter, the Court will decide whether there is a need for a conference. Plaintiffs in a New York cases challenging the Trump administration plan to add a question about US citizenship to the 2020 Census have requested an immediate conference with a federal judge to resolve the contradiction between the Trump administration\u2019s representations in court yesterday, that the citizenship question is not going on the Census, and Trump\u2019s tweet of today, calling that \u201cfake news.\u201d The filing quotes Trump\u2019s tweet and says: \u201cBecause this statement is not consistent with the representations Defendant\u2019s counsel made to Plaintiffs and a federal court yesterday, and because proceeding with a citizenship question at this point would violate this court\u2019s injunction \u2013 which the Court retains jurisdictions to enforce \u2013 Plaintiffs request an immediate status conference so the court and the parties can determine Defendants\u2019 current position and whether any emergency relief is needed.\u201d As you ease into your holiday weekend, a PSA: Republicans are celebrating the news that Marianne Williamson, the self-help author, has made it into the second round of Democratic presidential debates by clearing benchmarks for money raised and polling strength. Williamson\u2019s far-out performance in the first debate led GOP strategist Jeff Roe to call on Republicans to keep the show going: On Wednesday, Roe and others were celebrating with the hashtag #harnesslove: Former Michigan governor Rick Snyder says he has turned down a fellowship at Harvard University following social media backlash over his administration\u2019s role in the Flint water crisis, the Associated Press reports: He tweeted Wednesday that being a senior research fellow would have been too \u201cdisruptive\u201d because of \u201cour current political environment and its lack of civility.\u201d Harvard announced last week that Snyder would begin his appointment this week. It drew criticism from critics of Snyder who cited his involvement in the 2014-15 lead contamination of Flint\u2019s drinking water while the city was under state emergency management. Snyder, who is credited with helping to turn around Detroit, says it would have been exciting to share his experiences at Harvard, \u201cboth positive and negative.\u201d The Republican left office in December due to term limits. In a statement, the Kennedy school dean said \u201cwe anticipated that students would have learned from engaging with and questioning Governor Snyder\u201d but \u201cwe and he now believe that having him on campus would not enhance education here in the ways we intended.\u201d The American Academy of Pediatrics, which was an early and vocal critic of the Trump administration\u2019s family border separation policy, has released drawing by children recently held in migrant detention centers, the news networks report: The AAP has warned that family separation harms children\u2019s short- and long-term health. Separately, the Trump administration is shopping for potential permanent sites to hold unaccompanied migrant children, Reuters reports: Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Mark Weber said Wednesday that property is being assessed in and around Atlanta; Phoenix; Dallas; Houston; and San Antonio, Texas. Bidding documents request properties that can accommodate up to 500 children. Buildings must have up to 100,800 square feet (9,400 square meters) of space and the properties must include about 2 acres (0.8 hectares) for outdoor recreation. The plan for the Georgia facility calls for 125 bedrooms, with each of them housing up to four children. Weber says the search for permanent facilities is being pursued to reduce the possible need for temporary shelters in the future. Biden\u2019s fundraising numbers in the last quarter don\u2019t measure up to South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s. This is not quite academic at this point but it\u2019s very early days and perceived fundraising performance by a candidate like Buttigieg, who has been a national figure for five minutes, is more important in terms of demonstrating viability than how Biden might perform in any given quarter. Trump and the Republican national committee reported raising $105m in the second quarter. But for the moment he\u2019s running, practically speaking, a one-person race. Polling analysts counsel that not much information about a race can be gleaned from a single poll, a single data point. Where possible it\u2019s better to look at polling averages and trends. And so a new poll of likely Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa, and the seemingly bad news it has for former vice president Joe Biden, should be taken with a pinch of salt. That\u2019s perhaps doubly true considering that the pollster, David Binder Research, works for the campaign of California senator Kamala Harris. And yet. Binder\u2019s polling in the field predated the advent of the Harris campaign, and the polling reflects a clear negative trendline for Biden. Here\u2019s the trend: in six months, Biden drops from 30 to 17, while senator Elizabeth Warren jumps from 9 to 20 and Harris jumps from 7 to 18: Read more about the latest Binder poll over at Iowa Starting Line. The elections analyst Daniel Nichanian points out that it\u2019s the first poll out of Iowa with Warren in the lead. For a broader look at polling of likely caucus-goers in Iowa \u2013 the first state to vote \u2013 we can glance at FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Iowa poll tracker. A poll conducted by Suffolk University at the same time as Binder\u2019s poll paints a very different picture of the race, with Biden leading at 24, followed by Harris at 16 and Warren at 13. The last polling published out of Iowa from the gold standard Selzer &amp; Co is a month old but likewise had Biden leading. With insufficient polling in Iowa to have much confidence in the state of the race there, we can swoop out to the national picture, where polling is more regular. The national picture ain\u2019t great for Biden, either: CNN polling analyst Harry Enten summarizes the national picture: \u201cBiden in a clear first, though less so than before...\u201d Donald Trump has contradicted commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, in addition to officials in the justice and commerce departments and the White House, about whether the administration had accepted there will be no question about citizenship on the 2020 US Census following a Supreme Court ruling denying the administration\u2019s request to include one. On Tuesday, Ross said: The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question. Not so fast, tweets Trump: Reactions: Donald Trump has tweeted congratulations to Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher, who was acquitted Tuesday by a military jury of murder in the killing of a wounded Islamic State captive under his care in Iraq in 2017. It\u2019s not clear how Trump thinks he helped in the jury trial. The same military jurors who acquitted Gallagher returned to court Wednesday to decide whether he should serve any jail time for the single charge he was convicted of: posing with the 17-year-old militant\u2019s corpse. Gallagher could face up to four months imprisonment for the single conviction along with a reduction in rank, forfeiture of two-thirds of his pay and a reprimand, the Associated Press reported: Having already served seven months in confinement ahead of the trail, the Bronze Star recipient is expected to go home a free man, his defense lawyers said. In the military justice system, the jury decides the sentence. After the verdict was read, the defense attorneys jumped up from their seats as Gallagher turned and embraced his wife over the bar of the gallery. Gallagher, dressed in his Navy whites sporting a chest full of medals, told reporters outside court that he was happy and thankful. \u201cI thank God, and my legal team and my wife,\u201d he said Associated Press reporters Mark Sherman and Jessica Gresko have taken a look back at last term\u2019s Supreme Court rulings, including one that went against the Trump administration\u2019s effort to include a question about citizenship on the 2020 US Census. The reporters flag an interesting question: Did Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg hint at the census outcome in a public appearance in June? Sherman and Gresko write: Many of us wrote that based on arguments in late April, the court\u2019s five conservative justices would allow the Trump administration to go forward with a citizenship question on the 2020 census. That turned out not to be true when Chief Justice John Roberts joined with the court\u2019s four liberals, in a decision announced last week, to keep citizenship off the census questionnaire , at least for the time being. The administration said Tuesday it would drop its effort to put its question on the form. But perhaps we did not focus enough on a hint dropped by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in early June. In a speech to lawyers and judges in New York, Ginsburg described those predicting the administration would win the case as \u201cspeculators.\u201d The Merriam-Webster dictionary says a speculator may take something \u201cto be true on the basis of insufficient evidence.\u201d \u201cSpeculators about the outcome note that last year, in Trump v. Hawaii, the court upheld the so-called \u2018travel ban,\u2019 in an opinion granting great deference to the Executive,\u201d Ginsburg said in prepared remarks distributed by the court. It\u2019s fair to, ahem, speculate that the 86-year-old justice could have idly dropped the word into her speech without intending to signal the case\u2019s outcome. But this year\u2019s speech was not the first to offer some evidence that Ginsburg knows precisely what she is doing. In 2012, with the whole world waiting for the court\u2019s verdict on President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul, Ginsburg told the same groups of lawyers and judges that that the term had been especially \u201ctaxing.\u201d Weeks later, with Roberts and the four liberals forming a majority, the Supreme Court upheld the heart of the Affordable Care Act as a valid exercise of Congress\u2019 taxing power. Problem is, Ginsburg\u2019s handiwork is typically only evident in hindsight. And to be fair, she denied to a reporter that she intended to foreshadow the health care decision in her speech.

Trump is barking about his upcoming circus Read further: Following the revelation on Monday that potentially thousands of customs and border patrol officers belong to a secret Facebook group in which users have made abusive statements toward members of congress as well as migrant detainees including sexual threats, acting homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan tweeted on Wednesday that he is opening an investigation into the \u201cdisturbing\u201d matter and that employees would be held \u201caccountable\u201d. The announcement came after Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who was the target of some of the abusive posts, and other Democratic members of congress visited migrant detention centers in Texas Monday and confirmed reports that migrants were being held in overcrowded, filthy and inhumane conditions. McAleenan last week called reports of such conditions \u201cunsubstantiated,\u201d but that claim was undercut by the publication on Tuesday of an inspector general\u2019s report warning that facilities in the Rio Grande Valley in southern Texas face \u201cdangerous overcrowding\u201d and require \u201cimmediate attention\u201d. One image from the report showed a man squashed in a crowd pressing a cardboard sign to a cell window with the word \u201chelp\u201d written on it. He was one of 88 men in a cell meant for 41. Ocasio-Cortez and colleagues have declared that the secret Facebook group and the abuse of detainees pointed to a system-wide crisis in border law enforcement, going beyond a lack of resources which border officers blame for the squalid detention centers. As part of the growing Democratic push on the issue, House speaker Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Donald Trump urging the administration to guarantee proper hygiene, sanitation and water for detained migrants, and a separate letter to her caucus. \u201cEvery day that goes by, we have even greater cause for concern and urgency to enact the protections for children and families,\u201d Pelosi wrote to Democrats. Citizen \u201cClose the Camps\u201d protests were held on Tuesday nationwide, meanwhile. The rallies were organized by the progressive activist group MoveOn joined by the ACLU, the Center for Popular Democracy, and others. Organizers announced at least 184 events across the country. Hello and welcome to our pre-holiday politics coverage. Former vice-president Joe Biden\u2019s support among African American voters has been halved since the first Democratic debate, according to a new Reuters-Ipsos poll, while support for the California senator Kamala Harris has risen. Biden fell from about 40% to about 20% support among African Americans in the poll. Harris rose from 6% support to 10% support among all voters in the poll \u2013 the largest rise of any candidate. But Biden was still ahead of the pack in that poll and a second set of numbers released Wednesday by the Washington Post and ABC News. \u201cWhen asked to identify their preferred candidate, without being prompted with a list of names,\u201d the poll found, Biden was named by 21 % of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, up eight points from April. Senator Bernie Sanders was second at 13%, and Harris and Senator Elizabeth Warren were tied at 7%. Washington is preparing for the nation\u2019s birthday tomorrow; in other words, everyone has left town for someplace nicer. Everyone, that is, except Donald Trump, who tomorrow will become the first president in memory to take part in the Fourth of July celebration on the National Mall. As with all things Trump, the move is controversial. His critics accuse the president of seeking to turn the national holiday into a campaign event. The criticism is buoyed by the fact that the Trump administration has distributed VIP tickets to the event to the Republican National Committee, which is using them to reward donors, but not the Democratic National Committee, NBC News has reported. Trump also has ordered up some military pomp, including a flyover by bombers and fighter jets and some in situ tanks. The National Park Service has diverted $2.5m to gratify Trump\u2019s wishes, the Washington Post has reported. Thanks for joining us!",
