Proffered agreement. All pre planned. Anything else I would take to SC,\u201d he added, apparently alluding to Trump potentially challenging Mueller at the US supreme court.</p> <p>Hannity is known to speak frequently with Trump by telephone. In August 2017, Hannity warned Manafort that any supporter of Trump would be \u201croad kill\u201d in the investigations into his circle.</p> <p>\u201cI hope Potus understands your point,\u201d Manafort replied, using the common abbreviation for the president of the United States. In response, Hannity said: \u201cI tell him a lot. A real lot. Brutally honest relationship.\u201d</p> <p>The text messages were filed to court under seal as an exhibit by Mueller\u2019s team during Manafort\u2019s prosecution in Washington DC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/08/scathing-indictment-paul-manafort-sentencing-draws-accusations-of-privilege\">for financial crimes</a>. It was not immediately clear what the messages were used to demonstrate.</p> <p>Manafort pleaded guilty to charges in Washington DC after having been convicted on eight charges in a separate trial in Virginia last year. He received a combined sentence of about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/13/paul-manafort-second-sentencing-hearing-donald-trump\">seven and a half years in prison</a> for his convictions.</p> <p>The former campaign chairman complained repeatedly to Hannity about the conduct of Mueller\u2019s senior attorneys, claiming they were pressuring him to lie about wrongdoing by Trump and Kushner in return for favorable treatment.</p> <p>\u201cThey would want me to give up DT or family, esp JK. I would never do that,\u201d he wrote when asked why he had not been given a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d like another defendant in his case. But there were no crimes to report, Manafort claimed. \u201cThey will want me to make shit up on both. I will never do that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Other text messages released on Friday showed Hannity alluding to further conversations with Trump. On 3 February last year, he wrote to Manafort: \u201cI\u2019m disgusted at this corruption. It should not happen in the USA. I can tell u Potus is disgusted too.\u201d</p> <p>Hannity also appeared to claim he had inside information on developments at high levels of the administration. At one point he purported to know the release date of an investigation report. And in November 2017, Manafort told Hannity he hoped Jeff Sessions, then the US attorney general, would appoint a \u201cnew spec pros\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cdd7b6c91dd3c982be224a0cc233a80d7b70fb53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdd7b6c91dd3c982be224a0cc233a80d7b70fb53/0_0_3304_2204/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump greets Sean Hannity at a 2018 rally.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump greets Sean Hannity at a 2018 rally.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Conservative activists have demanded a second special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton, Trump\u2019s defeated 2016 opponent, and/or the origins of the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 campaign.</p> <p>In response, Hannity appeared to say Sessions would have to do so or \u201che is gone\u201d, though an apparent typographical error replaced \u201cor\u201d with \u201cit\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The Fox News host Sean Hannity discussed Donald Trump\u2019s legal strategy with Paul Manafort while Manafort was awaiting trial, it emerged on Friday. Hundreds of text messages between Hannity, who is a close confidant of the president, and Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, were released by a judge in Washington DC. While many contained only affectionate messages of support \u2013 \u201cI love you \u2026 you are the best \u2026 that was powerful,\u201d Manafort told Hannity after one TV broadcast \u2013 some featured discussion of the legal challenges facing the president and his allies. On 25 January last year, Manafort expressed concern to Hannity that Robert Mueller, the special counsel, might threaten charges against Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner in an attempt to pressure Trump to agree to an interview. \u201cHe won\u2019t agree,\u201d Hannity replied. \u201cThe lawyers will fight tooth and nail. Proffered agreement. All pre planned. Anything else I would take to SC,\u201d he added, apparently alluding to Trump potentially challenging Mueller at the US supreme court. Hannity is known to speak frequently with Trump by telephone. In August 2017, Hannity warned Manafort that any supporter of Trump would be \u201croad kill\u201d in the investigations into his circle. \u201cI hope Potus understands your point,\u201d Manafort replied, using the common abbreviation for the president of the United States. In response, Hannity said: \u201cI tell him a lot. A real lot. Brutally honest relationship.\u201d The text messages were filed to court under seal as an exhibit by Mueller\u2019s team during Manafort\u2019s prosecution in Washington DC for financial crimes. It was not immediately clear what the messages were used to demonstrate. Manafort pleaded guilty to charges in Washington DC after having been convicted on eight charges in a separate trial in Virginia last year. He received a combined sentence of about seven and a half years in prison for his convictions. The former campaign chairman complained repeatedly to Hannity about the conduct of Mueller\u2019s senior attorneys, claiming they were pressuring him to lie about wrongdoing by Trump and Kushner in return for favorable treatment. \u201cThey would want me to give up DT or family, esp JK. I would never do that,\u201d he wrote when asked why he had not been given a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d like another defendant in his case. But there were no crimes to report, Manafort claimed. \u201cThey will want me to make shit up on both. I will never do that,\u201d he said. Other text messages released on Friday showed Hannity alluding to further conversations with Trump. On 3 February last year, he wrote to Manafort: \u201cI\u2019m disgusted at this corruption. It should not happen in the USA. I can tell u Potus is disgusted too.\u201d Hannity also appeared to claim he had inside information on developments at high levels of the administration. At one point he purported to know the release date of an investigation report. And in November 2017, Manafort told Hannity he hoped Jeff Sessions, then the US attorney general, would appoint a \u201cnew spec pros\u201d. Conservative activists have demanded a second special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton, Trump\u2019s defeated 2016 opponent, and/or the origins of the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 campaign. In response, Hannity appeared to say Sessions would have to do so or \u201che is gone\u201d, though an apparent typographical error replaced \u201cor\u201d with \u201cit\u201d. Hannity explained he had \u201ctalked to a friend\u201d. Manafort replied: \u201cFingers crossed you are right.\u201d In March last year, Hannity said in a message to Manafort that Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, was to withdraw his guilty plea to a charge of lying to the FBI. Flynn did not do so but recently replaced his attorneys, sparking speculation that he may yet. Asked to confirm the texts were Hannity\u2019s, a Fox News spokeswoman responded with a statement from Hannity that said: \u201cMy view of the special counsel investigation and the treatment of Paul Manafort were made clear every day to anyone who listens to my radio show or watches my TV show.\u201d Hannity also tweeted the statement. The name and telephone number of the sender were redacted in the released documents. But the messages were littered with clues. In some messages, Hannity signed off as \u201cSean\u201d while in others Manafort addressed him by that name. Hannity also referred to having had a long career in television and radio. In August 2017, Manafort\u2019s texting partner referred to being 55 years old and having started out as a dishwasher and construction worker. Hannity, who was 55 at the time, has said he held those two jobs early in his adult life.",

      "bodyText": "Hospitals are having to treat patients on makeshift wards in places such as corridors because they are so relentlessly busy, research shows. They are using temporary wards created to ease winter pressures throughout the year to cope with the rising demand for care, and patients are having their surgery cancelled at the last minute because hospital managers have commandeered their bed for an emergency admittance. Hospitals have begun routinely deploying thousands of \u201cescalation beds\u201d, which are meant to help ease a temporary spike in demand, because they so often run out of normal beds, official NHS figures show. On 3 March, NHS hospitals in England were using 3,428 escalation beds for patients, even though winter pressures had eased by then, according to data obtained by the British Medical Association. They were still relying on at least 1,637 such beds as recently as 1 May, though the true total will be higher as that number was based on figures supplied by just 80 of England\u2019s 240 NHS trusts. \u201cThe intense pressure on beds can result in patients being placed on beds in corridors or in bits of other facilities, sometimes cramping treatment areas and causing unacceptable stress to the patient and their families,\u201d said Dr Rob Harwood, the chair of the consultants committee at the BMA, the doctors\u2019 union. \u201cIt cannot be right that the NHS is having to use these measures almost permanently.\u201d The BMA says the service needs 10,000 more beds to cope with the additional demand created by the ageing and growing population. This week Simon Stevens, the head of the NHS in England, admitted the loss of almost 15,000 hospital beds since 2010 was too many and that more beds would be needed in the next few years. The Care Quality Commission said on Thursday that the quality of care inpatients received was being affected because hospitals were so full and understaffed. Dr Nick Scriven, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said: \u201cAnyone who works in hospitals will recognise this state of affairs and it\u2019s probably been in place in many units since the beginning of winter 2017/18 with little or no respite. \u201cThe system is now so reliant on this \u2018extra capacity\u2019 that most hospitals cannot survive even minor changes in pressure that occur.

      "bodyText": "An international field assembles for the big race on Royal Ascot\u2019s closing card, the Diamond Jubilee Stakes, in which Blue Point tries to add to his victory here on Tuesday. The French raider City Light and Bound From Nowhere, from the US, are to be feared, while other contenders have also travelled from Singapore and New Zealand. But all may struggle to match a horse whose home is just two hours up the road at Newmarket. The Tin Man (4.20) took this prize in 2017 and was a marginally unlucky fourth last year. He also won here on Champions Day in 2016 and bagged the third Group One of his career at Haydock last autumn. He should be a lot sharper for his first run back at Windsor, when he was giving weight to the first two, and looks the value in the race at 9-1. 2.30 Chesham Stakes Lope Y Fernandez has obvious claims on his debut win but Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s second-string might be a better option and not for the first time this week. Year Of The Tiger ran a promising race in second the same day, looking as though this step up in trip was needed, and his pedigree promises much. 3.05 Jersey Stakes There\u2019s a lot to like about the zippy Space Blues but he does not deserve to be half the price of So Perfect. O\u2019Brien\u2019s filly was beaten less than a length in the Queen Mary last year and later came within half a length of a Group One win against males. Having needed her first run back, she powered home at Naas last time. 3.40 Hardwicke Stakes He was impressive in last year\u2019s Derby but there\u2019s no way Masar can be the right favourite for this after a year off with a leg injury. Defoe appeals more, as a Group One winner last time who nonetheless meets these rivals at level weights. 5.00 Wokingham Stakes For a horse with a fair record at this track, it\u2019s surprising to see Spring Loaded available at 25-1. Paul D\u2019Arcy\u2019s veteran was an unlucky ninth in this last year on his first run of the season and beat 19 rivals to a big pot here next time out.

Researchers have found Indigenous people experience as many as 10-12 different traumatic events in a lifetime, and Aboriginal communities have very elevated rates of PTSD. \u201cComplex trauma\u201d is the term to describe cumulative exposure to multiple traumatic experiences over the course of a childhood and is being seen as separate to PTSD, which might be suffered by exposure to a single traumatic event. Childhood abuse and prolonged stress, affecting up to 50% of children worldwide, are the most common cause of complex trauma. Growing evidence demonstrates this is a major public health issue, according to Dr Cath Chamberlain, the lead researcher on the \u201cHealing the past by nurturing the future\u201d project. The effects of trauma in early childhood can affect physical and mental health for a lifetime. Dr Chamberlain said Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are particularly affected by complex trauma following a legacy of colonisation, which includes state-sanctioned systematic removal of Aboriginal children from families and ongoing discrimination. The project outcomes could help stem the rising rates of Aboriginal child removal by making sure parents are supported early and babies are able to grow in a safe and nurturing environment. The project aims to co-design perinatal awareness, recognition, assessment and support strategies for Indigenous parents experiencing complex trauma, for whom pregnancy and birth can trigger memory of traumatic childhood. \u201cThe perinatal [before birth] period is a really important time where we can support parents to understand and manage feelings of trauma-related distress so they can nurture their baby and enjoy the healing love children bring into the world with them,\u201d Chamberlain said. \u201cIt\u2019s a time when women and men often turn their lives around, when most of their experiences are positive. It\u2019s a time for a fresh start and hope for the future. And we see them a lot \u2013 for the first time since childhood, they\u2019re coming in for health check-ups,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of science behind why we\u2019re focusing on this period.\u201d There is also a strong cultural focus. The project is Indigenous designed and led, and wants to bring together western evidence and Indigenous knowledge, including Aboriginal concepts of wellbeing and caring for babies and young children. \u201cChildren are sacred, and there is a lot of rich cultural knowledge about nurturing and promoting safety for our babies that we are starting to learn from Aboriginal researchers,\u201d Chamberlain said. \u201cWe want to try and reclaim some of that and bring that sense of safety back for children.\u201d Dr Catherine Chamberlain received the 2019 Lowitja Institute award for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health research leadership and excellence.",

They were preparing for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/21/labor-to-keep-national-energy-guarantee-in-bid-for-climate-truce\">an incoming Labor government intent on reviving the Neg</a> and imposing a higher emissions reduction target of 45% to pull through new investment in low-emissions technology.</p> \n<p>A re-elected Morrison government means an entirely different outlook. Taylor, thus far, has batted away arguments to revive the Neg, although the word is Morrison may have a different view. The federal renewable energy target will wind down from 2020, and in the absence of a clearly defined emissions reduction target, there\u2019s no clear policy mechanism to encourage investment in large-scale low-emissions projects beyond that point.</p> \n<p>Taylor has proposed direct intervention in the market through government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/13/coalition-signals-it-will-provide-taxpayer-support-for-new-and-existing-coal-plants\">underwriting of new power generation</a>, but analysts and some of the states, who have spent time and political capital trying to extract themselves from running power systems, wonder why on earth a Liberal government wouldn\u2019t just set coherent rules and leave the investment decisions to the market.</p> \n<p>As well as the demise of the RET, and the uncertainty about the regulatory framework to come, there is also significant concern in the renewable energy sector that the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, which has played a significant role in assisting the transition to date, is funded only until 2022.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Climate change always comes up behind Australian political leaders and grabs them</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Emma Herd</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Adding to the friction, the government is also continuing to threaten energy companies with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/11/big-stick-energy-bill-coalition-mp-wants-economy-wide-power-to-break-up-big-companies\">its \u201cbig stick\u201d legislation</a> \u2013 a proposal which has generated enormous hostility from the energy sector and business groups to the point where Morrison, according to government insiders, has directed Taylor to set about mending fences.</p> \n<p>Energy and climate stakeholders are aware there may be a state-led move to revive the Neg, but that\u2019s a double-edged sword. If Canberra continues to be a car crash, refusing to provide necessary national leadership, the states will take energy policy into their own hands, and that\u2019s fine if the end result is harmonised rules, and less fine if it\u2019s a hodge-podge.</p> \n<p>If reviving the Neg proves impossible, some insiders who have worked in this policy area for a long time wonder if it might be better to try to re-engage Canberra through the regulation of energy grid architecture \u2013 a debate sufficiently arcane and technical to prevent it becoming hostage to the idiocy of hyper-partisan politics.</p> \n<p>The Morrison government is locked in through the Paris agreement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/18/australia-quizzed-by-eu-and-china-on-whether-it-can-meet-2030-paris-climate-target\">to undertake reviews of Australia\u2019s targets</a>, a process that will provide a focal point for some of the advocacy over the coming parliamentary term.

Energy and climate stakeholders are aware there may be a state-led move to revive the Neg, but that\u2019s a double-edged sword. If Canberra continues to be a car crash, refusing to provide necessary national leadership, the states will take energy policy into their own hands, and that\u2019s fine if the end result is harmonised rules, and less fine if it\u2019s a hodge-podge. If reviving the Neg proves impossible, some insiders who have worked in this policy area for a long time wonder if it might be better to try to re-engage Canberra through the regulation of energy grid architecture \u2013 a debate sufficiently arcane and technical to prevent it becoming hostage to the idiocy of hyper-partisan politics. The Morrison government is locked in through the Paris agreement to undertake reviews of Australia\u2019s targets, a process that will provide a focal point for some of the advocacy over the coming parliamentary term. In the Paris framework which Australia has signed up to, the next two years are supposed to be about \u201creview and ratchet up,\u201d as Emma Herd, the head of the Investor Group on Climate Change, puts it. \u201cHaving worked in climate change for nearly 20 years, climate change always comes up behind Australian political leaders and grabs them. We are a carbon-intensive trade-exposed economy that\u2019s vulnerable to the effects of climate change, and leaders have to deal with that as a very real issue. They have to deal with it even when they haven\u2019t wanted to.\u201d She says business and investors are screening out toxic politics and have already clicked over to planning for a regulatory environment of net zero emissions by 2050. \u201cIncreasingly investors are adopting that as the long-term market signal.\u201d A tone of self-reliance is starting to assert itself in business circles. There is talk of ClimateWorks, with business backing, doing an Australian version of a report called Mission Possible. The Energy Transition Commission in Britain in 2018 mapped out how the energy and industrial sectors could achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and a local version could provide something of a self-help roadmap for businesses in Australia, as well as a prompt for the government. Innes Willox, the head of the Ai Group, is continuing to advocate for better policy, particularly certainty about targets. But he\u2019s also telling his members not to rely on government. Rather than assuming rationality will reassert itself, and project us into a golden period of coherence, Willox is now talking about harm minimisation. \u201cThe policy framework can help. There\u2019s no doubt about it. But it can also do a lot of harm. We\u2019re probably at the point of do no harm and let business play this out.\u201d Willox says the abandonment of the Neg last year was a tipping point in the psychology of the stakeholder debate in Australia. \u201cThe beauty of the Neg was nobody thought it was 100% wonderful, but everyone thought they could work with it,\u201d Willox says. \u201cEveryone got in the cart and when that was blown up, we almost went back to square one in a way. \u201cThat has made business decide we\u2019ve just got to get on with it and be self-reliant. \u201cWe just have to get on with it without them.\u201d Fears the investment boom in renewables will stall While the policy failures and accumulated chaos of the past decade has meant investors in old-school power generation are unwilling to build new kit lest they become saddled with stranded assets, the renewables sector in Australia has boomed over the past 18 months, with around $20bn worth of new development. It\u2019s ironic, perhaps, that in an election cycle where a number of regional Queenslanders voted for the promise of blue-collar jobs, backing the party that backed the Adani coal project, renewables generated more than 13,000 actual jobs in construction, with a lot of that activity in north Queensland. The worry post-election is that the renewables investment boom will stall. \u201cThe concern is we will stagger as an industry,\u201d Peter Cowling, who runs Vestas Australia, a major wind turbine manufacturer, tells Guardian Australia. While Zali Steggall, the independent who managed to unseat Abbott in Warringah on a climate action platform, argues the Morrison government needs to extend the RET beyond 2020 \u2013 and the renewables sector may end up lobbying for that if the Neg reboot stalls \u2013 Cowling says the industry doesn\u2019t need subsidies if the government can deliver a clear direction that gives companies certainty to invest. Kane Thornton, who runs the Clean Energy Council, says the cost of large-scale renewable energy has come down significantly over the past five years. \u201cIt is now the lowest-cost form of new generation. But the reality is that without a clear strategy and policy there will be uncertainty about investment.\u201d Cowling says as a corporate player in the energy market, it is clear why the Morrison government needs to step back into the frame: \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dream of government pulling out of the planning of roads, or where you put an airport, and Australia\u2019s electricity grid is more complex than those things. \u201cWhat we need is the government to step up and set the direction in the transition. If I only have a five- to 10-year horizon as an investor, I\u2019m going to charge a much higher risk premium for getting involved in Australia. If I can look out over 30 years, Australia will get much cheaper energy.\u201d He says Australia has two options \u2013 a glide path to zero emissions by mid-century that is elegant or one that is chaotic. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have an elegant glide path to retirement, and replacement of ageing coal assets before retirement, then you are setting people up for much greater grid risks than anyone could have from the fact that renewables are intermittent.\u201d Those grid risks are already evident, with ageing coal assets struggling to meet demand from consumers and businesses. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do the planning, this transition is much harder,\u201d Cowling says. \u201cI\u2019ve been searching for an appropriate analogy and the best I can come up with is roads and airports. \u201cImagine if we left it to the market to dispatch police or ambulances \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t do it, but we are close to that with electricity.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The revolving door of tennis swivelled with dizzying speed again here , but stalled briefly as Andy Murray confirmed his comeback win was no chimera. He remains tantalisingly poised short of the semi-finals in a tournament he has won a record five times, five months after career-saving hip surgery, and just hours after his Argentinian friend, Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, cast doubt on his own future before an operation on his cracked knee-cap.</p> <p>Murray and Feliciano L\u00f3pez, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/20/andy-murray-fortunate-to-be-playing-doubles-win\" title=\"\">beat the No 1 seeds Juan Sebasti</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/20/andy-murray-fortunate-to-be-playing-doubles-win\" title=\"\">\u00e1n Cabal and Robert Farah</a> in straight sets on Thursday, went to work in fading light on Friday against the British pair, Dan Evans and Ken Skupski, in another tight thriller. They were 6-4 up and 4-5 down when a high-grade contest was called off under gloomy skies at 8.50pm, half an hour before sunset on the longest day of the year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/21/ashleigh-barty-andy-murray-wimbledon\">Ashleigh Barty sorry she had to reject Andy Murray\u2019s Wimbledon offer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Had the schedule started rolling just a little earlier than noon, they might have got a result in this quarter-final. The players will resume on Saturday, although squeezing it into an already concertinaed programme will be tricky.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez is in the semi-finals of the singles, mid-afternoon, against the exciting young Canadian, Felix Auger-Aliassime, and the doubles semi is slotted in as the last match on Centre Court. The 37-year-old Spaniard, a champion here in 2017, could end up playing three matches in a row on the same court.</p> <p>Waiting for the delayed winners will be John Peers and Henri Kontinen, who earlier beat Murray\u2019s brother, Jamie, and his new partner, Neal Skupski, Ken\u2019s brother, 7-5, 7-6 (6).</p> <p>Meanwhile, in a downbeat statement from Barcelona, where he will go under the knife on Saturday, Del Potro, whose career has been blighted by injury since he won the US Open 10 years ago, said: \u201cI hope my knee can heal properly. If that match was the last one of my career [beating Denis Shapovolov here], that I don\u2019t know. This is a tough moment. It\u2019s sad to go through all this once again.\u201d</p> <p>A small cloud also drifted across Murray\u2019s world when Nicolas Mahut, the regular doubles partner of Pierre-Hugues Herbert, who will play at Wimbledon with the Scot, presented a grumpy face when asked how he felt about being dumped. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this doubles team,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only one who needs to know what I think is Pierre. We talked together but I won\u2019t come into the press to say what I think about this situation.\u201d</p> <p>Herbert was more forthcoming on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that it\u2019s not the cleanest move,\u201d he said. \u201cI will play doubles when I said I wouldn\u2019t. But it is exceptional to play with Murray at Wimbledon.\u201d</p> <p>Mahut will play with \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin at Wimbledon and get back together with Herbert at the US Open. Murray, if he plays at Flushing Meadows in September, might even be ready to play singles.</p> <p>Across the landscape change is in the air. Auger-Aliassime strengthened his credentials as a major new force in the game when he played two superb sets to dislodge the top seed, Stefanos Tsitsipas, two years older than him at 20 and equally bristling with promise.</p> <p>The Greek world No 8, a cerebral as well as physical presence, reacted with maturity and insight to the Canadian teenager\u2019s 7-5, 6-2 win in the quarter-finals. \u201cHe\u2019s the most difficult opponent I\u2019ve ever faced,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has one of the best returns on the tour. He has a really powerful, accurate serve, which is tough to read. He\u2019s really quick and fast. It is rare to find all of that combined. He can create a lot of opportunities from his backhand, but also, at the same time, he can be very aggressive from the forehand side. There\u2019s not much to come up with when you play against him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tsitsipas predicted Auger-Aliassime could master even the class and experience of Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal - a report card the winner could have composed himself \u2013 if he was not such a level-headed young player.</p> <p>Auger-Aliassime, who began the year outside the top 100 and will go to Wimbledon inside the top 20, said: \u201cIt\u2019s humbling. I appreciate that from him, because he\u2019s beaten these players. How do I explain it? I think it\u2019s the result of a lot of work over years and months.\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday he plays L\u00f3pez, who is more than twice his age and who played solidly but with dashes of flair to end the run of Auger-Aliassime\u2019s compatriot, Milos Raonic, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (5) in two hours 16 minutes. </p> <p>Another voice from the past stirred briefly when John McEnroe joined the queue to offer advice to the troubled Nick Kyrgios, fined $17,500 for three incidents of unsportsmanlike conduct in two matches on Thursday.<br>\u201cI have talked with him,\u201d said McEnroe, whose own crime sheet was long enough. \u201cNick is a good guy. I think the people around him like him. The players like him [apart from Auger-Aliassime, it seems]. They don\u2019t like what he does on the court sometimes.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he could even say, \u2018I like the fact that I try half the time.\u2019 I mean, how could anyone think that? I don\u2019t think it just has to be him [who deals with his problem]. I wasn\u2019t known as the easiest person to deal with.<br>\u201cTo me, that [other] person has to be ready to embrace whoever that is. They have to be willing to listen to [him]. If you are not going to listen, he is doing what he wants to do. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s 24 years old. He brings an electricity to tennis. That\u2019s why everyone is trying to figure a way to work through this \u2013 so he can get to a place where he can go out and feel free to compete and give the effort. That\u2019s the part that gnaws at the players. I don\u2019t care if he throws a chair on the court or does what he does. </p> <p>\u201cThe part that I have a problem with \u2013 and I am assuming 99 per cent of the rest of the Tour do \u2013 is when you go out there and don\u2019t seem like you are giving an effort half of the time ... for whatever reason. But I am not Sigmund Freud.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The revolving door of tennis swivelled with dizzying speed again here , but stalled briefly as Andy Murray confirmed his comeback win was no chimera. He remains tantalisingly poised short of the semi-finals in a tournament he has won a record five times, five months after career-saving hip surgery, and just hours after his Argentinian friend, Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, cast doubt on his own future before an operation on his cracked knee-cap. Murray and Feliciano L\u00f3pez, who beat the No 1 seeds Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Cabal and Robert Farah in straight sets on Thursday, went to work in fading light on Friday against the British pair, Dan Evans and Ken Skupski, in another tight thriller. They were 6-4 up and 4-5 down when a high-grade contest was called off under gloomy skies at 8.50pm, half an hour before sunset on the longest day of the year. Had the schedule started rolling just a little earlier than noon, they might have got a result in this quarter-final. The players will resume on Saturday, although squeezing it into an already concertinaed programme will be tricky. L\u00f3pez is in the semi-finals of the singles, mid-afternoon, against the exciting young Canadian, Felix Auger-Aliassime, and the doubles semi is slotted in as the last match on Centre Court. The 37-year-old Spaniard, a champion here in 2017, could end up playing three matches in a row on the same court. Waiting for the delayed winners will be John Peers and Henri Kontinen, who earlier beat Murray\u2019s brother, Jamie, and his new partner, Neal Skupski, Ken\u2019s brother, 7-5, 7-6 (6). Meanwhile, in a downbeat statement from Barcelona, where he will go under the knife on Saturday, Del Potro, whose career has been blighted by injury since he won the US Open 10 years ago, said: \u201cI hope my knee can heal properly. If that match was the last one of my career [beating Denis Shapovolov here], that I don\u2019t know. This is a tough moment. It\u2019s sad to go through all this once again.\u201d A small cloud also drifted across Murray\u2019s world when Nicolas Mahut, the regular doubles partner of Pierre-Hugues Herbert, who will play at Wimbledon with the Scot, presented a grumpy face when asked how he felt about being dumped. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this doubles team,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only one who needs to know what I think is Pierre. We talked together but I won\u2019t come into the press to say what I think about this situation.\u201d Herbert was more forthcoming on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that it\u2019s not the cleanest move,\u201d he said. \u201cI will play doubles when I said I wouldn\u2019t. But it is exceptional to play with Murray at Wimbledon.\u201d Mahut will play with \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin at Wimbledon and get back together with Herbert at the US Open. Murray, if he plays at Flushing Meadows in September, might even be ready to play singles. Across the landscape change is in the air. Auger-Aliassime strengthened his credentials as a major new force in the game when he played two superb sets to dislodge the top seed, Stefanos Tsitsipas, two years older than him at 20 and equally bristling with promise. The Greek world No 8, a cerebral as well as physical presence, reacted with maturity and insight to the Canadian teenager\u2019s 7-5, 6-2 win in the quarter-finals. \u201cHe\u2019s the most difficult opponent I\u2019ve ever faced,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has one of the best returns on the tour. He has a really powerful, accurate serve, which is tough to read. He\u2019s really quick and fast. It is rare to find all of that combined. He can create a lot of opportunities from his backhand, but also, at the same time, he can be very aggressive from the forehand side. There\u2019s not much to come up with when you play against him.\u201d Tsitsipas predicted Auger-Aliassime could master even the class and experience of Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal - a report card the winner could have composed himself \u2013 if he was not such a level-headed young player. Auger-Aliassime, who began the year outside the top 100 and will go to Wimbledon inside the top 20, said: \u201cIt\u2019s humbling. I appreciate that from him, because he\u2019s beaten these players. How do I explain it? I think it\u2019s the result of a lot of work over years and months.\u201d On Saturday he plays L\u00f3pez, who is more than twice his age and who played solidly but with dashes of flair to end the run of Auger-Aliassime\u2019s compatriot, Milos Raonic, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (5) in two hours 16 minutes. Another voice from the past stirred briefly when John McEnroe joined the queue to offer advice to the troubled Nick Kyrgios, fined $17,500 for three incidents of unsportsmanlike conduct in two matches on Thursday. \u201cI have talked with him,\u201d said McEnroe, whose own crime sheet was long enough. \u201cNick is a good guy. I think the people around him like him. The players like him [apart from Auger-Aliassime, it seems]. They don\u2019t like what he does on the court sometimes. \u201cI don\u2019t think he could even say, \u2018I like the fact that I try half the time.\u2019 I mean, how could anyone think that? I don\u2019t think it just has to be him [who deals with his problem]. I wasn\u2019t known as the easiest person to deal with. \u201cTo me, that [other] person has to be ready to embrace whoever that is. They have to be willing to listen to [him]. If you are not going to listen, he is doing what he wants to do. \u201cHe\u2019s 24 years old. He brings an electricity to tennis. That\u2019s why everyone is trying to figure a way to work through this \u2013 so he can get to a place where he can go out and feel free to compete and give the effort. That\u2019s the part that gnaws at the players. I don\u2019t care if he throws a chair on the court or does what he does. \u201cThe part that I have a problem with \u2013 and I am assuming 99 per cent of the rest of the Tour do \u2013 is when you go out there and don\u2019t seem like you are giving an effort half of the time ... for whatever reason. But I am not Sigmund Freud.\u201d",

Until then the Warriors had played well, defending stoutly and proving troublesome on the counter-attack. Egypt, who made a rampant start, begin to look short of ideas; but Trezeguet\u2019s strike has transformed the game and Egypt looked very dangerous again after it. Zimbabwe, then, need to use half-time to steady themselves and try to figure out a way to stem the Egyptian flow again and spring forward themselves for an equaliser. It\u2019s a decent contest and Egypt can\u2019t rest until they\u2019ve scored at least one more. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0d423b8f081e872734c668\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-21T20:47:20.572Z\">9.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>45+1 min</strong>: Mohsen and Mudimu receive treatment after banging heads as they challenged for a ball into the box.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0d41c68f082364d7ceeda8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-21T20:45:49.888Z\">9.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>45 min</strong>: Zimbabwe are reeling and Egypt are trying to finish them off before the break.

Eleven of the previous editions have been won by the host country and it would be no surprise if that happened again this time \u2013 in fact, a lot of Egyptians would be outraged if it did not. Home support has helped spur the Pharaohs to victory on the three of the four precious occasions that they staged the continent\u2019s gala event, and this time they have one of the world\u2019s best players, one Mohamed Salah. Pressure? Sure, but Salah and the rest of Egypt\u2019s players are used to coping with that.</p> <p> That bit about \u2018the rest of Egypt\u2019s players\u2019 is important, because whereas the team that reached last year\u2019s World Cup were set up by the then-manager Hector Cuper to defend to the max and channel all attacks through Salah, this side, under Javier Aguirre, are more committee and rounded attackers. They do not just rely on Salah to do the damage \u2013 players such as Trezeguet, Kouka, Mohsen and Soliman are all capable of tormenting opposing defences. And given that Egypt\u2019s own defence is prone to occasional creaking, the Pharaohs like to stay on the front foot. The crowd in Cairo today expect and demand if not a goal spree, then at least concerted and relentless offence.</p> <p> All of which means Zimbabwe have a big challenge on their hands. But Sunday Chidzambwa\u2019s men got here by topping a testing group \u2013 finishing above two Congos and Liberia thanks notably to a smart counter-attacking victory in Kinshasa. Their ambition will be to spring something similar today to claim their first win in the Africa Cup of Nations since 2006 \u2013 the last time it as hosted in Egypt. </p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Mission accomplished for the hosts. They started this match with real vibrancy but soon ran out of ideas against a well organised and very tidy Zimbabwe side. Both teams lacked sharpness up front - even Salah was a little below par despite being heavily involved - but the game\u2019s one piece of clinical play was the difference between the sides. Trezeguet\u2019s nicely taken goal gave Egypt maximum points. They leave the pitch with the knowledge that they will need to perform better to win this tournament, while Zimbabwe leave with no points but the conviction that they are a decent unit who could yet get out of this group. 90+2 min: Nervous times for Egypt as Zimbabwe continue to probe around their box. This is uncomfortable for the hosts ... 89 min: Zimbabwe quickly switch play. Chiwapawa sends in a lovely curling cross from the left, depositing the ball right on the head of Rusike .... who nods over from 10 yards! A let-off for Egypt! 87 min: Solimon pounces on a breaking ball near halfway and hooks a pass over the top of the Zimbabwean defence. Hadebe can\u2019t catch Salah! But the Salah produces another weak finish on his right foot, shooting softly at the substitute keeper, who makes a good save. 85 min: It\u2019s all become a bit laboured for Egypt. You get the feeling they\u2019d welcome the final whistle right now and are relieved that their pesky opponents have not been deadly up front. Zimbabwe sub: Chawapiwa on, Musona off. 82 min: Billiat dances past two opponents down the left wing, leaving them to bash into each other like confused bouncers. Then the Kaizer Chief schemer shuffles in-field and spots a run from deep by Karuru. He tries to play the ball into his path ... but overhits it. Yet again, nice Zimbabwean play peters out at the finish. Zimbabwe sub: Rusike, Mushekwi off. Egypt sub: Donga on, Trezeguet off. Zimbabwe sub: It\u2019s an enforced change of goalkeeper, as Sibanda has not fully recoverd from the injury he suffered in the collission with Mohsen several minutes ago. Elvis Chipezeze on, Sibanda off. 76 min: Salah is robbed just outside the Zimbabwean box, then suddenly the Warriors hurtle forward on a menacing counter-attack. Karuru decides to let fly from 30 yards. He strikes it well but it\u2019s straight at the keeper, who saves with no panic. 74 min: The game enters a scrappy phase. It\u2019s tense. Egypt can\u2019t find the wit to get the killer goal and they know Zimbabwe can work their way into dangerous positions and may not continue to be as inaccurate with the final ball. Egypt substitution: Warda on, El Said off. 70 min: Lunga intercepts a pass deep in his own half and then embarks on a thrilling safari forward. It takes him all the way to within shooting range ... but he eschews that option and plays the ball infield. So Munetsi goes the long-range shot instead, wellying the ball way wide from 30 yards. 67 min: Slack defending by Zimbabwe as Trezegut collects a throw-in from the right and is allowed to look up and play a simple pass through to Salah, who has a free shot on the run from 12 yards. But Salah scuffs his effort, leaving Sibanda with an easy save! 65 min: Karuru, who has had a fine game, does well to dig out a cross from the left. But El Shenawy snaffles it. Zimbabwe, though, are spending more and more time in Egyptian territory. The hosts aren\u2019t safe yet ... 64 min: A freekick on the right gives Zimbabwe a chance to send a cross into the box. But the delivery is shoddy. Egypt substitution: Solimon on, Mohsen off. That likely means that Salah will shift to centreforward and Solimon will go in on the right wing. 60 min: Elneny sweeps a pass from the left to Salah on the far flank. The Liverpool man takes it down beautifully and then feeds Elmohamady, who clips a pass towards Mohsen. The striker flips it around the last defender and tries to retrieve it on the far side but, yet again, Sibanda rushes off his line to intervene. This time, however, it\u2019s at some cost to the keeper, as he collided with Mohsen and seems to have done himself a mischief. 57 min: Zimbabwe have spent more time in Egyptian territory over the lsat five minutes or so but they\u2019re interplay around the box has gone awry at critical times. There\u2019s a hint of a threat from them but unless they can summon a little more precision, it will remain unfulfilled. 55 min: Billiat tries to drop a freekick from the left into the path of the runners in yellow ... but instead he sends it too long, into the arms of El Shenawy. 53 min: The eer-alert Sibanda hurries off his line to prevent Salah from latching on to a nice through-ball by El Said. 50 min: Salah dodges past Musona and then tries to thread a ball through to Mohsen. But Trezeguet gets in the way, giving a reprieve to the Zimbabwe defence. 48 min: Trezeguet cuts in from the left wing and tries to send a curling shot into the net from 25 yards. Sibanda throws himself across goal and tips it around the post for a corner. 47 min: Salah tries to wriggle his way down the right and initially looks like he\u2019s about to going to get into a shooting position near the edge of the area. But Munetsi sticks in a foot to sabotage is run, and then Nakamba arrives at the scene to tidy up. Good defensive work by the Zimbabwean pair. Salah has been heavily involved in this game so far an full of positive intent, but things aren\u2019t quite coming off for him. 46 min: Zimbabwe begin the second half but lose the ball within seconds. The tournament has begun with a pleasantly brisk half, and the hosts have the lead thanks to a deadly finish by Trezeguet after Zimbabwe were caught trying to play out from the back. Until then the Warriors had played well, defending stoutly and proving troublesome on the counter-attack. Egypt, who made a rampant start, begin to look short of ideas; but Trezeguet\u2019s strike has transformed the game and Egypt looked very dangerous again after it. Zimbabwe, then, need to use half-time to steady themselves and try to figure out a way to stem the Egyptian flow again and spring forward themselves for an equaliser. It\u2019s a decent contest and Egypt can\u2019t rest until they\u2019ve scored at least one more. 45+1 min: Mohsen and Mudimu receive treatment after banging heads as they challenged for a ball into the box. 45 min: Zimbabwe are reeling and Egypt are trying to finish them off before the break. Everything was going so well for the visitors until just a few minutes ago; now they have to shift into survival mode and get to half-time. 43 min: Salah tries to land another blow while Zimbabwe still try to com to terms with the first. He unleashes a crisp shot from 25 yards, but it whizzes a couple of yards wide. Musona loses possession mid-way inside his own half and then Trezeguet takes over, collecting a pass from Ashraf as he runs into the left-hand side of the box before cutting past Hadebe and on to his right foot and curling the ball into the far corner! 37 min: Lunga does well to stop a run by Salah down the right and then take the ball forward to start a counter-attack. When their progress is stopped by a foul, Billiat takes the freekick quickly and slips in Mushekwi. El Shenawy hares of his line to make an important block at the expense of a corner. 35 min: With Hegazi off the pitch receiving treatment to his profusely bleeding nose - I don\u2019t know how that happened - Billiat sizes up a freekick for Zimbabwe. It\u2019s over 25 yards out but he is undaunted. But he got his calculations all wrong, because his shot sails high over the bar. 33 min: Mohamady finds Salah with another long pass from the back, but Hadebe hares out to meet him and put the ball behind for a corner. Salah delivers and inswinger to the back post, where Alaa mistimes his jump and somehow manages to head wide from two yards! 31 min: A high cross from the left wing reaches Salah beyond the far post. He fools Lunga with a feint one way and then the other, making enough room to blast off a low shot. Sibanda is well positioned to make a solid save. 29 min: Egypt\u2019s early vim has subsided and they\u2019re looking a little short of ideas at the moment. Things are going pretty much to Sunday Chidzambwa\u2019s plan for now. 27 min: Salah tries to release Trezeguet with a quick pass from midfield, but that plan founders on a poxy first touch by Treeguet. 25 min: Zimbabwe are becoming increasingly pesky for the hosts. They\u2019re tidy players and beginning to piece together some purposeful moves in the Egyptian half, with Billiat and Karuru particularly influential. 23 min: A pass by El Said takes a nick off a defender and deflects into the path of Mohsen just beyond the far post. The forward hits the bouncing ball on the half-volley but fails to keep it down, sending it a couple of yards over the bar. 22 min: Mohamady crosses from the right. Hadebe hooks it clear. 21 min: Nakamba leads a break from midfield after a nice give-and-go pass. They work it into Mushekwi in the box. He initially holds it up well but then force of numbers takes its toll and he\u2019s dispossessed. 19 min: Salah comes deep again to pick up the ball and try to drop a lofted pass behind the Warriors\u2019 defence and into the path of Mohsen. But, as with the previus time, he overhits it and the keeper collects. 16 min: Salah gives Hadebe the slip down the right and cuts into the box. Mohsen calls for a pass near the penalty spot but he\u2019s marked, so Salah prefers to try a shot himself from an acute angle. He fires over the bar. 14 min: Salah has been invited to go on another couple of raids down the right just now, but both times he was foiled by solid Zimbabwean defending, notably by Mudimu. 11 min: Salah causes havoc down the right before firing in a cross thta Sibanda half-clears. Elmohamady collects it on the right-hand side of the box and cuts it back for El Said ... who leans back and sidefoots his shot over from 15 yards! 10 min: Zimbabwe step in to interrupt another Egyptian attack, and then launch one of their own. Billiant feeds Karuru, who tries to pick out Mushekwi from the left wing. But he misdirects his cross. Still, Zimbabwe, despite beingmostly on the back foot, have shown enough so far to prove they could be bothersome on the counter-attack. 8 min: Swish play by the Pharaohs, with Salah the chief conductor. A series of rapid one-twos takes him from the right wing to the edge of the box, where he tees up El Said for a smart shot from 16 yards. But it too close to Sibanda, who bats it away. 6 min: Zimbabwe show they are not to be trifled with by mounting a dangerous break. Musonda got it going with a clever pass into the left-hand channel, where Mushekwi took it up before laying it back for a cross. It\u2019s deflected out for a corner, which yields nothing. 4 min: Salah drops deep to collect the ball off Hegazi. Then he aims a long pass from half-way over the top towards Mohsen. But Sibanda rushes off his line to intercept. 3 min: It\u2019s been a dominant start from Egypt. They\u2019re pinging the ball around fast and sharp and penning their opponents into their own box. Salah fired over a dangerous in-swining cross from the right that was batted behind for a corner, and then Sibanada had to tip a looping header by Mohsen over the bar. 1 min: We have kickoff! Egypt get the show on the road ... send the ball out of play within 14 seconds. You know the way the TV cameras goes down the team lineup as their national anthem is played? Yeah, well the Egyptian cameraman really didn\u2019t want to move beyond Mohamed Salah: he just lingered on the forward\u2019s face as if marvelling at a natural wonder, and it seemed like he had to be pushed to continue on to the next player .... Here comes the teams. Zimbabwe are resplendent in an all yellow kit, while the hosts wear their familiar red shirts, white shorts and black socks - and nearly everyone in the crowd appears to be dressed in the same colours. The pitch looks immaculate, the temperature is 26 degrees, and the national anthem are about to begin. The 2019 Africa Cup of Nations is about to kick off ... The opening ceremony is in progress in the Cairo International Stadium and it looks and sounds astonishing. Under dark night sky the pitch is currently covered by three large model pyramids, all illuminated red laser lights and the mobile phones of about 60,000 fans, most of whom seem to have brought some manner of truck horn with them, too. Wait, now the topography of Egypt is displays on the huge silver tarp covering the pitch. And now there\u2019s bursts of fire, and elegant dancers who come together to form the face of a Pharaoh. No schlock here, this is high class stuff. And what an atmosphere! Egypt: El-Shenawy, El Mohamady, Alaa Eldin, Hegazi, Mansour; Hamed, Elneny; Salah, El Said, Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet; Mohsen Subs: El-Shenawy; El Mohamady; Gabe, Ghazal, Soliman, Ashraf, Kamel, Hamdi, Mahgoub, Emad, Warda, Abdel Rehim Zimbabwe: Sibanda; Darikwa, Mudimu, Hadebe, Lunga; Nakamba, Munetsi, Karuru, Mushekwi; Musona, Billiat Subs: Phiri, Pfumbidzai, Chawapiwa, Rusike, Dzingai, Chipezeze, Kadewere, Mutizwa, Mahachi, Kamusoko, Mhlanga Referee: A Alioum (Cameroon) Hello and welcome to the opening match of the 32nd Africa Cup of Nations. Eleven of the previous editions have been won by the host country and it would be no surprise if that happened again this time \u2013 in fact, a lot of Egyptians would be outraged if it did not. Home support has helped spur the Pharaohs to victory on the three of the four precious occasions that they staged the continent\u2019s gala event, and this time they have one of the world\u2019s best players, one Mohamed Salah. Pressure? Sure, but Salah and the rest of Egypt\u2019s players are used to coping with that. That bit about \u2018the rest of Egypt\u2019s players\u2019 is important, because whereas the team that reached last year\u2019s World Cup were set up by the then-manager Hector Cuper to defend to the max and channel all attacks through Salah, this side, under Javier Aguirre, are more committee and rounded attackers. They do not just rely on Salah to do the damage \u2013 players such as Trezeguet, Kouka, Mohsen and Soliman are all capable of tormenting opposing defences. And given that Egypt\u2019s own defence is prone to occasional creaking, the Pharaohs like to stay on the front foot. The crowd in Cairo today expect and demand if not a goal spree, then at least concerted and relentless offence. All of which means Zimbabwe have a big challenge on their hands. But Sunday Chidzambwa\u2019s men got here by topping a testing group \u2013 finishing above two Congos and Liberia thanks notably to a smart counter-attacking victory in Kinshasa. Their ambition will be to spring something similar today to claim their first win in the Africa Cup of Nations since 2006 \u2013 the last time it as hosted in Egypt.",

      "body": "<p>Jeremy Hunt has challenged Boris Johnson to agree to live TV debates before Conservative party members begin voting in the leadership contest. He said the candidates needed to have their character tested as part of the job.</p> <p>On Friday, the Sky News anchor Kay Burley said Johnson had turned down the chance to take part in a TV debate next Tuesday in front of a Tory-supporting audience.</p> <p>Hunt wrote to his leadership rival on Friday afternoon saying he believed they should take part in at least two debates in the next fortnight, before members receive their postal ballots.</p> <p>Johnson has so far committed only to a debate on ITV on 9 July, by which time Tory party members will have received their ballots.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Hunt has challenged Boris Johnson to agree to live TV debates before Conservative party members begin voting in the leadership contest. He said the candidates needed to have their character tested as part of the job. On Friday, the Sky News anchor Kay Burley said Johnson had turned down the chance to take part in a TV debate next Tuesday in front of a Tory-supporting audience. Hunt wrote to his leadership rival on Friday afternoon saying he believed they should take part in at least two debates in the next fortnight, before members receive their postal ballots. Johnson has so far committed only to a debate on ITV on 9 July, by which time Tory party members will have received their ballots. The Guardian understands that Johnson\u2019s camp agreed with ITV that this would be the first head-to-head debate, requiring Sky to move its debate back. The foreign secretary said it was essential that candidates were tested before they took on the job of prime minister, suggesting untested candidates such as Theresa May and Gordon Brown had not been successful prime ministers and the \u201cstakes are too high\u201d for that to happen again. \u201cThe purpose of this stage is to test us \u2013 our plans, our policies, our character,\u201d Hunt wrote to Johnson. \u201cWe do this country and our democracy a deep disservice if we hide away until members have submitted their postal ballots.

Don\u2019t for one second think that it is justified | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We need to rethink our current approach. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/21/iran-latest-trump-drone-attack-timeline-airstrikes-called-off\">war with Iran</a> would be an absolute disaster. As former general Anthony Zinni has <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/the-consequences-of-a-strike-on-iran-adb27963ff01/\">put it</a>: \u201cIf you like Iraq and Afghanistan, you\u2019ll love Iran.\u201d If the US were to attack Iran, Iran could respond with attacks on US troops and on countries around the region. It would lead to the further destabilization of that region in a way that is unimaginable and would result in wars that would go on years and probably cost trillions of dollars.</p> <p>Sixteen years ago, the US committed one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the history of our country by attacking Iraq. That war was sold to the American people based on a series of lies about weapons of mass destruction. One of the leading advocates for that war was John Bolton, who served as a member of the Bush administration and is now Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser. Incredibly, even today, Bolton is one of the few remaining people in the world who continues to believe that the Iraq war was a good idea.</p> <p>That war led to the deaths of <a href=\"https://dod.defense.gov/News/Casualty-Status/\">more than 4,400 American troops,</a> with tens of thousands of American soldiers wounded, many severely, and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians killed. It unleashed a wave of radicalism and destabilization across the region that we will be dealing with for many years to come. It was the biggest foreign policy disaster in American history.</p> <p> Trump campaigned on getting the US out of \u201cendless wars\u201d, but his administration is taking us down a path that has made war with Iran more and more likely.</p> <p>First, there was the president\u2019s reckless decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal with Iran a year ago and re-impose crushing sanctions on Iran.

      "bodyText": "The drums of war are beating in Washington again. Just today we learned that the US came very close to striking targets inside Iran in response to the downing of a US drone in the Persian Gulf. Last week the White House announced that a 1,000 additional troops would be sent to the Middle East in response to an alleged Iranian attack on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Last month, the New York Times reported that the Pentagon had presented a plan to the White House that envisions sending as many as 120,000 troops to the region to fight Iran. We need to rethink our current approach. A war with Iran would be an absolute disaster. As former general Anthony Zinni has put it: \u201cIf you like Iraq and Afghanistan, you\u2019ll love Iran.\u201d If the US were to attack Iran, Iran could respond with attacks on US troops and on countries around the region. It would lead to the further destabilization of that region in a way that is unimaginable and would result in wars that would go on years and probably cost trillions of dollars. Sixteen years ago, the US committed one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the history of our country by attacking Iraq. That war was sold to the American people based on a series of lies about weapons of mass destruction. One of the leading advocates for that war was John Bolton, who served as a member of the Bush administration and is now Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser. Incredibly, even today, Bolton is one of the few remaining people in the world who continues to believe that the Iraq war was a good idea. That war led to the deaths of more than 4,400 American troops, with tens of thousands of American soldiers wounded, many severely, and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians killed. It unleashed a wave of radicalism and destabilization across the region that we will be dealing with for many years to come. It was the biggest foreign policy disaster in American history. Trump campaigned on getting the US out of \u201cendless wars\u201d, but his administration is taking us down a path that has made war with Iran more and more likely. First, there was the president\u2019s reckless decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal with Iran a year ago and re-impose crushing sanctions on Iran. This was a move opposed by his own top security officials, including then secretary of defense James Mattis. Why? Because they knew, as do the vast majority of national security experts in the US, Europe and around the world, that the nuclear deal was effectively preventing Iran from moving forward with its nuclear program. The Iran nuclear deal put Iran\u2019s nuclear program under the most intense inspections regime in history. It got Iran to give up more than 98% of its stockpile of enriched uranium. Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign has reversed those gains. Iran recently announced that, in response to a year\u2019s worth of increased US sanctions, it would increase its stockpile of enriched uranium beyond the limits imposed by the nuclear deal. Bizarrely, Trump is now warning Iran not to violate an agreement his administration violated over a year ago. While there is still much we need to know about the attack on the tankers and the shooting down of the drone, clearly the Trump administration\u2019s rhetoric and increased sanctions are escalating tensions. The US and the international community have a shared interest in protecting international shipping lanes and airspace. We need to work multilaterally to do this. Unfortunately, the US is isolated from its most important allies right now because of Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the nuclear deal and campaign against Iran. Because of Trump\u2019s constant lying, the word of the US is doubted by many around the world. Voices of dissent went unheeded in the lead-up to the Iraq war. They must be heeded now. Congress must do everything it can to prevent this war. The constitution is very clear: it is Congress, not the president, who decides when we go to war.

      "body": "<p>With ten games remaining this season, the fact that there are realistically two-thirds of Super League still in danger of relegation means there are no shortage of narratives for those looking to find one. Yet as the weeks go on, and the trap-door to the Championship looms, you have to wonder just how this season will end for Leeds Rhinos.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in control of where we will finish this season,\u201d was the defiant message post-match from their interim coach, Richard Agar, after another defeat which underlined the grave deficiencies of a side who appear to be staring into the abyss. Agar may well be right, but given how there has not yet been any sign of the Rhinos turning this dismal season around save for the odd false dawn, you would forgive any Leeds supporter for beginning to panic.</p> <p>The fact London Broncos - tipped by many for relegation this season - keep winning, and are now two points clear of the Rhinos at the foot of the table, only further illustrates the gravity of this situation. Here they were well-beaten before half-time, trailing 24-6 against a St Helens side who, it must be said, played nowhere near their scintillating best, underlining the gulf in quality between two sides who have 14 Super League titles between them.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve mentioned relegation in the sheds, but we know we\u2019re still in control,\u201d Agar said. You cannot dispute the effort, which in itself is a step forward from where Leeds were a month or so ago \u2013 but this season is fast approaching a point in which results become imperative, not performances. Such is Leeds\u2019 frail confidence at present, the damage had been done within four minutes. They hadn\u2019t even touched the ball by the time they were 12-0 behind, with early tries for Kevin Naiqama and Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook.</p> <p>On the day of the summer solstice, this certainly had all the makings of the longest day of the year for the Rhinos - and while Brad Dwyer\u2019s first-half try was mere consolation for the visitors, before tries from Lachlan Coote and a wonderful one-handed finish from Tommy Makinson made it 24-6 at the break. Even then, so early in proceedings, there was no way back.

      "bodyText": "With ten games remaining this season, the fact that there are realistically two-thirds of Super League still in danger of relegation means there are no shortage of narratives for those looking to find one. Yet as the weeks go on, and the trap-door to the Championship looms, you have to wonder just how this season will end for Leeds Rhinos. \u201cWe\u2019re in control of where we will finish this season,\u201d was the defiant message post-match from their interim coach, Richard Agar, after another defeat which underlined the grave deficiencies of a side who appear to be staring into the abyss. Agar may well be right, but given how there has not yet been any sign of the Rhinos turning this dismal season around save for the odd false dawn, you would forgive any Leeds supporter for beginning to panic. The fact London Broncos - tipped by many for relegation this season - keep winning, and are now two points clear of the Rhinos at the foot of the table, only further illustrates the gravity of this situation. Here they were well-beaten before half-time, trailing 24-6 against a St Helens side who, it must be said, played nowhere near their scintillating best, underlining the gulf in quality between two sides who have 14 Super League titles between them. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve mentioned relegation in the sheds, but we know we\u2019re still in control,\u201d Agar said. You cannot dispute the effort, which in itself is a step forward from where Leeds were a month or so ago \u2013 but this season is fast approaching a point in which results become imperative, not performances. Such is Leeds\u2019 frail confidence at present, the damage had been done within four minutes. They hadn\u2019t even touched the ball by the time they were 12-0 behind, with early tries for Kevin Naiqama and Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook. On the day of the summer solstice, this certainly had all the makings of the longest day of the year for the Rhinos - and while Brad Dwyer\u2019s first-half try was mere consolation for the visitors, before tries from Lachlan Coote and a wonderful one-handed finish from Tommy Makinson made it 24-6 at the break. Even then, so early in proceedings, there was no way back. On any other night, a 17th victory in 19 league games for St Helens would claim the headlines, but against such an ordinary Leeds side here, this was as routine as it gets. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really play at our best,\u201d said their coach, Justin Holbrook: underlining the lofty standards surrounding the Saints at present.

      "body": "<p>On the Labor side of politics, the beltway saga of Anthony Albanese versus John Setka has grabbed the headlines in recent weeks, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/19/labor-gears-up-for-battle-as-unions-fight-to-keep-john-setka-in-party\">the public spat</a> lumbering towards a decision point at the party\u2019s national executive meeting on July 5.</p> <p>But the troublesome Setka losing his ALP membership is only one item of business for the looming national executive. Another important consideration for that meeting is Labor\u2019s post-campaign review: who does it, and how broad is the scope of the inquiry.</p> <p>Campaign postmortems are always delicate exercises, particularly after contests a party expects to win. Everyone has legacies to defend, and nobody wants to get blamed for the debacle.</p> <p>While the decision hasn\u2019t yet been made, the former South Australian premier Jay Weatherill, who has longstanding relationships with frontbenchers Mark Butler and Penny Wong (both strong supporters of Albanese), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/05/jay-weatherill-asked-to-conduct-warts-and-all-review-of-labors-election-loss\">seems a lock as one of the reviewers</a>.</p> <p>But there has been some argy bargy behind the scenes about which rightwinger should join him in the inquisition, possibly because Weatherill might be seen in some quarters as too aligned to the new power structure currently settling in to the opposition leader\u2019s office, and some people might want a bit of competitive tension in the process.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/17/coalitions-tax-plan-would-benefit-men-almost-twice-as-much-as-women-analysis-finds\">Coalition's tax plan would benefit men almost twice as much as women, analysis finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a view in Labor officialdom that the postmortem should concern itself with the nuts and bolts of what went wrong during the 2019 campaign, and why, rather than morph into addressing the more existential questions about where Australia\u2019s social democratic party finds itself at this particular moment in history.</p> <p>It\u2019s pretty obvious that Labor needs to assess its campaign performance as a matter of urgency, rather then indulge a Grand Poobah seminar, given the poor result on 18 May, and given senior players evidently believed they were winning the campaign as they were losing it.</p> <p>Notably, Labor\u2019s national president Wayne Swan has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/12/wayne-swan-says-combating-inequality-remains-labors-sacred-mission\">moved with a certain amount of alacrity to put some shape around the postmortem</a>. It\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t want Labor\u2019s 2019 economic platform completely decimated as a consequence of the review, and the reasons for that are obvious \u2013 he was a forceful intellectual advocate over the past term for the collective focus on inequality and redistribution.</p> <p>But Albanese is trying to draw some lines as he settles into the new job of leading Labor, and one of his clear early signals is the ALP needs to put more focus on aspiration as well as fairness \u2013 which is a bit of shorthand for Labor needs a growth narrative. In one of Albanese\u2019s early forays, the new Labor leader said he wanted \u201cto appeal to people who are successful as well as lift people up who aren\u2019t as successful\u201d.</p> <p>The difference between Swan and Albanese is a nuance rather than an order-of-magnitude rupture, particularly as the new leader is doubtless still working through what his \u201cmake aspiration great again\u201d rhetoric will actually mean in practice, a process that plays out issue by issue.</p> <p>There will be an early indication of the post-election line drawing on Monday, when the shadow cabinet makes a decision about whether or not to support some or all of the Coalition\u2019s income tax cut package.</p> <p>In the lead up to Monday\u2019s decision, Labor MPs have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/21/anthony-albanese-says-labor-considering-supporting-coalitions-tax-plan\">extemporising about what should happen</a> about the income tax cuts. As well as the public thinking out loud, there has been some leaking too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/12/inequality-is-growing-in-australia-labors-mission-is-to-create-a-fairer-society\">Inequality is growing in Australia. Labor's mission is to create a fairer society | Wayne Swan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both of these activities are unusual in recent times, with Labor putting a premium on unity and discipline in the last term.

      "bodyText": "On the Labor side of politics, the beltway saga of Anthony Albanese versus John Setka has grabbed the headlines in recent weeks, with the public spat lumbering towards a decision point at the party\u2019s national executive meeting on July 5. But the troublesome Setka losing his ALP membership is only one item of business for the looming national executive. Another important consideration for that meeting is Labor\u2019s post-campaign review: who does it, and how broad is the scope of the inquiry. Campaign postmortems are always delicate exercises, particularly after contests a party expects to win. Everyone has legacies to defend, and nobody wants to get blamed for the debacle. While the decision hasn\u2019t yet been made, the former South Australian premier Jay Weatherill, who has longstanding relationships with frontbenchers Mark Butler and Penny Wong (both strong supporters of Albanese), seems a lock as one of the reviewers. But there has been some argy bargy behind the scenes about which rightwinger should join him in the inquisition, possibly because Weatherill might be seen in some quarters as too aligned to the new power structure currently settling in to the opposition leader\u2019s office, and some people might want a bit of competitive tension in the process. There is a view in Labor officialdom that the postmortem should concern itself with the nuts and bolts of what went wrong during the 2019 campaign, and why, rather than morph into addressing the more existential questions about where Australia\u2019s social democratic party finds itself at this particular moment in history. It\u2019s pretty obvious that Labor needs to assess its campaign performance as a matter of urgency, rather then indulge a Grand Poobah seminar, given the poor result on 18 May, and given senior players evidently believed they were winning the campaign as they were losing it. Notably, Labor\u2019s national president Wayne Swan has moved with a certain amount of alacrity to put some shape around the postmortem. It\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t want Labor\u2019s 2019 economic platform completely decimated as a consequence of the review, and the reasons for that are obvious \u2013 he was a forceful intellectual advocate over the past term for the collective focus on inequality and redistribution. But Albanese is trying to draw some lines as he settles into the new job of leading Labor, and one of his clear early signals is the ALP needs to put more focus on aspiration as well as fairness \u2013 which is a bit of shorthand for Labor needs a growth narrative. In one of Albanese\u2019s early forays, the new Labor leader said he wanted \u201cto appeal to people who are successful as well as lift people up who aren\u2019t as successful\u201d. The difference between Swan and Albanese is a nuance rather than an order-of-magnitude rupture, particularly as the new leader is doubtless still working through what his \u201cmake aspiration great again\u201d rhetoric will actually mean in practice, a process that plays out issue by issue. There will be an early indication of the post-election line drawing on Monday, when the shadow cabinet makes a decision about whether or not to support some or all of the Coalition\u2019s income tax cut package. In the lead up to Monday\u2019s decision, Labor MPs have been extemporising about what should happen about the income tax cuts. As well as the public thinking out loud, there has been some leaking too. Both of these activities are unusual in recent times, with Labor putting a premium on unity and discipline in the last term. This loose dynamic will either settle or it won\u2019t, as Labor makes a collective decision about whether it wants to regroup and put itself on track to win the next election, or set itself up for a long stint in opposition. Going into Monday\u2019s deliberation, it\u2019s pretty clear Labor will support stage one and two of the government\u2019s income tax cut package, but support for the third stage, which would create a flat tax rate of 30% for people earning between $45,000 and $200,000, remains moot at this point. Some in Labor are currently arguing they should just draw the line and pass the whole package. If the third tranche proves to be unaffordable, that\u2019s the government\u2019s problem, not Labor\u2019s, and Labor can just repeal that element if it wins the next election, arguing circumstances have changed. This \u201clet \u2019er rip baby\u201d attitude is fine if all you are thinking about is producing some cognitive dissonance to stop News Corp from pumping out endless class warfare headlines. But it\u2019s more complicated if you think you are a chance to win the next election, and then you are the newly elected government having to repeal the tax cuts you helped legislate because now, apparently, the imperative is getting the budget back on track. It\u2019s hard to make the case you didn\u2019t know at the time the package was fiscally reckless, because it\u2019s pretty obvious the package is fiscally reckless. Even before you get to the point of being the new government having to repeal tax cuts you passed only a couple of years ago, you first have to be upfront and win an election while you are telling voters you are going to repeal the tax cuts you helped legislate a couple of years ago. Now call me old-fashioned, but that flip-flopping doesn\u2019t sound like the most compelling election pitch I\u2019ve ever heard, particularly as the 2019 result suggests Australians are pretty focused on their material interests right at the moment, and don\u2019t like the thought of having to give concessions up, even if those concessions are fiscally unsustainable. While it\u2019s always fraught to try and second guess a decision that hasn\u2019t been made yet, particularly in circumstances where the leader has left all options open and is telling colleagues he wants a genuine discussion, I suspect Labor will caveat any support for stage three if that\u2019s where the collective wisdom lands \u2013 apply some form of conditionality. In any case, current indications suggest the government is on track to get the tax cuts through with crossbench backing, which would just leave Labor having to determine what it says about stage three of the package over the coming term. In terms of the crossbench, all eyes are on the Senate swing vote, Jacqui Lambie, who is by all accounts, brimming with confidence, and content to let the \u201cwill she or won\u2019t she\u201d suspense build to a satisfying return-to-Canberra thunder clap.",

      "body": "<p>Give that man a swimming pool. Pimp the team bus. Rejig the semi-final calculations. At the end of a week in which Sri Lanka\u2019s players have been reduced to whingeing about the backstage arrangements, and on a day when England\u2019s opening bowlers confirmed their own status as the leanest, most compelling cutting edge at this World Cup, there was something thrilling about the sight of Sri Lanka\u2019s own 35-year-old white-ball marvel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/21/england-sri-lanka-cricket-world-cup-report\" title=\"\">taking his team to victory in Leeds</a>.</p> <p>As the sun dipped over the edge of the Emerald stand at close of play, Lasith Malinga could be seen at the boundary edge being politely mobbed by a crowd of supporters. For half an hour he posed for selfies, hand clasps and back-slaps, sucking the sweetness from the moment in a way that has, as ever in the tangled depths of Sri Lankan cricket, its own wider significance.</p> <p>Malinga\u2019s status has often been a little confused. He has been a popular hero in Sri Lanka, but never an establishment darling, never entirely untroubled in his public portrayal. There has been unkind comment in the media on the swell of his burgeoning gut and the money earned in overseas leagues. He has enjoyed the familiar dance of captaincy, lost captaincy and the ill will of those in power. Dismissed once as a brash interloper, in later life Malinga has been cast by some as a mercenary and gadabout.</p> <p>In reality he is, of course, neither. You don\u2019t get this good, or succeed from such small-town beginnings without a cold hard dedication to your craft. And as ever it was Malinga who changed this game, taking a listing team to victory over the favourites with two fine spells of bowling.</p> <p>Plus there was that point of contrast. On a bright, fresh, chilly Headingley day, Jofra Archer and Mark Wood had produced another performance of sustained high-end fast bowling to decorate the first half of this game.</p> <p>It is always surprising how teams can change their points of emphasis. England were so confident in their batting order leading into the World Cup they could afford to be coy about including Archer at all. And yet this World Cup match was ultimately set up by their bowlers, then lost by their batsmen, who made a steaming, bubbling hash of chasing down Sri Lanka\u2019s 233.</p> <p>There were limp prods, brainless swipes, and the sense of a muscular lineup unable to change down a gear and grind out a low winning total. Most of all there was Malinga. It is 13 years now since an English team first faced the master of the round-arm fling.

      "bodyText": "Give that man a swimming pool. Pimp the team bus. Rejig the semi-final calculations. At the end of a week in which Sri Lanka\u2019s players have been reduced to whingeing about the backstage arrangements, and on a day when England\u2019s opening bowlers confirmed their own status as the leanest, most compelling cutting edge at this World Cup, there was something thrilling about the sight of Sri Lanka\u2019s own 35-year-old white-ball marvel taking his team to victory in Leeds. As the sun dipped over the edge of the Emerald stand at close of play, Lasith Malinga could be seen at the boundary edge being politely mobbed by a crowd of supporters. For half an hour he posed for selfies, hand clasps and back-slaps, sucking the sweetness from the moment in a way that has, as ever in the tangled depths of Sri Lankan cricket, its own wider significance. Malinga\u2019s status has often been a little confused. He has been a popular hero in Sri Lanka, but never an establishment darling, never entirely untroubled in his public portrayal. There has been unkind comment in the media on the swell of his burgeoning gut and the money earned in overseas leagues. He has enjoyed the familiar dance of captaincy, lost captaincy and the ill will of those in power. Dismissed once as a brash interloper, in later life Malinga has been cast by some as a mercenary and gadabout. In reality he is, of course, neither. You don\u2019t get this good, or succeed from such small-town beginnings without a cold hard dedication to your craft. And as ever it was Malinga who changed this game, taking a listing team to victory over the favourites with two fine spells of bowling. Plus there was that point of contrast. On a bright, fresh, chilly Headingley day, Jofra Archer and Mark Wood had produced another performance of sustained high-end fast bowling to decorate the first half of this game. It is always surprising how teams can change their points of emphasis. England were so confident in their batting order leading into the World Cup they could afford to be coy about including Archer at all. And yet this World Cup match was ultimately set up by their bowlers, then lost by their batsmen, who made a steaming, bubbling hash of chasing down Sri Lanka\u2019s 233. There were limp prods, brainless swipes, and the sense of a muscular lineup unable to change down a gear and grind out a low winning total. Most of all there was Malinga. It is 13 years now since an English team first faced the master of the round-arm fling. They still can\u2019t play him. In the warm-ups here Malinga had strolled up, arm wanging out behind him and knocked down a single rubber stump four times in a row on the half-volley. As England chased he bowled 82mph in his jumper and picked up a pair of edges and a pair of classic full-slinger lbws. James Vince, Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root and Jos Buttler were the flower of England\u2019s batting ripped out, all deceived by that masterly, dipping, veering command of length and line. Malinga remains a sui generis modern great, the boy from the palm scrub who swam in the sea to build his strength, who came to the city as a country nobody; who is still basically bowling a tennis ball on the beach; but who did for the most heavily resourced team in ODI history here. England will right themselves from this defeat. Bad batting days can happen. They play Australia at Lord\u2019s on Tuesday, another welcome spark in the middle overs of this poorly structured tournament. England\u2019s best moments here came when their own fast bowlers were in action as a pair. It has been the surprise of the last few weeks, the way the bowling attack, so often a supporting cast for that adrenal batting lineup, has become a sword and not just a shield For the fifth time in six games England\u2019s bowlers restricted the opposition to less than 300. Archer and Wood once again bowled with relentless toe scorching, throat-searing heat, the kind of shared speed from both ends that is physically and mentally draining to face. With six wickets between them in Sri Lanka\u2019s innings England\u2019s two quicks now have 27 wickets at this World Cup to 26 for Mitch Starc and Pat Cummins. The pace-off at Lord\u2019s on Tuesday takes on a little extra urgency now, in a game England really could do with winning Sri Lanka had decided to bat first here. They were three for two, 14 balls into the day, Chris Woakes providing a reminder of his own role in that pace attack.

Answers include a reminder of director Luc Besson\u2019s action movie credentials, an attempt to start a female-fronted assassin franchise and a showcase for the acting talents of model Sasha Luss. Or at least that\u2019s what <em>could</em> be said of the film, sight unseen. Because in actuality, the delayed, and rather dumped thriller (distributor Lionsgate refused to screen the film for press) is an unqualified failure on all three counts, a wide-releasing multiplex dweller that instead works best as an undemanding late-night TV watch, exactly where it should have been offloaded in the first place.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/20/childs-play-review\">Child's Play review \u2013\u00a0a razor-sharp and exquisitely gruesome toy story</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After Besson scored a surprise global hit with the rather barmy Scarlett Johansson actioner Lucy, he used his increased sway to get the even barmier Valerian made, an audacious and expensive misfire that at the very least showcased his untamed creative spark. But Besson\u2019s gonzo excesses didn\u2019t attract a wide enough audience and everything about his follow-up feels like a director settling back into a safe groove. Anna is not quite pedestrian but it never really feels like the work of someone with anything to say or prove. It\u2019s competent and even complacent at times, a million miles from what one would expect from the director of The Fifth Element.</p> <p>In a plot that feels patchworked together from better films, Anna (Luss) is a woman in need of a chance. In 80s Moscow, there aren\u2019t that many available to her and while trying to strike out on her own, the patriarchal society she\u2019s trapped in forces her into a life of submission. But one day she gets given an opportunity to work for the KGB and after being reluctantly taken under the wing of sour, ruthless handler Olga (Helen Mirren) she finds herself to be a surprisingly ruthless assassin while moonlighting as a model because of course. But after years of servitude, Anna starts to worry that a life spent taking other lives might not be what she really wants.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOYeBlgQdFg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sOYeBlgQdFg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Revisiting his 1990 calling card La Femme Nikita, Besson has managed something quite astonishing in that he has somehow made Anna even worse than that film\u2019s much-loathed Hollywood remake, 1993\u2019s Point of No Return. In the almost 30 years since his original hit, we have seen a string of films focused on female assassins (although still not nearly as many as those starring men) yet Anna seems to exist in a world where these films don\u2019t exist. For so much of the film, Besson rests on the \u201cshock\u201d appeal of showing a beautiful blonde woman being able to kill just as ruthlessly and as violently as any man, as if we\u2019re new to the concept and as if that\u2019s enough to add sheen to a tired, familiar plot.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/sasha-luss-star-of-luc-besson-anna-movie.html\">Besson sees Anna</a> as a star vehicle for Russian model Luss, who he used as an alien in Valerian, and as rote as the script might be, one can still imagine what the right choice of actor might have brought to the material. The similarly themed Atomic Blonde and Red Sparrow were both deeply flawed, but Charlize Theron and Jennifer Lawrence elevated them effortlessly, both bringing old-fashioned star presence to projects that didn\u2019t deserve them.

      "bodyText": "Who or what is Anna? Answers include a reminder of director Luc Besson\u2019s action movie credentials, an attempt to start a female-fronted assassin franchise and a showcase for the acting talents of model Sasha Luss. Or at least that\u2019s what could be said of the film, sight unseen. Because in actuality, the delayed, and rather dumped thriller (distributor Lionsgate refused to screen the film for press) is an unqualified failure on all three counts, a wide-releasing multiplex dweller that instead works best as an undemanding late-night TV watch, exactly where it should have been offloaded in the first place. After Besson scored a surprise global hit with the rather barmy Scarlett Johansson actioner Lucy, he used his increased sway to get the even barmier Valerian made, an audacious and expensive misfire that at the very least showcased his untamed creative spark. But Besson\u2019s gonzo excesses didn\u2019t attract a wide enough audience and everything about his follow-up feels like a director settling back into a safe groove. Anna is not quite pedestrian but it never really feels like the work of someone with anything to say or prove. It\u2019s competent and even complacent at times, a million miles from what one would expect from the director of The Fifth Element. In a plot that feels patchworked together from better films, Anna (Luss) is a woman in need of a chance. In 80s Moscow, there aren\u2019t that many available to her and while trying to strike out on her own, the patriarchal society she\u2019s trapped in forces her into a life of submission. But one day she gets given an opportunity to work for the KGB and after being reluctantly taken under the wing of sour, ruthless handler Olga (Helen Mirren) she finds herself to be a surprisingly ruthless assassin while moonlighting as a model because of course. But after years of servitude, Anna starts to worry that a life spent taking other lives might not be what she really wants. Revisiting his 1990 calling card La Femme Nikita, Besson has managed something quite astonishing in that he has somehow made Anna even worse than that film\u2019s much-loathed Hollywood remake, 1993\u2019s Point of No Return. In the almost 30 years since his original hit, we have seen a string of films focused on female assassins (although still not nearly as many as those starring men) yet Anna seems to exist in a world where these films don\u2019t exist. For so much of the film, Besson rests on the \u201cshock\u201d appeal of showing a beautiful blonde woman being able to kill just as ruthlessly and as violently as any man, as if we\u2019re new to the concept and as if that\u2019s enough to add sheen to a tired, familiar plot. Besson sees Anna as a star vehicle for Russian model Luss, who he used as an alien in Valerian, and as rote as the script might be, one can still imagine what the right choice of actor might have brought to the material. The similarly themed Atomic Blonde and Red Sparrow were both deeply flawed, but Charlize Theron and Jennifer Lawrence elevated them effortlessly, both bringing old-fashioned star presence to projects that didn\u2019t deserve them. Luss appears in virtually every scene of Anna, and in not a single one of them does she prove worthy of such a task. She\u2019s a black hole at the centre of the film, her performance so sedate and lifeless that it sucks all the energy right out of a thriller that should be jacked up with adrenaline. As her duelling love interests, Cillian Murphy (Irish but playing American) and Luke Evans (Welsh but playing Russian but sounding Scottish) struggle to rise above the dross they signed up to which leaves it up to Mirren to have some campy fun as a heartless anti-matriarch figure, spouting lines like \u201cTrouble never sends a warning!\u201d and having more fun than anyone else in the film or the audience. There\u2019s ample room for commentary on the journey a woman trying to rise up in a man\u2019s world, especially given the setting, but bar a few throwaway lines, this is business as usual. Luss is still a fetishised object, especially as she engages in a rather pointless romantic relationship with a fellow female model, and at times the film plays like a softcore porno just with the sex scenes cut short. It\u2019s not empowering by itself to show a woman with a gun, especially when she\u2019s wearing such little clothing, and the film does at times play uneasily given the accusations of sexual misconduct levelled at Besson, something that led to its many delays (the director denies \u201creprehensible behavior of any kind\u201d). What ultimately sinks the film is its overwhelming blandness, from the lack of creativity employed in Anna\u2019s many kills to Besson\u2019s inability to choreograph a pulse-racing action scene, and the script\u2019s belaboured attempts to jump back and forward in time to wrongfoot us only highlight how little it brings to the table.

A cruising 2-0 defeat of Sweden in their final Group F game, albeit both already having qualified, went part of the way to answering that. Of course sterner tests are to come but the swaggering, confident performances shown so far have all the hallmarks of champions.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/21/uswnt-sweden-takeaways-world-cup\">Confident USA riding high entering Women's World Cup knockout stage</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>2) France</strong></h2> \n<p>Corinne Diacre\u2019s home side came out of the blocks with intent against South Korea. Since then the journey has been harder fought and has benefited from some much discussed \u2013 though correct \u2013 VAR decisions. The Lyon spine has been vital to their perfect start. When Diacre has shuffled the pack, though, the team\u2019s flow has looked disrupted, prompting questions about whether the squad is deep enough.</p> \n<h2><strong>3) England</strong></h2> \n<p>The first England team to finish a World Cup group stage with top marks since 1982 has shown flashes of genius. But consistency across 90 minutes has been a problem. Phil Neville\u2019s heavy rotation policy has been successful thus far but, with tougher tests on the horizon, there is a feeling he needs to settle a little more on a first-choice XI. Will he be bold and hand some of the impressive fringe stars a more central role?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/21/cameroon-england-womens-world-cup-last-16-nchout-ajara\">Cameroon\u2019s Nchout Ajara, a heroine on and off the pitch, can hurt England</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>4) Netherlands</strong></h2> \n<p>The Dutch will concede and at the back they look disorganised. But further forward they have the most potent attack in the World Cup in their new all-time top-scorer Vivianne Miedema, Lieke Martens, Shanice van de Sanden and Danielle van de Donk. Two against Canada \u2013 who had conceded only once in 2019 \u2013 to top the group showed they are a serious force.</p> \n<h2><strong>5) Italy</strong></h2> \n<p>In a group alongside Australia and Brazil few would have penned Italy as table toppers. Exploiting the weakness of the Australian defence to come from behind to win showed a much stronger side than expected. Eight of the Italian squad play for two-year-old and two-time title winners Juventus, including Cristiana Girelli and Barbara Bonansea, who have five goals between them.

Yet the Group B winners have nine points, three clean sheets and five different goal scorers. They are no one-woman team. With the best run without a defeat of any team in the competition \u2013 15 games \u2013 Martina Voss-Tecklenburg\u2019s side have quietly flown under the radar.</p> \n<h2><strong>7) Australia</strong></h2> \n<p>Possibly the most lopsided team in the tournament, the chaotic Australia defence is balanced by the goal machine, Sam Kerr, up top.

      "bodyText": "1) USA The question after USA\u2019s 13-0 win against Thailand \u2013 in which Alex Morgan scored five \u2013 and 3-0 victory over Chile was whether they could do it against tougher opponents. A cruising 2-0 defeat of Sweden in their final Group F game, albeit both already having qualified, went part of the way to answering that. Of course sterner tests are to come but the swaggering, confident performances shown so far have all the hallmarks of champions. 2) France Corinne Diacre\u2019s home side came out of the blocks with intent against South Korea. Since then the journey has been harder fought and has benefited from some much discussed \u2013 though correct \u2013 VAR decisions. The Lyon spine has been vital to their perfect start. When Diacre has shuffled the pack, though, the team\u2019s flow has looked disrupted, prompting questions about whether the squad is deep enough. 3) England The first England team to finish a World Cup group stage with top marks since 1982 has shown flashes of genius. But consistency across 90 minutes has been a problem. Phil Neville\u2019s heavy rotation policy has been successful thus far but, with tougher tests on the horizon, there is a feeling he needs to settle a little more on a first-choice XI. Will he be bold and hand some of the impressive fringe stars a more central role? 4) Netherlands The Dutch will concede and at the back they look disorganised. But further forward they have the most potent attack in the World Cup in their new all-time top-scorer Vivianne Miedema, Lieke Martens, Shanice van de Sanden and Danielle van de Donk. Two against Canada \u2013 who had conceded only once in 2019 \u2013 to top the group showed they are a serious force. 5) Italy In a group alongside Australia and Brazil few would have penned Italy as table toppers. Exploiting the weakness of the Australian defence to come from behind to win showed a much stronger side than expected. Eight of the Italian squad play for two-year-old and two-time title winners Juventus, including Cristiana Girelli and Barbara Bonansea, who have five goals between them. Dark horses. 6) Germany With the influential Lyon playmaker Dzsenifer Marozs\u00e1n suffering a broken toe in their narrow 1-0 win against China it was easy to write off any chance of a serious title challenge. Yet the Group B winners have nine points, three clean sheets and five different goal scorers. They are no one-woman team. With the best run without a defeat of any team in the competition \u2013 15 games \u2013 Martina Voss-Tecklenburg\u2019s side have quietly flown under the radar. 7) Australia Possibly the most lopsided team in the tournament, the chaotic Australia defence is balanced by the goal machine, Sam Kerr, up top. Kerr already has five goals to draw her level with Morgan. How far Ante Milicic\u2019s side can survive on a \u2018you score two, we\u2019ll score three\u2019 mentality is anyone\u2019s guess but, with Kerr firing on all cylinders, anything is possible. 8) Canada As mentioned, the Canadians had conceded only once in 2019 before they shipped two to the Netherlands to finish second in Group E.

      "bodyText": "Mexico\u2019s immigration chief has vowed to slash the number of migrants entering his country by 60% and prevent Mexico from being used as \u201ca trampoline\u201d to the United States, as the Mexican government scrambles to satisfy Donald Trump\u2019s demands to curb migration. Trump has given Mexico a 45-day deadline \u2013 which ends on 22 July \u2013 to reduce the flow of undocumented Central American migrants to the United States\u2019 southern border, leaving the Mexican government racing to meet those demands and avert the threat of tariffs. This week \u2013 as Mexican security forces intensified an ongoing crackdown on migrants \u2013 authorities said more than 6,000 members of Mexico\u2019s National Guard had been deployed to \u201cseal off\u201d its southern border with Guatemala. Trump has not publicly specified by how much he expects Mexico to reduce migration in order to escape punitive tariffs. But in an interview with the Mexican newspaper La Raz\u00f3n, Mexico\u2019s newly appointed immigration chief, Francisco Gardu\u00f1o, said he hoped to prevent hundreds of thousands of migrants entering the country each year as part of a \u201ccontainment\u201d drive designed to cut of arrivals by 60%. The influx of so many migrants from Central America, Asia and Africa was \u201cno longer a normal phenomenon\u201d and had to be reduced, Gardu\u00f1o said. The latest US-Mexico crisis erupted at the end of May when Trump unexpectedly announced the imminent introduction of tariffs on Mexican goods \u201cuntil such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP\u201d. Those tariffs \u2013 which experts warned would inflict serious pain on both countries\u2019 economies \u2013 were averted after an agreement was reached for Mexico to reduce the number of migrants reaching the US border and host an increased number of Central Americans while their asylum applications were processed in the US. And since that deal was struck, on 7 July, the Mexican government has been battling to demonstrate it is working hard to rein in migration. On Saturday police and immigration officials reportedly detained 791 migrants heading north towards the US border in lorries \u2013 an operation authorities hailed as \u201cunprecedented\u201d in size. During a visit to Mexico\u2019s southern border on Thursday the president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, said Mexico had given the US an undertaking that there would be \u201cmore control\u201d over migration, while insisting he still favoured a \u201chumanitarian\u201d approach. \u201cThere\u2019s an effort here to convince the United States that they are taking this very seriously and taking immediate action to head-off a potential 45-day crisis,\u201d said Eric Olson, a Mexico specialist from Washington\u2019s Woodrow Wilson Centre. But Olson said it was wrong to imagine Mexico had only decided to start policing its southern border because of Trump\u2019s threats. \u201cThere is a narrative \u2013 at least in the United States and from Donald Trump - that Mexico is doing nothing. That is patently false,\u201d he said. \u201cThe threat of tariffs certainly elevates it in terms of urgency. But it\u2019s not like they were like: \u2018Oh my god! I guess we\u2019d better do something!\u2019\u201d In fact, Olson said L\u00f3pez Obrador was facing a growing backlash against migrants from Mexican citizens, as well as Trump. \u201cThere is increasing push back from [Mexican] communities and from the people who are being most affected directly by the growing number of Central Americans and you see that on the two borders, but also along the route.\u201d Observers believe that backlash is likely to intensify as Mexico accepts greater numbers of Central American migrants because of its deal with the US. \u201cMexico is not well-prepared to receive potentially tens of thousands of Central Americans,\u201d in dangerous and over-crowded border cities such as Tijuana, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and Matamoros, Olson said. In an interview with the BBC, the former US ambassador to Mexico, Roberta Jacobson, said she also feared Mexico would struggle to feed, house and find jobs for so many arrivals. L\u00f3pez Obrador would have to learn he could not always acquiesce to \u201cthe demands of a bully like Trump\u201d, Jacobson added.",

It has been reported that they intend to move into Downing Street together if he is elected leader. Johnson\u2019s office was contacted earlier on Friday for comment but had not responded by the time of publication.",

      "bodyText": "A nurse who was strangled, raped and murdered by a convicted sex offender was failed by police and probation services, an inquest has concluded. Lisa Skidmore\u2019s killer was under the supervision of the National Probation Service at the time of the attack at her home in Wolverhampton in November 2016. A jury at Black Country coroner\u2019s court found that failures by police and probation staff made \u201cmore than a minimal contribution\u201d to her death. Leroy Campbell, 57, had previously targeted lone women and broken into their houses. He was released on licence four months before he attacked 37-year-old Skidmore. Six weeks prior to the attack, Leroy told probation services and West Midlands police separately that he had been noticing open windows \u2013 a trigger for his previous offending \u2013 but this information was not shared and no attempt was made to recall him to prison. Leroy climbed into Skidmore\u2019s home using ladders, where he attacked her and her 80-year-old mother before setting fire to the property in an attempt to destroy evidence. Returning a narrative verdict, jurors said there were failures to document information and carry out basic checks, and insufficient consideration was given to the option of recalling Campbell to prison. A probation worker has been sacked for gross misconduct in relation to the case. During the two-week inquest, Sonia Crozier, the director of the National Probation Service, said significant changes to probation services introduced under Chris Grayling as justice secretary had resulted in a deficiency of qualified probation officers and increased workloads. The former prisons and probation minister Rory Stewart met Skidmore\u2019s family twice to personally apologise for the failings and assured them that changes would be made to the training, assessment and management of probation staff. A review into the death by HM Inspectorate of Probation found that authorities failed in their duty to minimise risks to the public and did not \u201cdo their job properly\u201d. West Midlands police said in a statement: \u201cThe murder of Lisa Skidmore and the assault on her mother is one of the most horrific and appalling crimes in recent years and our thoughts remain with Lisa\u2019s family who are, quite rightly, seeking answers for how this happened. \u201cWe are committed to reducing reoffending and protecting the public from harm, and to do this we have a dedicated offender management team who work with partner agencies and offenders to assist rehabilitation and also identify risk. \u201cIn the last six years we have invested millions of pounds and tripled the number of officers managing those released from prison.

Chipper and unpretentious despite a long list of achievements, she long ago established a talent for breaking new ground. The first woman to ride 100 winners in a year in British racing and the first to win a Group One race outright, she was also on the \u201cGirls\u201d team when they first won the Shergar Cup here, an event that has become her favourite day of the year.</p> <p>Kelleway and others showed that women can win in the saddle but it was Turner who made a habit of it and who did it at the sport\u2019s highest level as well. Now, thanks to the late surge of the 33-1 shot Thanks Be in the Sandringham Stakes, she has a Royal Ascot victory to her name as well. It came at the expense of the Queen, whose Magnetic Charm was beaten by just a neck.</p> <p>Asked what it meant to her, Turner replied with a cheerful dig at her only predecessor: \u201cQuite a lot because, although we all love Royal Ascot, we have to listen to Gay every year.

I\u2019m getting the hang of it.\u201d</p> <p>Turner has been invited by many a reporter to complain about chauvinism in the sport and, indeed, there must be some reason why the capable female jockeys around these days do not get more rides in this key week. But she has always insisted that the chances are there for any jockey who proves to be deserving.</p> <p>\u201cI went in the changing room today and there was Josephine Gordon, Hollie Doyle, Nicola Currie, they\u2019re all there all the time now. The standard is just so high and they all deserve to be here with good rides.

The forensic sector has been hit by a series of problems recently, including the collapse of Key Forensic Services and the continuing criminal investigation into alleged drug test manipulation at the Randox Testing Services laboratory in Manchester. The NPCC said it was unclear how long it would be before Eurofins could give assurances that its systems were safe or whether any forensic data held by the company had been affected or accessed by the perpetrators of the cyber-attack. Ransomware is a type of computer program that infiltrates an IT system and threatens to publish the victim\u2019s data or block their access to it by encrypting files. Eurofins said prompt action had been taken to contain the incident and that it had not so far found any evidence that confidential client data had been stolen or transferred. \u201cInformation from law enforcement and independent cybersecurity experts lead us to believe that this attack has been carried out by highly sophisticated, well-resourced perpetrators,\u201d the company said. Rob Jones, the director of threat leadership at the National Crime Agency, which is leading the criminal investigation into the cyber-attack, said: \u201cSpecialist cybercrime officers from the NCA are working with partners from the National Cyber Security Centre and the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council to mitigate the risks and assess the nature of this incident. \u201cWe are securing evidence and forensically analysing infected computers, but due to the quantity of data involved and the complexity of these kinds of inquiries, this is an investigation which will take time; therefore we cannot comment further.\u201d",

Dimuth Karunaratne\u2019s side, pursued by the rain for most of their stay here, had been grumpily unimpressive until now with a solitary victory over Afghanistan.</p> <p>But here in the Headingley sunshine they humiliated England, for whom only Ben Stokes, stranded at the crease at the end on 82, could be content with his display with the bat. Not that he will be smiling much after England had lost a match which they appeared to be controlling at the halfway stage with Sri Lanka restricted to 232 for nine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jun/21/england-v-sri-lanka-cricket-world-cup-2019-live\">Sri Lanka beat England by 20 runs: Cricket World Cup 2019 \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The architects of Sri Lanka\u2019s win were the old soldiers on the brink of being discarded. Angelo Mathews hit a craggy unbeaten 85 \u2013 a gnarled old pro\u2019s innings by his standards which looked insufficient to keep his side in the game. Then Lasith Malinga, the old white-ball trouper, conjured four vital wickets from nowhere, all of them top-order batsmen.</p> <p>Here was a fine example of the difference between a World Cup match and one that is part of a bilateral series. A target of 233 for a side that loves chasing? A mere bagatelle. Not with the additional tension of a tournament that matters, not against a Sri Lankan side that has been universally derided, but which, unlike the bookies, refused to accept that defeat was inevitable.</p> <p>The tension in the England dressing room was triggered by the early dismissal of both openers, a rare event in this tournament, especially among those near the top of the table. For the second time in the competition Jonny Bairstow was out first ball, lbw to Malinga. James Vince unveiled the statutory brace of breathtaking strokes before departing caught at slip.</p> <p>Now it was 26 for two and no time for frippery. England had budgeted for two more points here and this could no longer be taken for granted. But Joe Root was still there. The best teams have an ordinary Joe, a batsman prepared to be self-effacing, who does not need to have the crowd gasping at the audacity of his strokeplay, who measures risk and reward adroitly. However, on this occasion Root could not guide his team home despite posting his fifth half-century of the tournament. After Eoin Morgan had succumbed to an excellent return catch by Isuru Udana, Root flicked down the leg side and the review proved positive - for Sri Lanka</p> <p>Stokes remained resolute, a pragmatist among wayward cavaliers. Now his partners kept disappearing with wanton regularity.

      "bodyText": "Against all the odds Sri Lanka produced the result of the tournament with a stunning 20-run victory over England. Dimuth Karunaratne\u2019s side, pursued by the rain for most of their stay here, had been grumpily unimpressive until now with a solitary victory over Afghanistan. But here in the Headingley sunshine they humiliated England, for whom only Ben Stokes, stranded at the crease at the end on 82, could be content with his display with the bat. Not that he will be smiling much after England had lost a match which they appeared to be controlling at the halfway stage with Sri Lanka restricted to 232 for nine. The architects of Sri Lanka\u2019s win were the old soldiers on the brink of being discarded. Angelo Mathews hit a craggy unbeaten 85 \u2013 a gnarled old pro\u2019s innings by his standards which looked insufficient to keep his side in the game. Then Lasith Malinga, the old white-ball trouper, conjured four vital wickets from nowhere, all of them top-order batsmen. Here was a fine example of the difference between a World Cup match and one that is part of a bilateral series. A target of 233 for a side that loves chasing? A mere bagatelle. Not with the additional tension of a tournament that matters, not against a Sri Lankan side that has been universally derided, but which, unlike the bookies, refused to accept that defeat was inevitable. The tension in the England dressing room was triggered by the early dismissal of both openers, a rare event in this tournament, especially among those near the top of the table. For the second time in the competition Jonny Bairstow was out first ball, lbw to Malinga. James Vince unveiled the statutory brace of breathtaking strokes before departing caught at slip. Now it was 26 for two and no time for frippery. England had budgeted for two more points here and this could no longer be taken for granted. But Joe Root was still there. The best teams have an ordinary Joe, a batsman prepared to be self-effacing, who does not need to have the crowd gasping at the audacity of his strokeplay, who measures risk and reward adroitly. However, on this occasion Root could not guide his team home despite posting his fifth half-century of the tournament. After Eoin Morgan had succumbed to an excellent return catch by Isuru Udana, Root flicked down the leg side and the review proved positive - for Sri Lanka Stokes remained resolute, a pragmatist among wayward cavaliers. Now his partners kept disappearing with wanton regularity. Moeen Ali clubbed the off-spinner Dhananjaya de Silva to square leg for six and then, to the exasperation of all non-Sri Lankans in the Leeds crowd \u2013 sought another six over Udana at long-off. Instead he found the hands of Udana. Chris Woakes and Adil Rashid both opted to cut De Silva\u2019s off-spinners, something Tykes of old would never have tolerated \u2013 at least not before July. Both were caught behind by a jubilant Perera. Now 55 were needed with just two wickets in hand, a stern first test for Jofra Archer, the international batsman. Stokes was stranded once more as Archer holed out to long on. Now Stokes cracked 25 runs off his own bat including two mighty sixes off Udana. But Mark Wood, defending the last ball of Nuwan Pradeep\u2019s final over, edged to the keeper and the Sri Lanka celebrations could begin. They have moved into fifth place in the table.

What could have possessed a minister \u2013 especially one who has talked about helping women feel safe \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkFieldUK/status/1126432512727764992\" title=\"\">so they can speak freely and be part of the change we all want</a>\u201d \u2013 to grab a female protester, shove her against a pillar, then grasp her by the back of the neck and push her from the room?</p> <p>The degree of force used was shocking. Such misjudgments are all the more grave at a time when standards and norms of conduct are known to be imperilled \u2013 and civility in the public square seems increasingly to have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/11/missing-ingredient-debates-generosity-labour-antisemitism\" title=\"\">replaced by rancour</a>. All politicians have a responsibility to promote high standards in public life. It is right that Mr Field has been suspended from his ministerial role, and apologised. That so many people, including senior Conservative MPs, have <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48718725\" title=\"\">rushed to his defence</a>, gives cause for alarm. This is especially so at the end of a week that also saw the homelessness minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/20/homelessness-minister-accused-of-racist-remarks-in-email\" title=\"\">Heather Wheeler, forced to apologise</a>, for describing rough sleepers in her South Derbyshire constituency in pejorative terms as \u201cold tinkers\u201d.</p> <p>Politeness and civility are virtuous. This is not to argue for obsequious questioning or unquestioning respect for authority. The three years since the UK\u2019s Brexit referendum have revealed and deepened profound divisions of culture and opinion. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/14/homophobic-and-transphobic-hate-crimes-surge-in-england-and-wales\" title=\"\">rise in hate crime</a>, effects of austerity and climate emergency all provoke rightly angry responses. But beliefs can be strongly expressed without aggression.</p> <p>Three years ago the MP Jo Cox was murdered, and any MP could be forgiven a jumpy initial reaction when taken by surprise by a member of the public. Mr Field\u2019s recent actions went far beyond that, and such considerations make them appear all the more reckless. By modelling the use of violence in a situation where there was no physical threat, he may well have helped to lower the bar for the use of force.</p> <p>Whatever the outcome of the police and party investigations, Mr Field should now consider whether his future lies in public life.

      "bodyText": "Footage of a UK government minister, Mark Field, forcibly removing a Greenpeace activist from a City of London banqueting hall on Thursday night is not only extremely damaging to Mr Field, it has a detrimental effect more widely: on his party, his parliamentary colleagues and politics itself. The spectacle of a figure of Mr Field\u2019s seniority behaving in such a gratuitously aggressive manner, at an important national occasion, has the potential to reverberate far and wide. What could have possessed a minister \u2013 especially one who has talked about helping women feel safe \u201cso they can speak freely and be part of the change we all want\u201d \u2013 to grab a female protester, shove her against a pillar, then grasp her by the back of the neck and push her from the room? The degree of force used was shocking. Such misjudgments are all the more grave at a time when standards and norms of conduct are known to be imperilled \u2013 and civility in the public square seems increasingly to have been replaced by rancour. All politicians have a responsibility to promote high standards in public life. It is right that Mr Field has been suspended from his ministerial role, and apologised. That so many people, including senior Conservative MPs, have rushed to his defence, gives cause for alarm. This is especially so at the end of a week that also saw the homelessness minister, Heather Wheeler, forced to apologise, for describing rough sleepers in her South Derbyshire constituency in pejorative terms as \u201cold tinkers\u201d. Politeness and civility are virtuous. This is not to argue for obsequious questioning or unquestioning respect for authority. The three years since the UK\u2019s Brexit referendum have revealed and deepened profound divisions of culture and opinion. The rise in hate crime, effects of austerity and climate emergency all provoke rightly angry responses. But beliefs can be strongly expressed without aggression. Three years ago the MP Jo Cox was murdered, and any MP could be forgiven a jumpy initial reaction when taken by surprise by a member of the public. Mr Field\u2019s recent actions went far beyond that, and such considerations make them appear all the more reckless. By modelling the use of violence in a situation where there was no physical threat, he may well have helped to lower the bar for the use of force. Whatever the outcome of the police and party investigations, Mr Field should now consider whether his future lies in public life. Meanwhile, it would be good if Paul Crowther\u2019s sentencing for a common assault on Nigel Farage earlier this week drew a line under the recent spate of milkshake-throwing incidents. While this might seem a lighthearted way to make a serious point, the principle of non-violent dissent is too valuable to turn into spilt milk. The week has been dominated by a Conservative leadership contest that has compounded a national mood of disengagement and frustration. Confidence in our institutions is being tested to its limits. At such a time, it is more important than ever to respect people\u2019s democratic right to use their voices. Mr Field\u2019s decision to overpower an activist, rather than listen to her, reflects badly on him. Even more worrying is what it says about the state Britain is in.",

      "bodyText": "The next Conservative prime minister will face serious questions over whether they can command the confidence of the House of Commons, MPs have said after the party\u2019s already vulnerable majority was put in further danger by the recall of a disgraced MP. Several MPs told the Guardian they had \u201chuge concerns\u201d about whether Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt would be able to avoid an autumn election, given the Conservatives could lose another MP in an imminent byelection forced by the recall of Chris Davies. The loss would give the Tories a working majority of three, and at least two MPs, Ken Clarke and Dominic Grieve, have said they would vote against their party if necessary in a confidence vote in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit. The Guardian understands that Hunt raised concerns about the Tories\u2019 shrinking majority in a private hustings with Conservative councillors on Friday, suggesting it would make it almost impossible for any prime minister to pursue no deal. Davies was forced out on Friday by a recall petition following a conviction for expenses fraud, triggering a byelection in Brecon and Radnorshire, which he intends to fight as the Tory candidate. The seat, which the Liberal Democrats have high hopes of winning, could be one of the most significant byelection fights in recent history. Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party also intends to contest the seat. A majority of three would put the Conservatives perilously close to losing any majority. One frontbencher said they were particularly concerned because two anonymous Conservative MPs had apparently been so angered by the state of the party that they spoilt their ballot papers in the fourth round of the leadership vote.

The tense mood in the Conservatives was underlined when Sandbach, a supporter of Rory Stewart\u2019s campaign, tweeted text messages she received from a fellow Tory MP telling her to leave the party. Sandbach told the BBC she had received the message after the MP had been \u201ctrawling\u201d through a defunct WhatsApp group and found messages from her that he deemed objectionable.

One sceptical MP who saw Johnson in the last days of the campaign for MPs\u2019 votes said he told them he believed the chances of no deal were \u201cvanishingly small\u201d. Yet members of the ERG, including MPs such as Steve Baker and Mark Francois, claimed to have been told Johnson was willing to rip up the entire withdrawal agreement. Hunt\u2019s team believes its chances lie in skewering Johnson on the detail of his plan for exiting by 31 October, with one source saying the campaign team had \u201cenjoyed Mark Carney\u2019s take down of Boris\u2019s no-deal tariffs \u2018plan\u2019 this morning on the Today programme\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Mark Field, whose suspension as a Foreign Office minister was precipitated by the emergence of video footage showing him manhandling a Greenpeace protester who was trying to peacefully draw attention to the climate crisis, has often walked a fine line between seeking to protect the right to protest and to curb its effectiveness. In a Westminster Hall debate last month, he lauded the work of the Foreign Office in seeking to protect the rights of female activists across the world and detailed some of the many means used to silence them. When the Extinction Rebellion demonstrations were bringing parts of London to a standstill this year, Field similarly stood up for the right to protest peacefully. When it came to the actual demonstrations taking place, however, Field was more conflicted and went as far as to write to the Met police commissioner, Cressida Dick, demanding that she \u201ctake a much firmer grip\u201d on those \u201cprotesting in this anti-social way\u201d. The demonstrations, he said, had gone \u201cwell beyond a good-natured exercise in free speech\u201d. Field added that the \u201cdetrimental effect these protests are having on ordinary citizens and local business is much too great for the protesters, however well intention, to be allowed to carry on in such an flagrant way\u201d. It is a theme that has been repeated in other comments he has made in similar situations. In an interview with Channel 4 News in 2011, during the Occupy London demonstrations outside St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, he said he was \u201cvery proud that we have a tradition in this country of open protest. It is very much an important part of democracy.\u201d The early Occupy demonstrations were, he said, \u201cvalid\u201d. Asked whether the protest was not, therefore, still valid, he said: \u201cThere is making a protest and there is having a semi-permanent encampment \u2026 There are many rights that Londoners have and tourists have to be able to get into the cathedral and to be able to walk in what is the open highway.\u201d Field, who has been a member of parliament since 2001 and a junior minister since 2017, has been described in glowing terms by both political allies and opponents, including Labour\u2019s Liz McInnes, who has shadowed him. While she denounced his actions at Mansion House, she said she has \u201calways found him to be unfailingly polite\u201d. Field has often walked a fine line. Now he stands accused of crossing it.",

He was quickest in the morning leading a one-two with his teammate, Valtteri Bottas, only six-hundredths back, while Charles Leclerc was just under four-tenths back in third. Bottas led FP2 in front of Hamilton with Leclerc and Vettel in third and fourth, over six-tenths in arrears. Every sign indicates Mercedes are in position to extend the run that has seen them win all seven races this season and given Hamilton a 29-point lead in the world championship.",

Some of the messages become acrimonious on both sides, as Jack berated his parents for their criticism of his ideology. \u201cYou hurt your mother and I very deeply, but I suppose we\u2019re just nasty unbelieving western kafir enemies of Islam who need to be wiped out before your new utopian caliphate begins,\u201d Letts wrote. \u201cI feel I\u2019ve lost you and if I could forget I had a son called Jack this pain would stop. But I can\u2019t and I never will. I will stand here beside your mother and suffer with her until the end.\u201d Lane, too, chastised Jack. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say it, but I am very ashamed of you and the shame you have brought on us as a family,\u201d she wrote in June 2015. Jack hit back. \u201cYou lot brought me up without faith. You taught me and indoctrinated me to look down on religious people as brainwashed idiots [you know you did]. You taught me that life had no true purpose \u2026 that there\u2019s no afterlife and therefore no final justice. You taught me disbelief and darkness. Why should I be grateful for that?\u201d he wrote to his mother. Lane replied: \u201cWe weren\u2019t [aren\u2019t] religious ourselves. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we didn\u2019t give you the ability to choose what belief you wanted. \u201cFor my own sanity I have to believe you at least care about us a bit and if anything happened to us you wouldn\u2019t just think \u2018Good, that\u2019s three less kafir in the world.\u201d",

Clashes with police the previous night left more than 200 people injured and caused the parliamentary speaker to resign. The protests were prompted by a Russian MP addressing the Georgian parliament from the speaker\u2019s seat, during an assembly of legislators from Orthodox Christian countries being held in Tbilisi. Also on Friday, organisers of Georgia\u2019s first LGBT pride march, which had been planned for Saturday and threatened by religious and right-wing groups, called off the march, citing security concerns. Thousands of protesters spent several hours trying to storm parliament in the early hours of Friday, with some attacking the thick cordon of police outside the building in central Tbilisi.

You don\u2019t need to have felt the sharp edge of a man\u2019s temper to be afraid of it, and there is something viscerally disturbing about the sight of a hand closing in on a vulnerable neck. If he really thought she was so dangerous, why not wrestle her to the ground? And if he just wanted to get her out before she caused trouble, why not steer her by the elbow? As it is, the whole thing looks horribly reminiscent of a controlling husband, hustling away a wife who has had a few drinks at a party and is now in danger of making a scene, while everyone else stares uncomfortably at their shoes.</p> <p>But not everyone will see it that way. All over the country this morning, there will have been millions of Tory voters harrumphing that frankly she got what was coming to her; that it was her fault for bursting into a private dinner, wilfully causing a security scare when she must have known everyone was on edge. What happened split the room, never mind the country, with some guests reportedly horrified at what they saw as an overreaction while others broke into applause after she was removed.</p> <p>Field\u2019s fellow diners have been criticised in some quarters for failing to step in and calm things down, but in the heat of the moment it isn\u2019t always that simple. Theresa May\u2019s cabinet were mocked for sitting around helplessly when a man (who thankfully turned out merely to be a comedian pulling off a stunt) suddenly lunged towards the podium <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2017/oct/04/man-interrupts-theresa-mays-speech-to-hand-her-p45-video\" title=\"\">during her 2017 party conference speech</a>. But all I can say, having been there at the time, is that it takes longer than you think for the brain to catch up with the evidence right in front of your eyes. Most bystanders\u2019 natural response is to freeze in profoundly unheroic confusion, because they can\u2019t quite believe what they\u2019re seeing; surely this can\u2019t be real?</p> <p>But watching the Mansion House film back in the cold light of day, it is simply impossible not to form a view. </p> <p>We know which side May is on, at least: she rightly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/21/mark-field-suspended-as-minister-after-grabbing-climate-protester-by-neck\" title=\"\">suspended Field</a>, with Downing Street confirming that she found the footage \u201cvery concerning\u201d. Jeremy Hunt, whose leadership bid Field was supporting, chose to emphasise his colleague\u2019s apology while adding that \u201che recognises that what happened was an overreaction\u201d. But the biggest test of character here is perhaps for Boris Johnson, since those who instinctively sympathise with Field are now his natural constituency.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s path to the leadership in the current climate lies through the sort of Tory members grumbling that a man can\u2019t even act like a man any more without being vilified for it, plus those sick of being preached at by what they see as sanctimonious lefties chipping away at the lifestyles they lead. Many of them regard Hunt as suspiciously wet, warming instead to Johnson\u2019s incorrigible political incorrectness. But are these really the followers he wants? His reaction over the coming days is a fascinating test of what kind of leader he wants to be.</p> <p>At a debate hosted by the Policy Exchange thinktank last week, the strategist Lynton Crosby, widely expected to run Johnson\u2019s first general election campaign if he becomes leader, sketched out <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/lynton-crosby-says-next-tory-leader-must-offer-more-than-phoney-hope/ar-AAD3TZi\" title=\"\">how he thought the Tories might win</a> again. The model is Scott Morrison, the Australian politician who confounded pollsters, bookies and pundits by winning a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/22/scott-morrison-won-the-unwinnable-election-now-the-hard-part-begins\" title=\"\">surprise re-election victory</a> shortly after assuming the leadership of the governing Liberal party. Morrison had, Crosby explained, pitched himself as the man for \u201cquiet Australians\u201d \u2013 people who don\u2019t follow politics closely, aren\u2019t active on social media, and just want to be left to get on with life \u2013 and won by aligning himself with their gut values. The next Tory leader should also pitch themselves as being on the side of what the Australian prime minister Robert Menzies famously called the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.liberals.net/theforgottenpeople.htm\" title=\"\">forgotten people</a>\u201d, better known here as John Major\u2019s \u201csilent majority\u201d, Tony Blair\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/sep/27/labourconference.speeches\" title=\"\">hardworking families</a>\u201d, and David Cameron\u2019s middle income \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/07/conservative-conference-squeezed-middle-strivers\" title=\"\">strivers</a>\u201d. It may seem an oddly retro approach for the unpredictable times we\u2019re living through, but Crosby clearly still believes elections all come down in the end to telling a story of shared, broadly socially conservative values.</p> <p>And that\u2019s why the Mansion House incident matters; it\u2019s a perfect litmus test of where people stand on those values. Deep down, are you socially liberal pink or socially conservative blue? If the latter, do you believe a true gentleman never lifts a hand to a woman, or that women can\u2019t go around demanding equality and then expecting special treatment? Are you more afraid of cosy consensus forming behind closed doors, or of the chaos unleashed by someone breaking through them? All of us know, in our guts, how we\u2019d answer even if we might avoid saying so publicly. Do not trust the politician who seeks election without having the courage to spell it out.</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Many of them regard Hunt as suspiciously wet, warming instead to Johnson\u2019s incorrigible political incorrectness. But are these really the followers he wants? His reaction over the coming days is a fascinating test of what kind of leader he wants to be. At a debate hosted by the Policy Exchange thinktank last week, the strategist Lynton Crosby, widely expected to run Johnson\u2019s first general election campaign if he becomes leader, sketched out how he thought the Tories might win again. The model is Scott Morrison, the Australian politician who confounded pollsters, bookies and pundits by winning a surprise re-election victory shortly after assuming the leadership of the governing Liberal party. Morrison had, Crosby explained, pitched himself as the man for \u201cquiet Australians\u201d \u2013 people who don\u2019t follow politics closely, aren\u2019t active on social media, and just want to be left to get on with life \u2013 and won by aligning himself with their gut values. The next Tory leader should also pitch themselves as being on the side of what the Australian prime minister Robert Menzies famously called the \u201cforgotten people\u201d, better known here as John Major\u2019s \u201csilent majority\u201d, Tony Blair\u2019s \u201chardworking families\u201d, and David Cameron\u2019s middle income \u201cstrivers\u201d. It may seem an oddly retro approach for the unpredictable times we\u2019re living through, but Crosby clearly still believes elections all come down in the end to telling a story of shared, broadly socially conservative values. And that\u2019s why the Mansion House incident matters; it\u2019s a perfect litmus test of where people stand on those values. Deep down, are you socially liberal pink or socially conservative blue? If the latter, do you believe a true gentleman never lifts a hand to a woman, or that women can\u2019t go around demanding equality and then expecting special treatment? Are you more afraid of cosy consensus forming behind closed doors, or of the chaos unleashed by someone breaking through them? All of us know, in our guts, how we\u2019d answer even if we might avoid saying so publicly. Do not trust the politician who seeks election without having the courage to spell it out. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

Well it\u2019s been another amazing afternoon. Hayley Turner broke a 32-year gap by becoming only the second woman to ride a winner at Royal Ascot when successful on Thanks Be in the Sandringham Stakes. Ryan Moore and Frankie Dettori are slugging it out for the jockeys\u2019 title at the Royal meeting and ended the final race of the day coming home first and second in a pulsating finish, with Moore coming out on top and now on five winners to Frankie\u2019s seven. It could be that the final race of the meeting tomorrow, the Queen Alexandra Stakes, decides the prize for top rider as both ride fancied mounts. I also think we saw the performance of the meeting on the track with Japan\u2019s great win in the King Edwards VII Stakes. On top of all that, the Guardian tipster Chris Cook gave five out of six winners on the day. I hope you enjoyed it \u2013 I did and I hope you can join me again here tomorrow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efd139a831aa5b51f619ac2c2b904da98aebeb18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efd139a831aa5b51f619ac2c2b904da98aebeb18/0_136_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan Moore, red colours, just holds off Frankie Dettori, green colours to win the Duke Of Edinburgh Stakes on Baghdad at Royal Ascot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ryan Moore, red colours, just holds off Frankie Dettori, green colours to win the Duke Of Edinburgh Stakes on Baghdad at Royal Ascot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-21T16:52:33.316Z\">at 5.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d0d08be8f081e872734c46b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-21T16:42:49.327Z\">5.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Duke of Edinburgh Stakes Handicap (5.35pm) result</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>1 <strong>Baghdad</strong> (R L Moore) 7-2 Fav <br>2 <strong>Ben Vrackie</strong> (L Dettori) 7-1 <br>3 <strong>Fujaira Prince</strong> (Andrea Atzeni) 4-1 <br>4 <b>Corgi</b> (Jim Crowley) 7-1 <br>19 ran <br>Non Runner: 4 </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0d07108f080e828514cf56\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-21T16:37:41.240Z\">5.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Duke of Edinburgh Stakes Handicap (5.35pm)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And they\u2019re off ...

Fujaira Prince, beaten only by a talented rival at York, will surely be plugging on gamely up the straight. Ben Vrackie was a shade disappointing last year but his physique suggested he could do better again this summer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d269ebae074104b9ee142d9c8a2ce47e4f66ce42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d269ebae074104b9ee142d9c8a2ce47e4f66ce42/0_167_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The French celebrated victory with Watch me in style.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The French celebrated victory with Watch me in style.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Headington/racingfotos.com/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0d00a38f082364d7ceeb1d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-21T16:09:13.146Z\">5.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sandringham Stakes Handicap (5.00pm) result</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>1 <strong>Thanks Be</strong> (Hayley Turner) 33-1 <br>2 <strong>Magnetic Charm</strong> (James Doyle) 7-1 <br>3 <strong>Hotsy Totsy</strong> (J P Spencer) 7-1 <br>4 <strong>Coral Beach</strong> (R L Moore) 10-1 <br>27 ran <br>Also: 11-2 Fav Desirous <br>Non Runner: 23 </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9384b7f8249fc4cc8803cb442d382ebc632fd42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9384b7f8249fc4cc8803cb442d382ebc632fd42/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Punters cheering the winners home at Royal Ascot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Punters cheering the winners home at Royal Ascot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images for Longines</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0d004a8f081e872734c3ee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-21T16:06:55.036Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hayley Turner has become the first woman since Gay Kelleway 32 years ago to ride a winner at Royal Ascot when bringing Thanks Be through to win the Sandringham Stakes Handicap.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0cfee08f082364d7ceeb02\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-21T16:01:49.127Z\">5.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sandringham Stakes Handicap (5.00pm)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And they\u2019re off ...

She looked a likely improver when winning her handicap debut at Goodwood and two of her runs in defeat as a juvenile look a lot better now that the winners have shown themselves to be Group-class. Hotsy Totsy represents the yard that won this last year and is feared. Her Kempton win suggests she is easily worth her mark of 90. </p> <p>Magnetic Charm, gifted to the Queen by Sheikh Mohammed, offers the real prospect of a royal success. A half-sister to a Group Three winner at Royal Ascot, she battled well to win a Listed race on her reappearance and her rating looks on the lenient side. It\u2019s odd to see John Gosden run four without using Frankie Dettori; perhaps the Italian was unable to do the weight of 8st 7lbs for Nonchalance, to be partnered by Rab Havlin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2cf2b5c5a524dd4dc48b119ffc5c48771a4ad39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2cf2b5c5a524dd4dc48b119ffc5c48771a4ad39/0_163_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frankie getting over excited.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frankie getting over excited.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Davies/racingfotos.com/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0cf75c8f082364d7ceea77\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-21T15:30:53.189Z\">4.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Guardian tipster Chris Cook has done a Frankie!

This is what he said on his latest Ladbrokes blog.<br><br><strong>\u201cRose Of Kildare</strong> is a little bit of an outsider in the Chesham Stakes (2.30), but I don\u2019t know much about her to be honest. In the Jersey Stakes (3.05) I ride <strong>Maries Diamond</strong> but again he is an outsider. There are better horses in the race. I think <strong>Lah Ti Dar</strong> could run a big race in the Hardwicke Stakes (3.40). She will like the track and was second in the Fillies &amp; Mares Stakes. In the Diamond Jubilee Stakes (4.20), I ride <strong>Emblazoned</strong>. It will be a big ask but I hope we can get him placed. In the Wokingham (5pm), I am on one of the favourites in <strong>Danzeno</strong>. He likes Ascot. I was third in the QIPCO Sprint so he is a good horse on his day. My final ride of the meeting is on <strong>Corelli</strong> in the Queen Alexandra Stakes (5.35). It is two miles and five furlongs and he has never run that far so who knows. Hopefully if I get one winner, it will be an amazing day.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b03b7c9d8910829f9de5f0312ddf48791f15af9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b03b7c9d8910829f9de5f0312ddf48791f15af9b/0_137_4112_2467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frankie loves a kiss.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frankie loves a kiss.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Crowhurst/Getty Images for Ascot Racecourse</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-21T14:30:23.164Z\">at 3.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d0ce7f68f082364d7cee990\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-21T14:23:58.001Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Commonwealth Cup (3.40pm) betting</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <ul> <li>Ten Sovereigns \u2013 5/4</li> <li>Jash \u2013 5/1</li> <li>Advertise \u2013 7/1</li> <li>Khadeem \u2013 15/2</li> <li>Hello Youmzain \u2013 8/1</li> <li>Rumble Inthejungle \u2013 25/1</li> <li>Forever in Dreams \u2013 33/1</li> <li>Koncheck \u2013 66/1</li> <li>Royal Intervention \u2013 66/1</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.oddschecker.com/horse-racing/ascot/15:40/winner\">Full Oddschecker betting here </a></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ca4d7bc09c142b29508c5afe3f2872e661a6cb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ca4d7bc09c142b29508c5afe3f2872e661a6cb1/16_0_3468_2082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Albany Stakes finish at Royal Ascot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Albany Stakes finish at Royal Ascot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0ce6a18f080e828514cd62\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chriscook\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-21T14:19:50.291Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Commonwealth Cup (3.40pm) preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ten Sovereigns\u2019s Middle Park win is the best bit of form and he can be forgiven his non-staying effort in the Guineas.

A close second to Calyx here last year, he has some excellent six-furlong form and the blinkers could make a difference.

After a troubled preparation and a disappointing effort in his prep run, that was a terrific effort. Aidan O\u2019Brien was under no pressure to bring him here with the Irish Derby on the horizon, so he is presumably confident the horse is ready to go again and Japan looks the standout talent on show. </p> <p>One concern is that O\u2019Brien has only won this race once and that was 15 years ago, which seems surprising in view of how often he would have suitable horses. Bangkok boiled over before the Derby and reportedly failed to handle the track. His temperament will again be tested here but, if calmer, he undoubtedly has enough talent to win, so he is overpriced at 16-1. It\u2019s worrying that the market has allowed him to double in price. </p> <p>Private Secretary was briefly considered for the Derby but was felt not to be ready for the Classic. This is a serious test of John Gosden\u2019s son of Kingman, unbeaten in three this year at a lower level. He doesn\u2019t do anything quickly. Pondus takes a huge step up in class from the Sandown novice race he won easily last time.

Interviewed on Sky Sports Racing, he compared it to his Magnificent Seven, achieved 23 years ago at Ascot, but at the September meeting. <br><br>Dettori said: \u201cI could feel the people getting behind me and everybody wanted Stradivarius to win \u2013 it was magical. I can\u2019t lie, I was nervous before the race, but the Gold Cup went to plan. I had a good spot and looking at the replay I know why people were worried, but I thought I was fine as I knew everything that was going on! When I crossed the line, everyone went mad \u2013 it was great. I haven\u2019t experienced anything like it at Royal Ascot. We got over 66,000 people here yesterday and a lot of them won\u2019t know much about racing, but they got to experience something really special. To see a gutsy performance from Stradivarius is good for the sport and I was so pleased to be a part of it.</p> <p>\u201cStradivarius has become the people\u2019s favourite. His style of racing and the way he conducts himself is marvellous. He has a tremendous will to win and it is so obvious for people to see. It is a privilege for me to ride him obviously, for people in the grandstand and people at home, it is magical to see a horse like that \u2013 Stradivarius is a wonderful horse.

The Italian dominated the race from the start on his mount and and almost pulled off what would have been an historic fifth straight win on the day. </p> <p>If that had come off everyone would then have been willing the jockey to ride all six winners but it became clear early in the final race that his mount, Questionare, had not read the script and was not fully co-operating with his rider.

Pink, which looks a certainty to make an appearance at every meeting is next and should prove a popular pick on course with better weather forecast.</p> <p>\u201cRacegoers who want to participate in the Ascot tradition are urged to place bets with an off-course bookmaker before arriving, thanks to some of the colossal overrounds on display in the betting ring, although based on the lack of price sensitivity shown by trackside hat punters and the thin competition, the bookies are within their rights to try and recoup some of the Frankie losses any way they can.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f628cf20a73c90798cacab410210c6cc5ca108ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f628cf20a73c90798cacab410210c6cc5ca108ed/0_94_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Betting on the colour of the Queens hat at Royal Ascot on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Betting on the colour of the Queens hat at Royal Ascot on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Sorge/racingfotos.com/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-21T10:45:24.071Z\">at 11.45am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d0caf798f081e872734bf97\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chriscook\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-21T10:31:20.275Z\">11.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Top jockeys</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Frankie Dettori</strong> 6 wins<br><strong>Ryan Moore</strong> 3<br><strong>Danny Tudhope</strong> 3<br><strong>Jim Crowley</strong> 1<br><strong>Oisin Murphy</strong> 1<br><strong>James Doyle</strong> 1<br><strong>Richard Kingscote</strong> 1<br><strong>Harry Bentley</strong> 1<br><strong>Seamie Heffernan</strong> 1<br><br>This is Frankie\u2019s place and he proved it with his four-timer yesterday, which looked for all the world like a five-timer in the making for a few seconds.

They have all won the award for the top jockey at Royal Ascot since Frankie Dettori picked up the last of his five riding titles at this meeting way back in 2004.</p> <p>After the day that Dettori had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/20/frankie-dettori-royal-ascot\">here on Thursday</a>, it seems difficult to believe. In the first four races, there was not a stride out of place as the most famous name in the game racked up a 449-1 four-timer. He is also, and by an increased margin thanks to his exploits this week, the most successful current rider at the meeting, leading Ryan Moore by 66 winners to 56. Spencer, who is next on the list of current riders, has 23.</p> <p>But as well as his considerable talent, this is also a testament to Dettori\u2019s durability. His first winner at Royal Ascot came in 1990. Moore\u2019s arrived 18 years later. Dettori has been consistently top-class at Ascot for nearly three decades, while only rarely enjoying the kind of week that puts a rider at the top of the pile.</p> <p>Even now, after an afternoon that few who were there to absorb the crackling atmosphere will ever forget, Dettori is not assured of his first jockeys\u2019 title at the Royal meeting for 15 years. His total of six winners for the week gives him a healthy lead over Ryan Moore, who has three, but the bookies rate him only a 4-7 chance, with Moore on 11-8, when you might expect Dettori to be long odds-on.</p> <p>Today\u2019s card at Ascot could make all the difference. Dettori has rides in five of the six races, while Moore has a full book of six. In terms of quality, though, Moore is, on paper, streets ahead. Three of his rides are certain to start favourite, probably at 6-4 or shorter, while the best of Dettori\u2019s partners appears to be Private Secretary, the 4-1 second favourite behind Moore\u2019s ride Japan, in the King Edward VII Stakes, the second race on the card.</p> <p>A win for Dettori there would be a huge setback for Moore, who is ahead on a \u201ccountback\u201d of placed efforts and so needs only to draw level with his rival to win. Elsewhere on the card, it may take a little more of the Dettori magic that was so evident yesterday if Advertise (who faces the Moore-ridden favourite Ten Sovereigns in the Commonwealth Cup) or Twist \u2018N\u2019 Shake, around 12-1 to beat the dual Guineas winner Hermosa in the Coronation Stakes, is to extend his lead. One more winner, incidentally, would equal Dettori\u2019s personal record at the meeting, when he rode seven winners in 1998.</p> <p>Weather-wise, the prospects look excellent for Ascot today, with highs in the low 20s and no rain at all in the forecast. It has been dry at the track since Wednesday evening, but Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, reported this morning that the going is still good-to-soft on the straight course and good-to-soft, soft in places on the round course.</p> <p>Stickels does expect that to change as the day goes on, however. \u201cWe have a sunny day forecast, so I do expect a change in the going later to reflect that. A great forecast for tomorrow too. A dry, sunny day, so we should see the ground quicken up a little bit.\u201d</p> <p>Chris Cook\u2019s tips for the fourth day, including a 16-1 chance in the Coronation Stakes, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jun/20/talking-horses-watch-me-cause-upset-coronation-stakes-royal-ascot-horse-racing-tips\">here</a>, and all the news and more will be live here as the day unfolds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jun/20/talking-horses-watch-me-cause-upset-coronation-stakes-royal-ascot-horse-racing-tips\">Talking Horses: Watch Me the value in Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "How could Thursday\u2019s action when Frankie Dettori rode the first four winners be beaten? Well it\u2019s been another amazing afternoon. Hayley Turner broke a 32-year gap by becoming only the second woman to ride a winner at Royal Ascot when successful on Thanks Be in the Sandringham Stakes. Ryan Moore and Frankie Dettori are slugging it out for the jockeys\u2019 title at the Royal meeting and ended the final race of the day coming home first and second in a pulsating finish, with Moore coming out on top and now on five winners to Frankie\u2019s seven. It could be that the final race of the meeting tomorrow, the Queen Alexandra Stakes, decides the prize for top rider as both ride fancied mounts. I also think we saw the performance of the meeting on the track with Japan\u2019s great win in the King Edwards VII Stakes. On top of all that, the Guardian tipster Chris Cook gave five out of six winners on the day. I hope you enjoyed it \u2013 I did and I hope you can join me again here tomorrow. 1 Baghdad (R L Moore) 7-2 Fav 2 Ben Vrackie (L Dettori) 7-1 3 Fujaira Prince (Andrea Atzeni) 4-1 4 Corgi (Jim Crowley) 7-1 19 ran Non Runner: 4 And they\u2019re off ...

Turner got Charlie Fellowes\u2019 33-1 shot Thanks Be home in front by a neck from the Queen\u2019s Magnetic Charm in the Sandringham Stakes. Reflecting on her success, Turner said: \u201cThe girls\u2019 changing rooms are full now \u2013 and it was only a matter of time. Gay Kelleway was obviously the first, and great respect to her.\u201d PA Having managed to crack a leg bone in victory here last year, Baghdad has made a full recovery and was really game at Newmarket last month. That counts as a career best and his battling qualities should serve him well in this big field. Corgi was only beaten a neck by Baghdad last year but has continued to edge up the weights without winning. Byron Flyer ran a promising race at Epsom last time but is three years older than most winners of this. Fujaira Prince, beaten only by a talented rival at York, will surely be plugging on gamely up the straight. Ben Vrackie was a shade disappointing last year but his physique suggested he could do better again this summer. 1 Thanks Be (Hayley Turner) 33-1 2 Magnetic Charm (James Doyle) 7-1 3 Hotsy Totsy (J P Spencer) 7-1 4 Coral Beach (R L Moore) 10-1 27 ran Also: 11-2 Fav Desirous Non Runner: 23 Hayley Turner has become the first woman since Gay Kelleway 32 years ago to ride a winner at Royal Ascot when bringing Thanks Be through to win the Sandringham Stakes Handicap.

Thanks Be gets home to deny the Queen a royal winner with Magnetic Charm. Desirous is the new favourite now for the Sandringham. The bookies are running scared of Chris Cook, never mind Frankie! Rhys knows! Japan put up an even more impressive performance today in the King Edward VII Stakes when you crunch the stats. Can\u2019t wait to back it in the King George back at Ascot in July.

She looked a likely improver when winning her handicap debut at Goodwood and two of her runs in defeat as a juvenile look a lot better now that the winners have shown themselves to be Group-class. Hotsy Totsy represents the yard that won this last year and is feared. Her Kempton win suggests she is easily worth her mark of 90. Magnetic Charm, gifted to the Queen by Sheikh Mohammed, offers the real prospect of a royal success. A half-sister to a Group Three winner at Royal Ascot, she battled well to win a Listed race on her reappearance and her rating looks on the lenient side. It\u2019s odd to see John Gosden run four without using Frankie Dettori; perhaps the Italian was unable to do the weight of 8st 7lbs for Nonchalance, to be partnered by Rab Havlin. Guardian tipster Chris Cook has done a Frankie! He has had the first four winners today and if he has the last two, colleague Barry Glendenning will be retiring, which will be bad news for the Football Podcast fans but good news for him. 1 Watch Me (P C Boudot) 20-1 2 Hermosa (R L Moore) Evens Fav 3 Jubiloso (James McDonald) 9-2 9 ran Also: 7-1 Twist \u2018n\u2019 Shake 4th Non Runner: 7 And they\u2019re off ...

Here comes Twist \u2018N\u2019 Shake but Watch Me goes clear and is going to win. John Hunt with an interesting point about the final race of the meeting tomorrow. Frankie Dettori has now matched his best total of winners, seven, which came back in 1998. Here he is winning the Gold Cup in that year: It\u2019s now good ground on the straight course; good to soft on the round course.

It\u2019s Watch Me in the next. Come on my son ... er daughter! Hermosa seeks to complete the Guineas/Irish Guineas/Coronation Stakes hat-trick that was achieved by her stablemate Winter just two years ago, and there is every reason to expect a big run from Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s likeable filly. But the opposition here looks a step up on what she\u2019s faced and the available odds take little account of that. Castle Lady, the unbeaten French Guineas winner, is a big danger while, at 14-1, there could be plenty of value in Watch Me from the Francis Graffard yard that won Sunday\u2019s French Oaks. Watch Me didn\u2019t look comfortable on the heavy going and met trouble in running on the way to being sixth in the French Guineas, but she has a lot of speed and can be seen to better effect on this ground. Jubiloso is out of Frankel\u2019s half-sister and has easily won a maiden and a novice race, but this is another level altogether. That is the seventh winner of the meeting for the irrepressible Frankie Dettori and that may have clinched the jockey of the meeting title for the Italian. He leads Ryan Moore by seven to four. He\u2019s kissed the camera, the owner of Advertise and the trainer. Long may he stay riding. 1 Advertise (L Dettori) 8-1 2 Forever In Dreams (Oisin Murphy) 20-1 3 Hello Youmzain (Kevin Stott) 6-1 9 ran And they\u2019re off ... Royal Intervention is out fast with Ten Sovereigns in fourth early ... Forever In Dreams is prominent ... Ten Sovereigns is under pressure ... Advertise has the lead ... and it\u2019s Frankie again ... Advertise wins! Frankie Dettori has been talking about his runners tomorrow if you want to get primed for the action on the final day. This is what he said on his latest Ladbrokes blog. \u201cRose Of Kildare is a little bit of an outsider in the Chesham Stakes (2.30), but I don\u2019t know much about her to be honest. In the Jersey Stakes (3.05) I ride Maries Diamond but again he is an outsider. There are better horses in the race. I think Lah Ti Dar could run a big race in the Hardwicke Stakes (3.40). She will like the track and was second in the Fillies &amp; Mares Stakes. In the Diamond Jubilee Stakes (4.20), I ride Emblazoned. It will be a big ask but I hope we can get him placed. In the Wokingham (5pm), I am on one of the favourites in Danzeno. He likes Ascot. I was third in the QIPCO Sprint so he is a good horse on his day. My final ride of the meeting is on Corelli in the Queen Alexandra Stakes (5.35). It is two miles and five furlongs and he has never run that far so who knows. Hopefully if I get one winner, it will be an amazing day.\u201d Ten Sovereigns \u2013 5/4 Jash \u2013 5/1 Advertise \u2013 7/1 Khadeem \u2013 15/2 Hello Youmzain \u2013 8/1 Rumble Inthejungle \u2013 25/1 Forever in Dreams \u2013 33/1 Koncheck \u2013 66/1 Royal Intervention \u2013 66/1 Full Oddschecker betting here Ten Sovereigns\u2019s Middle Park win is the best bit of form and he can be forgiven his non-staying effort in the Guineas. But he was evidently primed to the minute, judging by the support that came for him, and it\u2019ll be interesting to see how much he has left to offer here. Odds of 11-8 are very short about a horse that hasn\u2019t won since September. Jash has a big chance but the overpriced one could be Advertise, who failed to run his race in the Guineas when his stable was out of sorts. A close second to Calyx here last year, he has some excellent six-furlong form and the blinkers could make a difference. Hello Youmzain profited when Calyx failed to give his running at Haydock recently. The winner of two Group Twos, he faces much stiffer opposition here. Japan looked a class act there and has obviously come to himself after a poor run in the Dante and a much more promising one in the Derby. Immediately after some were suggesting the St Leger but Ryan Moore suggests he\u2019s better than that. The King George at Ascot in late July looks tailor-made for the Aidan O\u2019Brien runner. 1 Japan (R L Moore) 6-4 Fav 2 Bangkok (S De Sousa) 10-1 3 Eagles By Day (D Tudhope) 25-1 8 ran And they\u2019re off ...

Japan makes a move but is very wide ... Bangkok makes a good move ... Japan comes down the wide outside and looks a class apart, winning with ease under Ryan Moore, now on four winners for the week. Japan, favourite for the King Edward VII Stakes, is the best-backed horse of the week, one rails bookmaker reporting on wager of \u00a3200,000 at 5-4.

In just a few more strides, Japan would have won the Derby, so strong was he finishing up the middle of the track. After a troubled preparation and a disappointing effort in his prep run, that was a terrific effort. Aidan O\u2019Brien was under no pressure to bring him here with the Irish Derby on the horizon, so he is presumably confident the horse is ready to go again and Japan looks the standout talent on show. One concern is that O\u2019Brien has only won this race once and that was 15 years ago, which seems surprising in view of how often he would have suitable horses. Bangkok boiled over before the Derby and reportedly failed to handle the track. His temperament will again be tested here but, if calmer, he undoubtedly has enough talent to win, so he is overpriced at 16-1. It\u2019s worrying that the market has allowed him to double in price. Private Secretary was briefly considered for the Derby but was felt not to be ready for the Classic. This is a serious test of John Gosden\u2019s son of Kingman, unbeaten in three this year at a lower level. He doesn\u2019t do anything quickly. Pondus takes a huge step up in class from the Sandown novice race he won easily last time. The best of his siblings won a handicap while rated 88. 1 Daahyeh (David Egan) 4-1 Fav 2 Celtic Beauty (W J Lee) 25-1 3 Aroha (Harry Bentley) 100-1 25 ran Also: 50-1 Alabama Whitman 4th Non Runner: 21 And they\u2019re off ...

Frankie Dettori has been reflecting on the four-timer he achieved at Royal Ascot yesterday, including Stradivarius in the Gold Cup. Interviewed on Sky Sports Racing, he compared it to his Magnificent Seven, achieved 23 years ago at Ascot, but at the September meeting. Dettori said: \u201cI could feel the people getting behind me and everybody wanted Stradivarius to win \u2013 it was magical. I can\u2019t lie, I was nervous before the race, but the Gold Cup went to plan. I had a good spot and looking at the replay I know why people were worried, but I thought I was fine as I knew everything that was going on! When I crossed the line, everyone went mad \u2013 it was great. I haven\u2019t experienced anything like it at Royal Ascot. We got over 66,000 people here yesterday and a lot of them won\u2019t know much about racing, but they got to experience something really special. To see a gutsy performance from Stradivarius is good for the sport and I was so pleased to be a part of it. \u201cStradivarius has become the people\u2019s favourite. His style of racing and the way he conducts himself is marvellous. He has a tremendous will to win and it is so obvious for people to see. It is a privilege for me to ride him obviously, for people in the grandstand and people at home, it is magical to see a horse like that \u2013 Stradivarius is a wonderful horse. Stradivarius is so tiny and they dwarf him! His heart is bigger than his body. The Magnificent Seven was special, but it was such a long time ago I forgot about it! Yesterday was so special and I could feel everything. After the Magnificent Seven, this is my second biggest day \u2013 I cannot put it into words.\u201d Daahyeh \u2013 9/2 Nayibeth \u2013 8/1 Last Surprise - 13/2 Galadriel \u2013 11/1 JM Jackson \u2013 12/1 Precious Moments \u2013 14/1 Silent Wave \u2013 14/1 So Wonderful \u2013 14/1 Lil Grey \u2013 20/1 Exceptional \u2013 25/1 Chili Petin \u2013 25/1 Kemble \u2013 28/1 Exclusively \u2013 33/1 Celtic Beauty \u2013 28/1 Moon of Love \u2013 33/1 Separate \u2013 40/1 Back to Brussels \u2013 50/1 Seraphinite \u2013 100/1 Alabama Whitman \u2013 66/1 Graceful Magic \u2013 125/1 Fleeting Princess \u2013 150/1 Lorelei Rock \u2013 80/1 Dilligent Dab \u2013 125/1 Aroha \u2013 200/1 Get the Look \u2013 250/1 Full betting at Oddschecker here The Guardian sent its wealth correspondent Rupert Neate to the Goffs Sale earlier this week. \u201cWe\u2019re attracting wealthy people from around the world. It\u2019s called the sport of kings for a reason,\u201d said Goff\u2019s chief executive Henry Beeby. The well-related Nayibeth comes from the US with a big reputation but Wesley Ward\u2019s juvenile winners here have been in shorter races and she could struggle to last home with some moisture still in the ground. The suggested alternative is Daahyeh, from the stable that won this five years ago. She impressed on her Newmarket debut, beating Raffle Prize, the Queen Mary winner here on Wednesday. From the same stable that won Thursday\u2019s Norfolk Stakes, Last Surprise was an easy winner over an experienced, well-fancied rival at Lingfield. Jm Jackson is winless but got close to two classy rivals in running second on both starts so far, notably when beaten by the Norfolk Stakes runner-up on her debut. 1st Pink 5-4 The bookies at the track are still betting on the Queen\u2019s hat ... look at those odds!

Dame Annabel Whitehead Major Nana Twumasi-Ankrah I attended a Serpentine gallery exhibition by artist Mark Wallinger back in 1994 when one of his installations, called \u2018Royal Ascot\u2019, consisted of a series of video monitors on top of wheeled flight cases, each isolating the royal carriage\u2019s leisurely progress down the track on the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (respectively, as it was then) of the meeting with the added TV commentary. The British Council described the work thus: \u2018Simultaneous footage exposes precise choreography: the Queen\u2019s frozen smile and rigid curls, the tilt of her head, her gloved wave, the Duke of Edinburgh raising his top hat, the national anthem striking up. Appropriately for an event whose media coverage focuses on the parade of hats and dresses rather than the sport, here we have a close-up on clothes, on the Queen\u2019s dolly mixture of pinks, tangerines, limes; the difference from day to day is barely discernible, just as the four BBC commentaries merge in a confused blather. This repetition of imagery, all backed by bright green turf, brings into play Andy Warhol\u2019s late screenprints of Elizabeth II from his \u2018Reigning Queens\u2019 series (1985), a quartet of the postage stamp icon in camp conjugations of Hollywood make-up and bubblegum colours.\u2019 The Duke of Edinburgh, who has retired from royal duties and apparently hated his trips down the road from Windsor Castle to the races, is missing but little else has changed including the blather. This is last year\u2019s Royal Procession on the Friday \u2013 see if you can spot the difference. Frankie Dettori joked that Ascot \u201cmight need to get another statue\u201d after winning the first four races yesterday. It might be a blessing as the one near the entrance to Ascot\u2019s Royal enclosure to mark his astonishing day in 1996 is not regarded as the finest example in a crowded field of bad statues of sportsmen. The day the statue was unveiled I remember standing next to Racing Post scribe Alastair Down, who opined: \u201cIt looks as if Frankie\u2019s had a dose of senna pods!\u201d Yesterday was one of the best day\u2019s racing in recent memory and Frankie Dettori\u2019s exploits certainly helped put bums on sofas. ITV Racing spokesman Liz Ampairee reported this morning: \u201cFollowing on from very strong viewing figures in the first two days of Royal Ascot 2019, Frankie Dettori\u2019s \u2018fabulous four\u2019 ensured that Day Three produced the highest peak viewing figures for any day at Royal Ascot for seven years, with 1.4 million people watching ITV Racing.\u201d It could be argued that Frankie Dettori\u2019s best ride yesterday was on a horse he lost on, doing brilliantly to get Turgenev (a horse who should have gone off a 14-1 shot but which started the 7-2 favourite) so close to winning the Britannia Stakes. The Italian dominated the race from the start on his mount and and almost pulled off what would have been an historic fifth straight win on the day. If that had come off everyone would then have been willing the jockey to ride all six winners but it became clear early in the final race that his mount, Questionare, had not read the script and was not fully co-operating with his rider. Questionare ran so poorly that the stewards asked questions and it would seem that the horse faces a fate far worse than that of Frankie! For the first time this week I wasn\u2019t sent any odds in advance for the colour of the Queen\u2019s hat today and it\u2019s now clear the best-known novelty betting market at Royal Ascot is in peril. Ladbrokes have suspended betting indefinitely with spokesperson Nicola McGeady stating this morning: \u201cWe are no longer betting on the colour of the Queen\u2019s hat this week. After the gamble was landed yesterday it\u2019s obvious someone knew something we don\u2019t so betting has been suspended for now.\u201d Rupert Adams of William Hill told me that his firm had been offering 1-2 Blue and 5-4 Pink with all layers now seemingly running scared of getting involved. A spokesperson from Bookmakers.tv said: \u201cAny profits made from the worst set of hat results for punters in recent memory were quickly eviscerated by Frankie Dettori on Ladies\u2019 day and the major firms have taken an even more cautious approach, with nearly every major bookmaker\u2019s odds suspended by 9am this morning, but following yesterday\u2019s antics, it\u2019s easy to forgive traders for having less time to price up the Friday hat market. \u201cSome overnight prices incredibly suggest another blue number is favourite, which would be a huge deviation from the form book. Pink, which looks a certainty to make an appearance at every meeting is next and should prove a popular pick on course with better weather forecast. \u201cRacegoers who want to participate in the Ascot tradition are urged to place bets with an off-course bookmaker before arriving, thanks to some of the colossal overrounds on display in the betting ring, although based on the lack of price sensitivity shown by trackside hat punters and the thin competition, the bookies are within their rights to try and recoup some of the Frankie losses any way they can.\u201d Frankie Dettori 6 wins Ryan Moore 3 Danny Tudhope 3 Jim Crowley 1 Oisin Murphy 1 James Doyle 1 Richard Kingscote 1 Harry Bentley 1 Seamie Heffernan 1 This is Frankie\u2019s place and he proved it with his four-timer yesterday, which looked for all the world like a five-timer in the making for a few seconds. Moore\u2019s week started so well but has had plenty of difficult moments in the last two days. Bookmakers closed the book on top jockey after Tuesday but reopened it last night with Dettori at 8-15 and Moore 11-8. Silvestre De Sousa can\u2019t have been enjoying it, with three second places the best he has to show for some fancied rides. Tudhope, who was in Yorkshire yesterday, is back for a single ride today, on the unfancied Eagles By Day in the 3.05. Here\u2019s an excellent piece by colleague Ben Fisher on Jay Tabb, the former Coventry and Reading player who is training to work in racing and has a ride at the Cheltenham Festival in his sights. He starts work at Philip Hobbs\u2019 yard later thins month. 2.30pm Albany Stakes 21 PAPER STAR (Self Certificate, Not Eaten Up) 4.20pm Coronation Stakes 7 MOT JUSTE (Going) 5.00pm Sandringham Handicap 23 GALLIC (Going) 5.35pm Duke of Edinburgh Handicap 4 SEA THE LION (Vet\u2019s Certificate, Bruised Foot) The official going for the fourth day of Royal Ascot remains: Straight Course: Good to Soft Round Course: Good to Soft, Soft in places GoingStick readings at 8.15am today: Stand side: 7.4, Centre: 7.6, Far Side: 7.4.

It has been dry since racing on Wednesday when there was 10 millimetres of rain. The forecast is for generally dry conditions with the risk of occasional showers. Temperatures for the remainder of the week are predicted to be between 19 and 22 degrees Celsius. Looking ahead to racing this afternoon and through to Saturday, Ascot\u2019s clerk of the Course Chris Stickels is expecting the weather to remain dry, the going to quicken up with the possibility of a going change later today. He said at 8.30am today: \u201cWe have a dry sunny day forecast so I expect a change in the going later to reflect that. A great forecast for tomorrow as well. A dry sunny day so we should see the ground quicken up a little bit.\u201d Aidan O\u2019Brien 4 wins John Gosden 2 William Haggas 2 Sir Michael Stoute 2 Andrew Balding 1 Mark Johnston 1 Charlie Hills 1 Ian Williams 1 Charlie Appleby 1 David O\u2019Meara 1 Simon Crisford 1 Ralph Beckett 1 After his win with Sangarius yesterday, Stoute was presented with an adapted number cloth with \u201880\u2019 on it, to mark his 80th success at Royal Ascot. In fact, his 80th winner had been Crystal Ocean the day before and he was now on 81, but we don\u2019t quibble over details. O\u2019Brien is now one away from his 70th success here and one imagines he will be bearing down on Stoute\u2019s mark soon enough. Gosden got off the mark for the week in fine style with his Thursday double and the big beasts of Newmarket are faring very well once more. Roger Varian is one of the bigger names missing from that list and I hope he can rectify the matter in today\u2019s first race. Richard Hannon is 0/12 and will be rueing his near miss in the Coventry with Threat. You want to know what\u2019s going to win, right? Here are our selections for the fourth day.

If we get a tie after all the races have been run, the winner will be the one who posted their tips earliest out of those with the highest score. Thanks for playing our competition this week! This is our final day running the Ascot competition. We\u2019ll return with more competitions for the Cheltenham Festival in March. The heartiest congratulations seem scant reward for JimmyDeuce, who put up one of the best tipping performances I\u2019ve ever seen yesterday. Somehow he found Biometric (28-1), South Pacific (22-1), Sangarius (13-2) and Star Catcher (4-1) for a score of +58.50, more than twice what anyone else could do. Very well done, sir, and I hope you\u2019re a lot richer. Please post your tips or racing-related comments below. What do Michael Kinane, Jamie Spencer, Jimmy Fortune and Johnny Murtagh have in common? They have all won the award for the top jockey at Royal Ascot since Frankie Dettori picked up the last of his five riding titles at this meeting way back in 2004. After the day that Dettori had here on Thursday, it seems difficult to believe. In the first four races, there was not a stride out of place as the most famous name in the game racked up a 449-1 four-timer. He is also, and by an increased margin thanks to his exploits this week, the most successful current rider at the meeting, leading Ryan Moore by 66 winners to 56. Spencer, who is next on the list of current riders, has 23. But as well as his considerable talent, this is also a testament to Dettori\u2019s durability. His first winner at Royal Ascot came in 1990. Moore\u2019s arrived 18 years later. Dettori has been consistently top-class at Ascot for nearly three decades, while only rarely enjoying the kind of week that puts a rider at the top of the pile. Even now, after an afternoon that few who were there to absorb the crackling atmosphere will ever forget, Dettori is not assured of his first jockeys\u2019 title at the Royal meeting for 15 years. His total of six winners for the week gives him a healthy lead over Ryan Moore, who has three, but the bookies rate him only a 4-7 chance, with Moore on 11-8, when you might expect Dettori to be long odds-on. Today\u2019s card at Ascot could make all the difference. Dettori has rides in five of the six races, while Moore has a full book of six. In terms of quality, though, Moore is, on paper, streets ahead. Three of his rides are certain to start favourite, probably at 6-4 or shorter, while the best of Dettori\u2019s partners appears to be Private Secretary, the 4-1 second favourite behind Moore\u2019s ride Japan, in the King Edward VII Stakes, the second race on the card. A win for Dettori there would be a huge setback for Moore, who is ahead on a \u201ccountback\u201d of placed efforts and so needs only to draw level with his rival to win. Elsewhere on the card, it may take a little more of the Dettori magic that was so evident yesterday if Advertise (who faces the Moore-ridden favourite Ten Sovereigns in the Commonwealth Cup) or Twist \u2018N\u2019 Shake, around 12-1 to beat the dual Guineas winner Hermosa in the Coronation Stakes, is to extend his lead. One more winner, incidentally, would equal Dettori\u2019s personal record at the meeting, when he rode seven winners in 1998. Weather-wise, the prospects look excellent for Ascot today, with highs in the low 20s and no rain at all in the forecast. It has been dry at the track since Wednesday evening, but Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, reported this morning that the going is still good-to-soft on the straight course and good-to-soft, soft in places on the round course. Stickels does expect that to change as the day goes on, however. \u201cWe have a sunny day forecast, so I do expect a change in the going later to reflect that. A great forecast for tomorrow too. A dry, sunny day, so we should see the ground quicken up a little bit.\u201d Chris Cook\u2019s tips for the fourth day, including a 16-1 chance in the Coronation Stakes, are here, and all the news and more will be live here as the day unfolds.",

This is more than somewhat misleading. The Queen appoints as PM the person thought to be able to command a majority in the House of Commons. As your leader went some way to admitting towards the end, it is by no means clear that any of the candidates could achieve that majority. There is a hung parliament, the present government is in power only by courtesy of the DUP, whose views do not seem to have been advertised, and some Tory MPs have said they could not support a government led by the likely winner of the current party election.<br><strong>Robin M White</strong><br><em>Dundee</em></p> <p>\u2022 The poll that showed the madness of more than half the Conservative party membership willing to sacrifice the union, economic growth and even their own party, in order the achieve Brexit seems unbelievable (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/19/margaret-thatcher-brexit-tory-folly-40-years-conservatives\" title=\"\">Martin Kettle</a>, Journal, 20 June). But even more significant was the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/06/11/boris-johnson-course-140-seat-majority-general-election-becomes/amp/?__twitter_impression=true\" title=\"\">earlier poll</a> that showed Johnson as the only Tory who would win an absolute majority (of 140 seats!) in a general election. That seems to me the reason why Johnson won such a majority of MPs\u2019 votes and will be backed by the grassroots, even though many in both groups distrust him. So it would be in Johnson\u2019s interests to call an election as soon as he becomes prime minister, and before the 31 October deadline. He could then face the disaster of a no-deal Brexit with equanimity.<br><strong>Ralph Blumenau</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 We are told of skulduggery by the Johnson team (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/20/jeremy-hunt-and-boris-johnson-are-final-two-in-tory-leadership-race\" title=\"\">It\u2019s Johnson versus Hunt.

As your leader went some way to admitting towards the end, it is by no means clear that any of the candidates could achieve that majority. There is a hung parliament, the present government is in power only by courtesy of the DUP, whose views do not seem to have been advertised, and some Tory MPs have said they could not support a government led by the likely winner of the current party election. Robin M White Dundee \u2022 The poll that showed the madness of more than half the Conservative party membership willing to sacrifice the union, economic growth and even their own party, in order the achieve Brexit seems unbelievable (Martin Kettle, Journal, 20 June). But even more significant was the earlier poll that showed Johnson as the only Tory who would win an absolute majority (of 140 seats!) in a general election. That seems to me the reason why Johnson won such a majority of MPs\u2019 votes and will be backed by the grassroots, even though many in both groups distrust him. So it would be in Johnson\u2019s interests to call an election as soon as he becomes prime minister, and before the 31 October deadline. He could then face the disaster of a no-deal Brexit with equanimity. Ralph Blumenau London \u2022 We are told of skulduggery by the Johnson team (It\u2019s Johnson versus Hunt. But was the result fixed?, 21 June). As Hunt scraped in by only two votes, either the skulduggery was undertaken with remarkable finesse, or with utter incompetence, the required result courtesy of luck.

      "body": "<p>All we need now is for Boris Johnson to praise Mark Field, the government-minister-cum-self-appointed-close-protection-officer who thought the best way to deal with a peaceful distributor of leaflets was to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulBrandITV/status/1141819192020295680\" title=\"\">ram</a> her into a pillar and grab her by the neck. If Johnson lauds Field as \u201cmy kind of guy\u201d, then the already long list of similarities between Britain\u2019s near-certain next prime minister and Donald Trump will get longer still. Compiling that list might once have been an amusing parlour game for politics nerds; now it is essential preparation for what is to come.</p> <p>For Trump, you will recall, did not share the public shock at one of his party\u2019s lawmakers using physical violence against a citizen exercising a basic democratic right. In the US case, the offender was Republican congressman <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3t4NBUb57s\" title=\"\">Greg Gianforte</a>, who bodyslammed a reporter \u2013 a Guardian reporter, as it happens \u2013 whose desire to ask a question irritated him. Trump offered no condemnation. Instead, the president <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/fce5e4b518684ce1bec91c744974c2d4\" title=\"\">said</a>: \u201cAny guy that can do a bodyslam, he\u2019s my kind of guy.\u201d</p> <p>Still, we need not wait for Johnson to hymn Field\u2019s prowess in manhandling the unarmed to spot multiple parallels between America\u2019s current leader and Britain\u2019s likely next one. The signature nest of blond hair; the political career forged by unexpected success on a TV show; the knack for grabbing attention by ensuring every public moment carries a frisson of danger, generated by the possibility that the rules are about to be broken, often through a remark that is crude or hurtful or both. Both men are skilled at making their appearances seem daringly, and therefore compellingly, unscripted \u2013 \u201cseem\u201d being the operative word in Johnson\u2019s case. Note Jeremy Vine\u2019s riveting <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/1691455784407633/posts/2449074521979085/\" title=\"\">account</a> of watching the former London mayor deliver an apparently impromptu, even chaotically ad-libbed after-dinner speech \u2013 only to see him repeat the exact same performance, word for word, stumble for stumble, several years later.</p> <p>More substantive similarities have been well documented. Both men have the same elastic approach to the truth that they had to their wedding vows. Trump\u2019s lies are so legion, CNN has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/1136257506228035584\" title=\"\">appointed</a> a correspondent whose chief task is to tally them.

      "bodyText": "All we need now is for Boris Johnson to praise Mark Field, the government-minister-cum-self-appointed-close-protection-officer who thought the best way to deal with a peaceful distributor of leaflets was to ram her into a pillar and grab her by the neck. If Johnson lauds Field as \u201cmy kind of guy\u201d, then the already long list of similarities between Britain\u2019s near-certain next prime minister and Donald Trump will get longer still. Compiling that list might once have been an amusing parlour game for politics nerds; now it is essential preparation for what is to come. For Trump, you will recall, did not share the public shock at one of his party\u2019s lawmakers using physical violence against a citizen exercising a basic democratic right. In the US case, the offender was Republican congressman Greg Gianforte, who bodyslammed a reporter \u2013 a Guardian reporter, as it happens \u2013 whose desire to ask a question irritated him. Trump offered no condemnation. Instead, the president said: \u201cAny guy that can do a bodyslam, he\u2019s my kind of guy.\u201d Still, we need not wait for Johnson to hymn Field\u2019s prowess in manhandling the unarmed to spot multiple parallels between America\u2019s current leader and Britain\u2019s likely next one. The signature nest of blond hair; the political career forged by unexpected success on a TV show; the knack for grabbing attention by ensuring every public moment carries a frisson of danger, generated by the possibility that the rules are about to be broken, often through a remark that is crude or hurtful or both. Both men are skilled at making their appearances seem daringly, and therefore compellingly, unscripted \u2013 \u201cseem\u201d being the operative word in Johnson\u2019s case. Note Jeremy Vine\u2019s riveting account of watching the former London mayor deliver an apparently impromptu, even chaotically ad-libbed after-dinner speech \u2013 only to see him repeat the exact same performance, word for word, stumble for stumble, several years later. More substantive similarities have been well documented. Both men have the same elastic approach to the truth that they had to their wedding vows. Trump\u2019s lies are so legion, CNN has appointed a correspondent whose chief task is to tally them. Johnson\u2019s form in this area is scarcely less impressive. The \u00a3350m on the side of the bus gets most of the attention, but let\u2019s not forget the false claim that Turkey was on course to accede to the EU, a claim repeated by Johnson himself in a televised debate \u2013 only for him to deny earlier this year that he had so much as mentioned Turkey during the 2016 referendum campaign. In other words, he lied and then lied about his lie. On Thursday, Johnson\u2019s editor for a decade, Max Hastings, said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019s capable of caring for any human being other than himself,\u201d words that have been said often of Trump, a man who seems devoid of basic human empathy. That was one reason why many Republicans vowed to stop him ever gaining power: \u201cNever Trump\u201d was their slogan.

For every couple whose love for each other is perfectly in tune, there is a partner who has woefully misjudged their lover\u2019s desire for public attention, grand romantic gestures, or simply marriage full stop. So Gabriel Grossman might have been taking a huge risk when he and his girlfriend, the Instagram influencer Marissa Casey Fuchs, embarked on not just a public proposal, but a 48-hour-long surprise holiday scavenger hunt, exhaustively documented by the couple on their respective Instagram accounts. What if she\u2019d said no? Or decided that this precious moment was too personal to be shared with her audience of 193,000 people? But perhaps Grossman didn\u2019t need to worry. Not just because Fuchs has been sharing nearly every detail of her life for years and shows no sign of stopping \u2013 but also because it may not have been as much of a surprise as her audience were led to believe.

      "bodyText": "Problems that denied EU citizens their vote in last month\u2019s European elections were evident five years ago, according to a leaked letter from the European commission. Many EU nationals were unable to vote in the European elections on 23 May, through a series of bureaucratic muddles and mistakes that experts decried as a fiasco that a democracy should not tolerate. A letter sent on Friday to the constitution minister, Chloe Smith, shows that some of the chaos at polling stations was foreshadowed in previous European elections in 2014. \u201cThe commission notes that the difficulties encountered were largely recurrences of the incidents and deficiencies that had previously arisen during the 2014 elections and which the United Kingdom had undertaken to remedy in time,\u201d states a copy of the letter seen by the Guardian. The government told the commission in January 2015 that it would remedy the problems identified in 2014, either through legislation or practicalities before the 2019 vote. The letter, from the EU justice commissioner, V\u0115ra Jourov\u00e1, acknowledged that British authorities faced \u201cpractical challenges\u201d because of the last-minute Brexit delay, but concluded this should not have affected \u201cthe obligation of the United Kingdom to respect the right to vote of EU citizens\u201d. Theresa May said she did not want the UK to participate in European elections, even after agreeing a six-month Brexit extension with the EU on 11 April. The prime minister still thought it possible to get her deal through parliament and avoid the EU-wide vote. She also said the government was making \u201cresponsible preparations\u201d to hold the elections. The commission identified four main bureaucratic problems encountered by EU nationals in the UK: councils failed to inform EU citizens about the two-step registration process; councils did not send out forms on time to people who requested them; or forms were not registered despite being sent. Finally, the letter states, staff at polling stations \u201cfailed in many cases to adequately respond to EU citizens\u2019 complaints\u201d after they were unable to vote, despite taking all the necessary steps. The government has been asked to send the commission data about complaints. EU authorities also want to know how the government attempted to tackle the problems first identified in 2014. The UK has been given 10 weeks to draw up a response \u2013 a late September deadline that falls just one month before Brexit day on 31 October. Usually, persistent rule-breaking governments are taken to the European court of justice. The looming Brexit deadline makes any legal action politically charged for the commission. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK government took all the legal steps necessary to prepare for the European parliament elections, including putting in place all the necessary legislative and funding elements to enable returning officers to make their preparations required for the polls on 23 May. \u201cWe worked with returning officers, the Electoral Commission and other agencies such as the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives (Solace) and the Association of Electoral Administrators (AEA) to support the smooth running of the polls.\u201d",

He is very likely to win, and this way you get almost two hours with the next prime minister telling him what you think and grilling him on what he thinks.

Perhaps we were not prepared to woo him and his talents in the same way,\u201d the minister said. MPs who spoke to the Guardian about Williamson\u2019s operation to support Johnson said it was not all threats: often he could charm them and offer tidbits of valuable gossip. If he had heard that an MP was backing a rival candidate, he would pursue them and suggest that perhaps it was not worth risking their careers to back a loser. MPs said they were repeatedly warned about the perils of double-dealing. When MPs went into the first round of voting, they were asked to leave their phones to one side because rumours had reached the returning officers that Williamson had been demanding MPs photograph their ballot papers. Johnson\u2019s team denied anyone had been asked to do so. Johnson\u2019s wooing of MPs dates back far longer than Williamson\u2019s involvement. \u201cWe were always told that Boris\u2019s problem was he\u2019ll never win back his colleagues,\u201d one senior member of Johnson\u2019s team said. \u201cSo now you know why he has focused entirely on doing that.\u201d For many months, MPs have been approached and invited to make an appointment to see the former foreign secretary to discuss anything of their choosing. Often, MPs have not needed Williamson\u2019s persuasion tactics. \u201cFor certain people in the party, being approached by Gavin just wouldn\u2019t be the tactic that worked,\u201d one MP said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually not a difficult job to get people in to see Boris. He is very likely to win, and this way you get almost two hours with the next prime minister telling him what you think and grilling him on what he thinks. That is worth doing even if you are not going to vote for him.\u201d If Johnson enters No 10, it will be a tricky to find the right job for Williamson. He has a deep personal grudge against the current cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, who is believed to have made it clear Williamson had to be sacked for the NSC breach. Multiple MPs told the Guardian that Williamson had said he was determined to go back to the Ministry of Defence.",

Launched in 2006, the scheme keeps numbers low to ensure tailored, individual support \u2013 72 people have been through it so far. \u201cI\u2019m being developed at my own pace \u2013 if I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m ready for something yet, then that\u2019s OK,\u201d she says. \u201cThe training has also been very specific to me \u2013 I struggle sometimes with emotional resilience, and was helped with that as well as building my confidence.\u201d Advice from senior practitioners is never far away: \u201cThe social workers are very experienced,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve found that really helpful, learning from them, feeling inspired \u2013 it really is learning from the best of the best.\u201d</p> <p>So what does Cafcass, rated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cafcass-professional-careers/2019/apr/03/we-all-want-the-safest-outcomes-for-children-inside-cafcasss-national-improvement-service\">outstanding</a> by Ofsted inspectors, look for in its NQSWs? \u201cYou must have a strong academic base, and we\u2019re looking for more than a degree,\u201d says Tammy Conn, head of practice (Staffordshire, Cheshire, Merseyside, Manchester and central intake team). \u201cWe want people who can work under pressure, who bring something extra with them. They must be able to reflect on their practice and have a continuing commitment to professional development.\u201d Career changers may also have an advantage, as they bring life experiences with them \u2013 invaluable in the high-pressured environment of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cafcass-professional-careers/2019/mar/08/we-advise-on-whats-best-for-the-child-protecting-childrens-interests-in-court\">family court</a>, she says.</p> <p>Launching your career as a children and family social worker with Cafcass opens up unique opportunities. Social workers work across both public and private law \u2013 an option denied to those who choose the more traditional route and work for a local authority. All Cafcass social workers are employed as family court advisers (FCAs) and, whether they are involved in public or private law, their role is always the same \u2013 they are in court to represent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cafcass-professional-careers/2019/jun/14/the-voice-of-the-child-is-at-the-heart-of-everything-how-cafcass-is-improving-care-with-partnerships\">the voice of the child</a>. Clode, who now has a mixed caseload, spent most of her first six months in private law, and has just started taking on public law cases that deal with local authority care. \u201cWhen I was a student, I thought private law was just about what happens when families split up and where the child lives,\u201d she says. \u201cWe do have cases involving access, and also others where the child wants to keep their second name, or relocation issues where a parent wants to move to another country with a child. We also get involved in cases of surrogacy.\u201d</p> <p>All NQSWs have a protected caseload. They have access to a physical and virtual library \u2013 requested books are delivered to their desk within 24 hours, journals and other research material within the hour. Clode says she was logged into her work laptop within 90 minutes on her first day \u2013 but she knows of graduates employed by local authorities having to wait a month before they were set up. \u201cIt just reduced anxiety \u2013 it meant I could get to work straight away,\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cafcass-professional-careers/2019/jun/14/making-a-difference-gets-you-up-in-the-morning-behind-the-scenes-at-cafcass\">'Making a difference gets you up in the morning': behind the scenes at Cafcass</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a support network of NQSWs, which, according to Clode, has been invaluable: \u201cIt\u2019s like group supervision,\u201d she says. And all NQSWs have higher-level supervision than other FCAs. \u201cBecause our NQSW numbers are small, they can be embedded in a team with a smaller caseload and they are supported and protected on the assessed and supported year in employment (ASYE) that all social workers do. That\u2019s why it\u2019s such a great opportunity for them here,\u201d says Conn. \u201cThey usually realise quite quickly just how lucky they are because they get a really good grounding working for us.\u201d</p> <p>NQSWs start on \u00a328,728 \u2013 rising to \u00a333,147 after 18 months \u2013 and spend most of their first year working in private law, as they gradually build up a mixed caseload. The second year can include placement with a local authority children\u2019s service to acquire a different professional perspective, before returning to Cafcass in the final year.</p> <p>As a national organisation, career opportunities are second to none. There is a clear pathway from practice supervisor right to the top assistant director roles. And its emerging talent programme is an alternative for those more interested in following a research and development route. Also, as the NQSW programme is academically accredited, completing it results in a postgraduate certificate in professional practice and can lead to opportunities to go on and study for a master\u2019s degree. Flexible working and working from home is routinely supported, while other benefits include access to qualified personal trainers and nutritionists, all of which is part of a unique employee wellbeing offer.</p> <p>But for Clode, the biggest draw of Cafcass is being the voice of the child. \u201cThe family court can often be parent and adult led. To be able to put a halt to that and say: \u2018This is about the child\u2019 \u2013 there is nothing better than that.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Since joining the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (Cafcass) as a newly qualified social worker (NQSW) eight months ago, Scarlett Clode hasn\u2019t looked back. \u201cI\u2019ve probably learned more since I\u2019ve been here than I did at university,\u201d says the 23-year-old from Devon. \u201cThe training has been fantastic.\u201d Clode is one of a small cohort who have joined Cafcass\u2019s unique programme for NQSWs. Launched in 2006, the scheme keeps numbers low to ensure tailored, individual support \u2013 72 people have been through it so far. \u201cI\u2019m being developed at my own pace \u2013 if I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m ready for something yet, then that\u2019s OK,\u201d she says. \u201cThe training has also been very specific to me \u2013 I struggle sometimes with emotional resilience, and was helped with that as well as building my confidence.\u201d Advice from senior practitioners is never far away: \u201cThe social workers are very experienced,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve found that really helpful, learning from them, feeling inspired \u2013 it really is learning from the best of the best.\u201d So what does Cafcass, rated outstanding by Ofsted inspectors, look for in its NQSWs? \u201cYou must have a strong academic base, and we\u2019re looking for more than a degree,\u201d says Tammy Conn, head of practice (Staffordshire, Cheshire, Merseyside, Manchester and central intake team). \u201cWe want people who can work under pressure, who bring something extra with them. They must be able to reflect on their practice and have a continuing commitment to professional development.\u201d Career changers may also have an advantage, as they bring life experiences with them \u2013 invaluable in the high-pressured environment of the family court, she says. Launching your career as a children and family social worker with Cafcass opens up unique opportunities. Social workers work across both public and private law \u2013 an option denied to those who choose the more traditional route and work for a local authority. All Cafcass social workers are employed as family court advisers (FCAs) and, whether they are involved in public or private law, their role is always the same \u2013 they are in court to represent the voice of the child. Clode, who now has a mixed caseload, spent most of her first six months in private law, and has just started taking on public law cases that deal with local authority care. \u201cWhen I was a student, I thought private law was just about what happens when families split up and where the child lives,\u201d she says. \u201cWe do have cases involving access, and also others where the child wants to keep their second name, or relocation issues where a parent wants to move to another country with a child. We also get involved in cases of surrogacy.\u201d All NQSWs have a protected caseload. They have access to a physical and virtual library \u2013 requested books are delivered to their desk within 24 hours, journals and other research material within the hour. Clode says she was logged into her work laptop within 90 minutes on her first day \u2013 but she knows of graduates employed by local authorities having to wait a month before they were set up. \u201cIt just reduced anxiety \u2013 it meant I could get to work straight away,\u201d she says. There is a support network of NQSWs, which, according to Clode, has been invaluable: \u201cIt\u2019s like group supervision,\u201d she says. And all NQSWs have higher-level supervision than other FCAs. \u201cBecause our NQSW numbers are small, they can be embedded in a team with a smaller caseload and they are supported and protected on the assessed and supported year in employment (ASYE) that all social workers do. That\u2019s why it\u2019s such a great opportunity for them here,\u201d says Conn. \u201cThey usually realise quite quickly just how lucky they are because they get a really good grounding working for us.\u201d NQSWs start on \u00a328,728 \u2013 rising to \u00a333,147 after 18 months \u2013 and spend most of their first year working in private law, as they gradually build up a mixed caseload. The second year can include placement with a local authority children\u2019s service to acquire a different professional perspective, before returning to Cafcass in the final year. As a national organisation, career opportunities are second to none. There is a clear pathway from practice supervisor right to the top assistant director roles. And its emerging talent programme is an alternative for those more interested in following a research and development route. Also, as the NQSW programme is academically accredited, completing it results in a postgraduate certificate in professional practice and can lead to opportunities to go on and study for a master\u2019s degree. Flexible working and working from home is routinely supported, while other benefits include access to qualified personal trainers and nutritionists, all of which is part of a unique employee wellbeing offer. But for Clode, the biggest draw of Cafcass is being the voice of the child. \u201cThe family court can often be parent and adult led. To be able to put a halt to that and say: \u2018This is about the child\u2019 \u2013 there is nothing better than that.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A former Conservative MP who was accused of child sexual abuse and murder by an alleged fantasist has told a court he felt the \u00a32m Scotland Yard inquiry was a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d and a charade. Harvey Proctor, 72, accused the Metropolitan police of effectively leaking his name to the media in a \u201cquite outrageous\u201d breach after searching his home in March 2015. The former politician gave evidence for a second day on Friday in the trial of Carl Beech, previously known by the alias \u201cNick\u201d, who is charged with making up allegations about a supposed VIP paedophile ring. The trial at Newcastle crown court has heard that Beech accused Proctor of being involved in the sexual abuse and murder of three boys in the late 1970s and early 80s, claims Proctor has described in his evidence as the \u201cravings of a fantasist\u201d. Proctor told jurors on Friday that he had \u201cevery right to be indignant\u201d about the investigation and how his name became public the day after his home at Belvoir Castle, near Grantham in Leicestershire, was raided on 4 March 2015. He told the court he believed that a police officer confirmed news of the house search to Beech while it was taking place, leading to it being leaked to the Exaro news agency. Proctor said police had assured him that he would not be identified, but hours later his office received a call and an email from a journalist from Exaro seeking to confirm the police search. \u201cI think he [the journalist] in part knew about that because Nick had been told by DC Chatfield on the day of the search. Where was DC Chatfield on the day of the search? He was in my house,\u201d Proctor said. \u201cThe police had told [Beech] on the day of the search from within my home because DC Chatfield was the family liaison officer for Nick. Quite outrageous.\u201d Beech, 51, is accused of falsely claiming he was among the victims of an alleged group of establishment figures including senior politicians and military and intelligence officers who raped, kidnapped and murdered boys in the late 1970s and early 80s. Proctor told jurors he had to wait three and a half months to be interviewed by police about the allegations of child rape and murder, despite repeatedly pressing them to question him at the earliest opportunity. \u201cThese allegations were so absurd and if they genuinely thought I had murdered anyone, why would they have waited three and half months to interview me, and then interview me on a voluntary [basis] but not charge?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re allowing a murderer to roam the streets of Leicestershire for three and a half months? An absurdity, but of course just one more absurdity in the Metropolitan police\u2019s Operation Midland.\u201d Under cross-examination by Beech\u2019s barrister, Collingwood Thompson, Proctor said he was not responsible for any of the allegations the defendant had \u201cmaliciously and mischievously\u201d made against him. Beech denies 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one of fraud. The trial continues.",

Before effective screening was introduced, NHS patients were given transfusions and blood products in the 1970s and 1980s containing HIV and hepatitis C viruses.</p> <p>On Friday, the inquiry examined the case of Michael Dorricott, a mild haemophiliac who was infected with hepatitis C at the age of 15 during a routine dental procedure when he was given contaminated Factor VIII blood products.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1a78442d710c9044a87f2f5e7038874c948262d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1a78442d710c9044a87f2f5e7038874c948262d/206_24_952_571/500.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Dorricott.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Dorricott.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Infected Blood Inquiry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like many mild haemophiliacs, the inquiry heard, he could have been treated with older medication and did not necessarily need the new Factor VIII drug.</p> <p>Giving evidence alongside her daughters, Sarah and Eleanor, and Dorricott\u2019s mother, Jennifer, his wife Ann told the inquiry her husband had died in April 2015 at the age of 47 from liver cancer linked to the hepatitis C. The women described how Dorricott\u2019s disease and eventual death had devastated their lives.</p> <p>They told the inquiry that following his terminal diagnosis, he had met his local MP, Hunt, who was then health secretary, who \u201cmade lots of promises\u201d about support and compensation. Dorricott\u2019s family told how the two men had become \u201creally good friends\u201d and were on \u201cfirst-name terms\u201d.</p> <p>In an interview following the inquiry, his daughter Sarah said: \u201cMy dad really had quite a close relationship with Hunt. He met him on numerous occasions. He had trust in him. We all thought that he [Hunt] would sort this out and that\u2019s what he had promised, but that was over five years ago now and our dad is no longer here.</p> <p>\u201cHe [Hunt] is now running to become prime minister and he is doing that on broken promises. Promises that he made to my father.\u201d</p> <p>Ann Dorricott told the inquiry how her husband had a meeting with Hunt, the junior health minister, Jane Ellison, and about 20 civil servants about getting a \u201cfair and final settlement\u201d. Ann said this was a week after her husband had been told he had terminal cancer.</p> <p>She told the inquiry: \u201cWhen Mike told the room that it was terminal, Mike got very upset, very emotional. Towards the end of the meeting, Jeremy Hunt came to myself and Mike, shook our hands and said to us: \u2018Don\u2019t worry about this, we\u2019ll sort it.\u2019 Those were his words.\u201d</p> <p>The counsel to the inquiry, Jenni Richards, reminded Ann that she had said in her witness statement that Hunt had \u201cguaranteed\u201d to her husband he would \u201csort this out\u201d. Richards said: \u201cYou say in your statement this: \u2018Since that meeting he has not fulfilled his promise.\u2019 That is your view and that was Mike\u2019s view?\u201d</p> <p>Ann told the inquiry: \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>She explained that Hunt had been their constituency MP when they lived in Farnham in Surrey \u2013 but they later moved to Sedbergh in Cumbria.</p> <p>Ann said her husband had met Hunt on a number of occasions relating to his campaign for compensation for the infected blood victims. She said: \u201cHe respected Jeremy Hunt. They called each other by their Christian names.

      "bodyText": "The Tory leadership candidate Jeremy Hunt has been accused of running for prime minister on \u201cbroken promises\u201d after claims that he failed victims of the infected blood scandal and did not fulfil his promise to a dying man. The infected blood inquiry, which began its hearings in London in May and spent the last fortnight in Leeds, is looking into the scandal, which is estimated to have claimed more than 3,000 lives. Before effective screening was introduced, NHS patients were given transfusions and blood products in the 1970s and 1980s containing HIV and hepatitis C viruses. On Friday, the inquiry examined the case of Michael Dorricott, a mild haemophiliac who was infected with hepatitis C at the age of 15 during a routine dental procedure when he was given contaminated Factor VIII blood products. Like many mild haemophiliacs, the inquiry heard, he could have been treated with older medication and did not necessarily need the new Factor VIII drug. Giving evidence alongside her daughters, Sarah and Eleanor, and Dorricott\u2019s mother, Jennifer, his wife Ann told the inquiry her husband had died in April 2015 at the age of 47 from liver cancer linked to the hepatitis C. The women described how Dorricott\u2019s disease and eventual death had devastated their lives. They told the inquiry that following his terminal diagnosis, he had met his local MP, Hunt, who was then health secretary, who \u201cmade lots of promises\u201d about support and compensation. Dorricott\u2019s family told how the two men had become \u201creally good friends\u201d and were on \u201cfirst-name terms\u201d. In an interview following the inquiry, his daughter Sarah said: \u201cMy dad really had quite a close relationship with Hunt. He met him on numerous occasions. He had trust in him. We all thought that he [Hunt] would sort this out and that\u2019s what he had promised, but that was over five years ago now and our dad is no longer here. \u201cHe [Hunt] is now running to become prime minister and he is doing that on broken promises. Promises that he made to my father.\u201d Ann Dorricott told the inquiry how her husband had a meeting with Hunt, the junior health minister, Jane Ellison, and about 20 civil servants about getting a \u201cfair and final settlement\u201d. Ann said this was a week after her husband had been told he had terminal cancer. She told the inquiry: \u201cWhen Mike told the room that it was terminal, Mike got very upset, very emotional. Towards the end of the meeting, Jeremy Hunt came to myself and Mike, shook our hands and said to us: \u2018Don\u2019t worry about this, we\u2019ll sort it.\u2019 Those were his words.\u201d The counsel to the inquiry, Jenni Richards, reminded Ann that she had said in her witness statement that Hunt had \u201cguaranteed\u201d to her husband he would \u201csort this out\u201d. Richards said: \u201cYou say in your statement this: \u2018Since that meeting he has not fulfilled his promise.\u2019 That is your view and that was Mike\u2019s view?\u201d Ann told the inquiry: \u201cYes.\u201d She explained that Hunt had been their constituency MP when they lived in Farnham in Surrey \u2013 but they later moved to Sedbergh in Cumbria. Ann said her husband had met Hunt on a number of occasions relating to his campaign for compensation for the infected blood victims. She said: \u201cHe respected Jeremy Hunt. They called each other by their Christian names. He had a good relationship with him.\u201d She said the meeting was in about February 2014 and was to discuss \u201cwhat would be a fair and final settlement for the victims of contaminated blood\u201d. Dorricott\u2019s family told the inquiry that he was first given Factor VIII in 1982. He found out he had hepatitis in 1996, when he was 28, and later developed liver cancer despite two liver transplants. His daughter Sarah read from a piece her father, a managing director at United Biscuits, wrote before his death. In it, he described how the \u201cnasty, nasty, disease has completely shattered my life\u201d. He explained how he had been forced to take early retirement from his well-paid job on medical grounds when he was just 42. He said his early retirement had reduced his income and estimated his lifetime loss of earnings at \u00a32.25m. Dorricott said: \u201cThe financial impact of this scandal is only one part of how this has affected me and my family. The chances are that I will be dead in the next 12 months. Nothing will ever repay this. \u201cI won\u2019t be there for my wife and two daughters. I won\u2019t get to walk them up the aisle. I won\u2019t be there to see their grandchildren. My wife will be on her own.\u201d Continuing his statement, Dorricott mentioned meeting Hunt and said only a financial package that made his family secure would provide any mitigation, adding: \u201cIt is time that the government sorts this issue out.\u201d He said: \u201cWe have had years of pain and anguish as a result of the actions taken by previous governments.

He added: \u201cThe Dorricott family are among thousands who have faced tragedy as a result of this appalling injustice. As well as increasing the financial support for victims, Jeremy pushed for this landmark inquiry because those affected have a right to know what went wrong and why.\u201d The inquiry also heard powerful testimony from Peter Burney, who said he would not live to see the conclusion of the inquiry after being told that he only had a year to live earlier this week. Burney, 60, from Stockport, who contracted hepatitis after two blood transfusions in 1976, called for victims of the NHS scandal to be fast-tracked for any medical procedures. \u201cThere is a victim dying every 96 hours while the Department for Health stand by and watch. There is one voice less with every passing. I am definitely a victim who will not see the end of this inquiry. I am one of the many who will not see justice.\u201d",

An offer to listen to the ideas of whoever replaces Theresa May came with a warning from the European council president and fellow leaders that the withdrawal agreement was final. \u201cMaybe the process of Brexit will be even more exciting than before because of some personnel decisions in London, but nothing has changed when it comes to our position,\u201d he said. Johnson and Jeremy Hunt will spend the next four weeks lobbying Conservative members for their votes, with both men claiming they will be able to renegotiate the Brexit agreement. But Tusk said that during a 12-minute discussion on the latest Brexit developments at a Brussels summit, the EU leaders were united in rejecting any further talks on the withdrawal agreement containing the contentious Irish backstop. \u201cWe emphasised again that from our point of view the exit agreement has been finalised in negotiations but we will get back to this after the election of a new prime minister,\u201d the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, later told reporters.

Under the backstop, Northern Ireland would in effect stay in the single market, and the UK would share a customs territory, leaving it unable to pursue an independent trade policy.

      "body": "<p>The former Barclays chief executive John Varley has been acquitted in a criminal trial over a deal with Qatar at the height of the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>A decision handed down by the court of appeal on Friday upheld a ruling by a lower court to drop charges against Varley, who was accused of disguising payments made to Qatar. The appeal court upheld the ruling that there was insufficient evidence to proceed.</p> <p>It also ruled that the remaining defendants, all former senior executives at Barclays, will return to trial at a date to be determined. They are Roger Jenkins, a former investment banking chief; Thomas Kalaris, a former head of the wealth division; and Richard Boath, a former head of European financial institutions at the bank.</p> <p>Varley, 63, who served as chief executive from 2004 to 2011, was the only UK banking chief to face a criminal trial over his actions during the financial crash.</p> <p>Lord Justice Gross, sitting at the appeal court, said: \u201cFollowing an application by Mr Varley at the close of the prosecution case, the trial judge ruled that the evidence against him on each count was insufficient for the case to proceed. The appeal was dismissed by the court of appeal \u2026 Accordingly, Mr Varley has been acquitted on both counts.\u201d</p> <p>The judgment marks the end of a lengthy legal battle for Varley, who faced trial more than a decade after the deal was struck. The trial jury was discharged in April after four months of court proceedings.</p> <p>The Serious Fraud Office, which brought the charges, accused Varley and his three former colleagues of disguising \u00a3322m in payments to Qatar in order to secure \u00a311bn of emergency funding in 2008.</p> <p>The deal helped Barclays avoid a government bailout, after Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland were nationalised.</p> <p>Prosecutors alleged the executives put together two advisory services agreements in order to mask Qatar\u2019s demand for a larger discount on its investment. UK regulations put a cap on investor discounts and require all investors to be offered the same deal.</p> <p>According to the SFO, Barclays chiefs claimed the bank was paying for advice from Qatar and introductions to other investors throughout the Middle East, but never expected those terms to be fulfilled.</p> <p>The SFO case followed a five-year investigation into the details of the rescue package. The fraud charges carried a maximum 10-year prison sentence.</p> <p>The remaining defendants all deny wrongdoing. Varley also denied the charges during the initial trial.</p> <p>The acquittal is another failure by the SFO after a string of failed prosecutions. But the retrial of the remaining former executives is a chance for the SFO to redeem itself.</p> <p>Last year, the SFO\u2019s case against Barclays over the same Qatari deal collapsed and was similarly struck down by the court of appeal.</p> <p>Its charges against former Tesco executives accused of masterminding a major accounting scandal were also thrown out at the end of last year after a judge deemed the SFO\u2019s case too weak to face a jury.</p> <p>The charges against the four former Barclays executives were first made public in 2017, with Varley losing two major board positions shortly after.</p> <p>He stepped down from the board of the asset manager BlackRock that summer and was also replaced as chairman of the Marie Curie charity.</p> <p>Varley was a Barclays stalwart, having joined in 1982. He also had close familial ties with the bank after marrying Carolyn Pease, whose father is a former Barclays vice-chairman.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The former Barclays chief executive John Varley has been acquitted in a criminal trial over a deal with Qatar at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. A decision handed down by the court of appeal on Friday upheld a ruling by a lower court to drop charges against Varley, who was accused of disguising payments made to Qatar. The appeal court upheld the ruling that there was insufficient evidence to proceed. It also ruled that the remaining defendants, all former senior executives at Barclays, will return to trial at a date to be determined. They are Roger Jenkins, a former investment banking chief; Thomas Kalaris, a former head of the wealth division; and Richard Boath, a former head of European financial institutions at the bank. Varley, 63, who served as chief executive from 2004 to 2011, was the only UK banking chief to face a criminal trial over his actions during the financial crash. Lord Justice Gross, sitting at the appeal court, said: \u201cFollowing an application by Mr Varley at the close of the prosecution case, the trial judge ruled that the evidence against him on each count was insufficient for the case to proceed. The appeal was dismissed by the court of appeal \u2026 Accordingly, Mr Varley has been acquitted on both counts.\u201d The judgment marks the end of a lengthy legal battle for Varley, who faced trial more than a decade after the deal was struck. The trial jury was discharged in April after four months of court proceedings. The Serious Fraud Office, which brought the charges, accused Varley and his three former colleagues of disguising \u00a3322m in payments to Qatar in order to secure \u00a311bn of emergency funding in 2008. The deal helped Barclays avoid a government bailout, after Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland were nationalised. Prosecutors alleged the executives put together two advisory services agreements in order to mask Qatar\u2019s demand for a larger discount on its investment. UK regulations put a cap on investor discounts and require all investors to be offered the same deal. According to the SFO, Barclays chiefs claimed the bank was paying for advice from Qatar and introductions to other investors throughout the Middle East, but never expected those terms to be fulfilled. The SFO case followed a five-year investigation into the details of the rescue package. The fraud charges carried a maximum 10-year prison sentence. The remaining defendants all deny wrongdoing. Varley also denied the charges during the initial trial. The acquittal is another failure by the SFO after a string of failed prosecutions. But the retrial of the remaining former executives is a chance for the SFO to redeem itself. Last year, the SFO\u2019s case against Barclays over the same Qatari deal collapsed and was similarly struck down by the court of appeal. Its charges against former Tesco executives accused of masterminding a major accounting scandal were also thrown out at the end of last year after a judge deemed the SFO\u2019s case too weak to face a jury. The charges against the four former Barclays executives were first made public in 2017, with Varley losing two major board positions shortly after. He stepped down from the board of the asset manager BlackRock that summer and was also replaced as chairman of the Marie Curie charity. Varley was a Barclays stalwart, having joined in 1982. He also had close familial ties with the bank after marrying Carolyn Pease, whose father is a former Barclays vice-chairman.",

      "body": "<p>As a teenager, disenchanted with religion, I turned to Shakespeare for ethical guidance. I was inspired by the work of the Royal Shakespeare Company. It represented the ultimate company of conscious artists, speaking and playing Shakespeare with humour and insight.</p> <p>In my 20s I was fortunate to join the company, play Hamlet and Romeo, and become an associate artist. I have been delighted ever since to be connected with thousands of artists and audiences who have made the RSC what it is. And yet today I feel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/21/mark-rylance-resigns-from-royal-shakespeare-company-rsc-over-bp-sponsorship\">I must dissociate myself from the RSC</a>, not because it is any less of a theatre company, but because of the company it keeps.</p> <p>In 2012, when the RSC first partnered with BP, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/apr/22/oiling-wheels-shakespeare-festival\" title=\"\">I joined a number of others</a> in expressing concern that the RSC was \u201callowing itself to be used by BP to obscure the destructive reality of its activities\u201d. We felt BP was buying the impression that it, too, had the consciousness of Shakespeare and the RSC artists. At the same time, the activist theatre group <a href=\"https://bp-or-not-bp.org/\" title=\"\">BP or not BP?</a> began a series of Shakespearean stage invasions in protest at the sponsor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/21/mark-rylance-resigns-from-royal-shakespeare-company-rsc-over-bp-sponsorship\">Mark Rylance resigns from RSC over BP sponsorship</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the wake of that criticism, the RSC desisted in putting BP logos on more plays. However, the following year, BP instead started sponsoring the \u00a35 ticket scheme for 16- to 25-year-olds, and in 2016 the RSC signed a contract for the partnership to continue until 2022.</p> <p>The arts sponsorship business is tricky. I would love nothing more than increased support for the imaginative arts, athletics and sciences of Britain. So I met with the environmentalist Jonathon Porritt, to find out if my suspicions about BP were wrong. \u201cI worked closely with senior leaders in BP for more than a decade, intent on helping them radically change course,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat work came to an end when I came to the incontrovertible conclusion that BP is neither sincere nor serious in addressing the climate crisis.\u201d</p> <p>He continued: \u201cTogether with other oil majors, BP has been accused of fully understanding the science of climate change as far back as the early 1980s, and downplaying and obscuring that science ever since, always in the short-term interests of its shareholders. Regrettably, its current leadership is stuck in the same pattern \u2013 all the time using philanthropy to hide its past and present culpability.\u201d</p> <p>The early 1980s! This is 2019. Half the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere currently warming our planet have been emitted in the last 30 years. BP has made the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/20/90-companies-man-made-global-warming-emissions-climate-change\" title=\"\">third-biggest contribution to climate change</a> of any private company in history. It apparently knew three decades ago we were about to cook our planet, and then lit the fire.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Surely the RSC wants to be on the side of the world-changing kids, not the world-killing companies?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And this is not just about the past; this is about the future. The climate crisis could now not be more urgent, and to tackle it climate scientists advise that the majority of known fossil-fuel reserves <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/news/most-fossil-fuels-must-stay-in-the-ground-new-study\" title=\"\">be left in the ground</a>. But BP has committed to invest \u00a341bn in new oil extraction over the next 10 years. Its current advertising campaign suggests the company is investing heavily in renewables, yet in reality 97% of its capital investments will remain in oil and gas.</p> <p>BP is also a powerful lobbyist.

      "bodyText": "As a teenager, disenchanted with religion, I turned to Shakespeare for ethical guidance. I was inspired by the work of the Royal Shakespeare Company. It represented the ultimate company of conscious artists, speaking and playing Shakespeare with humour and insight. In my 20s I was fortunate to join the company, play Hamlet and Romeo, and become an associate artist. I have been delighted ever since to be connected with thousands of artists and audiences who have made the RSC what it is. And yet today I feel I must dissociate myself from the RSC, not because it is any less of a theatre company, but because of the company it keeps. In 2012, when the RSC first partnered with BP, I joined a number of others in expressing concern that the RSC was \u201callowing itself to be used by BP to obscure the destructive reality of its activities\u201d. We felt BP was buying the impression that it, too, had the consciousness of Shakespeare and the RSC artists. At the same time, the activist theatre group BP or not BP? began a series of Shakespearean stage invasions in protest at the sponsor. In the wake of that criticism, the RSC desisted in putting BP logos on more plays. However, the following year, BP instead started sponsoring the \u00a35 ticket scheme for 16- to 25-year-olds, and in 2016 the RSC signed a contract for the partnership to continue until 2022. The arts sponsorship business is tricky. I would love nothing more than increased support for the imaginative arts, athletics and sciences of Britain. So I met with the environmentalist Jonathon Porritt, to find out if my suspicions about BP were wrong. \u201cI worked closely with senior leaders in BP for more than a decade, intent on helping them radically change course,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat work came to an end when I came to the incontrovertible conclusion that BP is neither sincere nor serious in addressing the climate crisis.\u201d He continued: \u201cTogether with other oil majors, BP has been accused of fully understanding the science of climate change as far back as the early 1980s, and downplaying and obscuring that science ever since, always in the short-term interests of its shareholders. Regrettably, its current leadership is stuck in the same pattern \u2013 all the time using philanthropy to hide its past and present culpability.\u201d The early 1980s! This is 2019. Half the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere currently warming our planet have been emitted in the last 30 years. BP has made the third-biggest contribution to climate change of any private company in history. It apparently knew three decades ago we were about to cook our planet, and then lit the fire. And this is not just about the past; this is about the future. The climate crisis could now not be more urgent, and to tackle it climate scientists advise that the majority of known fossil-fuel reserves be left in the ground. But BP has committed to invest \u00a341bn in new oil extraction over the next 10 years. Its current advertising campaign suggests the company is investing heavily in renewables, yet in reality 97% of its capital investments will remain in oil and gas. BP is also a powerful lobbyist. It recently topped the list of firms obstructing climate action around the world and has been successfully lobbying President Trump for access to Arctic oil. I also wonder how much BP is actually giving the RSC? Oil companies operating in the North Sea, of which BP is one of the biggest, benefit from billions in tax breaks and subsidies, so in reality they are taking much more from the public purse than they are \u201cgiving back\u201d in sponsorship. Back in 2017 I submitted a question to the RSC\u2019s AGM, as I thought my role as an associate artist was to press these matters reasonably within the organisation. Many months later, I was told that BP\u2019s support was discussed and that \u201cwe assess potential donations against three principles \u2013 they must support the charitable objectives of the RSC, reflect the integrity of the RSC and not influence the RSC\u2019s artistic decisions\u201d. It went on: \u201cPossible ways to further involve the RSC\u2019s valued associate artists are already under way, welcoming their support through private consultation.\u201d I have waited two years for that consultation. Hearing nothing, I recently let the RSC know that I feel I must resign as I do not wish to be associated with BP any more than I would with an arms dealer, a tobacco salesman or anyone who wilfully destroys the lives of others alive or unborn. Nor, I believe, would William Shakespeare. The RSC\u2019s response? We must be \u201cphased and pragmatic\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The five defendants in the notorious Pamplona sexual attack case have had their prison sentences raised from nine to 15 years each after the supreme court found them guilty of gang-raping a woman at the running of the bulls festival three years ago. The case \u2013 known as La Manada, or the \u201cwolf pack\u201d, after the name of the men\u2019s WhatsApp group \u2013 shocked Spain, prompted major protests and provoked a fierce debate over the country\u2019s sexual offences legislation. At the end of their trial in Pamplona in April last year, the five were cleared of gang rape but convicted of the lesser charge of sexual abuse. Under Spanish law, sexual abuse differs from rape in that it does not involve violence or intimidation. Defence lawyers had claimed the woman had consented and had let one of the men kiss her. They also argued that 96 seconds of video footage from the men\u2019s phones \u2013 showing the woman immobile and with her eyes shut during the attack \u2013 was proof of consent. The prosecution, however, said the victim had simply been too terrified to move. Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Prenda, Alfonso Cabezuelo, Antonio Manuel Guerrero, Jes\u00fas Escudero and \u00c1ngel Boza were originally sentenced to nine years\u2019 imprisonment, five years\u2019 probation and ordered to pay \u20ac10,000 each to the woman. Guerrero, a Guardia Civil police officer, was also fined \u20ac900 for stealing her phone. But on Friday, the supreme court in Madrid overturned the lower court\u2019s verdict, ruling that the men had committed rape rather than sexual abuse. It said the victim had been subjected to \u201ca genuinely intimidating scenario in which she never consented to the sexual acts perpetrated by the accused\u201d. Explaining its decision to find the five guilty of rape, the court added: \u201cThis intimidating situation led the victim to adopt an attitude of submission, doing what the perpetrators told her to do, despite the distress and intense strain \u2026 The accused took advantage of this to commit acts against the victim\u2019s freedom, among them at least 10 sexual assaults consisting of oral, vaginal and anal penetration.\u201d Earlier, the public prosecutor Isabel Rodr\u00edguez had argued that violence and intimidation had been used in the assault, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t ask victims to act in a dangerously heroic way.\u201d The defendants were sentenced to 15 years in prison, forbidden from contacting or approaching the victim for 20 years, and ordered to pay her \u20ac100,000. Guerrero was sentenced to a further two years for the phone theft. The original proceedings had also been criticised because the judges accepted into evidence a report compiled by a private detective hired by some of the defendants. The detective had followed the woman over several days and produced photographs of her smiling with friends. Spain\u2019s acting deputy prime minister and equalities minister, Carmen Calvo, said the supreme court\u2019s decision \u201crecognised the credibility of the victim\u201d. In a tweet, she said the verdict was in line with the government\u2019s proposals to change the law to distinguish between rape and sexual assault, and sexual abuse. Viviana Waisman, the president of the human rights NGO Women\u2019s Link, said the verdict was very important. \u201cIt sends a clear message that judges must apply the law without gender stereotypes and that when victims of sexual violence come forth, they must be believed instead of questioned \u2013 and that the system needs to focus on investigating the accused and not the victims,\u201d she said. The convicted men can appeal to the Spanish constitutional court and then to the European court of human rights.",

That resulted in an exodus of quite a meaningful number of Conservative party members, who found those changes to be unacceptable.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that the general tenor of the 2017 general election campaign was to attract former Ukip voters in northern seats, and to some extent it was successful.\u201d</p> <p>Data from an upcoming book, Footsoldiers, by Bale and his colleagues Paul Webb and Monica Poletti, suggests that even as of two years ago the party was far from representative of the wider population. Men made up 71% of party members, and 54% of members lived in London or the south of England. The stereotype of an octogenarian membership is largely unfounded, with an average age of 57 compared with 53 for Labour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2019-06-21T12:19:47/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Age graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2019-06-21T12:19:47/embed.html\">Age graphic</a> </figure>  <p>On economic issues, the membership are substantially further to the right than other parties. Only 14% think government should redistribute income from the better off to the worse off, and only 25% think ordinary working people do not get their fair share. One in five think austerity has gone too far, up from 4% in 2015.</p> <p>There is a similar story in attitudes to social issues. Up to 77% of members think young people do not have enough respect for traditional British values, and more than half support reintroducing the death penalty. Up to 42% think censorship of films and magazines is necessary to uphold moral standards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2019-06-21T11:27:57/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Poll results graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2019-06-21T11:27:57/embed.html\">Poll results graphic</a> </figure>  <p>There is some evidence that the Conservative membership is less engaged than members of other parties. Up to 29% think they are ignored by the leadership, compared with 18% of Labour members and 11% of Liberal Democrats, <a href=\"https://esrcpartymembersproject.org/\">according to the research</a>.</p> <p>This appears to have translated to levels of activism around the 2017 election. Members reported carrying out an average of 1.7 campaign activities, compared with 2.5 for Labour. Tory members are less likely to have displayed a poster, donated money, attended a public meeting or engaged with a campaign on social media than members of the other parties.</p> <p>However, Bale believes the survey data also shows a shift towards the extreme on members\u2019 attitudes towards Brexit. \u201cWhen we asked Conservative party members just after the 2015 election, two-thirds of them exactly told us that they would make up their minds about how to vote in the referendum after seeing what David Cameron came home with following his renegotiation,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got to a situation where two-thirds of them want a no-deal Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 June 2019 because an earlier version referred to a supposed \u201cgeriatric membership\u201d. Geriatric refers to a branch of medicine; octogenarian was meant. This has been corrected.</p>",

In an article for the Telegraph, Brandon Lewis, the Tory party chairman, attributed the increase to better membership retention, and his account is backed up by Robert Semple, a former chair of the national convention, who oversaw the recent centralisation of the party\u2019s membership processes. \u201cWhen I went on to the board you had 636 autonomous associations,\u201d Semple said. \u201cQuite understandably, in many parts of the country they struggled to maintain and retain their membership purely from an administrative point of view.\u201d Semple is proud of the reforms and dismisses the suggestion that entryism has played any role in the increase in numbers. \u201cI have seen no evidence whatsoever \u2013 ever \u2013 of any entryism into the Conservative party,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a myth.\u201d In a recent poll of members\u2019 attitudes, 44.5% of those questioned said they had joined after the 2016 EU referendum. \u201cIt does seem high, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University. \u201cBut you have to remember that it looks as if there has been a surge into the party in recent months, and perhaps really since the referendum itself.\u201d Party memberships waxed and waned, he said, although \u201cit\u2019s not altogether surprising given how important Brexit is to many people, and given how many Ukip members may have been former Conservative members who then came home.\u201d Mohammed Amin, the chair of the Conservative Muslim Forum, who has called Boris Johnson a \u201cbuffoon\u201d and threatened to leave the party if he becomes leader, agreed that members had probably returned. \u201cStarting in 2005 when David Cameron became party leader, there was a very clear, determined attempt from the top to change the way that the Conservative party was seen by the population at large,\u201d Amin said. \u201cHis most notable and most successful measure in this broad area was the introduction of equal civil marriage. That resulted in an exodus of quite a meaningful number of Conservative party members, who found those changes to be unacceptable. \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that the general tenor of the 2017 general election campaign was to attract former Ukip voters in northern seats, and to some extent it was successful.\u201d Data from an upcoming book, Footsoldiers, by Bale and his colleagues Paul Webb and Monica Poletti, suggests that even as of two years ago the party was far from representative of the wider population. Men made up 71% of party members, and 54% of members lived in London or the south of England. The stereotype of an octogenarian membership is largely unfounded, with an average age of 57 compared with 53 for Labour. On economic issues, the membership are substantially further to the right than other parties. Only 14% think government should redistribute income from the better off to the worse off, and only 25% think ordinary working people do not get their fair share. One in five think austerity has gone too far, up from 4% in 2015. There is a similar story in attitudes to social issues. Up to 77% of members think young people do not have enough respect for traditional British values, and more than half support reintroducing the death penalty. Up to 42% think censorship of films and magazines is necessary to uphold moral standards. There is some evidence that the Conservative membership is less engaged than members of other parties. Up to 29% think they are ignored by the leadership, compared with 18% of Labour members and 11% of Liberal Democrats, according to the research. This appears to have translated to levels of activism around the 2017 election. Members reported carrying out an average of 1.7 campaign activities, compared with 2.5 for Labour. Tory members are less likely to have displayed a poster, donated money, attended a public meeting or engaged with a campaign on social media than members of the other parties. However, Bale believes the survey data also shows a shift towards the extreme on members\u2019 attitudes towards Brexit. \u201cWhen we asked Conservative party members just after the 2015 election, two-thirds of them exactly told us that they would make up their minds about how to vote in the referendum after seeing what David Cameron came home with following his renegotiation,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got to a situation where two-thirds of them want a no-deal Brexit.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 24 June 2019 because an earlier version referred to a supposed \u201cgeriatric membership\u201d. Geriatric refers to a branch of medicine; octogenarian was meant. This has been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "OH FERNANDO! Liverpool\u2019s supporters have long been renowned as a detached and indifferent bunch who could never be accused of being even remotely sentimental, but The Fiver is prepared to bet even those Koppites with the flintiest of hearts shed a salty tear upon hearing their former hero, Fernando Torres, has announced his retirement. Madrile\u00f1o by birth but Scouse by the grace of God, the freckle-faced striker who achieved hero status with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid by helping to secure their return to the Spanish top flight before his move to Merseyside may look 12 years old, but is in fact 35. And following a long and largely successful career in which he won such insignificant baubles as a World Cup, two European Championships, one Big Cup, two Big Vases and an FA Cup, he has finally decided to put himself out to pasture. \u201cI have something very important to announce,\u201d he declared on social media disgraces today, before a statement you just kind of knew wouldn\u2019t comprise him effing and jeffing his way around a messy Miami hotel room. \u201cAfter 18 exciting years, the time has come to put an end to my football career. Next Sunday, the 23rd at 10am local time in Japan, I will have a press conference in Tokyo to explain all the details. See you there.\u201d While it is in Japan, with Sagan Tosu, that Torres has been playing out his dotage, it is his spells with his boyhood club Atl\u00e9tico and Liverpool for which he will be best remembered. \u201cAtl\u00e9tico is my club but I still support Liverpool and I want them to win every game, every trophy,\u201d he told Simon Hughes in 2017, when the writer travelled to the outskirts of Madrid to get the skinny on a certain ill-fated \u00a350m move to Chelsea. Citing irreconcilable differences between himself and a board he felt demonstrated an obvious lack of ambition by selling off all their best players, Torres decided to join the exodus for the door marked Do One. \u201cThe stories that appeared in the press changed the view of everybody including myself,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was not the truth. The truth was that I moved from my home to a club that was ready to win. When I left, there was not a single piece of the winning culture left.\u201d Despite going on to win an enviable amount of silverware with clubs elsewhere, Torres won nothing at Liverpool beyond local hearts. \u201cThe reason to move was to win trophies and I did,\u201d he explained, when asked if he wished he hadn\u2019t moved to Chelsea. \u201cIt is silly to regret something you wanted but maybe you realise it does not bring you contentment.\u201d Now all grown up and with a great and glorious future behind him, we hope the \u201cThe Kid\u201d \u2013 one of football\u2019s gents \u2013 has achieved all he\u2019d ever hoped for. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Paul Doyle from 9pm BST for hot MBM coverage of Egypt 2-0 Zimbabwe in the Africa Cup of Nations, assuming the hosts\u2019 opponents don\u2019t boycott the game, as some reports claim. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI just thought: \u2018Life\u2019s too short, I\u2019m not enjoying football, I do have other interests,\u2019 so it was the right time to do it. My mum would have been exactly the same as my auntie, crying her eyes out if she had seen me on a horse. Even when she came and watched me play football, if someone hit me too hard she would be really annoyed and be like: \u2018What are they doing to my baby?\u2019\u201d \u2013 former Coventry midfielder Jay Tabb on how he switched careers to being a wee jockey with ambitions to ride at the Cheltenham Festival.

The name Libra comes from the basic Roman measurement of weight. The abbreviation lb for pound is derived from Libra, and the \u00a3 symbol originally comes from an ornate L in Libra.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is Facebook launching a cryptocurrency?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Facebook claims it wants to reach the 1.7 billion people around the world who do not have access to a bank account.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who is in charge of Libra?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Facebook is likely to run into regulatory hurdles and antitrust concerns. The currency will be serviced by a collective of companies called the 'Libra Association'. It functions as what is known as a 'stablecoin', pegged to existing assets like the dollar or euro, in the aim of making it less subject to the volatility that many cryptocurrencies experience.</p>\n    <p>The Libra Association is described by Facebook as an independent, not-for-profit organisation based in Switzerland. Within the Libra Association will be a governing body called the Libra Association Council, comprised of a representative of each member of the association, which will vote on policy and operating decisions.</p>\n    <p>Facebook claims that although it created the Libra Association and the Libra Blockchain, once the currency is launched in 2020 the company will withdraw from a leadership role and all members of the association will have equal votes in governance of Libra. The companies who contributed a minimum of $10m(\u00a38m) to be listed as founding members of the Libra Association include tech companies such as PayPal, Ebay, Spotify, Uber and Lyft, as well as financial and venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, Visa and Mastercard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>However in October 2019 several of the companies that had been backing the initiative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/11/payment-firms-back-out-in-painful-blow-to-facebooks-cryptocurrency-libra\">announced that they were pulling out</a>, including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Stripe.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How and when can I use it?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>With regulators asking questions and backing companies dropping out, it is unclear now if Libra is still viable. Facebook's original plans were that users could download Calibra, a digital wallet, that would allow them to send the currency to anyone with a smartphone. It is no longer clear which countries the coin will launch in first, if at all, though Facebook had said 'almost anybody' in the world with a smartphone would be able to download the app.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kari-paul\"><b>Kari Paul</b></a>&nbsp;in <i>San Francisco</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIf even modestly successful, Libra would hand over much of the control of monetary policy from central banks to these private companies,\u201d said Hughes, a co-chair of the Economic Security Project, an anti-poverty campaign group. \u201cIf global regulators don\u2019t act now, it could very soon be too late.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, gave a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/20/mark-carney-bank-of-england-lend-digital-business-sme-cryptocurrency\">cautious welcome</a> to Libra in his speech at the annual Mansion House dinner on Thursday night.</p> \n<p>But in an article for the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aa97ad20-91a0-11e9-8ff4-699df1c62544\">Financial Times</a>, Hughes said the companies involved in the Libra Association, which have each put $10m into the project, would be able to \u201cdisrupt and weaken\u201d nation states.</p> \n<p>He warned that if enough people in emerging economies traded local currency for Libra, it would threaten the ability of governments to manage their fiscal policies. Emerging markets should place a temporary ban on local banks and payment processors accepting the currency until the implications are thought through, Hughes said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat Libra backers are calling \u2018decentralisation\u2019 is in truth a shift of power from developing world central banks toward multinational corporations and the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Hughes added that if Libra is successful, Facebook and its partners would hold undue sway over the development of crucial global technology such as identify verification, as well as effectively writing the rules on matters such as privacy and response to theft.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He said anyone believing his fears were overblown should consider how Facebook has had a huge, sometimes negative, effect on other walks of life.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe company\u2019s decision to offer live broadcasting made it possible for teenagers to stream bullying, terrorists to live cast an execution and a gunman a mass shooting,\u201d Hughes said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt has similarly transformed mobile messaging and news and journalism faster than many imagined.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Guardian has approached Facebook for comment.</p>",

Facebook is developing Libra from a base in Switzerland, in partnership with 27 other corporations \u2013 including Mastercard, Paypal, Uber and Vodafone \u2013 collectively known as the Libra Association. \u201cIf even modestly successful, Libra would hand over much of the control of monetary policy from central banks to these private companies,\u201d said Hughes, a co-chair of the Economic Security Project, an anti-poverty campaign group. \u201cIf global regulators don\u2019t act now, it could very soon be too late.\u201d Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, gave a cautious welcome to Libra in his speech at the annual Mansion House dinner on Thursday night. But in an article for the Financial Times, Hughes said the companies involved in the Libra Association, which have each put $10m into the project, would be able to \u201cdisrupt and weaken\u201d nation states. He warned that if enough people in emerging economies traded local currency for Libra, it would threaten the ability of governments to manage their fiscal policies. Emerging markets should place a temporary ban on local banks and payment processors accepting the currency until the implications are thought through, Hughes said. \u201cWhat Libra backers are calling \u2018decentralisation\u2019 is in truth a shift of power from developing world central banks toward multinational corporations and the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank,\u201d he said. Hughes added that if Libra is successful, Facebook and its partners would hold undue sway over the development of crucial global technology such as identify verification, as well as effectively writing the rules on matters such as privacy and response to theft. He said anyone believing his fears were overblown should consider how Facebook has had a huge, sometimes negative, effect on other walks of life. \u201cThe company\u2019s decision to offer live broadcasting made it possible for teenagers to stream bullying, terrorists to live cast an execution and a gunman a mass shooting,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cIt has similarly transformed mobile messaging and news and journalism faster than many imagined.\u201d The Guardian has approached Facebook for comment.",

He pushes her out of the posh dinner, his hands gripping her neck. She is shocked. The gut twists at the familiarity. Male violence so everyday that many will have experienced it, many will have felt sick watching it \u2013 and somehow still ashamed to admit that this had happened to them too. Elsewhere, long ago, somewhere more private. No one saw. The woman looked stunned. What could have been hidden in her red dress? Submachine guns, harpoons, ground-to-air missiles? Philip Hammond was to make his Mansion House speech. The woman was part of a protest designed to draw attention to the climate crisis. But there is no room for protest here in the centre of power. The man, Mark Field, is the MP for Cities of London and Westminster, which includes the area presided over by the Corporation of London, the ancient centre of power and still the epicentre of business.

      "bodyText": "In June 2019, the UK government committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 \u2013 making it the first major economy and G7 member to do so. But what does that mean? And how are they planning on getting there? The integration of renewable energy sources is key, for starters, and a lot needs to happen to the way we produce, supply and store energy. From the stats on our increasing reliance on the \u201cright\u201d energy sources, and a look at how we\u2019re changing our lifestyles for the better, to what might stand in our way, these are our energy facts and figures as they stand. Renewables are on the rise The International Energy Agency (IEA) calls modern bioenergy \u2013 such as ethanol \u2013 \u201cthe overlooked giant\u201d within renewable energy, responsible for half of all renewable energy consumed in 2017. Bioenergy is also expected to account for 30% of the growth in renewables consumption between 2018 and 2023, mainly due to its use in heat and transport. The growth in renewables overall will also continue during the same period, and by 2023 will account for almost 30% of total power demand globally. Source: IEA The grid is big Electricity Transmission owns and runs the network of cables and transformers within the National Grid. It transmits electricity from power stations to homes, schools, hospitals, factories and other places. The network consists of 4,474 miles of overhead line, 969 miles of underground cable and 346 substations. Source: National Grid ET We\u2019re attached to Europe Our future relationship with the EU may be uncertain, but interconnectors will still link our power system to mainland Europe. These high-voltage cables are designed to connect separate electricity systems, allowing national markets to trade and transmit power. Providing about 6% of the country\u2019s electricity supply in 2017 (pdf), they link the UK\u2019s power system with those of Ireland, France, the Netherlands and Belgium. Eleven further connections linking the UK to other European countries are also planned or under construction (including the 450-mile long North Sea Link to tap into Norway\u2019s hydropower, and the 470-mile long Viking Link to harness energy from Denmark\u2019s wind farms), which could meet a fifth of the UK\u2019s electricity needs by 2025 (pdf). Source: Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Coal consumption is declining Coal consumption has fallen from 157m tonnes in 1970 to 11.8m tonnes in 2018, and the UK\u2019s six remaining coal power stations are set to close by 2025. In May 2019 the UK also went 18 days without burning coal to generate energy \u2013 the longest streak the country has managed since 1882. Source: BEIS / National Grid ESO Offshore wind capacity is increasing A third of the UK\u2019s electricity generation came from renewables in the third quarter of 2018 \u2013 a new record. That percentage is likely to go even higher: the government hopes that offshore windfarms alone will provide a third of our electricity by 2030 \u2013 with the number of jobs in offshore wind potentially tripling to 27,000 in that period. What will be the world\u2019s biggest offshore wind farm, Hornsea One \u2013 75 miles off the Yorkshire coast \u2013 is also due to be completed in 2020. It will cover an area five times the size of the nearby city of Hull, and the 174 turbines \u2013 each taller than London\u2019s Gherkin building \u2013 will be capable of powering 1m homes. In times of peak demand, the smarter energy network will also help to better integrate energy from offshore wind. Source: BEIS / \u00d8rsted We\u2019re reducing the amount of energy we use In 2018 the power output of British power stations fell to its lowest level since 1994. A total of 335 terawatt-hours were generated in 2018, down by 1% on the year before. Since 2005 the level has fallen by 16% \u2013 the reduction equivalent of two-and-a-half times the projected output of the new Hinkley Point C nuclear plant. On an individual level, this reduction is in part due to a combination of more efficient appliances and energy-efficient lighting, and an increase in environmentally conscious consumers. Source: Carbon Brief We\u2019re making more efficient appliances Energy-efficient appliances helped the average household reduce gas and electricity usage between 2008 and 2017 \u2013 saving \u00a3290 a year. The most efficient dishwashers on the market cost about \u00a37 less to run than the lowest-rated models of the same size, for example, and use less water. Eco kettles that only boil the amount of water required for a cuppa also use 20% less energy than a conventional electric kettle \u2013 quite a saving when you consider that the average UK household boils the kettle 1,500 times a year. Furthermore, smart meters help people keep tabs on their energy use, making it even easier to take steps to reduce their carbon footprint. Source: Committee on Climate Change / Energy Saving Trust And our homes are improving \u2026 Homes account for about 18% of the UK\u2019s emissions. The government\u2019s Clean Growth Strategy aims to tackle this by improving the energy efficiency of approximately 1m homes. As of February 2019, about 852,000 homes had received at least one improvement measure \u2013 such as better cavity-wall or loft insulation \u2013 since the scheme launched in 2015. Energy suppliers are also offering smart meters to every home in England, Wales and Scotland \u2013 these transmit energy data to the network so it can better cope with energy supply and demand, helping our country to integrate more renewable power into the grid and tackle the climate emergency. Source: BEIS \u2026 As are our cars More than 2m electric vehicles were sold globally in 2018. This figure is expected to rise to 10m in 2025, 28m in 2030 and 56m by 2040, when they will account for 57% of global car sales. A smarter, more flexible energy infrastructure will be crucial in managing the increased demand EV charging will place on our electricity system. Source: BloombergNEF And there\u2019s appetite for improvement More than six in 10 (62%) of the British public would install solar panels to tackle the climate crisis if there was greater assistance from the government, according to a 2018 YouGov survey carried out on behalf of the environmental law group ClientEarth. A total of 60% of respondents would also buy an energy storage device (such as a home battery), and 71% would join a local energy scheme, such as a community windfarm or solar panel collective. Source: ClientEarth But we\u2019ve got a long way to go According to independent government advisory body the Committee on Climate Change, which campaigned for the government\u2019s net-zero commitment, the foundations are already in place to achieve that goal, including initiatives such as increased tree planting and reducing emissions on farms. But, it reports, these policies must be strengthened.

      "bodyText": "An Oxford couple have been given suspended jail sentences after being found guilty of sending money to their son while he was living under Islamic State in Syria that could have been used to fund terrorism. John Letts, 58, an internationally renowned organic grain farmer, and Sally Lane, 57, a former Oxfam fundraiser, defied police warnings and sent \u00a3223 to Jack Letts, now 23, despite concerns he had joined Isis. They knew they were breaking the law, the Old Bailey jury was told. In one message, Lane told her son: \u201cI would go to prison for you if I thought it gave you a better chance of actually reaching your 25th birthday.\u201d The couple refused to believe that Jack, a Muslim convert, had become an extremist, and sent the money because they believed he was in mortal danger. The prosecution argued that the couple \u201cdid not want to hear the truth\u201d and \u201cturned a blind eye to the obvious\u201d. The judge Nicholas Hilliard QC sentenced the couple to 15 months\u2019 imprisonment, suspended for 12 months. He said that in their love for their son they had lost \u201csight of realities\u201d even though \u201cthe warning signs were there\u201d. The jury was not told that Jack was believed to be in the custody of Kurdish authorities, accused of being a member of Isis. In an ITV interview from prison in February, Jack, who has dual UK and Canadian citizenship, said he doubted officials from either country would help him because \u201cno one really cares\u201d. In a statement outside court, the couple said: \u201cWe have been convicted for doing what any parents would do if their child was in danger.\u201d There was no suggestion during the trial that the money they sent was used for terrorism, they said, adding that they felt badly let down by the police and the government. They said they had pleaded with the government to help get Jack back to the UK. \u201cHaving escaped from Isis, he is in limbo,\u201d they said. \u201cThe heavy price we paid today is an indicator of the love we have for our children. We are committed to help Jack return home.\u201d His parents initially sent him \u00a3223 in September 2015. They then attempted to send another \u00a31,000 in December, claiming Jack, who has obsessive compulsive disorder, was trapped in Raqqa and needed the money to escape. Those transfers were blocked. The jury deliberated for almost 20 hours before finding them guilty of the September charge but not guilty of the December charge. They could not reach a verdict on a third charge, which will remain on file. Jack converted to Islam aged 16 and travelled to Syria in 2014, when he was 18. The couple paid for his return flight to Jordan in May 2014, believing he was on a \u201cgrand adventure\u201d learning Arabic, despite one of Jack\u2019s friends warning them about his growing extremism. Jack then moved to Kuwait and married in Iraq, before he rang his mother to say he was in Syria in September 2014. Wanting to help Jack was not a defence, the prosecutor Alison Morgan QC told the jury. \u201cOnce Jack Letts made the decision that he did to follow Islamic State to Syria and live in Islamic State territory, and to defend its ideals and goals, the normal parenting rules for what you can do to help your child change.\u201d Jurors heard that Jack said \u201cthe most appalling things\u201d on social media and in messages to his parents. In one Facebook comment, underneath a photograph posted by a former schoolfriend with young British army comrades, he wrote that he would like to \u201cperform a martyrdom operation in this scene\u201d.

His parents have made repeated attempts to get the UK and the Canadian governments to help get Jack out of Syria, including organising protests and staging hunger strikes to draw attention to their case. DCS Kath Barnes said investigators had \u201chuge empathy\u201d with the couple but it was not for them to choose when it was \u201cOK to break the law\u201d. Jenny Hopkins, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said it was natural for parents to care for their son, but the couple had been warned \u201cmultiple times\u201d. \u201cThey chose to ignore that advice and at one point set up a fake identity to send him money,\u201d she said. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 June 2019 to change text in the first paragraph that did not conform to the Guardian\u2019s style guidelines.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap Tensions between the US and Iran have pushed the oil price up to a new three-week high. Brent crude is now over $65 per barrel, following yesterday\u2019s drone shooting. US company growth has slowed again this month, according to data firm Markit\u2019s latest PMI reports. Private sector output growth has lost momentum in each month since February, with companies reporting that customers are more nervous. UK financial regulators have imposed a \u00a345m fine over a notorious banking scandal a decade ago. Cardiff-based chipmaker IQE has become the latest tech firm to warn that America\u2019s ban on Huawei is hurting the tech sector. IQE\u2019s shares have plunged by a third today, after it issued a profits warning. Newsflash: Growth across America\u2019s private sector has slowed to its slowest pace in three years. Data firm Markit\u2019s monthly survey of company output has dropped closer to stagnation this month, suggesting the US economy is cooling. Both service sector companies and manufacturers reported that business conditions became tougher this month, with some clients growing more risk-averse. Factory bosses are bearing the brunt -- with the slowest growth in nearly a decade. Here are the key findings [50.0 is the boundary between growth and contraction]. Flash U.S. Composite Output Index at 50.6 (50.9 in May). 40-month low. Flash U.S. Services Business Activity Index at 50.7 (50.9 in May). 40-month low. Flash U.S. Manufacturing PMI at 50.1 (50.5 in May). 117-month low. Flash U.S. Manufacturing Output Index at 50.2 (50.7 in May). 37-month low. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says the US economy seems to have slowed this quarter, with trade war fears partly to blame: \u201cBusiness activity edged closer to stagnation in June, expanding at the slowest rate since February 2016 and rounding off a second quarter in which the survey data point to the pace of economic expansion slipping to 1.4%. \u201cRecent months have seen a manufacturing-led downturn increasingly infect the service sector. The strong services economy seen earlier in the year has buckled to show barely any expansion in June, recording the second-weakest monthly growth since the global financial crisis. \u201cBusiness optimism has also become more subdued, with sentiment about the year ahead down to a new series low amid intensifying worries about tariffs, geopolitical risk and slower economic growth in the months ahead. The financial markets are subdued today, as the US-Iran tensions weigh on investors\u2019 minds. America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 has dipped in early trading, down 4 points or 0.17%, having hit record highs last night. The tech-focused Nasdaq has shed 0.4%, while the Dow is basically flat. European markets are also quiet, with the FTSE 100 down slightly. Engineering firms and pharmaceuticals companies are among the top fallers. Ken Oleluga of City Index sums up the day: Overtones of the trade conflict are, like the unseasonably wet weather in much of Europe right now, difficult to avoid and likely to put a dampener on things. The impact on the broad STOXX 600 gauge was a 0.3% slip a short while ago Stock markets here were already on the lookout for excuses to consolidate their biggest monthly gain since January A report that U.S. President Donald Trump was close to issuing an executive order to force disclosure of health industry prices echoed in European pharma and health shares The simmering and increasingly unpredictable U.S.-Iran stand-off has also chilled the week\u2019s revived cheer. The latest is that Iran says it refrained from downing an aircraft accompanying the U.S. drone it destroyed earlier this week The news sets oil prices on course for their third session gain of the week and biggest weekly gain of the year The US and Iran are keeping pressure on each other, by revealing how they could have killed scores of each others citizens (but didn\u2019t). General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard\u2019s aerospace force, kicked things off by saying his troops could have shot down a US plane - as well as the spy drone they targeted. He told a news conference \u201cAt the same moment, another spy aircraft called a P8 was flying close to this drone. That aircraft is manned and has around 35 crew members. Well, we could have targeted that plane, it was our right to do so, and yes it was American, but we didn\u2019t do it. We hit the unmanned aircraft.\u201d Donald Trump has now responded, saying America was \u201ccocked and loaded\u201d (?) to retaliate, and could have killed 150 people/ This is keeping the oil price elevated, with Brent crude still over $65/barrel for the first time this month. America\u2019s central bank is widely expected to cut interest rates next month, but that\u2019s not soon enough for one policymaker. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, the only person to vote for a cut on Wednesday, has revealed that he pushed for an \u201cinsurance\u201d cut -- but the other nine members of the FOMC committee disagreed. Bullard cited low inflationary pressures, and signs that growth may be fading, arguing: \u201cIn light of these developments, I believe that lowering the target range for the federal funds rate at this time would provide insurance against further declines in expected inflation and a slowing economy subject to elevated downside risks. Even if a sharper-than-expected slowdown does not materialize, a rate cut would help promote a more rapid return of inflation and inflation expectations to target.\u201d Back in the UK, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has waded back into the Brexit debate -- warning that (brace yourself!), Boris Johnson\u2019s claims about trade aren\u2019t accurate. Carney also warned Facebook that it will not tolerate financial services that violate privacy or aid terrorists, after the much-anticipated launch of the social network\u2019s Libra cryptocurrency. The technology, which is controlled by a body brought together by Facebook, has the potential to reach billions of users worldwide, starting a new global payments infrastructure. Carney said Libra will be closely scrutinised by central banks and regulators across the world, and highlighted concerns around privacy and criminality which he said Facebook would have to address. Speaking to the BBC on Friday, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow a network that comes into place that is a network of criminals and terrorists.\u201d While many of the details of how the currency will work in practice have yet to be made public, privacy advocates have raised concerns about a company which makes money from advertising profiles of users having detailed access to transaction histories. Carney echoed some of these concerns. He said: \u201cPeople need to have the ability to be private and still have access to the [financial] system.\u201d The currency would have to have the explicit consent of users before data is shared with third parties, Carney said. He said: \u201cIt has to be the choice of the individual, and it has to be a choice that is a true choice.....Welcome to the world of finance. There is oversight.\u201d Speaking of oil... a refinery in Philadelphia has caught fire today, following a massive explosion. Here\u2019s some video from the scene: Reuters has the details: A massive fire was burning out of control in Philadelphia at the largest and oldest oil refinery on the U.S. East Coast on Friday morning. The blaze broke out at the Girard Point section of the 335,000-barrels-per-day Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery early in the day, the company said, adding that the fire was still burning. \u201cRefinery emergency response crews and the Philadelphia Fire Department are attempting to bring the fire under control. We are in the process of accounting for all personnel. There were no significant injuries,\u201d a company spokeswoman said. Congresswoman Mary Gay Scanlon, who represents the area, has tweeted about it too: Brent crude has now jumped by almost 10% over the last nine days, since two tankers were attacked in the Gulf of Oman. Back in the markets, the oil price has hit a new three-week high, driven by rising US-Iran tensions and a huge refinery fire. Brent crude has risen by 1.75% today to $65.57, up another dollar, to its highest levels since the end of May. US crude oil is also up, gaining 1% to $57.66 per barrel. Traders are increasingly concerned about the situation in the Middle East, after the New York Times reported that Donald Trump had given initial approval for the US military to launch strikes on Iran in retaliation for Tehran shooting down an American drone, before pulling back at the last minute. Planes were in the air and ships were reportedly in position last night, but no missiles had been fired when word came to stand down on Thursday night. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA explains: Oil prices are steady again on Friday, following another spike on Thursday which accompanied a broader rally in the stock market. Rising tensions in the middle east after Iran shot down a US drone over the Strait of Hormuz will likely have also contributed to the large gains, given that a fifth of all oil production passes through there on a daily basis. Airlines are also concerned - several have decided to avoid flying over the Strait of Hormuz (the \u2018pinch point\u2019 south of Iran, between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman). The latest UK public finances don\u2019t paint a cheery picture. Britain borrowed \u00a35.1bn in May, \u00a31.0bn more than in May 2018 and around a billion pounds more than the City expected. The Office for National Statistics reports that government spending rose by \u00a32.5 billion during the month, outpacing a \u00a31.9bn increase in receipts (income tax revenues rose by \u00a3600m, while national insurance brought in an extra \u00a3700m). In another blow, April\u2019s borrowing was revised up from \u00a35.8bn to \u00a36.8bn. It shows that the government hasn\u2019t made a great start to the current financial year, in which borrowing is already expected to increase compared with 2018-19. Victims of the fraud at Bank of Scotland\u2019s Reading branch aren\u2019t impressed by the FCA\u2019s ruling: Here\u2019s more reaction: HBOS\u2019s chief executive in 2007, Andy Hornby, was appointed as CEO of The Restaurant Group last month, on a pay package of up to \u00a33.9m per year. Here\u2019s our news story on the Bank of Scotland fine: Lloyds Banking Group, which owns HBOS, has welcomed the FCA\u2019s decision - and isn\u2019t disputing the \u00a345.5m fine either. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, Chief Executive of Lloyds Banking Group, says lessons have been learned (while also reminding us that the fraud took place before Lloyds rescued HBOS during the financial crisis): \u201cWe take today\u2019s enforcement notice very seriously. 2007-2009 was a dark period in HBOS\u2019s history, prior to its acquisition by Lloyds Banking Group. I want to apologise once again for the very deep distress caused to the customers affected by the HBOS Reading fraud. The perpetrators of the fraud rightly went to jail for the crimes they committed. The Group\u2019s management team has been committed to putting things right. In 2017, once clear of our obligations not to prejudice the criminal trial, we launched the Customer Review led by Professor Griggs to provide fair compensation for victims. We have now made offers to all customers in the review and 98% of those offers have been accepted.\u201d Incidentally, Lloyds would be facing a \u00a365m fine if it hadn\u2019t co-operated with the regulator. Several of the key figures involved in the Reading fraud have also banned from working in the City. The regulator says: The FCA has also today banned four individuals from working in financial services due to their role in the fraud at HBOS Reading. These are Lynden Scourfield, Mark Dobson, Alison Mills and David Mills. All four were jailed in 2017 over the scandal. Scourfield, a former senior HBOS manager, was sentenced to 11 years and three months in prison after the judge found he had \u201csold your soul, for sex, for luxury trips with and without your wife \u2013 for bling and for swag\u201d. David Mills, Scourfield\u2019s business associate, was jailed for 15 years, while his wife Alison was sentenced to three-and-a-half years. HBos banker Mark Dobson, 56, received four-and-a-half years. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u2019s financial watchdog has fined Bank of Scotland more than \u00a345m over the infamous fraud scandal at its HBOS branch in Reading. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has imposed the penalty on BOS for failing to report its suspicions that fraud may have occurred at the Halifax Bank of Scotland [HBOS] branch. In a stinging ruling, the FCA says BOS \u201cfailed to be open and cooperative\u201d and also failed to disclose information to the regulator. Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said: \u201cBank of Scotland failed to alert the regulator and the police about suspicions of fraud at its Reading branch when those suspicions first became apparent. BOS\u2019s failures caused delays to the investigations by both the FCA and Thames Valley Police. There is no evidence anyone properly addressed their mind to this matter or its consequences. The result risked substantial prejudice to the interests of justice, delaying scrutiny of the fraud by regulators, the start of criminal proceedings as well as the payment of compensation to customers.\u201d The FCA says that BOS identified suspicious conduct in the IAR team in early 2007, but did not alert regulators until 2009. That delay meant that it took much longer for the criminal misconduct at Reading to be discovered. Hundreds of small businesses lost money - and some even lost their homes -- due to the scam run by a group of bankers at Reading, who illegally took some \u00a3245m from the customers to spend on lavish parties, superyachts and sex parties. The FAC explains: The Director of the Impaired Asset Team at the Reading branch, Lynden Scourfield, had been sanctioning limits and additional lending facilities beyond the scope of his authority undetected for at least three years. BOS knew by 3 May 2007 that the impact of these breaches would result in substantial losses to BOS. Over the next two years, on numerous occasions, BOS failed properly to understand and appreciate the significance of the information that it had identified despite clear warning signs that fraud might have occurred. There was insufficient challenge, scrutiny or inquiry across the organisation and from top to bottom. At no stage was all the information that had been identified properly considered. There is also no evidence anyone realised, or even thought about, the consequences of not informing the authorities, including how that might delay proper scrutiny of the misconduct and prejudice the interests of justice. More to follow.... Data firm Markit reports that the eurozone private sector is growing at its fastest rate in seven months, lead by a pick-up of growth in France. Financial services firm Canaccord Genuity has slashed its price target for IQE\u2019s shares to 85p, from 130p. Its analysts suspect that IQE is suffering from weak demand for iPhones: \u201cAfter our Apple analyst\u2019s recent forecast cuts and recent commentary from Broadcom, it is also possible that IQE might be seeing a more muted iPhone supply chain ramp in 2H.\u201d IQE\u2019s shares, meanwhile, are still languishing at around 44p, some distance from Canaccord\u2019s new price target (and miles below the old one...). IQE\u2019s warning comes a week after US chipmaking giant Broadcom missed sales forecasts, and slashed its revenue forecasts. Broadcom\u2019s CEO warned that the Huawei export ban was creating \u201ceconomic and political uncertainty and reducing visibility for global customers\u201d - a point IQE has echoed today. Here\u2019s Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx on IQE\u2019s gloom: Though the European indices were reluctant to get out of bed, that\u2019s not to say there weren\u2019t any big moves on Friday morning. Chipmaker IQE was forced to slash its revenue forecasts for the year by as much as \u00a335 million as it sounded the alarm over the impact the blacklisting of Huawei by the US is having on the tech sector. Investors heard that alarm and ran for the hills, causing the stock to sink as much as 40% after the bell, leaving it at a 28-month nadir of 44.58p. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets sums up the IQE news: IQE\u2019s warning has rattled the entire European semiconductor sector this morning. Siltronic are down 2%, Infineon are down 1%, AMS have lost 4%, Dialog are down 1.5%, and STMicro has lost 1.4% (prices via Refinitiv). Investors are (sensibly) concluding that IQE won\u2019t be the only company suffering from delayed orders and cautious customers, following the sanctions on Huawei last month. IQE\u2019s shares have plunged by more than a third in early trading, as City traders react to its profits warning: They\u2019ve fallen by 37% to 44p (having hit a low of 41.3p), the lowest levels since March 2017, in a really alarming tumble. IQE has also slashed its profit forecasts for this year, telling investors: Given the reduction in expected revenues, IQE expects to remain profitable in 2019 but with Adjusted Operating Profit margin significantly below the previous guidance of over 10%. Whilst the company\u2019s cost base is largely fixed in the short-term, IQE is taking steps to reduce costs and avoid non-critical capital expenditure. This includes the acceleration of the assessment of strategic projects to optimise the company\u2019s global manufacturing footprint. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. America\u2019s decision to blacklist China\u2019s Huawei five weeks ago is having a clear damaging effect on the global tech industry. So warns Cardiff-based chipmaker IQE in a profits warning this morning. IQE has slashed its sales forecasts for this year, pinning the blame firmly on the White House for putting Huawei on its Entity List - preventing US companies dealing with the Chinese mobile giant. In a trading update to the City, IQE warned that it is operating in an \u201cincreasingly cautious marketplace\u201d, with several customers recently cutting their forecast orders. IQE may not be a household name, but its advanced silicon and compound semiconductor materials are used around the world. Its wafers are used in more than two billion wireless chips and more than one billion optoelectronic chips each year -- from smartphones and mobile base stations to satellites, cars and aircraft, and solar panels. It had previously expected to make revenues of \u00a3175m this year -- now it only expects to post \u00a3140m to \u00a3160m. Chief executive Dr Drew Nelson, chief executive of IQE, says America\u2019s crackdown on Huawei is having serious consequences: \u201cThese are unprecedented times for the global semiconductor industry as geo-political conditions affect interconnected global supply chains. It is now clear that the impact of Huawei\u2019s addition to the US Bureau of Industry and Security\u2019s Entity List is having far-reaching and long-lasting impacts on global supply chains. This is a matter outside of IQE\u2019s control but we have responded swiftly to leverage our breadth of relationships and to pursue new sales opportunities. Reaction to follow.... Also coming up today Oil is hovering near three-week highs, after Iran shot down a US drone yesterday - sparking reports that president Trump gave initial approval for the military to launch retaliatory strikes. Data firm Markit will release its flash surveys of purchasing managers in the eurozone and the US, which will show if manufacturers are still struggling from the US-China trade war. Plus, new UK public finance figures will show how much Britain borrowed to balance the books last month. Proactive Investors explains: In April, UK government borrowing came in at \u00a35.8bn, starting off the 2019-20 financial year with nearly the same deficit level as a year ago. In the 2018-2019 financial year, borrowing came to \u00a323.5bn, slightly worse than the \u00a322.8bn that the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted the March spring statement. For May, economists expect borrowing to fall to \u00a34.2bn. The agenda 9am BST: Flash eurozone PMI report for June 9.30am BST: UK public finances for May 2.45pm BST: Flash US PMI report for June",

I talked through your problem with Alexandra de Rementeria, a child psychotherapist (<a href=\"https://childpsychotherapy.org.uk/fat\" title=\"c\">childpsychotherapy.org.uk</a>). She explained that your daughter has \u201ccome up against two of life\u2019s hardest lessons: that we are mortal and that we can be usurped, in quick succession.

De Rementeria explained that children get their confidence to do things, such as walking down the stairs, by observing adults do it. But now that confidence has been shattered. Again, this is normal. It shows she feels safe to show you she is scared and expects you will help her with it \u2013 which you are doing.

We can all regress when afraid.</p> <p>As far as the new baby is concerned, De Rementeria said it would be useful (when the time comes) to \u201cmake room for your daughter to acknowledge the full range of her feelings about her brother\u201d. If you say something like: \u201cHe\u2019s lovely, but can be rather noisy/demanding, can\u2019t he?\u201d it can teach your daughter that she may have conflicting feelings about the baby: that she may love him but also feel intensely annoyed or jealous. This is another useful lesson: that we can have feelings about a person that seem like opposites. De Rementeria also said that you may need to reassure your daughter that thoughts, even negative ones, cannot make things happen, which is something that children often fear. Include her wherever you can, and also try to spend one-on-one time with her, even if it is just a few minutes at bedtime.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/24/marrying-first-love-curious-about-bdsm-annalisa-barbieri\">I\u2019m marrying my first love, but am curious about BDSM</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You sound very caring and also, if I may say, a bit of an overthinker (me, too).

It shows she feels safe to show you she is scared and expects you will help her with it \u2013 which you are doing. Be patient and, little by little, her confidence will come back. You are doing all the right things, listening to her and reassuring her. But, in the short term, you may need to break some things down for her. Try putting just a few inches of water in the bath, or sitting on the stairs when you go down. But only for a while. We can all regress when afraid. As far as the new baby is concerned, De Rementeria said it would be useful (when the time comes) to \u201cmake room for your daughter to acknowledge the full range of her feelings about her brother\u201d. If you say something like: \u201cHe\u2019s lovely, but can be rather noisy/demanding, can\u2019t he?\u201d it can teach your daughter that she may have conflicting feelings about the baby: that she may love him but also feel intensely annoyed or jealous. This is another useful lesson: that we can have feelings about a person that seem like opposites. De Rementeria also said that you may need to reassure your daughter that thoughts, even negative ones, cannot make things happen, which is something that children often fear. Include her wherever you can, and also try to spend one-on-one time with her, even if it is just a few minutes at bedtime. You sound very caring and also, if I may say, a bit of an overthinker (me, too). De Rementeria said something that may help you, as it did me. She said a life without stress isn\u2019t desirable for children because \u201cwe need some stress to develop\u201d. This, she explained, is how we learn what we are capable of and who we are. Allow your little girl space to talk, and answer her questions. Respond to what she asks (no more) factually and simply. Saying: \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again\u201d may not appease her; you may need to run through what to do if someone else has a fall, as her grandmother did (or whatever her worry is). Finally, do not be afraid of her fear. De Rementeria says: \u201cWorry that does not overwhelm is not harmful in itself, and learning that worry can be managed is a very important and helpful lesson.\u201d \u2022 Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

      "bodyText": "This week\u2019s puzzle marks the opening round of a national competition in which Guardian readers have traditionally performed strongly over many years. You have to work out how White, playing as usual up the board in the diagram, can force checkmate in two moves, however Black defends. The puzzle is the first stage of the Winton British Chess Solving Championship, organised by the British Chess Problem Society and open to any British resident. Entry is free and the prize fund will be at least \u00a31,225. If you would like to take part, simply send White\u2019s first move to Nigel Dennis, Boundary House, 230 Greys Road, Henley-on-Thames, Oxon RG9 1QY or by email to winton@theproblemist.org. Either way, please include your name and home address and mark your entry \u201cGuardian\u201d. If you will be under 18 on the closing date, 31 July, please also give your date of birth. After the closing date all solvers will receive the answer and those who get it right will also be sent a postal round of eight problems, with plenty of time for solving. The best 25-30 entries from the postal round, plus the best juniors, will qualify for the one-day final to be staged in February 2020. The winner there will qualify for the 2020 world solving championship. As usual the starter problem is tricky with all the action in the top half of the board. There are several plausible near-misses and White\u2019s first move is not obvious. Remember that routine checks and captures rarely work in composed problems. It is easy to make an error, so review your answer before sending it. Good luck to all Guardian entrants. Just 12 days after the world champion, Magnus Carlsen, scored his seventh straight tournament victory at Stavanger, he will be in action again in another very tough event. The Zagreb, Croatia stage of the Grand Chess Tour, starts at 3.30pm BST on 26 June. Most GCT events have 10 Tour players, but Zagreb has all 12, of whom nine currently rank in the world top 10 in the live ratings. The city itself is steeped in chess history, hosting Zagreb 1955 won by Vasily Smyslov, Zagreb 1959 the middle leg of the candidates won by Mikhail Tal, and Zagreb 1970 won by Bobby Fischer. Playing and winning seven tournaments in six months is a fierce schedule by the standards of previous world champions, so there is a risk of Carlsen running short of stamina in Zagreb. He was strong at Wijk aan Zee, Shamkir, Grenke and Abidjan but less convincing in his last two tournaments at Lindores Abbey and Stavanger, where he described his own performance as \u201cmediocre\u201d despite his three-point winning margin. On the plus side, Carlsen\u2019s current live rating of 2872.5, losing just 2.5 rating points in Norway, is within sight of his own all-time rating records of 2882 (official monthly) and 2889 (daily) and even of a round 2900, landmarks which he calls \u201cat least a half-attainable dream\u201d. England\u2019s current No 1 and No 2, Gawain Jones and David Howell, are both competing in the $40,000 St Louis Summer Classic, a highly rated six-GM double round event.

Trump said in a series of morning tweets that he decided late on Thursday that the death toll was not a proportionate response to the Iranian shooting down of a US spy drone off the Iranian coast 24 hours earlier. The tweets revealed how close the world may have come to a Middle East conflagration, and raised questions over why the commander-in-chief was told so late in the planning of a military operation about the predicted loss of life involved. It would be routine for a president to be informed of the likely civilian casualties when the options are first presented.

      "body": "<p>The idea of generational conflict has come to prominence in the last few years, but few seem to agree on its shape and causes. Public discussion of young people, for instance, is so contradictory that they can appear to the casual viewer like a kind of Schr\u00f6dinger generation; simultaneously both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/28/blame-parents-for-snowflake-millennials-says-author-fay-weldon\" title=\"\">Generation Snowflake</a>, the most over-entitled and coddled generation in history, and Generation Screwed, the most disadvantaged age cohort in modern times. Advocates for the latter can point to trends such as the collapse in home ownership among the under-35s. Proponents of the former argue that young people can\u2019t afford a house because they are irresponsible and frivolous, spending their money on avocado toast rather than saving for a deposit.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The current generational divergence is a consequence of the power the financial sector has held for the past 35 years</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2019/jun/20/young-adults-have-less-to-spend-on-non-essentials-study-says\" title=\"\">report from the Resolution Foundation</a>, described as an intergenerational audit, has provided the necessary data to decide which narrative is true. The findings are conclusive. The incomes of young people have been severely constrained, while housing costs have risen steeply compared with previous generations at a similar stage of life.</p> <p>The report also finds that, far from being spendthrifts, people under 30 are spending less on non-housing consumption than the same age group in 2001. Indeed, out of that reduced sum they are spending more than their predecessors on essentials and less on luxuries. Yet, despite this irrefutable debunking, the Generation Snowflake stories won\u2019t disappear, and play too important a role in obscuring the true causes of generational tension.</p> <p>The Resolution Foundation insists that it has no wish to pit generations against each other. The problem is, when we look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/17/saturday-uk-remain-parliament-force-second-referendum\" title=\"\">voting patterns and political opinion</a>, it\u2019s apparent that the generations are already in conflict. Over the last five to six years a yawning political generation gap has opened up with the young moving left and the old moving right. While sizeable minorities still buck the trend, the scale of shift is unprecedented. Even more curiously, it\u2019s a phenomenon that has arisen at the same time across several different countries, most notably the UK and US. As we know from inequalities around gender and race, you can\u2019t deal with divisions by simply denying their existence. Instead, they must be recognised and their causes identified if they are to be tackled.</p> <p>Thinking about the situation has made me question the traditional way we talk about generations, in which a new one simply comes along every 20 years. In fact, generational differences aren\u2019t often important factors in political and social life. They only become prominent when a specific event, a period of sudden, ruptural change, produces very different generational perspectives. In my book, Generation Left, I argue that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/29/bernanke-paulson-and-geithner-revisiting-the-2008-financial-crisis\" title=\"\">financial crisis of 2008</a> fits the bill as an explanation for our current generational political divide.</p> <p>In fact, we can see the current divergence as a consequence of the huge power the financial sector has held over the rest of society for the past 35 years. In the UK, this dominance dates to Thatcherite deregulation of finance in the mid-1980s. Alongside the sell-off of social housing this produced a dramatic rise in house prices in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The Generation Snowflake myth persists, despite all the evidence to the contrary, because it acts as an alibi for those old enough to benefit from this rise but who now mistake their generation\u2019s good fortune for the results of their individual character.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/21/are-young-people-growing-horns-because-of-mobile-phones-not-so-fast\">Are young people growing horns because of mobile phones? Not so fast | Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The crash of 2008 should have put paid to this illusion, but governments responded not by punishing the financial sector but by giving it everything it wanted. The ocean of free money that countries threw at finance, in the form of bailouts, quantitative easing, etc has largely gone into asset price inflation. As asset ownership (primarily housing but also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/16/auto-enrol-pension-below-living-wage\" title=\"\">pensions</a> invested in stocks) is so divided along generational lines, many people among the older cohorts have seen their material interests met, although almost by proxy. As a result, they are increasingly seeing their interests as aligned to the performance of the financial sector. The interests of younger cohorts, on the other hand, are aligned in a different direction, dependent on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/27/one-in-five-young-people-paid-less-than-minimum-wage-study\" title=\"\">levels of wages</a> and social spending.</p> <p>The last 10 years have been catastrophic in this regard. Indeed, the 2010s will be the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-39966615\" title=\"\">worst decade for wage growth</a> in over 200 years.

      "bodyText": "The idea of generational conflict has come to prominence in the last few years, but few seem to agree on its shape and causes. Public discussion of young people, for instance, is so contradictory that they can appear to the casual viewer like a kind of Schr\u00f6dinger generation; simultaneously both Generation Snowflake, the most over-entitled and coddled generation in history, and Generation Screwed, the most disadvantaged age cohort in modern times. Advocates for the latter can point to trends such as the collapse in home ownership among the under-35s. Proponents of the former argue that young people can\u2019t afford a house because they are irresponsible and frivolous, spending their money on avocado toast rather than saving for a deposit. A new report from the Resolution Foundation, described as an intergenerational audit, has provided the necessary data to decide which narrative is true. The findings are conclusive. The incomes of young people have been severely constrained, while housing costs have risen steeply compared with previous generations at a similar stage of life. The report also finds that, far from being spendthrifts, people under 30 are spending less on non-housing consumption than the same age group in 2001. Indeed, out of that reduced sum they are spending more than their predecessors on essentials and less on luxuries. Yet, despite this irrefutable debunking, the Generation Snowflake stories won\u2019t disappear, and play too important a role in obscuring the true causes of generational tension. The Resolution Foundation insists that it has no wish to pit generations against each other. The problem is, when we look at voting patterns and political opinion, it\u2019s apparent that the generations are already in conflict. Over the last five to six years a yawning political generation gap has opened up with the young moving left and the old moving right. While sizeable minorities still buck the trend, the scale of shift is unprecedented. Even more curiously, it\u2019s a phenomenon that has arisen at the same time across several different countries, most notably the UK and US. As we know from inequalities around gender and race, you can\u2019t deal with divisions by simply denying their existence. Instead, they must be recognised and their causes identified if they are to be tackled. Thinking about the situation has made me question the traditional way we talk about generations, in which a new one simply comes along every 20 years. In fact, generational differences aren\u2019t often important factors in political and social life. They only become prominent when a specific event, a period of sudden, ruptural change, produces very different generational perspectives. In my book, Generation Left, I argue that the financial crisis of 2008 fits the bill as an explanation for our current generational political divide. In fact, we can see the current divergence as a consequence of the huge power the financial sector has held over the rest of society for the past 35 years. In the UK, this dominance dates to Thatcherite deregulation of finance in the mid-1980s. Alongside the sell-off of social housing this produced a dramatic rise in house prices in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The Generation Snowflake myth persists, despite all the evidence to the contrary, because it acts as an alibi for those old enough to benefit from this rise but who now mistake their generation\u2019s good fortune for the results of their individual character. The crash of 2008 should have put paid to this illusion, but governments responded not by punishing the financial sector but by giving it everything it wanted. The ocean of free money that countries threw at finance, in the form of bailouts, quantitative easing, etc has largely gone into asset price inflation. As asset ownership (primarily housing but also pensions invested in stocks) is so divided along generational lines, many people among the older cohorts have seen their material interests met, although almost by proxy. As a result, they are increasingly seeing their interests as aligned to the performance of the financial sector. The interests of younger cohorts, on the other hand, are aligned in a different direction, dependent on the levels of wages and social spending. The last 10 years have been catastrophic in this regard. Indeed, the 2010s will be the worst decade for wage growth in over 200 years. Is it any wonder that the young are more open to left political projects, such as those of Jeremy Corbyn, Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, promising to rein in finance and rebalance power in favour of workers? As Generation Screwed turns into Generation Left, it\u2019s likely that the right will hold ever tighter to the myth of the snowflake despite the mountain of countervailing evidence. \u2022 Keir Milburn is a lecturer in political economy and organisation at the University of Leicester, and author of Generation Left",

Last summer the Church of St Michael in Estella, Navarre, became the latest holy place to fall victim to some well-intentioned but ill-advised brushwork. A local artist\u2019s efforts to freshen up the walnut wood statue did not go entirely according to plan. The saint was left with a rosy pink face and a strikingly bold suit of armour that reminded some of Tintin and others of a Playmobil figure. It also elicited comparisons with the infamous \u201cMonkey Christ\u201d restoration six years earlier. Now, however, the statue has been returned as closely to its pre-2018 state as possible. Carlos Mart\u00ednez \u00c1lava, the head of the Navarre government\u2019s historic heritage department, said the latest intervention had finished two weeks ago and the plan was to get the statue to Estella in the next few days. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long process because we had to do preliminary tests and take samples to see how we could go about cleaning it and to determine which would be the best materials and methods,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, the statue has the same colours it had before last year\u2019s extremely unfortunate intervention.

      "body": "<p>Fast fashion \u2013 the rapid system of trend-driven, low-cost clothing manufacture beloved by UK consumers \u2013 is on the rampage. We crossed a worrying line in 2014, scaling up garment production to 100bn pieces of new clothing a year. These are clothes, made from virgin resources, increasingly plastic, pushed out into the world with little thought as to where they will end up. Without rapid reform, the fashion industry \u2013 of which fast fashion is the dominant player \u2013 could be responsible for <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/environment/fashion-industry-may-use-quarter-of-world-s-carbon-budget-by-2050-61183\">a quarter of the Earth\u2019s carbon budget by 2050</a>. This threat to the planet has, not surprisingly, attracted the attention of climate protesters. Extinction Rebellion picketed London fashion week for the first time in February.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s contribution is enormous. Not only did we invent fast fashion, but our fashion consumers are among the most voracious in the world.

UK consumers sent 300,000 tonnes of textiles to be burned or dumped in landfill in 2018.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/18/fast-fashion-environmental-audit-committee-polluting-industry\">Fast fashion is eating up the planet \u2013 and this feeble government enables it | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The drive to fast fashion began from the moment Hargreaves of Oswaldtwistle built the first spinning jenny to spin cotton faster. By the 1770s the mill owner Richard Arkwright\u2019s version could spin 20 to 30 warp threads at once. With faster material production came more ready to wear clothes. By the early 1800s the well-heeled were writing to newspapers complaining that their housemaids were asking for higher wages to fund dress purchases. The poor maids were likely to have been trying to fill the same void in their lives that we do today, but we have fallen hook, line and sinker.</p> <p>To take the heat out of dressing we\u2019re often told to think of our grandparents and the make-do-and-mend spirit of the 1940s. In reality though this period, when the purchase of civilian clothing was restricted to free up materials and shipping space for the war effort, is an anomaly. These forebears were perhaps the only ones who had a truly sustainable approach to fashion.</p> <p>Ultimately fashion sped up not just the fibre production but also garment making. By the 1990s the UK\u2019s industry had been almost entirely exported to some of the lowest wage economies on earth. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jun/11/forget-fast-fashion-slow-style-pioneers-on-the-clothes-theyve-worn-for-decades\">Forget fast fashion: slow style pioneers on the clothes they've worn for decades</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If there is one point where we should have stopped the madness it was the aftermath of the morning of 23 April 2013, when the Rana Plaza complex in Bangladesh collapsed. More than 1,300 people, mostly young female garment workers making for western brands, died in the disaster, which exposed the true cost of our fast fashion habit. The industry, however, was allowed to mark its own homework, taking control of a limited programme of reform that would retrofit factories to bring them up to minimum safety requirements.

      "bodyText": "Fast fashion \u2013 the rapid system of trend-driven, low-cost clothing manufacture beloved by UK consumers \u2013 is on the rampage. We crossed a worrying line in 2014, scaling up garment production to 100bn pieces of new clothing a year. These are clothes, made from virgin resources, increasingly plastic, pushed out into the world with little thought as to where they will end up. Without rapid reform, the fashion industry \u2013 of which fast fashion is the dominant player \u2013 could be responsible for a quarter of the Earth\u2019s carbon budget by 2050. This threat to the planet has, not surprisingly, attracted the attention of climate protesters. Extinction Rebellion picketed London fashion week for the first time in February. The UK\u2019s contribution is enormous. Not only did we invent fast fashion, but our fashion consumers are among the most voracious in the world. One in three young women, the biggest segment of consumers, consider garments worn once or twice to be old. UK consumers sent 300,000 tonnes of textiles to be burned or dumped in landfill in 2018. The drive to fast fashion began from the moment Hargreaves of Oswaldtwistle built the first spinning jenny to spin cotton faster. By the 1770s the mill owner Richard Arkwright\u2019s version could spin 20 to 30 warp threads at once. With faster material production came more ready to wear clothes. By the early 1800s the well-heeled were writing to newspapers complaining that their housemaids were asking for higher wages to fund dress purchases. The poor maids were likely to have been trying to fill the same void in their lives that we do today, but we have fallen hook, line and sinker. To take the heat out of dressing we\u2019re often told to think of our grandparents and the make-do-and-mend spirit of the 1940s. In reality though this period, when the purchase of civilian clothing was restricted to free up materials and shipping space for the war effort, is an anomaly. These forebears were perhaps the only ones who had a truly sustainable approach to fashion. Ultimately fashion sped up not just the fibre production but also garment making. By the 1990s the UK\u2019s industry had been almost entirely exported to some of the lowest wage economies on earth. If there is one point where we should have stopped the madness it was the aftermath of the morning of 23 April 2013, when the Rana Plaza complex in Bangladesh collapsed. More than 1,300 people, mostly young female garment workers making for western brands, died in the disaster, which exposed the true cost of our fast fashion habit. The industry, however, was allowed to mark its own homework, taking control of a limited programme of reform that would retrofit factories to bring them up to minimum safety requirements. Not one brand moved to change the system. Instead, fast fashion pushed onwards and upwards. Brands sought cheaper more compliant manufacturers in new territories, exporting the same system for production that had led to Rana Plaza to Ethiopia, the lowest-wage economy on Earth. A recent study by NYU Stern into fast fashion production at the Hawassa industrial park found workers barely covering the cost of food and transport. This week the Manchester-based Missguided.com launched a \u00a31 plastic polymer bikini. It serves as a reminder that the new crop of online retailers make high street fast fashion look as slow as a diplodocus. These brands are social media and Snapchat tacticians with a direct line to very young people. Digital natives \u201cswipe up\u201d and instantly purchase an outfit worn by someone they follow.

Cave is \u201cacting on the intuition that something of value\u201d can come from doing it live. He was worried about <a href=\"https://normanlamont.com/nick-cave-the-red-hand-files/\">something he wrote</a>: that social media undermines \u201cboth nuance and connectivity\u201d. Here he is trying to deepen the connection, a word he returns to again and again. He comes on suited and booted, immaculate, the knowing elder statesman, the ex-junkie, the writer of murder ballads and the tenderest love songs, the storm-bringer who will somehow shelter us and reassure us that there can be, in that quaint old-fashioned way, \u201ca dialogue\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He is part standup, part grief counsellor, part old-time preacher man</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I have never seen anything like it. Cave is mordantly funny. What of that thing he said about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/toriamos\">Tori Amos</a> sequining her nether regions? \u201cI said it because interviews are boring,\u201d he replies, his ego erecting and softening in front of us. He is part standup, part grief counsellor, part old-time preacher man \u2013 and an entirely stupendous performer, pacing and communing with the audience, just as he has done at recent ecstatic gigs. He tells us he is \u201cfront-row man\u201d, needing to look into the crowd\u2019s eyes to locate what he needs, to find energy to spiral on \u2013 the opposite of his good mate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bono\">Bono</a>, who is \u201cback-row man\u201d, reaching for the back of the crowd.</p> <p>He prowls as he talks about how atheism is bad for songwriting: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether God exists or not \u2013 we must reach as if he does.\u201d He tells a young man who is heartbroken that it will pass. A songwriter who is not successful is advised to persevere. But the audience is tentative and no one asks about his son, Arthur, who died in 2015 at the age of 15 \u2013 until Cave himself starts talking about him. About what grief is and what it does. I have sat in bereavement counselling and group therapy myself, and it is rare to hear someone talk so directly about trauma, about what smashes us apart and what puts us back together.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/16/conversations-with-nick-cave-review-wales-millennium-centre\">Conversations With Nick Cave review \u2013 intimate audience with a rock'n'roll rebel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He plays <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/16/marc-bolan-cosmic-dancer-review-bbc4-documentary\">Marc Bolan</a>\u2019s Cosmic Dancer (\u201cBolan was inventing a new language\u201d) as well as The Mercy Seat, Stagger Lee and Into My Arms. Who should cover his songs? \u201cElvis.\u201d He does, however, bow down before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/leonard-cohen\">Leonard Cohen</a>, though it is what Cave says about loss and creation that is astonishing. He has no time for niceties but a lot of time for kindness. Mostly, we live in denial of grief, with the stupid word \u201cclosure\u201d bandied round often. I hear the babble about the stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. It is the categorisation of torture. What is so exceptional is to hear someone talk about being so irrevocably changed by it.</p> <p>The death of his son has pushed Cave further into fragility, though he is as hard as nails in some ways and more in control of his audience than ever. But he is telling us what the grieving need: compassion not empathy, since empathy means you may become a repository of despair. Compassion means being beside someone, being solid, making tea. He speaks of talking to his son, who is always present. He calls to his audience to bring into being something greater than all of them.</p> <p>Only a few times in my life have I heard people express grief in such a straightforward way. Once, in a hospital ward where my child was severely ill, two of the eight children on the ward died. The medics gathered us together, the professional distance gone as a hole had appeared in the universe. Children should not die.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fcc754e41aaa339e8d1cce0db370c5a9df5c8cf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcc754e41aaa339e8d1cce0db370c5a9df5c8cf0/13_618_3184_1910/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Compelling \u2026 Cave performing in Barcelona last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Compelling \u2026 Cave performing in Barcelona last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xavi Torrent/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then, when my mother was dying, a nurse putting balm on her lips told me we live in parallel worlds in which we are with people who will not be there in the future, but we must live as if they will be. This is how we talk to the dying. Indeed, it is how we talk to the living.</p> <p>Cave returns to Cohen, who wrote that beautiful letter to his lover <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/07/so-long-marianne-leonard-cohen-writes-to-muse-just-before-her-death\">Marianne Ihlen</a> when she was dying:<strong> </strong>\u201cKnow that I am so close behind you that if you stretch out your hand, I think you can reach mine.\u201d Cave tells us that, although he had never met him, Cohen emailed him when Arthur died. Agony cannot be ringfenced or denied.</p> <p>Now Cave performs a kind of public service, acknowledging that bereavement changes us, that no one is shielded from profound pain by fame or talent. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/cslewis\">CS Lewis</a> said: \u201cNo one ever told me that grief felt so like fear.\u201d Cave\u2019s hand sometimes flutters when he talks, as if out of fear. But there is something so raw, so real, in his words and music, and in what he needs to tell us. So unafraid. It is a remarkable affirmation of life. No less, no more.</p> <p>\u2022 Conversations With Nick Cave is at <a href=\"https://trch.co.uk/whats-on/nick-cave-2019/\">Royal Concert Hall, Nottingham</a>, on 25 June.

He is part standup, part grief counsellor, part old-time preacher man \u2013 and an entirely stupendous performer, pacing and communing with the audience, just as he has done at recent ecstatic gigs. He tells us he is \u201cfront-row man\u201d, needing to look into the crowd\u2019s eyes to locate what he needs, to find energy to spiral on \u2013 the opposite of his good mate Bono, who is \u201cback-row man\u201d, reaching for the back of the crowd. He prowls as he talks about how atheism is bad for songwriting: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether God exists or not \u2013 we must reach as if he does.\u201d He tells a young man who is heartbroken that it will pass. A songwriter who is not successful is advised to persevere. But the audience is tentative and no one asks about his son, Arthur, who died in 2015 at the age of 15 \u2013 until Cave himself starts talking about him. About what grief is and what it does. I have sat in bereavement counselling and group therapy myself, and it is rare to hear someone talk so directly about trauma, about what smashes us apart and what puts us back together. He plays Marc Bolan\u2019s Cosmic Dancer (\u201cBolan was inventing a new language\u201d) as well as The Mercy Seat, Stagger Lee and Into My Arms. Who should cover his songs? \u201cElvis.\u201d He does, however, bow down before Leonard Cohen, though it is what Cave says about loss and creation that is astonishing. He has no time for niceties but a lot of time for kindness. Mostly, we live in denial of grief, with the stupid word \u201cclosure\u201d bandied round often. I hear the babble about the stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. It is the categorisation of torture. What is so exceptional is to hear someone talk about being so irrevocably changed by it. The death of his son has pushed Cave further into fragility, though he is as hard as nails in some ways and more in control of his audience than ever. But he is telling us what the grieving need: compassion not empathy, since empathy means you may become a repository of despair. Compassion means being beside someone, being solid, making tea. He speaks of talking to his son, who is always present. He calls to his audience to bring into being something greater than all of them. Only a few times in my life have I heard people express grief in such a straightforward way. Once, in a hospital ward where my child was severely ill, two of the eight children on the ward died. The medics gathered us together, the professional distance gone as a hole had appeared in the universe. Children should not die. Then, when my mother was dying, a nurse putting balm on her lips told me we live in parallel worlds in which we are with people who will not be there in the future, but we must live as if they will be. This is how we talk to the dying. Indeed, it is how we talk to the living. Cave returns to Cohen, who wrote that beautiful letter to his lover Marianne Ihlen when she was dying: \u201cKnow that I am so close behind you that if you stretch out your hand, I think you can reach mine.\u201d Cave tells us that, although he had never met him, Cohen emailed him when Arthur died. Agony cannot be ringfenced or denied. Now Cave performs a kind of public service, acknowledging that bereavement changes us, that no one is shielded from profound pain by fame or talent. CS Lewis said: \u201cNo one ever told me that grief felt so like fear.\u201d Cave\u2019s hand sometimes flutters when he talks, as if out of fear. But there is something so raw, so real, in his words and music, and in what he needs to tell us. So unafraid. It is a remarkable affirmation of life. No less, no more. \u2022 Conversations With Nick Cave is at Royal Concert Hall, Nottingham, on 25 June. Then touring.",

      "bodyText": "The city of Brussels has cancelled plans to dress its famous Manneken Pis statue in a Michael Jackson costume on the 10th anniversary of the controversial star\u2019s death following the latest allegations against him. An event to be attended by senior city officials during which the municipality would have formally received a miniature sequined jacket, black trousers, trilby hat and single white glove has also been dropped. The 60cm (24in) Manneken Pis \u2013 \u201cpeeing boy\u201d in the local dialect \u2013 was scheduled to be dressed as Jackson on 25 June on the initiative of a Belgian fan club, a decision that had been approved by the city\u2019s previous administration. The costume show, and other festivities due to take place over a six-hour event at Brussels city hall, was to be the culmination of a series of tributes leading up to the 10th anniversary of Jackson\u2019s death in 2009, at the age of 50. The municipality said the cancellation \u2013 approved unanimously by councillors \u2013 was made in response to the Leaving Neverland documentary, which revived claims that Jackson had sexually abused children. Delphine Houba, a city of Brussels councillor responsible for culture and tourism, said that as the costume had already been made the clothing would be \u201cadministratively received\u201d but that \u201cfrom then on, we will not dress [him]\u201d. Neither will the items be put on public display in the museum of the Manneken Pis, where 1,025 pieces of clothing tailored to fit the statue are held. The Leaving Neverland documentary told the story of two men who say they were groomed and sexually abused as boys by Jackson. Following its showing at the Sundance festival in January and its broadcast on TV in March there was widespread condemnation of the singer, whose music was dropped by radio stations around the world. The creators of The Simpsons also shelved an episodes featuring Jackson\u2019s voice. The Mannekin Pis statue is dressed about 130 times a year in various outfits to mark special occasions or events, such as St Patrick\u2019s Day, Christmas or the start of the Olympics. The city was said to have been particularly concerned about the possibility of a backlash from the public over the Jackson outfit during its hosting of the Grand D\u00e9part of the Tour de France, when the city will be flooded by tourists. A spokesman said: \u201cThe city council of Brussels has not been insensitive to the documentary and has chosen to adopt a cautious position.\u201d Jermaine Jackson, the singer\u2019s older brother, led the family\u2019s denunciation of the HBO documentary, which he claimed had uncritically reported the claims of the two men featured in the programme.",

You\u2019d be justified in thinking that sherry was only a Christmas drink, but as anyone who\u2019s ever been to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/feb/21/jerez-andalucia-guide-what-to-see-hotels-restaurants-bars\" title=\"\">Jerez</a> (a fabulous city) will know (or indeed anywhere in the so-called \u201csherry triangle\u201d at the tip of southern Spain), it\u2019s ace in summer, too. Why, we wine writers wail, don\u2019t people love it more? Especially given that the quality is consistently high, and prices, particularly of own-label sherries, are ridiculously low?</p> <p>The main reason, I think, is because it\u2019s dry \u2013 often painfully so. And it\u2019s not all that fruity, either. Why would you drink a glass of fino (generally a small glass, so it doesn\u2019t go very far), for instance, when you could have a glass of ros\u00e9 or a G&amp;T instead? In its 1960s heyday, sherry was more often than not sweet, and the competition from other drinks was derisory. <a href=\"https://www.bluenun.wine/agecheck/index\" title=\"\">Blue Nun</a> or sherry? Sherry won hands down.</p> <p>The other reason, given that the drinks industry thrives on innovation, could be that nothing much happens in the sherry world. True, there are the new(ish) <em>en rama</em> sherries (limited-edition, unfiltered bottlings), but they\u2019re even more challenging to drink. Otherwise, it all chugs on much as it has done for the past 30 years.</p> <p>So what\u2019s to be done? Well, at this time of year, focus on the lighter styles such as fino and manzanilla for a start. In fact, I\u2019d say take a leaf out of the locals\u2019 book and drink a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/may/10/cocktail-of-the-week-olly-smiths-rebujito\" title=\"\">rebujito</a>, which is fino mixed with lemonade (traditionally Sprite or 7-Up, but you may want to upgrade to a premium mixer). Sherry and tonic, jocularly known as a She &amp; T, is also delicious.</p> <p>And if you\u2019re drinking your sherry straight, enjoy it with those tricky foods that defeat most still wines \u2013 artichokes, anchovies and olives, to name just three. That\u2019s because saltiness and bitterness make dry sherry shine; it\u2019s also a brilliant pairing with seafood.</p> <p>Perhaps, however, the problem is that we\u2019re also expecting too much of sherry. I happily pop into my local tapas bar in Bristol for a glass at the counter and a chat with the barman, much as I might in Spain. Or I pour myself a glass on a quiet night in and sip it while reading a good book. Maybe we try to make sherry too social when it should be a quiet, solitary pleasure. Eureka!

But the team\u2019s win, while convincing, needs to be qualified a bit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/20/usa-pass-sweden-test-to-seal-top-spot-in-group-as-spain-await-in-last-16\">USA pass Sweden test to seal top spot in group as Spain await in last 16</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With Sweden already guaranteed a spot in the round of 16, Sweden manager Peter Gerhardsson was clearly looking past the USA and ahead to the first game of the knockout round. He rotated out seven players who had started in Sweden\u2019s previous match and gave a handful of players their first minutes of the tournament.</p> <p>\u201cWe knew we didn\u2019t have much time between these matches,\u201d he said. \u201cWe played tonight, we\u2019ll have the bus trip tomorrow and recuperate, and we play again Monday. That\u2019s the match that is the most important one and that was the priority when I picked my lineup.\u201d</p> <p>The American attack again looked relatively strong, with their two goals a fair haul for the amount of danger they created in the final third. But defensively the Americans just weren\u2019t tested in the way critics may have hoped \u2013 just about all of Sweden\u2019s attempts on goal either missed the frame or went straight to goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher.</p> <p>It\u2019s not to say the performance wasn\u2019t promising \u2013 Naeher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/17/usa-chile-celebration-carli-lloyd-world-cup\">looked shaky against Chile</a> in the match\u2019s only real threatening moment, but her decision-making was on point against Sweden. Still, it wasn\u2019t enough to wash away fears that the USWNT can avoid conceding goals against a top team.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jun/20/var-penalising-goalkeepers-unfairly-womens-world-cup\">VAR is penalising goalkeepers unfairly at the Women\u2019s World Cup | Eni Aluko</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>More suspect injury reports show the USA\u2019s confidence</strong></h2> <p>First it happened in the opener against Thailand: Becky Sauerbrunn was left out of the starting lineup for a \u201cmild quad issue.\u201d (Note that it wasn\u2019t an injury and US Soccer was clearly choosing not to call it one.) Then against Sweden, Julie Ertz was held out for a mild \u201chip contusion\u201d. As with Sauerbrunn, her absence was termed \u201cprecautionary\u201d.</p> <p>More than a few reporters in the American press corps have a hunch that Sauebrunn and Ertz, two crucial players, were just rested against opponents the Americans were confident about beating.</p> <p>Resting players isn\u2019t anything new, but the Americans seemingly have a luxury few other teams in this tournament have: they can rest players whenever they want \u2013 as was the case during an almost full lineup rotation against Chile \u2013 and still look full strength.</p> <p>\u201cPeople should know we rotate our players, we have a strong 23, and we\u2019re always fresh and ready to go,\u201d said Crystal Dunn when asked what other teams should takeaway from the US performance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8eddfbbdb2832373f25d29249d297bc4beb62f7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8eddfbbdb2832373f25d29249d297bc4beb62f7b/0_0_3615_2413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lindsey Horan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lindsey Horan celebrates after scoring against Sweden on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The US is too busy winning to worry about plotting</strong></h2> <p>One of the biggest talking points coming into Thursday\u2019s match against Sweden was whether Jill Ellis and co might try to game the system and lose so the Americans could avoid France, the other best team in the tournament so far.</p> <p>But anyone who has been following the USWNT\u2019s run through the World Cup so far already knew the answer: not a chance. As if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/11/usa-thailand-uswnt-womens-world-cup-soccer-match-report\">a record-setting 13-0 win over Thailand</a> didn\u2019t show the Americans wanted to play at 100%, coach Jill Ellis\u2019s aggressive lineup against Sweden confirmed it.</p> <p>Rose Lavelle may have put it best after beating Sweden: \u201cI think if you\u2019re scared to play a team in the World Cup, you honestly don\u2019t deserve to win it.\u201d</p> <p>In the lead-up to the final game of the group stage, Ellis talked about the importance of everyone feeling good. Momentum may be an intangible, subjective thing that only exists in the minds of players, but it\u2019s real \u2013 and the Americans have it right now.</p> <h2><strong>Not every player who deserves to start will</strong></h2> <p>The question was a relatively simple one: If everyone is healthy \u2013 if Julie Ertz doesn\u2019t have a \u201chip contusion\u201d \u2013 how can Samantha Mewis got on the field as a starter?</p> <p>\u201cAt this point, just having the depth that we need, especially in that midfield with legs, I think that\u2019s important,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need legs.\u201d</p> <p>In other words: Mewis, who was arguably one of the USA\u2019s best players on Thursday may not start and that\u2019s just how it is. The Americans have considerable depth and \u2013 opponents beware \u2013 they intend to use it.</p> <p>To wit: it\u2019s been well-documented that Carli <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/07/carli-lloyd-uswnt-soccer-womens-world-cup\">Lloyd isn\u2019t pleased she hasn\u2019t been starting regularly</a> for the Americans either. But that doesn\u2019t figure to change.</p> <p>Asked last week about why she\u2019s so open about her displeasure, Lloyd said there\u2019s nothing wrong with the USWNT\u2019s starting-caliber players wanting to be on the field.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just being honest,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cIf I was satisfied with that, I really shouldn\u2019t be here. That\u2019s not who I am as a person and player. I know my ability is there. There\u2019s honestly nothing holding me back except for the coach\u2019s decision.\u201d</p> <p>Those decisions for Ellis are difficult ones, and it means players who deserve to start won\u2019t.</p> <p><strong>Comments on this article are pre-moderated to ensure that the discussion remains relevant to the issues raised by the contributor.</strong><br></p> <p><br></p>",

Now with the stakes raised as teams start dropping like flies, here is a look at the key takeaways from the US women\u2019s national team victory over Sweden to stay perfect through three matches and top Group F. This wasn\u2019t the reassuring test US fans might\u2019ve hoped for After the US coasted past Thailand and Chile, Sweden was supposed to finally offer the test that would to an end to questions about the USA\u2019s steel. But the team\u2019s win, while convincing, needs to be qualified a bit. With Sweden already guaranteed a spot in the round of 16, Sweden manager Peter Gerhardsson was clearly looking past the USA and ahead to the first game of the knockout round. He rotated out seven players who had started in Sweden\u2019s previous match and gave a handful of players their first minutes of the tournament. \u201cWe knew we didn\u2019t have much time between these matches,\u201d he said. \u201cWe played tonight, we\u2019ll have the bus trip tomorrow and recuperate, and we play again Monday. That\u2019s the match that is the most important one and that was the priority when I picked my lineup.\u201d The American attack again looked relatively strong, with their two goals a fair haul for the amount of danger they created in the final third. But defensively the Americans just weren\u2019t tested in the way critics may have hoped \u2013 just about all of Sweden\u2019s attempts on goal either missed the frame or went straight to goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher. It\u2019s not to say the performance wasn\u2019t promising \u2013 Naeher looked shaky against Chile in the match\u2019s only real threatening moment, but her decision-making was on point against Sweden. Still, it wasn\u2019t enough to wash away fears that the USWNT can avoid conceding goals against a top team. More suspect injury reports show the USA\u2019s confidence First it happened in the opener against Thailand: Becky Sauerbrunn was left out of the starting lineup for a \u201cmild quad issue.\u201d (Note that it wasn\u2019t an injury and US Soccer was clearly choosing not to call it one.) Then against Sweden, Julie Ertz was held out for a mild \u201chip contusion\u201d. As with Sauerbrunn, her absence was termed \u201cprecautionary\u201d. More than a few reporters in the American press corps have a hunch that Sauebrunn and Ertz, two crucial players, were just rested against opponents the Americans were confident about beating. Resting players isn\u2019t anything new, but the Americans seemingly have a luxury few other teams in this tournament have: they can rest players whenever they want \u2013 as was the case during an almost full lineup rotation against Chile \u2013 and still look full strength. \u201cPeople should know we rotate our players, we have a strong 23, and we\u2019re always fresh and ready to go,\u201d said Crystal Dunn when asked what other teams should takeaway from the US performance. The US is too busy winning to worry about plotting One of the biggest talking points coming into Thursday\u2019s match against Sweden was whether Jill Ellis and co might try to game the system and lose so the Americans could avoid France, the other best team in the tournament so far. But anyone who has been following the USWNT\u2019s run through the World Cup so far already knew the answer: not a chance. As if a record-setting 13-0 win over Thailand didn\u2019t show the Americans wanted to play at 100%, coach Jill Ellis\u2019s aggressive lineup against Sweden confirmed it. Rose Lavelle may have put it best after beating Sweden: \u201cI think if you\u2019re scared to play a team in the World Cup, you honestly don\u2019t deserve to win it.\u201d In the lead-up to the final game of the group stage, Ellis talked about the importance of everyone feeling good. Momentum may be an intangible, subjective thing that only exists in the minds of players, but it\u2019s real \u2013 and the Americans have it right now. Not every player who deserves to start will The question was a relatively simple one: If everyone is healthy \u2013 if Julie Ertz doesn\u2019t have a \u201chip contusion\u201d \u2013 how can Samantha Mewis got on the field as a starter? \u201cAt this point, just having the depth that we need, especially in that midfield with legs, I think that\u2019s important,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need legs.\u201d In other words: Mewis, who was arguably one of the USA\u2019s best players on Thursday may not start and that\u2019s just how it is. The Americans have considerable depth and \u2013 opponents beware \u2013 they intend to use it. To wit: it\u2019s been well-documented that Carli Lloyd isn\u2019t pleased she hasn\u2019t been starting regularly for the Americans either. But that doesn\u2019t figure to change. Asked last week about why she\u2019s so open about her displeasure, Lloyd said there\u2019s nothing wrong with the USWNT\u2019s starting-caliber players wanting to be on the field. \u201cI\u2019m just being honest,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cIf I was satisfied with that, I really shouldn\u2019t be here. That\u2019s not who I am as a person and player. I know my ability is there. There\u2019s honestly nothing holding me back except for the coach\u2019s decision.\u201d Those decisions for Ellis are difficult ones, and it means players who deserve to start won\u2019t.

The lack of input from counter-terrorism police meant no action was taken before the London Bridge attack on 3 June 2017. Hayward previously told the inquiry that police had not told TfL of their concerns that London Bridge could be vulnerable to vehicle attacks by terrorists. When asked if the transport body would have taken action if police had flagged up the threat, Hayward said: \u201cAbsolutely, categorically yes\u201d,adding that TfL would have called a meeting with its partners to consider what urgent action should be taken. \u201cIf a counter-terrorism security adviser [CTSA] had said to us that London Bridge was the most vulnerable site in the capital we would, in collaboration with the Corporation of London, have moved quickly to take action to mitigate the elements that make that site vulnerable to terrorists,\u201d she said. Although permanent security measures would have taken years to install, Hayward said barriers could have been put in place more quickly. \u201cWe have access to a huge range of vehicle restraint barriers, crash barriers, street furniture, planters, so we would have been able to work on the advice of the CTSA about measures that would have been put in place to reduce the vulnerability of that location,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "Facebook and eBay have been ordered to take urgent action to stop fake online reviews that are increasingly being used by companies to deceive customers. The Competition and Markets Authority said it had found \u201ctroubling evidence\u201d of a thriving marketplace for fake and misleading online reviews. After spending the past eight months looking for evidence, the CMA said it had unearthed more than 100 listings on eBay from companies and individuals offering fake reviews for sale. The UK regulator had also identified 26 Facebook groups where people offered to write fake reviews to order, or businesses recruiting people to write fake and misleading reviews for popular shopping and review sites. Having great online reviews can make or break a business, and companies spend huge sums creating and managing their feedback. In October 2018, Which? said two large Facebook groups, plus some smaller groups, may between them have up to 87,000 members potentially engaged in writing fake reviews. Andrea Coscelli, the CMA\u2019s chief executive, said he did not believe Facebook or eBay were intentionally allowing this content to appear on their websites, but he warned they must do more to prevent it appearing. \u201cLots of us rely on reviews when shopping online to decide what to buy. It is important that people are able to trust that reviews are genuine, rather than something someone has been paid to write,\u201d Coscelli said on Friday. \u201cFake reviews mean that people might make the wrong choice and end up with a product or service that\u2019s not right for them. They\u2019re also unfair to businesses who do the right thing.\u201d Both companies have been told to conduct an urgent review of their sites. It is estimated more than three-quarters of UK internet users consider online reviews when choosing what to buy. Billions of pounds of consumer spending is influenced by reviews every year. The use of fake and misleading reviews not only leads to poor choices, it is also illegal under consumer protection law. Facebook said it removed 24 of the 26 groups the CMA reported to it. \u201cWe know there is more to do which is why we\u2019ve tripled the size of our safety and security team to 30,000,\u201d a spokesman said. In a statement eBay said that sellers identified by the CMA have since been suspended. \u201cListings such as these are strictly against our policy on illegal activity and we will act where our rules are broken.\u201d",

It is part of a broader question that is very pertinent at the club. The transfer budget is mediocre. Wages are a problem. The club feel they have a particularly strong group of young players knocking on the door. But the Premier League has been a notoriously difficult nut to crack for the 18-to-21 age group in recent years and the Jadon Sancho principle is a dazzling example of how an increasing number of prodigies in the English system are encouraged to develop outside of these shores. In England, conventional wisdom dictates it is not practical to throw a bunch of young players in at the deep end.</p> <p>Arsenal have come up with a strategy to try to tackle the need for progress in this age group. The \u201ctransition team\u201d was launched this summer, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/17/arsenal-coaching-shake-up-sees-ljungberg-replace-bould-as-assistant\" title=\"\">Freddie Ljungberg </a>central to it. The Swede\u2019s strides on the youth coaching circuit at Arsenal are highly regarded. He has spent time with most of the age groups at Hale End because they are so impressed to see how he fares and what impression he makes, and his promotion to the first-team staff after an exciting year with the Under-23s is a move to create a link between youth and senior squads. \u201cThe transition from Under-23 to first team is massive,\u201d says the director of football, Ra\u00fal Sanlleh\u00ed. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty specifically English issue as we don\u2019t have B teams playing at a high level which our European competitors have. So we need to make careful choices around who stays with the Under-23s, who trains [and plays] with the first team and who goes on loan. The transition team will be responsible for managing development plans for each and every player to best optimise their potential.\u201d</p> <p>Ljungberg is acutely aware there is a cluster of talent from the academy that needs testing out, needs chances. Arsenal want to avoid players disappearing into the black hole of the 18- to 21-year-old football drift. The strategy began taking shape last season when the attackers Reiss Nelson and Emile Smith Rowe had loan spells in Germany. The next steps for them, for the defender Krystian Bielik, who did well at Charlton, and for the crop who had tasters at Arsenal last season such as Willock and Bukayo Saka and a few more besides are the focus of Ljungberg and his transition team.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a fascinating move for Ljungberg, who has effectively swapped jobs with Steve Bould.

What influences attitudes to Stem careers? When considering career paths and fields of study, our research showed that students are influenced by careers advisers, parents and teachers: 33% of male students felt that those people encouraged them to take Stem subjects, compared with 16% of the female students. What about role models? We have all heard the term: \u201cYou can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see\u201d, and the lack of female role models in the tech sector reinforces the perception that tech isn\u2019t for girls.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>After three years of training telescopes on 1,327 stars within 160 light years of Earth as part of the Breakthrough Listen project, astronomers have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/18/its-quiet-out-there-scientists-fail-to-hear-signals-of-alien-life\">been met with silence</a>, having failed to detect any signals that resemble intelligent life elsewhere. And yet many scientists still believe such life must exist. Even if they don\u2019t accept the premise of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2013/sep/04/equation-alien-life-universe\">1961 Drake equation</a>, written by the US astrophysicist Frank Drake, that there are 100m worlds where life has been created through evolution, they still reckon the probability of extraterrestrial civilisations has to be above zero. So what are we doing wrong? The most likely explanation is that either we are looking in the wrong places or we are looking for the wrong things and that our equipment is not quite up to the job. But is it also possible that other civilisations are rather more sophisticated than our own and deliberately maintain radio silence to stop us getting in contact with them? That they\u2019ve known about us for hundreds \u2013 if not thousands \u2013 of years and there is an international extraterrestrial alliance hellbent on blanking us out. They\u2019ve taken a good look at us and concluded we are not intelligent enough to be worth bothering with. Just give us a couple of hundred years more and we\u2019ll have probably destroyed the entire planet and ceased to exist, so why make the effort of trying to get to know us?</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>The first of three days of voting in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/20/jeremy-hunt-and-boris-johnson-are-final-two-in-tory-leadership-race\">Tory leadership race</a>, which meant much of my week was spent hanging around the corridor outside committee room 14 in Westminster as Tory MPs scurried in and out. It was both a repetitive and depressing experience. The formula was almost invariably the same. Jeremy \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/20/tories-choose-ken-doll-as-mr-blobbys-hustings-warm-up-act\">Ken Doll</a> in British Airways steward uniform\u201d with rictus smile insisting that the loss of cabin pressure was entirely normal. Michael Gove trying to conceal his naked ambition while looking like a newcomer at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. Sajid Javid saying anything to sound hard on Brexit and appear more interesting than his dog. Dominic Raab working on his anger management issues while bodies unexpectedly piled up in the Thames. All of whom knew they were really running for a post in the cabinet rather than prime minister. Boris \u201cPriapic Mr Blobby\u201d Johnson remaining tight-lipped, knowing that if he actually said something he would haemorrhage support. The only one who appeared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/19/rory-stewarts-exit-means-the-tories-have-now-given-up-on-reality\">halfway human</a> was Rory Stewart, which automatically disqualified him from the contest. But the candidates were far from the worst specimens on view. The sight of so many men and women betraying their principles for the sake of their careers even took some of their colleagues by surprise. MPs such as Matt Hancock and Damian Green, who had openly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/18/conservatives-warned-against-comfort-blanket-populism\">made no secret</a> of Johnson\u2019s unsuitability for the job, were now competing for his attention and disappearing so far up his arse that they began to reappear out of his mouth. As one MP said to me: \u201cIt appears that almost everyone on Team Boris has forgotten how to count. There just aren\u2019t enough jobs to go around.\u201d Come the end of July, there is going to be a lot of disappointed people in the Tory country. And in the rest of the country.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>Within hours of the advance squadron of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party MEPs descending on Brussels, Annunziata Rees-Mogg had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zatzi/status/1141277679129374721\">retweeted</a> a video of their arrival with the comment: \u201cI think I might watch this on my shiny new iPad I was given for no very obvious reason. We need to leave the corrupt gravy train, as we were promised we would.\u201d Which rather begged several questions. The first being that if Nancy really thought it was such a waste of money her being given an iPad, there was no reason why she could not have given it back. Presumably no one was forcing her to take it. There again, maybe she treats all gifts as a form of manorial tithe. On a more existential note, it made you wonder whether Nancy actually knows she is meant to be in Brussels to represent her constituents and not on a summer holiday. In which case she is probably a little pissed off that the EU did not also supply her with a sun lounger and an umbrella to cover all weather eventualities. But presuming she is vaguely aware of the responsibilities that come with her \u00a390,000-plus pay package, it has clearly never occurred to her that employers have a duty to provide the means for its workers to do their jobs. Or that an iPad is not just a toy on which to watch YouTube videos of cute dogs. No doubt the cleaners and nannies who keep the extended Rees-Mogg family on the road are expected to bring their own bleach and nappies. Nancy must also feel it is the height of decadence that the European parliament supplies lavatory paper in its own toilets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18922bb3798eb81063a5e94eaffb8d20b9c198d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18922bb3798eb81063a5e94eaffb8d20b9c198d0/90_99_3254_1953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rory Stewart: \u2018\u2018I keep looking into the soul of Tory MPs but I can\u2019t find one.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rory Stewart: \u2018\u2018I keep looking into the soul of Tory MPs but I can\u2019t find one.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>The final day of voting in the Tory leadership election had a demob happy feel to it. A sense of relief that the whole thing was over. And that wasn\u2019t just me. One Tory MP confided to me that the whole experience had been like a prolonged bushtucker trial in which she had been repeatedly forced to consume from an array of voting options all of which made her want to retch. Several others told me it had been a miserable experience with threats to careers being made if they failed to vote in the right direction. Many MPs of course were more than happy to do as they were told and what was noticeable about many of Johnson\u2019s supporters was that they were unable to explain exactly why they were voting for him. Some said the serious politicians had let us down and that it was time for a clown \u2013 though logic might suggest that if the serious politicians had failed then the task was rather more tricky than we had been led to believe. Others insisted they had been impressed by Mr Blobby\u2019s plan, his sense of vision. Though when pressed, none were able to articulate what precisely that plan was. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/20/the-guardian-view-on-the-tory-leadership-election-things-fall-apart\">Because there isn\u2019t one</a>. They had merely heard what they had wanted to hear. The fifth and final ballot was dominated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/20/jeremy-hunt-and-boris-johnson-are-final-two-in-tory-leadership-race\">claims of vote rigging</a> as Johnson\u2019s team contrived to keep Gove out of the final two, leaving their man with an easy run in the members\u2019 hustings against the anodyne Hunt. Shortly after the vote was announced, a Tory MP phoned to explain how it had been organised. Several members of Johnson\u2019s inner circle had up to nine proxy votes each and had used them judiciously to control the outcome. If the Conservative leadership contest had taken place in an African country, we\u2019d be calling it out as a failed state.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>We\u2019ve never had much luck with cars. Our previous one had the terrifying habit of suddenly losing power when travelling at 70mph on the motorway, a fault that repeated trips to the garage never resolved. It also had a satnav that was so inaccurate it thought we were heading across the middle of Tooting Bec common when we were parked outside our house. Eight years ago, we decided to give up the unequal and replace it with a diesel car. Because back then diesels were not only meant to be far more reliable, they were being marketed as the cars that would save the planet. Far less damaging to the environment than petrol cars. We all know what happened next, though I can\u2019t help suspecting that car manufacturers knew exactly how toxic diesels were for many years before the information became public knowledge. To add to its obsolescence, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/06/london-prepares-for-launch-of-ultra-low-emissions-zone\">ultra-</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/06/london-prepares-for-launch-of-ultra-low-emissions-zone\">low </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/06/london-prepares-for-launch-of-ultra-low-emissions-zone\">emissions </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/06/london-prepares-for-launch-of-ultra-low-emissions-zone\">zone</a> means we can no longer drive anywhere in central London without paying \u00a312.50 per day \u2013 which, to be fair, is no great loss as my over-60s Oyster card means I can travel everywhere for free by public transport.

      "bodyText": "Monday After three years of training telescopes on 1,327 stars within 160 light years of Earth as part of the Breakthrough Listen project, astronomers have been met with silence, having failed to detect any signals that resemble intelligent life elsewhere. And yet many scientists still believe such life must exist. Even if they don\u2019t accept the premise of the 1961 Drake equation, written by the US astrophysicist Frank Drake, that there are 100m worlds where life has been created through evolution, they still reckon the probability of extraterrestrial civilisations has to be above zero. So what are we doing wrong? The most likely explanation is that either we are looking in the wrong places or we are looking for the wrong things and that our equipment is not quite up to the job. But is it also possible that other civilisations are rather more sophisticated than our own and deliberately maintain radio silence to stop us getting in contact with them? That they\u2019ve known about us for hundreds \u2013 if not thousands \u2013 of years and there is an international extraterrestrial alliance hellbent on blanking us out. They\u2019ve taken a good look at us and concluded we are not intelligent enough to be worth bothering with. Just give us a couple of hundred years more and we\u2019ll have probably destroyed the entire planet and ceased to exist, so why make the effort of trying to get to know us? Tuesday The first of three days of voting in the Tory leadership race, which meant much of my week was spent hanging around the corridor outside committee room 14 in Westminster as Tory MPs scurried in and out. It was both a repetitive and depressing experience. The formula was almost invariably the same. Jeremy \u201cKen Doll in British Airways steward uniform\u201d with rictus smile insisting that the loss of cabin pressure was entirely normal. Michael Gove trying to conceal his naked ambition while looking like a newcomer at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. Sajid Javid saying anything to sound hard on Brexit and appear more interesting than his dog. Dominic Raab working on his anger management issues while bodies unexpectedly piled up in the Thames. All of whom knew they were really running for a post in the cabinet rather than prime minister. Boris \u201cPriapic Mr Blobby\u201d Johnson remaining tight-lipped, knowing that if he actually said something he would haemorrhage support. The only one who appeared halfway human was Rory Stewart, which automatically disqualified him from the contest. But the candidates were far from the worst specimens on view. The sight of so many men and women betraying their principles for the sake of their careers even took some of their colleagues by surprise. MPs such as Matt Hancock and Damian Green, who had openly made no secret of Johnson\u2019s unsuitability for the job, were now competing for his attention and disappearing so far up his arse that they began to reappear out of his mouth. As one MP said to me: \u201cIt appears that almost everyone on Team Boris has forgotten how to count. There just aren\u2019t enough jobs to go around.\u201d Come the end of July, there is going to be a lot of disappointed people in the Tory country. And in the rest of the country. Wednesday Within hours of the advance squadron of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party MEPs descending on Brussels, Annunziata Rees-Mogg had retweeted a video of their arrival with the comment: \u201cI think I might watch this on my shiny new iPad I was given for no very obvious reason. We need to leave the corrupt gravy train, as we were promised we would.\u201d Which rather begged several questions. The first being that if Nancy really thought it was such a waste of money her being given an iPad, there was no reason why she could not have given it back. Presumably no one was forcing her to take it. There again, maybe she treats all gifts as a form of manorial tithe. On a more existential note, it made you wonder whether Nancy actually knows she is meant to be in Brussels to represent her constituents and not on a summer holiday. In which case she is probably a little pissed off that the EU did not also supply her with a sun lounger and an umbrella to cover all weather eventualities. But presuming she is vaguely aware of the responsibilities that come with her \u00a390,000-plus pay package, it has clearly never occurred to her that employers have a duty to provide the means for its workers to do their jobs. Or that an iPad is not just a toy on which to watch YouTube videos of cute dogs. No doubt the cleaners and nannies who keep the extended Rees-Mogg family on the road are expected to bring their own bleach and nappies. Nancy must also feel it is the height of decadence that the European parliament supplies lavatory paper in its own toilets. Thursday The final day of voting in the Tory leadership election had a demob happy feel to it. A sense of relief that the whole thing was over. And that wasn\u2019t just me. One Tory MP confided to me that the whole experience had been like a prolonged bushtucker trial in which she had been repeatedly forced to consume from an array of voting options all of which made her want to retch. Several others told me it had been a miserable experience with threats to careers being made if they failed to vote in the right direction. Many MPs of course were more than happy to do as they were told and what was noticeable about many of Johnson\u2019s supporters was that they were unable to explain exactly why they were voting for him. Some said the serious politicians had let us down and that it was time for a clown \u2013 though logic might suggest that if the serious politicians had failed then the task was rather more tricky than we had been led to believe. Others insisted they had been impressed by Mr Blobby\u2019s plan, his sense of vision. Though when pressed, none were able to articulate what precisely that plan was. Because there isn\u2019t one. They had merely heard what they had wanted to hear. The fifth and final ballot was dominated by claims of vote rigging as Johnson\u2019s team contrived to keep Gove out of the final two, leaving their man with an easy run in the members\u2019 hustings against the anodyne Hunt. Shortly after the vote was announced, a Tory MP phoned to explain how it had been organised. Several members of Johnson\u2019s inner circle had up to nine proxy votes each and had used them judiciously to control the outcome. If the Conservative leadership contest had taken place in an African country, we\u2019d be calling it out as a failed state. Friday We\u2019ve never had much luck with cars. Our previous one had the terrifying habit of suddenly losing power when travelling at 70mph on the motorway, a fault that repeated trips to the garage never resolved. It also had a satnav that was so inaccurate it thought we were heading across the middle of Tooting Bec common when we were parked outside our house. Eight years ago, we decided to give up the unequal and replace it with a diesel car. Because back then diesels were not only meant to be far more reliable, they were being marketed as the cars that would save the planet. Far less damaging to the environment than petrol cars. We all know what happened next, though I can\u2019t help suspecting that car manufacturers knew exactly how toxic diesels were for many years before the information became public knowledge. To add to its obsolescence, the ultra-low emissions zone means we can no longer drive anywhere in central London without paying \u00a312.50 per day \u2013 which, to be fair, is no great loss as my over-60s Oyster card means I can travel everywhere for free by public transport. More importantly the zone will extend to our patch in under two years meaning we will be paying \u00a312.50 per day not to use the car. So it\u2019s got to go. Though we\u2019ll almost certainly find that we end up having to pay someone to take it off our hands as it\u2019s splattered with dents, full of more crap than Johnson\u2019s car and soon to be undriveable in London.

People with underlying illnesses can also have problems, and even those who are healthy can experience difficulty sleeping and discomfort, so people are advised to stay hydrated and wear loose clothing at night.</p>\n    <p>There is also an impact on farmers.

Too often the doors are shut,\u201d said Mallett, setting out her proposals before next month\u2019s General Synod in York. \u201cIs there a way that churches can be open, particularly between the hours of 3pm and 6pm, to be places of safety, of welcome, where young people can go?\u201d</p> <p>She said Angell Town, where she has been vicar for 12 years, was \u201can area blighted by serious youth violence. Certainly my time there has been punctuated by too many deaths, too many young people. I\u2019ve been involved in too many funerals.\u201d</p> <p>But knife crime was not just a problem for inner cities, she added. Gang-related \u201ccounty line\u201d activity meant serious youth violence had spread. \u201cIt\u2019s become a national problem.\u201d</p> <p>In 2018 there were <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48050426\">40,000 knife crime offences</a> in the UK, \u201cthe highest number since any kind of data was collected,\u201d said Mallett.</p> <p>Churches should become part of a nexus of support along with other community groups and agencies, she said. Knife amnesty bins could be situated in churches, where young people might feel more inclined to take weapons than police stations.</p> <p>The C of E, which is the second largest provider of state education in the country, should monitor exclusions and develop strategies to minimise their number, Mallett said. There was a proven link between school exclusions, young people being sent to pupil referral units, and becoming involved in serious violence, she said.</p> <p>Training and resources should be provided to clergy and church leaders to increase awareness of the signs of vulnerability to gang exploitation.</p> <p>Mallett said youth provision in her area had been hit by government funding cuts, but she stressed that the church did not play the same role as the state. Young people came to her church \u201cto use the space to have quiet time, to think about the situation they find themselves in.\u201d</p> <p>At next month\u2019s five-day synod session, members will also hear C of E plans to invest up to \u00a363m to train the increasing number of people applying to become priests.</p> <p>In the past two years there has been a 23% increase in people training for ordination. David Walker, the bishop of Manchester, said in his diocese there had been particular growth in female and minority ethnic candidates for the priesthood.</p> <p>\u201cThe growth will help us deal with the demographic challenge of many existing clergy coming to retirement. It won\u2019t necessarily mean a net increase in the number of stipendiary clergy, but it will stem the decline,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Churches should open their doors to provide a safe haven for young people at risk of knife crime during after-school flashpoints, the Church of England\u2019s governing body will be told next month. Rosemarie Mallett, a vicar in Angell Town, Brixton, south London, will urge churches to offer themselves as sanctuaries, both for young people in need of a quiet, safe place and those urgently fleeing violent attacks. \u201cIn every place where there is a problem of serious youth violence, there is a church. Too often the doors are shut,\u201d said Mallett, setting out her proposals before next month\u2019s General Synod in York. \u201cIs there a way that churches can be open, particularly between the hours of 3pm and 6pm, to be places of safety, of welcome, where young people can go?\u201d She said Angell Town, where she has been vicar for 12 years, was \u201can area blighted by serious youth violence. Certainly my time there has been punctuated by too many deaths, too many young people. I\u2019ve been involved in too many funerals.\u201d But knife crime was not just a problem for inner cities, she added. Gang-related \u201ccounty line\u201d activity meant serious youth violence had spread. \u201cIt\u2019s become a national problem.\u201d In 2018 there were 40,000 knife crime offences in the UK, \u201cthe highest number since any kind of data was collected,\u201d said Mallett. Churches should become part of a nexus of support along with other community groups and agencies, she said. Knife amnesty bins could be situated in churches, where young people might feel more inclined to take weapons than police stations. The C of E, which is the second largest provider of state education in the country, should monitor exclusions and develop strategies to minimise their number, Mallett said. There was a proven link between school exclusions, young people being sent to pupil referral units, and becoming involved in serious violence, she said. Training and resources should be provided to clergy and church leaders to increase awareness of the signs of vulnerability to gang exploitation. Mallett said youth provision in her area had been hit by government funding cuts, but she stressed that the church did not play the same role as the state. Young people came to her church \u201cto use the space to have quiet time, to think about the situation they find themselves in.\u201d At next month\u2019s five-day synod session, members will also hear C of E plans to invest up to \u00a363m to train the increasing number of people applying to become priests. In the past two years there has been a 23% increase in people training for ordination. David Walker, the bishop of Manchester, said in his diocese there had been particular growth in female and minority ethnic candidates for the priesthood. \u201cThe growth will help us deal with the demographic challenge of many existing clergy coming to retirement. It won\u2019t necessarily mean a net increase in the number of stipendiary clergy, but it will stem the decline,\u201d he said.",

Joining the Tory leadership frontrunner in the final was not his old foe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/20/gove-and-javid-prepare-for-top-jobs-with-congratulatory-tweets\" title=\"\">Michael Gove</a> but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/10/jeremy-hunt-wins-support-penny-mordaunt-conservative-leadership\" title=\"\">Jeremy Hunt</a>. The foreign secretary beat Gove to second place by a mere two votes. Hunt was the candidate the Johnson campaign wanted to join him in the final. The view is that he poses the least threat as he voted remain and isn\u2019t as skilled a debater as Gove.</p> <p>However, not everyone was so impressed with the result. Tory MPs quickly began to cry foul play and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/20/jeremy-hunt-and-boris-johnson-are-final-two-in-tory-leadership-race\" title=\"\">suggest dirty tricks</a>. The reason? The numbers don\u2019t add up. After Sajid Javid was knocked out in the first secret ballot of the day, at least four of his backers said they would now vote for Boris Johnson. Yet despite this, Johnson only managed to muster three more votes in total in the final ballot that afternoon. The suggestion is that Johnson supporters \u201clent\u201d their votes to Hunt in order to secure a weaker opponent.</p> <p>Suspicions hang in the air, too, over previous rounds. Ahead of the BBC debates, the only fellow hard Brexiteer in the competition, Dominic Raab, was eliminated. This meant that in the debate that night Johnson couldn\u2019t be out-Brexited or pushed into boxing himself in with further Brexit promises. The next day Rory Stewart was kicked out of the competition \u2013 mysteriously losing 10 votes. He has suggested \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rory-stewart-accuses-rival-of-dark-arts-as-he-is-knocked-out-of-tory-leadership-race-gt0fxzjk5\" title=\"\">dark arts</a>\u201d were at play. In some quarters, the finger of blame is being pointed at Gavin Williamson \u2013 the former chief whip who revels in his reputation as a machiavellian character \u2013 who helped run the parliamentary part of the Johnson campaign.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/20/jeremy-hunt-boris-johnson-conservative-leadership\">Hunt and Johnson are wildly different, but it\u2019s the latter who can deliver Brexit | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And the allegations of dirty tricks go further than tactical voting. While the Johnson campaign has impressed with its efficiency and organisation, some have suggested that it is too heavy-handed and the tactics it has deployed belong more to the mafia than big tent politics. MPs complain that the pitch has often been focused on bad things that would happen if they didn\u2019t back Johnson rather than good things that could happen if they did. \u201cDealing with the Boris campaign is like waking up with a horse\u2019s head in your bed,\u201d remarked one such MP.</p> <p>This means that although Johnson stamped his authority in the parliamentary rounds by winning the support of over half the party, there is growing unease about whether a Johnson premiership could bring the party back together. One such MP has already gone public. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/16/brexit-withdrawal-bill-tory-mp-antoinette-sandbach\" title=\"\">Antoinette Sandbach</a> shared a WhatsApp message she received from a male Tory MP which read: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48713978\" title=\"\">You too are a disgrace. Time you left the party I think</a>\u201d. Sandbach complained that \u201cbarely is the ink dry on the results and the dark ops begin\u201d \u2013 concluding: \u201cIs it any wonder three female MPs left.\u201d Another warning sign can be found in the fact that two MPs spoiled their ballot in the penultimate voting round \u2013 suggesting that they were not willing to be led by any of the remaining candidates.</p> <p>The Johnson campaign hopes that the membership vote next month will give the new prime minister a clean mandate and political authority, pushing MPs with differing Brexit positions to fall into line. However, there\u2019s a risk that a heavy-handed approach has the opposite effect and MPs decide to break rank and rebel \u2013 or leave the party altogether. The working Tory majority is so slim that even a couple of defections could mean that the next prime minister has no majority at all.</p> <p>So, is it inevitable that Johnson will become prime minister? There\u2019s a view among Johnson allies that they need to spend nearly as much time preparing to take office in the coming month as preparing for hustings against Hunt. There\u2019s a rule in politics that the Tory leadership frontrunner never wins. Right now Johnson looks unassailable \u2013 but campaigns can throw up surprises that move things off kilter.</p> <p>The first challenge has come in the form of Foreign Office minister Mark Field. The Conservative MP has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/21/mark-field-suspended-as-minister-after-grabbing-climate-protester-by-neck\" title=\"\">filmed grabbing a female climate change activist by the neck</a> and pushing her out of a black-tie City event. The minister has now been suspended. Yet several Tory MPs have publicly come to his defence. Neither leadership candidate has made an intervention, but as Field and Hunt are longtime friends and Field has been a minister in his department, his response will come under particular scrutiny.</p> <p>The hustings over the next month will see each of the candidates move from trying to win over MPs to appealing to the party membership.

      "bodyText": "When the names of the final two Tory leadership candidates were announced, there were celebrations among Boris Johnson\u2019s backers. Joining the Tory leadership frontrunner in the final was not his old foe Michael Gove but Jeremy Hunt. The foreign secretary beat Gove to second place by a mere two votes. Hunt was the candidate the Johnson campaign wanted to join him in the final. The view is that he poses the least threat as he voted remain and isn\u2019t as skilled a debater as Gove. However, not everyone was so impressed with the result. Tory MPs quickly began to cry foul play and suggest dirty tricks. The reason? The numbers don\u2019t add up. After Sajid Javid was knocked out in the first secret ballot of the day, at least four of his backers said they would now vote for Boris Johnson. Yet despite this, Johnson only managed to muster three more votes in total in the final ballot that afternoon. The suggestion is that Johnson supporters \u201clent\u201d their votes to Hunt in order to secure a weaker opponent. Suspicions hang in the air, too, over previous rounds. Ahead of the BBC debates, the only fellow hard Brexiteer in the competition, Dominic Raab, was eliminated. This meant that in the debate that night Johnson couldn\u2019t be out-Brexited or pushed into boxing himself in with further Brexit promises. The next day Rory Stewart was kicked out of the competition \u2013 mysteriously losing 10 votes. He has suggested \u201cdark arts\u201d were at play. In some quarters, the finger of blame is being pointed at Gavin Williamson \u2013 the former chief whip who revels in his reputation as a machiavellian character \u2013 who helped run the parliamentary part of the Johnson campaign. And the allegations of dirty tricks go further than tactical voting. While the Johnson campaign has impressed with its efficiency and organisation, some have suggested that it is too heavy-handed and the tactics it has deployed belong more to the mafia than big tent politics. MPs complain that the pitch has often been focused on bad things that would happen if they didn\u2019t back Johnson rather than good things that could happen if they did. \u201cDealing with the Boris campaign is like waking up with a horse\u2019s head in your bed,\u201d remarked one such MP. This means that although Johnson stamped his authority in the parliamentary rounds by winning the support of over half the party, there is growing unease about whether a Johnson premiership could bring the party back together. One such MP has already gone public. Antoinette Sandbach shared a WhatsApp message she received from a male Tory MP which read: \u201cYou too are a disgrace. Time you left the party I think\u201d. Sandbach complained that \u201cbarely is the ink dry on the results and the dark ops begin\u201d \u2013 concluding: \u201cIs it any wonder three female MPs left.\u201d Another warning sign can be found in the fact that two MPs spoiled their ballot in the penultimate voting round \u2013 suggesting that they were not willing to be led by any of the remaining candidates. The Johnson campaign hopes that the membership vote next month will give the new prime minister a clean mandate and political authority, pushing MPs with differing Brexit positions to fall into line. However, there\u2019s a risk that a heavy-handed approach has the opposite effect and MPs decide to break rank and rebel \u2013 or leave the party altogether. The working Tory majority is so slim that even a couple of defections could mean that the next prime minister has no majority at all. So, is it inevitable that Johnson will become prime minister? There\u2019s a view among Johnson allies that they need to spend nearly as much time preparing to take office in the coming month as preparing for hustings against Hunt. There\u2019s a rule in politics that the Tory leadership frontrunner never wins. Right now Johnson looks unassailable \u2013 but campaigns can throw up surprises that move things off kilter. The first challenge has come in the form of Foreign Office minister Mark Field. The Conservative MP has been filmed grabbing a female climate change activist by the neck and pushing her out of a black-tie City event. The minister has now been suspended. Yet several Tory MPs have publicly come to his defence. Neither leadership candidate has made an intervention, but as Field and Hunt are longtime friends and Field has been a minister in his department, his response will come under particular scrutiny. The hustings over the next month will see each of the candidates move from trying to win over MPs to appealing to the party membership. The risk, however, is that by pivoting to the Eurosceptic grassroots, they further isolate many of the MPs who are on the other end of the spectrum. With great challenges awaiting the next leader, the new prime minister will need these MPs. It follows that alarm bells should be ringing in the Johnson camp about the way this could play out. Otherwise even if Johnson succeeds, it could be a very short stint in No 10. \u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor",

One <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-48662463\">primary school in Bradford</a> is taking a hard line against the word, to the delight of the education minister, Nick Gibb, who suggested others follow suit. The headteacher, Christabel Shepherd, said: \u201cIt\u2019s when children are giving you an answer and they say \u2018is it, like, when you\u2019re, like \u2026\u2019 and they haven\u2019t actually made a sentence at all. They use the word all the time and we are trying to get rid of it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jul/18/problem-with-love-island-people-who-turned-it-down\">The problem with Love Island \u2013 by the people who turned it down</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Good luck, Miss Shepherd. Linguistic edicts of this kind have a low-to-zero chance of success. I just had a conversation with an eminent professor of linguistics and \u201clike\u201d popped up several times. Why is it OK for us but not for children? Informal \u201clike\u201d is well established and it\u2019s too late \u2013 and potentially cruel \u2013 to attempt to stop them using it. The more interesting question is why it seems to generate such disapproval.</p> <p>But before we turn to that, it\u2019s worth charting like\u2019s long journey, from Old English to ITV. The word was once <em>gelic</em>, which meant \u201calike\u201d or \u201csimilar\u201d. The <em>-lic</em> part derives from words meaning \u201cbody\u201d or \u201cform\u201d, so that we can think of it as meaning \u201chaving the form of\u201d (a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychgate\">lychgate</a> is the gate a body passes through on its way to a Christian graveyard).</p> <p>This is already a highly significant word, then. The act of comparing two or more objects is fundamental. The related faculty of analogy making \u2013 between things, but also between ideas and feelings \u2013 is equally important. It wouldn\u2019t be at all surprising if a word linked to these basic aspects of human cognition were recruited to serve a wide range of related meanings, branching off in subtly different directions. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. The Oxford English Dictionary has three principal and nearly 50 sub-definitions of \u201clike\u201d used as an adjective, adverb, conjunction and preposition. They range from \u201cresembling\u201d to \u201ccharacteristic or typical of\u201d to \u201cshowing a likelihood or probability of\u201d and \u201csuggesting that [a] statement is approximate\u201d.</p> <p>The examples given stretch back many hundreds of years, covering a long period of gradual evolution. And as you would expect, some uses are more recent than others. For our purposes, it\u2019s worth focusing on two in particular. The first is \u201cas a marker, intensifier, or filler in conversation or spoken discourse to introduce or focus attention on a following statement or question\u201d. The earliest written examples are from the 1950s: \u201cLike wow \u2026 wonderful\u201d is a line from She magazine in 1959. This is \u201clike\u201d as a discourse particle.</p> <p>The second use is \u201cwith a verb, introducing reported speech\u201d, and the earliest example is from Time magazine in 1970: \u201cAfterward, a girl came up to me and said, \u2018You kinda look interested in this; did you know there are civil rights for women?\u2019 And I thought like wow, this is for me.\u201d This is so-called quotative \u201clike\u201d \u2013 although in this case the words being quoted are thoughts. In the Sunday Times example, you\u2019ll notice that two out of the three \u201clikes\u201d are quotative.</p> <p>In both these uses \u201clike\u201d appears to have inched away from its core territory. Rather than having to do with similarity, the word seems to mean less, and to have become more functional. Linguists refer to this process as <a href=\"https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199772810/obo-9780199772810-0019.xml\">grammaticalisation</a>. It often happens to words that have elemental meanings and are used regularly. They become semantically \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/semantic-bleaching-word-meanings-1689028\">bleached</a>\u201d, and start to play a role in the organisation of the sentence, instead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/17/language-wars-18-greatest-linguistic-spats\">Language wars: the 19 greatest linguistic spats of all time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Grammaticalisation is perfectly natural and has happened many times in the history of English. Take the word \u201cindeed\u201d. This once meant literally \u201cin action\u201d (as opposed to \u201cin thought\u201d), before undergoing bleaching. In an example from 1580, Thomas Wilson writes \u201cI trust that not onely all men will commende justice in worde, but also will live justly in deede.\u201d It\u2019s now much more of an organising word instead. Similarly, \u201clook\u201d, used at the beginning of a sentence, is merely a discourse marker. But this grew out of its use as a call to direct someone\u2019s (visual) attention to something.</p> <p>\u201cLike\u201d plays such a fundamental role in the lexicon that it\u2019s been recruited for grammaticalisation not once but twice: as both discourse particle and quotative. These two forms now have different functions, and it might be useful to think of them as homophones: words which have the same sound but signify different things. A sentence containing both versions can sound like a bit of a barrage \u2013 but you can\u2019t exactly blame Love Islanders like Amy for the way English has evolved. As so often in language, the prejudice seems to be against the informal, and the new, which is erroneously branded \u201csloppy\u201d or \u201cdumb\u201d. There\u2019s no evidence that it is. People probably once said that about the non-literal use of \u201cindeed\u201d \u2013 no one would now.</p> <p>And we shouldn\u2019t shame schoolchildren either. It\u2019s fine for teachers to point out that \u201clike\u201d is generally used in more informal contexts. But when it crops up in pupils\u2019 speech \u2013 well, that could be an opportunity to teach children about the history of English, and the amazing process of grammaticalisation, which is one that rolls on and on whatever our feelings about it, like the waves lapping at Canute\u2019s feet.</p> <p>\u2022 David Shariatmadari is a Guardian editor and writer.

One primary school in Bradford is taking a hard line against the word, to the delight of the education minister, Nick Gibb, who suggested others follow suit. The headteacher, Christabel Shepherd, said: \u201cIt\u2019s when children are giving you an answer and they say \u2018is it, like, when you\u2019re, like \u2026\u2019 and they haven\u2019t actually made a sentence at all. They use the word all the time and we are trying to get rid of it.\u201d Good luck, Miss Shepherd. Linguistic edicts of this kind have a low-to-zero chance of success. I just had a conversation with an eminent professor of linguistics and \u201clike\u201d popped up several times. Why is it OK for us but not for children? Informal \u201clike\u201d is well established and it\u2019s too late \u2013 and potentially cruel \u2013 to attempt to stop them using it. The more interesting question is why it seems to generate such disapproval. But before we turn to that, it\u2019s worth charting like\u2019s long journey, from Old English to ITV. The word was once gelic, which meant \u201calike\u201d or \u201csimilar\u201d. The -lic part derives from words meaning \u201cbody\u201d or \u201cform\u201d, so that we can think of it as meaning \u201chaving the form of\u201d (a lychgate is the gate a body passes through on its way to a Christian graveyard). This is already a highly significant word, then. The act of comparing two or more objects is fundamental. The related faculty of analogy making \u2013 between things, but also between ideas and feelings \u2013 is equally important. It wouldn\u2019t be at all surprising if a word linked to these basic aspects of human cognition were recruited to serve a wide range of related meanings, branching off in subtly different directions. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. The Oxford English Dictionary has three principal and nearly 50 sub-definitions of \u201clike\u201d used as an adjective, adverb, conjunction and preposition. They range from \u201cresembling\u201d to \u201ccharacteristic or typical of\u201d to \u201cshowing a likelihood or probability of\u201d and \u201csuggesting that [a] statement is approximate\u201d. The examples given stretch back many hundreds of years, covering a long period of gradual evolution. And as you would expect, some uses are more recent than others. For our purposes, it\u2019s worth focusing on two in particular. The first is \u201cas a marker, intensifier, or filler in conversation or spoken discourse to introduce or focus attention on a following statement or question\u201d. The earliest written examples are from the 1950s: \u201cLike wow \u2026 wonderful\u201d is a line from She magazine in 1959. This is \u201clike\u201d as a discourse particle. The second use is \u201cwith a verb, introducing reported speech\u201d, and the earliest example is from Time magazine in 1970: \u201cAfterward, a girl came up to me and said, \u2018You kinda look interested in this; did you know there are civil rights for women?\u2019 And I thought like wow, this is for me.\u201d This is so-called quotative \u201clike\u201d \u2013 although in this case the words being quoted are thoughts. In the Sunday Times example, you\u2019ll notice that two out of the three \u201clikes\u201d are quotative. In both these uses \u201clike\u201d appears to have inched away from its core territory. Rather than having to do with similarity, the word seems to mean less, and to have become more functional. Linguists refer to this process as grammaticalisation. It often happens to words that have elemental meanings and are used regularly. They become semantically \u201cbleached\u201d, and start to play a role in the organisation of the sentence, instead. Grammaticalisation is perfectly natural and has happened many times in the history of English. Take the word \u201cindeed\u201d. This once meant literally \u201cin action\u201d (as opposed to \u201cin thought\u201d), before undergoing bleaching. In an example from 1580, Thomas Wilson writes \u201cI trust that not onely all men will commende justice in worde, but also will live justly in deede.\u201d It\u2019s now much more of an organising word instead. Similarly, \u201clook\u201d, used at the beginning of a sentence, is merely a discourse marker. But this grew out of its use as a call to direct someone\u2019s (visual) attention to something. \u201cLike\u201d plays such a fundamental role in the lexicon that it\u2019s been recruited for grammaticalisation not once but twice: as both discourse particle and quotative. These two forms now have different functions, and it might be useful to think of them as homophones: words which have the same sound but signify different things. A sentence containing both versions can sound like a bit of a barrage \u2013 but you can\u2019t exactly blame Love Islanders like Amy for the way English has evolved. As so often in language, the prejudice seems to be against the informal, and the new, which is erroneously branded \u201csloppy\u201d or \u201cdumb\u201d. There\u2019s no evidence that it is. People probably once said that about the non-literal use of \u201cindeed\u201d \u2013 no one would now. And we shouldn\u2019t shame schoolchildren either. It\u2019s fine for teachers to point out that \u201clike\u201d is generally used in more informal contexts. But when it crops up in pupils\u2019 speech \u2013 well, that could be an opportunity to teach children about the history of English, and the amazing process of grammaticalisation, which is one that rolls on and on whatever our feelings about it, like the waves lapping at Canute\u2019s feet. \u2022 David Shariatmadari is a Guardian editor and writer.

      "bodyText": "Drag SOS With a UK update of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race on the way, there has never been a better moment to feel fabulous. Channel 4\u2019s new reality series takes things a step further, inviting people struggling with confidence issues to embrace their inner selves with the help of the Family Gorgeous drag collective and their collection of sequinned outfits. Tuesday 25 June, 10pm, Channel 4 Tonight With Vladimir Putin From wrestling bears to meddling in elections, is there anything Putin can\u2019t do? This new talkshow sees a CGI version of the Russian premier (played by comic Natt Tapley) chat to guests including Alastair Campbell, June Sarpong and Joe Swash. Sunday 23 June, 11pm, BBC Two Beecham House Has ITV finally filled that Downton-shaped hole in its schedules? On paper, this Delhi-set period drama may just be the series to take on Poldark. Yet its creator Gurinder Chadha (Bend It Like Beckham) has promised that Beecham House will be a \u201cflipping radical thing\u201d in its portrayal of Indian characters and unvarnished truths about empire and colonialism. Sunday 23 June, 9pm, ITV Revisionist History Malcolm Gladwell, truly one of podcasting\u2019s big beasts, is back with a new season of his show about misremembered moments from our past, with stories on Jesuits, mobsters and getting into law school. Meanwhile a spin-off series, Solvable, quizzes some of the world\u2019s most innovative thinkers. Podcast The Unwanted: The Secret Windrush Files The Windrush scandal shocked Britain when it broke on to the front pages, but historian and documentary-maker David Olusoga reveals in this new film an uncomfortable historical precedent. From Churchill to Thatcher via Macmillan and Wilson, Olusoga takes a closer look at the legal documentation stacked against non-white immigrants since the 1940s, and why the dam burst last summer. Monday 24 June, 9pm, BBC Two Warrior The story goes that Bruce Lee pitched a martial arts TV show in the early 70s, that Lee\u2019s widow alleges was stolen by the studio and turned into Kung Fu starring David Carradine. Lee\u2019s vision finally sees the light of day here, as a Chinese master searches for his sister in a violent 19th-century San Fran. Tuesday 25 June, 10pm, Sky1 Minding the Gap Director Bing Liu\u2019s debut made waves at Sundance last year for its touching portrayal of how three young men use skateboarding as an antidote to the cycle of toxic masculinity in the former steel-producing states of North America. Using lo-res footage from his youth combined with interviews of his subjects, Liu\u2019s film is intimate and moving. Sunday 23 June, BBC Three Shaft Does anyone really need a sequel to Shaft, the middling John Singleton-directed, Samuel L Jackson-starring reboot of the 70s Blaxploitation classic? Netflix thinks they do, so here it is, in which Jackson\u2019s punchy PI returns, bafflingly, to battle the evil forces of millennial progressiveness. Likely to be trash, but a freebie for Jackson completists. From Friday 28 June, Netflix The Witch A devout father (Ralph Ineson) rebels against puritan elders and leads his family to set up home beside a forbidding forest in 17th-century New England; the torment that follows in Robert Eggers\u2019s eerie little horror stems from the dysfunctional family\u2019s inner lives, centring on the pubescent daughter (Anya Taylor-Joy), in a tale that springs from the darkest folklore.

He gave it to Sturgess as a gift and she fell fatally ill after spraying novichok on to her wrists.</p> <p>The central question for Rowley is why the bottle was in the bin. He said it was sealed in hard plastic and he had to use a kitchen knife to get to it. Rowley is convinced this means the bottle he found was not used in the attack on the Skripals \u2013 which the British government says was carried out by Russia \u2013 but was a second container.</p> <p>\u201cWhere did the bottle come from?\u201d said Rowley. \u201cWas it the Russians or wasn\u2019t it? How did it get on the streets? It\u2019s still a blank. It can\u2019t possibly be the same bottle that was used on the Skripals.

I feel I owe it to Dawn to get the answers. I\u2019ve an open mind about what happened.\u201d</p> <p>Rowley said he felt guilty about Sturgess\u2019s death and frequently turned to old Facebook messages and posts from Sturgess for comfort when he could not sleep. \u201cSometimes it gets to 8 or 9am and I still can\u2019t sleep. My head is going round in circles thinking about the day it happened.\u201d</p> <p>Rowley said he met Sturgess at the start of 2018 when both were living in separate hostels for homeless people in Salisbury.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a good time. I have many happy memories,\u201d Rowley said. Sturgess\u2019s room in John Baker House was a popular meeting place for residents. \u201cDawn was very sociable. She liked having people round. She enjoyed cooking and she was very motherly. If she had anything she would share it, whether it was food or cigarettes.</p> <p>\u201cShe was a very funny and very clever girl. We clicked straight away. We\u2019d spend time round the market, there were pubs we used to pop into, went from her place to mine. When things were going on in the summer, we\u2019d go along. We both liked music. It was the happiest time of my life.\u201d</p> <p>When Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/05/salisbury-incident-critically-ill-man-is-former-russian-spy-sergei-skripal\">poisoned with novichok</a> in Salisbury in March 2018, Rowley took little notice. \u201cIt didn\u2019t really affect me. I thought nothing of it. I didn\u2019t think we would be part of it.\u201d</p> <p>Fortunes seemed to be changing for Rowley, who has struggled with drug issues since being involved in the rave scene in the 1990s. He moved into a housing association flat in Amesbury, eight miles north of Salisbury, but continued to spend a lot of time with Sturgess in the city.</p> <p>On Wednesday 27 June 2018, Rowley said, he was rummaging in a charity shop bin in Salisbury. He had found a television there not long before and the bin was known as a place where valuables could be unearthed.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a proper honey hole. On that day there was nothing to my eye other than this perfume. I picked it up, put it my pocket and forgot about it for a little while. It stayed in my coat pocket.\u201d</p> <p>Rowley and Sturgess spent the Friday night \u2013 29 June \u2013 partying at his flat. By next morning, Rowley said, they had run out of things to say and to fill a gap in the conversation he gave her the perfume.</p> <p>\u201cWe both had sore heads. I showed it to Dawn to see if she was interested in having it. She recognised the name.\u201d</p> <p>The gift comprised a battered box within which was a bottle and pump. Rowley said the bottle and pump were packaged separately in hard plastic.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a thick plastic. You couldn\u2019t tear it. It was tough. I remember having to use a kitchen knife.\u201d As he attached the pump to the bottle, Rowley pressed the nozzle down. \u201cIt released on to me. I rinsed it off. It had an oily texture and next to no smell. I did mention [the lack of smell] to Dawn. She just carried on and gave it a spray, thinking nothing of it. She squirted it on to her wrists as she sat in front of the telly.</p> <p>\u201cI remember her saying she felt peculiar, very strange. Five or 10 minutes after that she disappeared. I went into the bathroom and found her lying in the bath. There was no water in the bath and she was fully clothed, looking pretty lifeless.</p> <p>\u201cI tried to bring her round. I got her out of the bath on to the floor and realised something was wrong. She wasn\u2019t breathing, she was foaming a bit, shaking. I phoned 999. They talked me through what to do.\u201d Rowley performed CPR on Sturgess, worried that he might crack a rib because she was so slight.</p> <p>Paramedics took Sturgess to hospital in Salisbury and Rowley rang her parents. He told them that he feared Sturgess was seriously ill and her mother, Caroline, tried to reassure him she would be fine.</p> <p>Later, Rowley was about to catch a bus into Salisbury to visit Sturgess when he began to feel strange. He looked at himself in a mirror and was alarmed at how tiny his pupils were.</p> <p>The next thing Rowley remembers is waking up in hospital. His memory was so badly affected that when police told him that Sturgess had died, he could not remember he even had a partner. His memory gradually returned and he was told that the perfume bottle could have been the source of the contamination. \u201cIt blew me away,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Over the months, counter-terrorism police have repeatedly questioned Rowley, sometimes making him feel like a suspect rather than a victim. \u201cThey were focusing on where I was when the Skripals were poisoned. I felt I was being interrogated. That kind of hurt but I suppose they have to go about their job.\u201d</p> <p>At first Rowley <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/18/novichok-poisonings-police-search-salisbury-park-visited-by-couple\">thought he was getting better</a>. \u201cBut my eyes and balance started playing tricks on me. My right eye is still playing up. I can\u2019t focus on things.\u201d He finds it difficult to gauge distance, even struggling when he steps off a kerb, and feels he is clumsier than he used to be, often dropping things.</p> <p>He cannot fully extend his left arm and struggles to get his coat on.

      "body": "<p>When gallerist Johann K\u00f6nig sold his first artwork at the tender age of 21, he had a secret he only reluctantly shared with his buyer.

      "bodyText": "When gallerist Johann K\u00f6nig sold his first artwork at the tender age of 21, he had a secret he only reluctantly shared with his buyer. Severely sight-impaired as a result of a freak accident in his teens, K\u00f6nig could barely make out the contours of the painting he was exchanging for \u20ac4,500. \u201cHow serious can you take someone who can\u2019t see the artwork they are trying to sell you?\u201d K\u00f6nig told the Guardian at his office inside his gallery, a converted brutalist church in Berlin\u2019s Kreuzberg district. \u201cThat fear was always in the back of my mind. I always thought someone would find me out.\u201d But in what he calls his \u201ccoming out\u201d memoir, published in Germany this month with the title Blind Gallerist, K\u00f6nig argues his disability has been key to the success he has enjoyed since, encouraging him to develop a distinctly personal idea of what makes good art, and enabling him to navigate an industry that can bedazzle and lead people astray with flashy exteriors. Born in Cologne in 1981, K\u00f6nig grew up in art world royalty. His mother Edda was an actress and illustrator previously married to filmmaker Wim Wenders, his father Kasper a curator whom S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung has dubbed \u201cthe inventor of Germany\u2019s post-war avant-garde\u201d. His uncle Walther is a leading seller and publisher of art books, painter Gerhard Richter was the best man at his parents\u2019 wedding, and Andy Warhol and David Hockney were regular visitors at his childhood home. But an accident when he was twelve cut Johann K\u00f6nig\u2019s access to the visual business that had made his family\u2019s name. Playing with fishing weights and the gunpowder from a starter pistol in his teenage bedroom, he accidentally caused an explosion which severely damaged both his eyes. Going blind did not mean the world around him went black, however. \u201cIn truth you mostly see a dark rusty brown, a mix of red, brown and black, little craters that appear to be moving\u201d, he writes in his book. \u201cYour vision is as if you want to gaze out from the inside of your body and hit an impenetrable layer. You see as if your vision has been locked inside your body\u201d. Against the advice of his family, K\u00f6nig started his own small gallery in Berlin when he was only 21, specialising at first in concept art and sound installations. His breakthrough work, by Danish sculptor Jeppe Hein, consisted of a motorised metal ball that wrecked the gallery\u2019s interior as soon as a visitor entered the exhibition space.

The gallery, which lies almost exactly on the geographic centre point of the German capital, has hosted fashion shows as well as art exhibitions, and sells clothes as well as \u201csouvenirs\u201d made by its artists, photogenically curated on K\u00f6nig\u2019s Instagram feed. In the wake of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU, K\u00f6nig\u2019s gallery released a collection of hoodies in the bright blue colours of the EU flag, but with one yellow star missing from the circle. Within weeks, the \u201cEUnify Hoodie\u201d became ubiquitous in Berlin\u2019s hippest galleries, and in February this year even 73-year-old veteran diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger was seen wearing one during the opening of the Munich Security Conference.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s six commonwealth national parks \u2013 including Kakadu and Uluru \u2013 are not being effectively managed by the government corporation tasked with preserving them, an audit has found. In a report released on Friday, the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) said the director of national parks had failed to meet benchmarks set by auditors to probe the agency\u2019s management of some of the nation\u2019s most precious land. The audit found the director had no \u201crobust\u201d way of knowing that park management and operational plans were being implemented. The agency\u2019s work within the six parks was also \u201cnot effectively measured, monitored and reported on\u201d. Among the seven recommendations, which were accepted by the agency, the auditors said a review was required to ensure the director of national parks was \u201cmeeting the requirements of the EPBC [Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation] Act\u201d. \u201cThe director does not effectively manage risks to the objectives of the parks,\u201d the report said. Under the EPBC Act, the agency is tasked with conserving and managing biodiversity and cultural heritage of 2.1 million hectares across three mainland and three island national parks (Christmas Island, Norfolk Island and Pulu Keeling). It must establish a 10-year park management plans to protect the sites, benefit traditional owners and enhance their value as tourism destinations. Three of the mainland parks \u2013 Uluru-Kata Tjuta and Kakadu as well as Booderee \u2013 are jointly managed by the director of national parks and traditional owners. But the agency had not established \u201cconstructive relationships with traditional owners at the jointly managed national parks\u201d, the report said. In one case study, eight green parrots died in a translocation project after they transferred from Phillip Island to Norfolk Island. While the parrots were moved in early April 2017 and had died by the end of June 2017, key bureaucrats were not told of any issues until August. Even then, the project\u2019s status was only changed to \u201camber\u201d and a report on the deaths was not filed until November. While the director had established five-year climate change strategies for the six parks, they had expired in 2017. \u201cThere has been no specific climate change plan or strategy in place since 2017,\u201d the report said. The director\u2019s policies suggests \u201chigh risk\u201d corrective action tasks should be completed within seven days, yet at Kakudu alone there were 26 outstanding tasks dating back to September or December 2016. There were similar findings at Uluru-Kata Tjuta. In another case study, the report said Kakudu\u2019s executive board did not receive warnings about \u201cdiesel \u2026 being released to the environment through a leaking bowser\u201d . \u201cThis is of great concern given the location of these facilities within parks that are world-heritage listed for their environmental values,\u201d an internal report said. Yet internal documents appeared to claim the issue was resolved before it had actually been dealt with. Lyndon Schneiders, the national director at the Wilderness Society, said he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d the audit office had \u201cfound a range of deep and systemic problems\u201d. But he was reluctant to blame the director of national parks, arguing the federal government had \u201clargely washed its hands of looking after national parks and protected areas\u201d. \u201cWe need a completely new system where the government takes responsibility of our national parks,\u201d he said. The director of national parks accepted the audit\u2019s seven recommendations, which called for a review of its internal processes. \u201cThe director is committed to continuous improvement in the delivery against legislative and related objectives for commonwealth national park management,\u201d it said. \u201cWorking in partnership with traditional owners, improving the governance and performance of the joint boards of management for Kakadu, Booderee and Ulu\u1e5fu-Kata Tju\u1e6fa national parks will be a particular and ongoing focus.\u201d Auditors reviewed internal documents, observed fieldwork and interviewed departmental staff, traditional owners and board members from the jointly managed parks, the report said.",

      "body": "<p>There is a Somali phrase, says Nimko Ali, that sums up the paradox of her status both as a survivor of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/female-genital-mutilation\" title=\"\">female genital mutilation</a> (FGM) and an activist seeking to eradicate it. \u201c\u2018<em>Bilaa xishood</em>\u2019. It means \u2018Do you have no shame?\u2019 Since the age of seven, when I started talking about my vagina after FGM, I was told that I should be ashamed. But I wouldn\u2019t have been talking about these things if FGM hadn\u2019t happened to me. FGM was the patriarchy\u2019s way of trying to break me and keep me silent, but it made me the loudest person in the room.\u201d</p> <p>As the co-founder of the charity <a href=\"http://www.dofeve.org/\" title=\"\">Daughters of Eve</a> and, latterly, The Five Foundation, 36-year-old Ali has devoted herself to campaigning against FGM and gender inequality for nearly 10 years. Her aim is to end FGM by 2030. It is a practice that, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/en/\" title=\"\">according to the World Health Organisation</a>, has affected 200 million women and girls alive today. This goal is ambitious, she says, but achievable. When we meet over coffee in Soho, central London, she has just come from a photo call at Lancaster House for the recipients of the Queen\u2019s birthday honours, in which she has been awarded an OBE. As Ali told the gathered press, her mother would be \u201cboth proud and embarrassed \u2026 The idea that I got my award for talking about my vagina is not something that is celebrated in my community.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother may be similarly uneasy about Ali\u2019s first book <em>What We\u2019re Told Not to Talk About (But We\u2019re Going to Anyway)</em>, a series of intimate, illuminating and often devastating conversations with women on the subjects of sex, masturbation, periods, pregnancy, the menopause and more. It was initially called <em>Rude</em>, but Ali worried that that would suggest the contents were somehow shocking or indecent. These are conversations, she says, that take place in quiet corners between women but are rarely aired publicly due to fear of judgment. \u201cIt\u2019s not shameful or rude,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just doing what we\u2019ve always been told not to do.\u201d</p> <p>Ali spoke to 152 women across 14 countries in the course of her research; many she encountered through her campaigning. It wasn\u2019t hard to get them to open up since, she says, \u201cevery woman I\u2019ve ever met has a story to tell\u201d. In the end, 42 made it into the book, all of whom appear under pseudonyms. We meet Becky, who is homeless and whose biggest challenge lies in dealing with her periods. Male rough sleepers, she says, \u201cdon\u2019t know the fear of finally having enough money to buy something to eat but worrying about dripping blood on the floor while you wait in line for a bag of chips\u201d. We are introduced to Ayaan, who suffered extreme tearing during childbirth which led to a fistula, causing her family to shun her, and Amina, who struggles to face up to the realities of menopause: \u201cI\u2019ve seen friends crumple at a cancer diagnosis,\u201d says Amina, \u201cnot just because they had a serious illness, it\u2019s more seeing their health and life just disappear in front of them. That\u2019s what I felt. My future was gone in a puff of hormones.\u201d</p> <p>I ask her which subject women found most difficult to discuss? \u201cSexual pleasure, definitely,\u201d Ali replies. \u201cWomen don\u2019t think they have the right to be happy, sexually. Especially empowered women, actually. I think orgasms and sexual pleasure are a human right. I guard these things with my life, though I have learned to become more diplomatic and nicer [to partners], and realise that men have emotions too.\u201d</p> <p>In the book\u2019s introduction, Ali reveals her dislike of the C-word as a pejorative. \u201cI want to reclaim it,\u201d she tells me. \u201cCunts are deep and warm and incredibly magical places where humanity came from, and into which men are trying to return. They want to be hugged by it. But because they\u2019re not always intelligent enough to express that, they want to take it by force. And when you take it by force, it becomes less warm and less hospitable.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Personally and politically, Tories have been better to my vagina than the Labour party, and I love them for that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ali isn\u2019t one to mince her words on topics that some might view as difficult or embarrassing \u2013 as she notes in her book, \u201cit\u2019s not very British to talk about fannies\u201d. Perhaps less well known is how funny she is. On politics, she remarks that \u201cpersonally and politically, Tories have been better to my vagina than the Labour party, and I love them for that\u201d. While she\u2019s never voted Conservative, she reveals that she has been known to date \u201ctall Tory men\u201d. For starters, she says, they share childhood trauma. \u201cThey were sent to boarding school at seven and I had FGM. But also there\u2019s the fact that they\u2019re so privileged, that they\u2019ve never needed to fight for anything. People say to me \u2018How could you?\u2019 and I say, \u2018I want someone that comes home and his biggest issue is, \u2018I couldn\u2019t get a seat on the train today.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>By comparison, she finds men on the left of politics exasperating: \u201cThey can\u2019t listen. There\u2019s two things that they can\u2019t understand and that\u2019s when the left is racist and when the left is sexist. They\u2019ll start questioning: \u2018How do you know that\u2019s racist?\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018Thank you, white guy. You\u2019re asking that because you\u2019ve never felt violated in your life.\u2019 They don\u2019t understand that they are at the top of the pyramid. They\u2019re, like, \u2018I\u2019ve got struggles too\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"400966e941650d0ea4b71f6907b6e70fd7156396\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/400966e941650d0ea4b71f6907b6e70fd7156396/178_524_7081_4248/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ali (third from left) delivering a petition against FGM with her fellow campaigners to Michael Gove in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ali (third from left) delivering a petition against FGM with her fellow campaigners to Michael Gove in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I ask her about the Conservative leadership contest and her backing of Boris Johnson, whom she first approached on Putney High Street to talk about FGM shortly after she\u2019d moved to London. She says Johnson listened to her and worked to protect young girls in London when he was mayor. \u201cI saw tribalism almost have my grandfather killed when I was a child because he was vilified for being successful, so I\u2019m not about taking sides,\u201d she explains. \u201cFor me, the personal is political, and there\u2019s nothing more personal to me than my anatomy and those of girls around the world. My loyalty comes from the things that you do, not the tribal things you wear.\u201d</p> <p>The eldest of six siblings, Ali \u2013 who calls Bristol home, but spends much of her time in London \u2013 was born in 1983 in Somaliland. When she was small the family would split their time between her maternal grandparents in the capital Hargeisa (her mother went back to have each of her babies), her paternal grandparents in Manchester, and Dubai, where her father worked in the oil industry. Her early life was immensely privileged. \u201cMy name means \u2018a gift from God\u2019 \u2013 I was a brat. That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re the firstborn and the first grandchild, and you get to sleep in a gold cot.\u201d</p> <p>When she was four, they settled in Manchester but then, late in 1988, went back to Hargeisa to stay with her grandparents, as Ali\u2019s mother was heavily pregnant. Ali recalls lots of men coming and going around the house. Later she learned that her grandfather was funding a revolutionary militia preparing to bring down the military regime. One evening, government solders burst into the house and took her grandfather away; the next day they returned to take everyone\u2019s passports. Bombs were falling across the city and Ali remembers her grandmother telling her to stand in the corner of a room to avoid falling masonry. Eventually, they fled the city by hiding in the back of trucks and headed to Djibouti, where Ali\u2019s aunt lived.</p> <p>It was there, at her aunt\u2019s house, that a woman arrived one afternoon wearing what looked like a black burqa \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I didn\u2019t like her. To this day, if I feel uncomfortable with someone, I get up and leave.\u201d Ali ran out of the house and had to be dragged back by her mother. \u201cI had no idea what was going on. I didn\u2019t want to scream, as up until then nothing wrong or harmful had ever come to me at the hands of my parents. When I got back into the house, this woman in black, who was the cutter, started shouting at me.\u201d</p> <p>Ali doesn\u2019t remember anything after this until she woke up hours later with her mother helping her go to the toilet. \u201cThe pain of peeing was beyond anything I\u2019d known,\u201d she recalls. She had undergone the most severe form of FGM, known as infibulation. This means that, as well as being cut, the edges of her vulva had been stitched together to ensure she couldn\u2019t have sexual intercourse \u2013 \u201cto which the obvious response is: \u2018Hello, who is having sex with seven-year-olds?\u2019\u201d. On returning to Manchester, Ali told her teacher what had been done to her, expecting her to be appalled. Instead, she said: \u201cWell, that\u2019s what happens to girls like you. It\u2019s like a bar mitzvah.\u201d The family later moved to a council estate in Cardiff, which was a comedown from their wealthy lifestyle in Hargeisa \u2013 \u201cI went from wearing Lacoste to C&amp;A. It gave me a humbling reality check.\u201d At 11, she collapsed on the school playground from an infection caused by her FGM, leading to her surgical deinfibulation in hospital. She nearly died.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc0d6f0d3ad367c662e971a6cc431feb92a4dbff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc0d6f0d3ad367c662e971a6cc431feb92a4dbff/0_135_2755_1653/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nimko Ali Leyla Hussein Daughters of Eve.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Speaking out \u2026 Ali (right) with Leyla Hussein, co-founder of Daughters of Eve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart C Wilson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After leaving school, Ali studied law at Bristol University, after which she got a job working as a civil servant in public health. While attending a Feminist Society event in 2006, she was asked by a local teacher if she would talk to a group of Somali girls at her school about aspiration. On meeting the girls, Ali discovered that all but one of them were FGM survivors. It was this, along with the birth of her niece, that prompted her to start campaigning against the practice. In 2010 she co-founded Daughters of Eve; three years later, worn out by her dual roles, she finally quit her job. Ali has long made peace with her mother and grandmother about what happened to her. \u201cThis is what was done to them \u2013 we have to understand the patriarchal system in which they lived. I\u2019m still meeting girls today who say, \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can live without cutting my daughter.\u2019 This is why I fundamentally think that if a woman has had FGM, there needs to be protective mechanisms put in place for when she has a daughter. Because those girls will be at risk.\u201d</p> <p>Writing the book was a cathartic experience during which Ali learned a lot about herself. \u201cFrom hearing about other people\u2019s lives, I realise that I do want kids and I do want to settle down but there are things that I won\u2019t sacrifice. If I wait and I don\u2019t have kids, will I be OK with it? I think I will.\u201d</p> <p>When she finally wins the war against FGM, I ask, what will she do professionally? \u201cAside from opening a B&amp;B?\u201d she laughs. \u201cMy thing is convening unlikely minds. I don\u2019t always work with people I agree with. I punch and hug at the same time. I want to be able to challenge power in a constructive way.\u201d Much of what she does now, she says, is \u201cjust weird\u201d, not least talking to Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, or to Barack Obama, about her vagina. She\u2019s proud of her OBE, but it\u2019s nothing next to her pride in the children in her family, who are vehemently anti-FGM, even if they don\u2019t all understand what it is. \u201cThere are 11 girls in my family who haven\u2019t been cut, and that\u2019s more than the women who have been cut. That change in one generation is amazing. It shows us what is possible when the silence stops.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 What We\u2019re Told Not to Talk About (But We\u2019re Going to Anyway) is published on 27 June by Viking.

As Ali told the gathered press, her mother would be \u201cboth proud and embarrassed \u2026 The idea that I got my award for talking about my vagina is not something that is celebrated in my community.\u201d Her mother may be similarly uneasy about Ali\u2019s first book What We\u2019re Told Not to Talk About (But We\u2019re Going to Anyway), a series of intimate, illuminating and often devastating conversations with women on the subjects of sex, masturbation, periods, pregnancy, the menopause and more. It was initially called Rude, but Ali worried that that would suggest the contents were somehow shocking or indecent. These are conversations, she says, that take place in quiet corners between women but are rarely aired publicly due to fear of judgment. \u201cIt\u2019s not shameful or rude,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just doing what we\u2019ve always been told not to do.\u201d Ali spoke to 152 women across 14 countries in the course of her research; many she encountered through her campaigning. It wasn\u2019t hard to get them to open up since, she says, \u201cevery woman I\u2019ve ever met has a story to tell\u201d. In the end, 42 made it into the book, all of whom appear under pseudonyms. We meet Becky, who is homeless and whose biggest challenge lies in dealing with her periods. Male rough sleepers, she says, \u201cdon\u2019t know the fear of finally having enough money to buy something to eat but worrying about dripping blood on the floor while you wait in line for a bag of chips\u201d. We are introduced to Ayaan, who suffered extreme tearing during childbirth which led to a fistula, causing her family to shun her, and Amina, who struggles to face up to the realities of menopause: \u201cI\u2019ve seen friends crumple at a cancer diagnosis,\u201d says Amina, \u201cnot just because they had a serious illness, it\u2019s more seeing their health and life just disappear in front of them. That\u2019s what I felt. My future was gone in a puff of hormones.\u201d I ask her which subject women found most difficult to discuss? \u201cSexual pleasure, definitely,\u201d Ali replies. \u201cWomen don\u2019t think they have the right to be happy, sexually. Especially empowered women, actually. I think orgasms and sexual pleasure are a human right. I guard these things with my life, though I have learned to become more diplomatic and nicer [to partners], and realise that men have emotions too.\u201d In the book\u2019s introduction, Ali reveals her dislike of the C-word as a pejorative. \u201cI want to reclaim it,\u201d she tells me. \u201cCunts are deep and warm and incredibly magical places where humanity came from, and into which men are trying to return. They want to be hugged by it. But because they\u2019re not always intelligent enough to express that, they want to take it by force. And when you take it by force, it becomes less warm and less hospitable.\u201d Ali isn\u2019t one to mince her words on topics that some might view as difficult or embarrassing \u2013 as she notes in her book, \u201cit\u2019s not very British to talk about fannies\u201d. Perhaps less well known is how funny she is. On politics, she remarks that \u201cpersonally and politically, Tories have been better to my vagina than the Labour party, and I love them for that\u201d. While she\u2019s never voted Conservative, she reveals that she has been known to date \u201ctall Tory men\u201d. For starters, she says, they share childhood trauma. \u201cThey were sent to boarding school at seven and I had FGM. But also there\u2019s the fact that they\u2019re so privileged, that they\u2019ve never needed to fight for anything. People say to me \u2018How could you?\u2019 and I say, \u2018I want someone that comes home and his biggest issue is, \u2018I couldn\u2019t get a seat on the train today.\u2019\u201d By comparison, she finds men on the left of politics exasperating: \u201cThey can\u2019t listen. There\u2019s two things that they can\u2019t understand and that\u2019s when the left is racist and when the left is sexist. They\u2019ll start questioning: \u2018How do you know that\u2019s racist?\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018Thank you, white guy. You\u2019re asking that because you\u2019ve never felt violated in your life.\u2019 They don\u2019t understand that they are at the top of the pyramid. They\u2019re, like, \u2018I\u2019ve got struggles too\u2019.\u201d I ask her about the Conservative leadership contest and her backing of Boris Johnson, whom she first approached on Putney High Street to talk about FGM shortly after she\u2019d moved to London. She says Johnson listened to her and worked to protect young girls in London when he was mayor. \u201cI saw tribalism almost have my grandfather killed when I was a child because he was vilified for being successful, so I\u2019m not about taking sides,\u201d she explains. \u201cFor me, the personal is political, and there\u2019s nothing more personal to me than my anatomy and those of girls around the world. My loyalty comes from the things that you do, not the tribal things you wear.\u201d The eldest of six siblings, Ali \u2013 who calls Bristol home, but spends much of her time in London \u2013 was born in 1983 in Somaliland. When she was small the family would split their time between her maternal grandparents in the capital Hargeisa (her mother went back to have each of her babies), her paternal grandparents in Manchester, and Dubai, where her father worked in the oil industry. Her early life was immensely privileged. \u201cMy name means \u2018a gift from God\u2019 \u2013 I was a brat. That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re the firstborn and the first grandchild, and you get to sleep in a gold cot.\u201d When she was four, they settled in Manchester but then, late in 1988, went back to Hargeisa to stay with her grandparents, as Ali\u2019s mother was heavily pregnant. Ali recalls lots of men coming and going around the house. Later she learned that her grandfather was funding a revolutionary militia preparing to bring down the military regime. One evening, government solders burst into the house and took her grandfather away; the next day they returned to take everyone\u2019s passports. Bombs were falling across the city and Ali remembers her grandmother telling her to stand in the corner of a room to avoid falling masonry. Eventually, they fled the city by hiding in the back of trucks and headed to Djibouti, where Ali\u2019s aunt lived. It was there, at her aunt\u2019s house, that a woman arrived one afternoon wearing what looked like a black burqa \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I didn\u2019t like her. To this day, if I feel uncomfortable with someone, I get up and leave.\u201d Ali ran out of the house and had to be dragged back by her mother. \u201cI had no idea what was going on. I didn\u2019t want to scream, as up until then nothing wrong or harmful had ever come to me at the hands of my parents. When I got back into the house, this woman in black, who was the cutter, started shouting at me.\u201d Ali doesn\u2019t remember anything after this until she woke up hours later with her mother helping her go to the toilet. \u201cThe pain of peeing was beyond anything I\u2019d known,\u201d she recalls. She had undergone the most severe form of FGM, known as infibulation. This means that, as well as being cut, the edges of her vulva had been stitched together to ensure she couldn\u2019t have sexual intercourse \u2013 \u201cto which the obvious response is: \u2018Hello, who is having sex with seven-year-olds?\u2019\u201d. On returning to Manchester, Ali told her teacher what had been done to her, expecting her to be appalled. Instead, she said: \u201cWell, that\u2019s what happens to girls like you. It\u2019s like a bar mitzvah.\u201d The family later moved to a council estate in Cardiff, which was a comedown from their wealthy lifestyle in Hargeisa \u2013 \u201cI went from wearing Lacoste to C&amp;A. It gave me a humbling reality check.\u201d At 11, she collapsed on the school playground from an infection caused by her FGM, leading to her surgical deinfibulation in hospital. She nearly died. After leaving school, Ali studied law at Bristol University, after which she got a job working as a civil servant in public health. While attending a Feminist Society event in 2006, she was asked by a local teacher if she would talk to a group of Somali girls at her school about aspiration. On meeting the girls, Ali discovered that all but one of them were FGM survivors. It was this, along with the birth of her niece, that prompted her to start campaigning against the practice. In 2010 she co-founded Daughters of Eve; three years later, worn out by her dual roles, she finally quit her job. Ali has long made peace with her mother and grandmother about what happened to her. \u201cThis is what was done to them \u2013 we have to understand the patriarchal system in which they lived. I\u2019m still meeting girls today who say, \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can live without cutting my daughter.\u2019 This is why I fundamentally think that if a woman has had FGM, there needs to be protective mechanisms put in place for when she has a daughter. Because those girls will be at risk.\u201d Writing the book was a cathartic experience during which Ali learned a lot about herself. \u201cFrom hearing about other people\u2019s lives, I realise that I do want kids and I do want to settle down but there are things that I won\u2019t sacrifice. If I wait and I don\u2019t have kids, will I be OK with it? I think I will.\u201d When she finally wins the war against FGM, I ask, what will she do professionally? \u201cAside from opening a B&amp;B?\u201d she laughs. \u201cMy thing is convening unlikely minds. I don\u2019t always work with people I agree with. I punch and hug at the same time. I want to be able to challenge power in a constructive way.\u201d Much of what she does now, she says, is \u201cjust weird\u201d, not least talking to Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, or to Barack Obama, about her vagina. She\u2019s proud of her OBE, but it\u2019s nothing next to her pride in the children in her family, who are vehemently anti-FGM, even if they don\u2019t all understand what it is. \u201cThere are 11 girls in my family who haven\u2019t been cut, and that\u2019s more than the women who have been cut. That change in one generation is amazing. It shows us what is possible when the silence stops.\u201d \u2022 What We\u2019re Told Not to Talk About (But We\u2019re Going to Anyway) is published on 27 June by Viking.

      "bodyText": "In May we asked you: what are the alternatives to endless economic growth? Dozens of you got in touch with tips and suggestions. And so we persuaded the Guardian economics correspondent Richard Partington to try to make sense of it all by taking a good hard look at GDP and the alternatives. His conclusion: GDP is an anachronism, but it\u2019ll take a major systemic upheaval to shift over to a more nuanced measure of progress. Coincidentally, the alternatives to GDP were also the subject of the latest Reasons to be Cheerful podcast by Ed Miliband and Geoff Lloyd. Perhaps a better metric would be the number of trees planted annually. It\u2019s a figure in the billions, as Patrick Barkham discovered, and a number that is also growing strongly. Will it be enough? After all, trees are not just good for the environment, they are good for mental health too, as Harriet Sherwood learned. Lucky numbers Alcohol sales in Scotland have fallen to their lowest level in 25 years. Alcohol-free beers are among the fastest-growing beverages in Germany. Among the world\u2019s poorest communities, more than 2 billion people gained access to a decent toilet in the first two decades of this century. And among the richest, Americans gave almost half a trillion dollars to charity in 2018. What we liked In stories about ageing, these glorious centenarians, featured by Positive News, are an example to us all. We also loved this Atlantic article on how to deal with life after you\u2019ve peaked professionally, particularly because it includes the great quote: \u201cUnhappy is he who depends on success to be happy.\u201d What we heard Kostas Karoubas emailed in from Greece to share his experience with reforesting in arid terrains. Reforestation in tropical climates is \u201ceasy\u201d (relatively)! Planting and rehabilitating arid zones becomes more difficult. Here is my experience over the last 16 years, and I hope it will be helpful. Aminul Hoque Chowdhury got in touch from Bangladesh. We are the Green Ukhiya Star Team, a team of volunteers gathered as part of relief operations during the Rohingya influx in Cox\u2019s Bazar. To compensate the great disaster and protect the environment we are planting 1 million trees. It is essential to gradually bring back vegetation cover in this area for an adaptable living condition for the displaced Rohingya people while they stay in their temporary shelters and also for the local host people.

      "body": "<p>It is 9.30am and Jay Tabb is shuffling around stall No 13 inside the horseshoe-shaped stable block at the Northern Racing College, tacking up Coombe Hill, his second of four lots, before leading the 18-year-old thoroughbred out to the seven-furlong woodchip gallop. His day began more than four hours ago, as it does every morning here during a 12-week foundation course, which he has nearly completed, by getting up to go for a half-hour run in a sweat suit to ensure he meets the 11st weight limit \u2013 inclusive of skullcap, body protector and boots. Tabb, a professional footballer in his previous life, jumps on the scales in the offices to double-check. \u201cI don\u2019t want to not ride basically,\u201d he says.</p> <p>On a sunny day in South Yorkshire, in the grounds of Rossington Hall and where peacocks roam, the 5ft 4in former Reading midfielder, who retired from football three years ago, explains swapping shin pads for saddle pads with a smile. The chipper instructors, former jockeys Philip Varley and Lee Swift, chivvy the students, including Tabb \u2013 whose hands are weathered and blistered from mucking out and \u201cbeing keen as mustard\u201d to sweep the yard during his first days on the programme \u2013 as he wraps tendon boots around the horse\u2019s legs, having applied the bridle, girth and stirrups.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s crazy how quickly you progress,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew nothing. I couldn\u2019t pick a horse\u2019s feet; I couldn\u2019t put a head collar on or anything like that. I did a bit of research online, came up here for an open day, an interview, and it went from there. I get stuff right and I get stuff wrong every day but the main thing is I\u2019m learning. It sounds a bit soppy but when you first stroke a horse, it\u2019s just a really nice feeling.\u201d</p> <p>For Tabb this is not about becoming a jockey \u2013 \u201cthe reality is I\u2019m 35 and coming into it very late\u201d \u2013 but he is serious about working in racing and trading life in west London for the Somerset countryside. Tabb, who graduates from the college this week, has been accepted to work at the trainer Philip Hobbs\u2019s yard in Minehead, where he will begin his level two apprenticeship and, down the line, he hopes to ride in a charity race.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you watch racing, you think: \u2018How has he not won there? How has he fallen there?\u2019 But, until you sit on a racehorse yourself, you are never going to respect a jockey like you should do because they are putting their lives on the line and they have to be a lot fitter than you think. People look at jockeys and see them as being small and skinny, and think \u2018Oh, anyone can do it\u2019 but it is really hard to give a horse a good ride. My respect levels for jockeys have gone through the roof.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c256a92a92e02c59b6ded11f5468442ffa3e3ad8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c256a92a92e02c59b6ded11f5468442ffa3e3ad8/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jay Tabb on the gallops.

If you restitute there is a transfer of the property rights and the new holder of those rights can loan you the item.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a symbolic dimension around property rights,\u201d added Savoy. \u201cIf you can loan your objects you are respected in the museum world because you can impose your will and conditions.

      "bodyText": "The authors of an influential report on colonial-era artefacts, which recommended a restitution programme to transfer hundreds of items from European institutions to Africa, have criticised the British Museum for acting like \u201can ostrich with its head in the sand\u201d. The Senegalese economist Felwine Sarr and the French art historian B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Savoy, who were asked to write the report by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, after he said the return of artefacts would be a priority during his tenure, said the British Museum was not addressing the issue. \u201cThere\u2019s an expression in French, la politique de l\u2019autruche, which means something is in front of you and you say you can\u2019t see it, like an ostrich with its head in the sand,\u201d said Sarr. \u201cThey will have to respond and they can\u2019t hide themselves any longer on the issue.\u201d The 252-page report published in November 2018 made a series of recommendations, chief among them being that France should respond favourably and grant restitutions to African countries that request the return of objects taken during the colonial era. For Sarr and Savoy, the loan of items to African museums \u2013 proposed by the British Museum and other major European institutions in the case of the Benin bronzes, which were stolen during a punitive expedition in 1897 \u2013 is not sufficient. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough because in a loan the right of the property belongs to you,\u201d said Sarr. \u201cYou loan something that you own, it\u2019s your property. If you restitute there is a transfer of the property rights and the new holder of those rights can loan you the item.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a symbolic dimension around property rights,\u201d added Savoy. \u201cIf you can loan your objects you are respected in the museum world because you can impose your will and conditions. In the capitalist sphere being able to loan gives you power and it means you can impose your own rights.\u201d In response, a spokesperson for the British Museum said it welcomed a \u201ctransparent focus on the provenance of objects\u201d, adding that the museum agreed with the report\u2019s call for the establishment of \u201cnew and more equitable relationships between Europe and Africa\u201d. \u201cWe believe the strength of the collection is its breadth and depth which allows millions of visitors an understanding of the cultures of the world and how they interconnect \u2013 whether through trade, migration, conquest, or peaceful exchange,\u201d the spokesperson added. Since the release of the report African countries, including Ivory Coast, Senegal and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, have made formal requests for the return of artefacts, and European countries including France and Germany have committed to handing back objects. The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam has opened talks with Sri Lanka and Indonesia and described the Netherlands\u2019 failure to return stolen artefacts as a \u201cdisgrace\u201d. The report, known colloquially as the Macron report, was described as radical by some in the art world upon its release, but the authors disagree. \u201cIt\u2019s not us who are radical; it\u2019s historical facts which are radical,\u201d said Savoy. \u201cThere was a taboo around this fact for many centuries in Europe, the fact that many major museums have collections based on plundering.

      "body": "<p>Eighteen months after Tatenda Taibu had become <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/149496.html\" title=\"\">the youngest captain in the history</a> of Test cricket, having been chosen to lead Zimbabwe at the age of 20 in April 2004, his life was under threat. In a sinister warning he was forced to look at images of death in Harare. That distressing experience led to his temporary exile as he went on the run from Robert Mugabe\u2019s enforcers.</p> <p>All these years later, on a sleepy morning in the Liverpool suburb of Crosby, where he and his family now live, it is quiet inside Taibu\u2019s front room. We have reached the point in his story where he had been summoned to the office of a minister in Mugabe\u2019s government in October 2005. Taibu had just announced his retirement from <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/other_international/zimbabwe/4467062.stm\" title=\"\">international cricket in protest</a> against his players not being paid or treated fairly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/14/robin-smith-cricket-england-interview-donald-mcrae\">Robin Smith: \u2018I drank vodka from the bottle. There were no half measures\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Two years after Zimbabwe\u2019s former captain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/24/andy-flower-zimbabwe-protest-henry-olonga\" title=\"\">Andy Flower</a>, and their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2000/may/15/cricket\" title=\"\">fast bowler Henry Olonga</a> had been forced to flee the country after they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/feb/16/cricketworldcup2003.zimbabwe\" title=\"\">wore black armbands</a> during the 2003 World Cup to highlight the death of democracy under Mugabe, Taibu had a serious message to impart. Zimbabwean cricket was close to breaking point. He refused to play for his country until the authorities offered their cricketers proper financial support.</p> <p>His stand against inequity, <a href=\"https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/1087502\" title=\"\">and the corruption of cricket administrators</a>, was much lonelier than the joint protest of Flower and Olonga. Brave as they had been, Flower\u2019s and Olonga\u2019s plight had been followed closely by the international media. Taibu was alone when he retired on a similar point of principle and arrived at the minister\u2019s office.</p> <p>\u201cHe did not listen to much of what I wanted to tell him,\u201d Taibu says now. \u201cHe just went into his drawer, pulled out an envelope and threw it on the table. Then he went to his window and looked outside. My mind was racing. I started thinking: \u2018OK, I\u2019ve watched this in movies \u2013 but this is actually happening to me. What has he just thrown at me without saying a word? What\u2019s in the envelope? If it\u2019s money, does he want to buy my silence?\u2019 I had lots of questions running in my head.\u201d</p> <p>The 36-year-old Taibu looks up, his still boyish face creasing with a difficult memory. \u201cThe envelope was full of photographs. I pulled them out and the first one was a picture of a dead person. I was thinking: \u2018OK, now I\u2019m experiencing shock, because I did not expect this.\u2019 It was an upsetting photo. I flipped it over and looked at the second one. It was the same. These were gross pictures of dead people. It looked like a war. So I\u2019m thinking: \u2018What message is being relayed? If these were photos taken during the war [against white minority rule in the 1970s] is he telling me all white people are bad? Or is he telling me I could soon be dead myself? I knew he was married to a white woman so the first idea didn\u2019t make sense. He meant this as a warning to me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61f2107f3776513eb55836d3345ca42c37e7c0dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61f2107f3776513eb55836d3345ca42c37e7c0dd/0_0_2300_1380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taibu looks on as Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene plays a shot during a 2010 T20 World Cup match for Zimbabwe in Guyana.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taibu looks on as Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene plays a shot during a 2010 T20 World Cup match for Zimbabwe in Guyana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Indranil Mukherjee/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI had seen six photos and they were all bad. I pretended to look at the others while he stood silently at the window. Then I said: \u2018Thank you for your time, sir. I must go to another meeting.\u2019 I left his office as quickly as I could.\u201d</p> <p>Taibu had already been threatened by activists from Mugabe\u2019s Zanu-PF party who were involved in cricket administration. In his new autobiography, <a href=\"https://www.decoubertin.co.uk/Tatenda\" title=\"\">Keeper of the Faith</a>, he explains how he had been warned repeatedly on the phone that he would be beaten up and that he was \u201ca black boy being used\u201d. His wife, Loveness, had been trailed by anonymous cars and hounded on the phone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He said I had so much power but I didn\u2019t realise it. The only way to stop me using that power was to intimidate me into leaving</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As Zimbabwe\u2019s first black captain, and a pioneering young player who had proved it was possible to emerge from a development programme in the impoverished townships all the way to Test cricket, Taibu believes he should have been \u201ctheir poster boy. In the [Test] team at the age of 18, vice-captain at 19, captain at 20. But I was on the run, scared of what the future might hold for me and my family.\u201d</p> <p>Taibu is understated in detailing the fear he and his wife felt but he also makes it clear that they were being hounded out of the country. \u201cI was strong for a long time but things built up. Two cars followed us every time we went out. Two other cars were parked outside my home when we got back. We felt we could not go home because my house is electronic. I had to open the gate with a remote. There was the feeling that, if we opened the gates, then one of these cars would follow us in. So we drove off. We had no freedom. But the final straw was soon after our first son was born and Loveness almost got kidnapped. That\u2019s when we decided to leave.\u201d</p> <p>Exiled in Bangladesh, England and Namibia, Taibu was lost to international cricket for two years. When he returned to Zimbabwe he was told why he had been forced to flee. \u201cI met a Zanu-PF activist who was a cricket executive. He told me his mandate was to instil as much fear in me as possible so that I would leave the country. He said I had so much power but I didn\u2019t realise it. The only way to stop me using that power was to intimidate me into leaving.\u201d</p> <p>Taibu was only 24 and, yearning to play international cricket and to help engender change in Zimbabwe, he tried again. Mugabe\u2019s regime was so entrenched that cricket could have only a limited impact but, in sporting terms, Taibu\u2019s talent flourished. In the first ODI series he played on his return, in August 2007, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/zimvrsa/content/story/308349.html\" title=\"\">he scored 107 not out</a> against a South Africa attack led by Shaun Pollock, Makhaya Ntini, Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander.</p> <p>A wicketkeeper batsman, only 5ft 5in, Taibu was brave and skilful. He did well in both Test and limited-overs internationals and, just before he was exiled, he showed his promise in the longer form of the game. Walking out to the crease in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with Zimbabwe reeling at 37 for four in 2005, he followed up his first-innings 85 <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/23115721/taibu-ton-sets-grand-finale\" title=\"\">with a masterful knock of 153</a> which saved the Test. \u201cI think those two hundreds mean the most to me,\u201d he says now.</p> <p>\u201cThe 153 against Bangladesh was Test cricket but the one-day hundred against South Africa meant even more. I had just come back against a great bowling attack. I would even say the 40 I scored in the game before was more special. It was the first time I felt what they say about getting in the zone. A South African journalist said, \u2018That was some innings\u2019, because I hit Dale Steyn for three sixes. I told him I was going to score a hundred the next day \u2013 and I did. I just wish I could have played more games like that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Zimbabwe\u2019s poor results, financial woes and political problems kept them out of the Test arena from 2005 to 2011. Taibu\u2019s prime years, from 22 to 28, were spent in the wilderness. His Test career began in 2001 and ended in 2012 and, over 28 Tests, his <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/zimbabwe/content/player/55805.html\" title=\"\">batting average</a> in a struggling team was a creditable 30.31. He took 57 catches and made five stumpings.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we were taken out of Test cricket I was rated No 27 in the world as a batsman,\u201d Taibu says. \u201cI was only 22 and before that happened I had dreams of being world No 1 as a batsman in Test cricket. I was starting to really understand my game when it suddenly stopped for six years. I always felt it didn\u2019t matter that I was playing in a losing team.</p> <p>\u201cI learnt from Andy Flower [his mentor and former Test captain who went on to become England\u2019s head coach] always to look with long-range vision.

      "bodyText": "Eighteen months after Tatenda Taibu had become the youngest captain in the history of Test cricket, having been chosen to lead Zimbabwe at the age of 20 in April 2004, his life was under threat. In a sinister warning he was forced to look at images of death in Harare. That distressing experience led to his temporary exile as he went on the run from Robert Mugabe\u2019s enforcers. All these years later, on a sleepy morning in the Liverpool suburb of Crosby, where he and his family now live, it is quiet inside Taibu\u2019s front room. We have reached the point in his story where he had been summoned to the office of a minister in Mugabe\u2019s government in October 2005. Taibu had just announced his retirement from international cricket in protest against his players not being paid or treated fairly. Two years after Zimbabwe\u2019s former captain, Andy Flower, and their fast bowler Henry Olonga had been forced to flee the country after they wore black armbands during the 2003 World Cup to highlight the death of democracy under Mugabe, Taibu had a serious message to impart. Zimbabwean cricket was close to breaking point. He refused to play for his country until the authorities offered their cricketers proper financial support. His stand against inequity, and the corruption of cricket administrators, was much lonelier than the joint protest of Flower and Olonga. Brave as they had been, Flower\u2019s and Olonga\u2019s plight had been followed closely by the international media. Taibu was alone when he retired on a similar point of principle and arrived at the minister\u2019s office. \u201cHe did not listen to much of what I wanted to tell him,\u201d Taibu says now. \u201cHe just went into his drawer, pulled out an envelope and threw it on the table. Then he went to his window and looked outside. My mind was racing. I started thinking: \u2018OK, I\u2019ve watched this in movies \u2013 but this is actually happening to me. What has he just thrown at me without saying a word? What\u2019s in the envelope? If it\u2019s money, does he want to buy my silence?\u2019 I had lots of questions running in my head.\u201d The 36-year-old Taibu looks up, his still boyish face creasing with a difficult memory. \u201cThe envelope was full of photographs. I pulled them out and the first one was a picture of a dead person. I was thinking: \u2018OK, now I\u2019m experiencing shock, because I did not expect this.\u2019 It was an upsetting photo. I flipped it over and looked at the second one. It was the same. These were gross pictures of dead people. It looked like a war. So I\u2019m thinking: \u2018What message is being relayed? If these were photos taken during the war [against white minority rule in the 1970s] is he telling me all white people are bad? Or is he telling me I could soon be dead myself? I knew he was married to a white woman so the first idea didn\u2019t make sense. He meant this as a warning to me. \u201cI had seen six photos and they were all bad. I pretended to look at the others while he stood silently at the window. Then I said: \u2018Thank you for your time, sir. I must go to another meeting.\u2019 I left his office as quickly as I could.\u201d Taibu had already been threatened by activists from Mugabe\u2019s Zanu-PF party who were involved in cricket administration. In his new autobiography, Keeper of the Faith, he explains how he had been warned repeatedly on the phone that he would be beaten up and that he was \u201ca black boy being used\u201d. His wife, Loveness, had been trailed by anonymous cars and hounded on the phone. As Zimbabwe\u2019s first black captain, and a pioneering young player who had proved it was possible to emerge from a development programme in the impoverished townships all the way to Test cricket, Taibu believes he should have been \u201ctheir poster boy. In the [Test] team at the age of 18, vice-captain at 19, captain at 20. But I was on the run, scared of what the future might hold for me and my family.\u201d Taibu is understated in detailing the fear he and his wife felt but he also makes it clear that they were being hounded out of the country. \u201cI was strong for a long time but things built up. Two cars followed us every time we went out. Two other cars were parked outside my home when we got back. We felt we could not go home because my house is electronic. I had to open the gate with a remote. There was the feeling that, if we opened the gates, then one of these cars would follow us in. So we drove off. We had no freedom. But the final straw was soon after our first son was born and Loveness almost got kidnapped. That\u2019s when we decided to leave.\u201d Exiled in Bangladesh, England and Namibia, Taibu was lost to international cricket for two years. When he returned to Zimbabwe he was told why he had been forced to flee. \u201cI met a Zanu-PF activist who was a cricket executive. He told me his mandate was to instil as much fear in me as possible so that I would leave the country. He said I had so much power but I didn\u2019t realise it. The only way to stop me using that power was to intimidate me into leaving.\u201d Taibu was only 24 and, yearning to play international cricket and to help engender change in Zimbabwe, he tried again. Mugabe\u2019s regime was so entrenched that cricket could have only a limited impact but, in sporting terms, Taibu\u2019s talent flourished. In the first ODI series he played on his return, in August 2007, he scored 107 not out against a South Africa attack led by Shaun Pollock, Makhaya Ntini, Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander. A wicketkeeper batsman, only 5ft 5in, Taibu was brave and skilful. He did well in both Test and limited-overs internationals and, just before he was exiled, he showed his promise in the longer form of the game. Walking out to the crease in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with Zimbabwe reeling at 37 for four in 2005, he followed up his first-innings 85 with a masterful knock of 153 which saved the Test. \u201cI think those two hundreds mean the most to me,\u201d he says now. \u201cThe 153 against Bangladesh was Test cricket but the one-day hundred against South Africa meant even more. I had just come back against a great bowling attack. I would even say the 40 I scored in the game before was more special. It was the first time I felt what they say about getting in the zone. A South African journalist said, \u2018That was some innings\u2019, because I hit Dale Steyn for three sixes. I told him I was going to score a hundred the next day \u2013 and I did. I just wish I could have played more games like that.\u201d Zimbabwe\u2019s poor results, financial woes and political problems kept them out of the Test arena from 2005 to 2011. Taibu\u2019s prime years, from 22 to 28, were spent in the wilderness. His Test career began in 2001 and ended in 2012 and, over 28 Tests, his batting average in a struggling team was a creditable 30.31. He took 57 catches and made five stumpings. \u201cWhen we were taken out of Test cricket I was rated No 27 in the world as a batsman,\u201d Taibu says. \u201cI was only 22 and before that happened I had dreams of being world No 1 as a batsman in Test cricket. I was starting to really understand my game when it suddenly stopped for six years. I always felt it didn\u2019t matter that I was playing in a losing team. \u201cI learnt from Andy Flower [his mentor and former Test captain who went on to become England\u2019s head coach] always to look with long-range vision. I always thought you can\u2019t buy experience in a shop. So I\u2019m gaining experience right now, the hard way, and it will make me a much better player in the future. When I look back at my international career I value those times. The Australian, England, South African, Indian, Pakistan, West Indies and Sri Lankan teams we played against had some amazing cricketers.\u201d Taibu, his wife and their two sons have settled in Crosby.

We will stay in England the next five years at least. My eldest son [Tatenda Jr] wants to become a neurosurgeon and we are determined to help our boys reach their full potential.

Vweto II is a record of celestial instrumentals, forgoing her old-soul R&amp;B vocal to instead focus on slow-burning, bass-driven hip-hop and G-funk-inspired synth noodling (see especially: Nate Dogg\u2019s Eulogy).

      "bodyText": "As the first track on LA jazz singer and multi-intrumentalist Georgia Anne Muldrow\u2019s 18th album, Almost Trendy could be read as a mission statement from an artist who works happily and prolifically in the fringes. While jazz seeps slowly back into the mainstream, Muldrow\u2019s esoteric experimentations refuse to sit on-trend. It makes sense for Muldrow, then, that after the release of perhaps her most accessible album ever \u2013 the R&amp;B opus Overload, on Flying Lotus\u2019s label Brainfeeder last year \u2013 she\u2019s returned to her comfort zone (which is often firmly outside of the listener\u2019s). Vweto II is a record of celestial instrumentals, forgoing her old-soul R&amp;B vocal to instead focus on slow-burning, bass-driven hip-hop and G-funk-inspired synth noodling (see especially: Nate Dogg\u2019s Eulogy). Darkness simmers beneath, as on the menacingly low-riding Emo Blues, but for the most part, the record hits like sunshine on your face. Sprawling like a jam session, the record contains a kaleidoscopic blur of 1970s and 90s sonic references, through a 2050 filter. Across its 16 tracks, Muldrow deftly weaves the digital with the physical: on Old School Fonk, squelchy bass faces off with feathery, ASMR melodies; Big Mama Africa Jam is a pure sci-fi odyssey, and the uplifting single Brokenfolks provides a marching beat that strides confidently straight into futurist psychedia.

      "bodyText": "Do I really need a separate knife for veg, meat, fish and so on, or will just the one good kitchen knife do? Erica, Box Hill, Surrey It depends mainly on whether you want to keep your fingers attached to your hands, Erica. Chef Mark Birchall, whose restaurant Moor Hall near Ormskirk in Lancashire was last week voted the UK\u2019s best at the annual National Restaurant Awards, likens his knives to a toolkit: \u201cNo one reaches in and picks out the same screwdriver for every DIY job, do they?\u201d he says bluntly. \u201cYou just can\u2019t fillet a fish with the same knife you use to chop parsley.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to go to town on the knife collection, Birchall says. \u201cYou need a short, stiff knife [AKA a chef\u2019s knife] for general everyday stuff, from chopping veg to trimming a rack of lamb, for example.

He created the track specifically for the street I\u2019m standing on, and it\u2019s only available to listen to within a 100-metre radius of where I am: it was designed for listening here and only here, where the clanking railway lines and the distant conversations of passersby add another layer to the music.</p> <p>\u201cCities are these amazing possibilities to put two things together: music and architecture. The city is a playground, a backdrop for music,\u201d says Nick Luscombe, presenter of BBC Radio 3\u2019s Late Junction and founder of <a href=\"https://www.musicityglobal.com/\">Musicity,</a> a platform that invites musicians to compose tracks in response to buildings and locations in cities. Musicity uses geo-tagging to link the tracks to the locations that inspired it.

Musicity builds on this idea, by making music and sound art part of the architecture of the city itself.</p> <p>Luscombe says: \u201cA hundred years down the road, the railway will still be here. Half of the buildings might not be, but the music will still be there in those locations. The tracks will be there forever now.\u201d</p> <p>Musicity was commissioned by the business improvement district <a href=\"http://www.betterbankside.co.uk/\">Better Bankside</a>, along with Team London Bridge and Blue Bermondsey, to create 15 pieces of music as a soundtrack to the Low Line, a new walking route along the Victorian rail viaducts spanning Bankside, London Bridge and Bermondsey.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10a67a99569ba3c5dd5b8fb71dfff50f43f7f8cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10a67a99569ba3c5dd5b8fb71dfff50f43f7f8cc/0_89_6690_4014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Low Line plaque at London Bridge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Low Line walking route spans Bankside, London Bridge and Bermondsey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mickey Lee Mediamixer.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Using smartphones, people follow the map on the Musicity website and click on the songs connected to points across the route.</p> <p>The idea is to use music as a way to open up this walk and the hidden areas underneath the arches to local communities and visitors. It gives people a reason to go to these backstreets, often overlooked by the nearby South Bank and prominent cultural institutions such as Tate Britain and the Globe theatre.</p> <p>\u201cIt provides a way for people who live and work along the line to experience the neighbourhood in a different way that\u2019s specific and rooted in an area,\u201d says Valerie Beirne, Bankside\u2019s urban forest manager. \u201cWe\u2019re creating a connection to the streets.\u201d</p> <p>The Low Line was conceived by a local resident, the former architect <a href=\"http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/8278\">David Stephens</a>, in 2012. Inspired by New York\u2019s High Line, London\u2019s version follows the centuries-old rail arches spanning this area south of the river. The Low Line is part of Bankside\u2019s regeneration to open up the mostly car-free base of the Victorian viaducts, and bring commercial development, whether that be cultural or retail, to the unused arches.</p> <p>Now the Low Line has a soundtrack to go with it. We turn a corner and follow the base of the railway line to Wardens Grove, the third stop along the route, tucked away behind the Metal Box Factory, just off Southwark Street.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8156de5f679255e04f14f88ba2a3cc6a054af67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8156de5f679255e04f14f88ba2a3cc6a054af67/0_13_1073_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Singer and composer Szjerdene\" width=\"1000\" height=\"727\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Singer and composer Szjerdene created a track called Wardens Grove for the Musicity project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This song, Wardens Grove, is by singer and composer Szjerdene, who grew up in north-east London and lives in Amsterdam. \u201cI love London. I was born and raised here but every time I come back it\u2019s a harsh reminder of the energy of London, its hustle mentality of keeping your head down,\u201d she tells me later over the phone.</p> <p>\u201cGenerally, it\u2019s a gritty city and you have to have substance to survive here. All of this was going into the song \u2013 my feelings towards the city itself.\u201d</p> <p>Wardens Grove is a beautifully melancholic track. I listen standing by the viaduct in this open space looking on to the back of the former factory, redeveloped to house studios and offices, as the Shard pokes out in the distance.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted the sounds to reflect the constantly changing face. You only listen to it at that location, so it brings that connectivity,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cEvery time I visit London there\u2019s something new to see but [it] still has that iron heart, a pulse that beats through which has the same ethos and feeling at its depth. I wanted the sounds to reflect this.\u201d</p> <p>She used metallic, industrial sounds, harking back to this area\u2019s former life as a tin box factory. Field recordings of conversations enhance the real-life voices of passersby.</p> <p>It\u2019s a fitting soundtrack but beyond this, just taking two and a half minutes to stop and listen is captivating in itself. You notice parts of the city you would not normally see; something beautiful in how brickwork is reflected in a puddle, or even just discovering a new cafe under the arches.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important that people get out. They can do two things at once: get tracks, enjoy different locations and get inspired by the city,\u201d says Luscombe. \u201cMusic is the most immediate artform there is. We have such a connection to sound. The idea of having headphones where you still hear some background noise is even more valuable. You feel you\u2019re in several different worlds.\u201d</p> <p>The ambient, industrial sounds of some of the tracks will not be to everyone\u2019s taste, but because the music is free (if you have a smartphone), it brings an element of accessibility to a city that prices many people out.</p> <p>\u201cMusic is a leveller, that accessibility brings communities together. We\u2019re effectively creating new memories for people of space by creating soundtracks,\u201d says Luscombe. \u201cIt adds to a healthier or better life, in a way.\u201d</p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardiancities/?hl=en\">Instagram</a> to join the discussion, catch up on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities\">our best stories</a> or sign up for our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/03/sign-up-for-the-cityscape-the-best-of-guardian-cities-every-week\">weekly newsletter</a></em></p>",

It gives people a reason to go to these backstreets, often overlooked by the nearby South Bank and prominent cultural institutions such as Tate Britain and the Globe theatre. \u201cIt provides a way for people who live and work along the line to experience the neighbourhood in a different way that\u2019s specific and rooted in an area,\u201d says Valerie Beirne, Bankside\u2019s urban forest manager. \u201cWe\u2019re creating a connection to the streets.\u201d The Low Line was conceived by a local resident, the former architect David Stephens, in 2012. Inspired by New York\u2019s High Line, London\u2019s version follows the centuries-old rail arches spanning this area south of the river. The Low Line is part of Bankside\u2019s regeneration to open up the mostly car-free base of the Victorian viaducts, and bring commercial development, whether that be cultural or retail, to the unused arches. Now the Low Line has a soundtrack to go with it. We turn a corner and follow the base of the railway line to Wardens Grove, the third stop along the route, tucked away behind the Metal Box Factory, just off Southwark Street. This song, Wardens Grove, is by singer and composer Szjerdene, who grew up in north-east London and lives in Amsterdam. \u201cI love London. I was born and raised here but every time I come back it\u2019s a harsh reminder of the energy of London, its hustle mentality of keeping your head down,\u201d she tells me later over the phone. \u201cGenerally, it\u2019s a gritty city and you have to have substance to survive here. All of this was going into the song \u2013 my feelings towards the city itself.\u201d Wardens Grove is a beautifully melancholic track. I listen standing by the viaduct in this open space looking on to the back of the former factory, redeveloped to house studios and offices, as the Shard pokes out in the distance. \u201cI wanted the sounds to reflect the constantly changing face. You only listen to it at that location, so it brings that connectivity,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery time I visit London there\u2019s something new to see but [it] still has that iron heart, a pulse that beats through which has the same ethos and feeling at its depth. I wanted the sounds to reflect this.\u201d She used metallic, industrial sounds, harking back to this area\u2019s former life as a tin box factory. Field recordings of conversations enhance the real-life voices of passersby. It\u2019s a fitting soundtrack but beyond this, just taking two and a half minutes to stop and listen is captivating in itself. You notice parts of the city you would not normally see; something beautiful in how brickwork is reflected in a puddle, or even just discovering a new cafe under the arches. \u201cIt\u2019s important that people get out. They can do two things at once: get tracks, enjoy different locations and get inspired by the city,\u201d says Luscombe. \u201cMusic is the most immediate artform there is. We have such a connection to sound. The idea of having headphones where you still hear some background noise is even more valuable. You feel you\u2019re in several different worlds.\u201d The ambient, industrial sounds of some of the tracks will not be to everyone\u2019s taste, but because the music is free (if you have a smartphone), it brings an element of accessibility to a city that prices many people out. \u201cMusic is a leveller, that accessibility brings communities together. We\u2019re effectively creating new memories for people of space by creating soundtracks,\u201d says Luscombe. \u201cIt adds to a healthier or better life, in a way.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

They have never truly grown up. Life is a game and the person who dies with the most wealth and power has won. It is going to be a long and difficult journey for the UK out of this mess.

It is the most likely outcome. If he becomes PM then he will have to face the reality of Brexit and that will lead him down the exact same path that Theresa May went down, only in a very much shorter time.

      "bodyText": "Sacked former Wallabies star Israel Folau is rattling the tin online to raise $3m for his legal action against his Rugby Australia. Folau is taking his case to the Fair Work Commission, saying his employment was terminated because of his religious beliefs. He has set up a GoFundMe page, asking people to chip in for the legal costs. It has so far generated more than $300,000. \u201cMy faith is the most important thing in my life. I try to live my life according to the Bible and I believe it is my duty to share the word of the Bible,\u201d Folau said in a message on the website. \u201cEarlier this year, I uploaded some messages from the Bible on my Instagram page. I believe that sharing the Bible is an act of love and compassion.\u201d Folau acknowledged some people do not like or believe in the Bible. \u201cIndeed, what makes our country so wonderful is that we have such a diverse community made up of so many different cultures and values. But my faith defines me as a person. I do not believe that it is fair or right that I be punished for my religious beliefs,\u201d he said. He flagged there was a chance the case could take years and eventually end up in the high court. \u201cRugby Australia have already said that they will divert significant resources to fight me in court. Even if I win, Rugby Australia can appeal,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife Maria and I have already spent over $100,000 of our own money, and that was just to try and deal with Rugby Australia\u2019s internal tribunal processes. The money I am asking for is solely to fund the rest of my action in court.\u201d However, Arthur Moses SC, Law Council of Australia president, warned that the use of crowdfunding for litigation opened up a \u201ccan of worms\u201d and was an issue the legal profession had to resolve. He said key problems were whether such funding could be used to pay the costs of a litigant\u2019s opponent and if contributors could sue a litigants\u2019s lawyer if they felt they were misled as to the use of the money or the conduct of the case. Folau\u2019s $4m contract was ripped up after he posted on social media that all homosexuals are destined for hell. An independent panel hearing into the social media posts found he had breached Rugby Australia\u2019s code of conduct at a high level. The application submitted to the Fair Work Commission claims the termination of Folau\u2019s contract prevented him from playing at the peak of his career \u2013 and in a World Cup year which would have generated even greater exposure and opportunities. Folau\u2019s sacking has stirred up public debate over religious freedom, with some conservative government MPs pushing for legal changes to enshrine the right to express religious opinions even when they breach employment codes of conduct. Folau was at the centre of controversy again on Monday after he used a sermon at his Sydney church to describe homosexuality as a sin and criticise young people being allowed to \u201cchange their gender\u201d.",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Bank\u2019s governor has been an outspoken critic of Britain leaving the EU without a deal.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has said that the UK would be hit automatically by tariffs on exports to the EU in a no-deal Brexit, rejecting a claim made by Boris Johnson that this could be avoided. Tory leadership candidate Johnson said this week that tariffs would not necessarily have to be paid if the UK left the EU without a deal because the UK could rely on article 24 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade (Gatt). Some Brexit supporters have claimed that the Gatt, a treaty under the auspices of the World Trade Organization (WTO), would allow a \u201cstandstill\u201d in which tariffs are avoided, even in the absence of any agreement on trade. Many trade experts say this is not the case without agreement from both sides. Carney cited the head of the WTO and Liam Fox, the minister for international trade who backed the Vote Leave campaign in 2016, to contradict Johnson. Talking to the BBC, Carney said: \u201cGatt 24 applies if you have an agreement, not if you\u2019ve decided not to have an agreement or have been unable to come to an agreement. \u201cNot having an agreement with the EU means that there are tariffs automatically because the Europeans have to apply the same rules to us as they apply to everyone else. If they were to decide not to put in place tariffs they also have to lower their tariffs with the United States, with the rest of the world.

However, Johnson has repeatedly said the UK must leave on 31 October, whether a deal is agreed or not. Carney said on Friday that as many as 150,000 British businesses did not have the paperwork in place to export to the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Around 40% of 250,000 exporters were prepared, he said. For businesses importing to the UK, Carney said that there was only a \u201cvery short-term level of preparation\u201d in the form of stockpiles of goods and materials. These would only last \u201cweeks\u201d, Carney said, highlighting sectors such as the automotive manufacturing sector. He said: \u201cNo deal means no deal. It means there is a substantial change in the trading relationship with the European Union.\u201d Carney is set to serve as governor until 31 January 2020, meaning he will serve under the incoming prime minister. Johnson won every round of voting among Conservative MPs as they chose the final two candidates to be the party leader. Conservative party members will choose between Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, in a vote next month.",

Stormzy (pictured) as headliner on Friday should be a proper moment, while the other stages offer the likes of Kamasi Washington, Rosal\u00eda, Tame Impala, Dave and Billie Eilish. There are legends, too: Kylie plays on Sunday 30 Jun and the actual Janet Jackson performs before Liam Gallagher on Saturday 29 June. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/\">Worthy Farm, nr Shepton Mallet Wednesday 26 to 30 June</a></em></p> <h2>Quincy Jones</h2> <p>Originally billed as a celebration of Jones\u2019s work on Michael Jackson\u2019s iconic Off the Wall, Thriller and Bad albums, the newly christened Quincy Jones: Presents Soundtrack of the 80s will also now include a smattering of his other productions for the likes of Michael McDonald. Guest singers on the night include Beverley Knight, Daley and, erm, James Morrison. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.theo2.co.uk/events/detail/quincy-jones\">The O2, SE10, Sunday 23 June</a></em></p> <h2>King Princess</h2> <p>New York-born, LA-based Mikaela Straus \u2013 AKA newcomer King Princess \u2013 has fast become a queer icon, peppering her lo-fi pop with readymade Pride slogans such as \u201cmy pussy is God\u201d, from last year\u2019s Pussy Is God, and latest single Cheap Queen\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m a real queen / I can make grown men cry\u201d.

To celebrate they are playing this one-off London show at central London\u2019s sadly soon-to-close Borderline club. <br><em><a href=\"http://borderline.london/listings/alphabeat/\">The Borderline, W1, Friday 28 June</a></em></p> <p><em>MC</em></p> <h2>Archie Shepp</h2> <p>Archie Shepp was an avant garde, John Coltrane-partnering saxophone firebrand in the 1960s. Nowadays, he is a soulful \u2013 but still sharply political \u2013 octogenarian player-singer who knows jazz and African-American history like the back of his hand.

Among the cast for the original performances of Brundib\u00e1r (Bumblebee) was the mother of Welsh National Opera\u2019s music director Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hanus (pictured), and Hanus now conducts these performances with WNO Youth Opera, as part of the WNO\u2019s Freedom season; David Pountney directs. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.wmc.org.uk/en/whats-on/2019/brundibar/\">Wales Millennium Centre: Weston Studio, Cardiff, Saturday 22 &amp; Sunday 23 June</a></em></p> <h2>Emanuel Ax at 70</h2> <p>Although he has been in the front rank of contemporary pianists for a quarter of a century now, Emanuel Ax\u2019s appearances in Britain often seem sporadic. But the Wigmore Hall is celebrating Ax\u2019s 70th birthday with a generous three-part, all-Schumann programme, in which Ax will play the Arabeske and the Op 12 Fantasiest\u00fccke, accompany baritone Simon Keenlyside in Dichterliebe, and join the Dover Quartet in the Piano Quartet and Piano Quintet. <br><em><a href=\"https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/leonidas-kavakos-emanuel-ax-201202011930\">Wigmore Hall, W1, Tuesday 25 June</a></em></p> <h2>The Cunning Little Vixen</h2> <p>Simon Rattle\u2019s collaborations with director Peter Sellars are already a regular part of the London Symphony Orchestra\u2019s season. Now they turn their attention to Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s most joyous, life-affirming opera. This semi-staging of The Cunning Little Vixen, sung in Czech, features Lucy Crowe as the Vixen and Gerald Finley as the Forester, with a supporting cast that includes Sophia Burgos, Peter Hoare and Hanno M\u00fcller-Brachmann. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2019/event/lsorattlejanacek-the-cunning-little-vixen\">Barbican Hall, EC2, Thursday 27 &amp; 29 June</a></em></p> <p><em>AC</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best ... exhibitions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0b8f669961544fdf81ab36bee0ce1d25a7898e8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b8f669961544fdf81ab36bee0ce1d25a7898e8c/0_0_3000_2352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Wall\u2019s Weightlifter, 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"784\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeff Wall\u2019s Weightlifter, 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Wall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Cindy Sherman</h2> <p>Ever since portraying herself as a Hitchcock heroine and horror film innocent in the early black-and-white Untitled Film Stills, this essential artist of our age has been using photography and disguise to play with her own image and identity. For Cindy Sherman we are all actors in the film of our life, which gets edgier with time. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/cindy-sherman/exhibition/\">National Portrait Gallery, WC2, Thursday 27 June to 15 September</a></em></p> <h2>Get Up, Stand Up Now</h2> <p>This epic survey of black creativity since Windrush features 50 years of art that stands up for its rights. Artists of the quality of Anthea Hamilton, Ajamu, Betye Saar, Chris Ofili and Yinka Shonibare CBE (Self Portrait after Warhol, pictured) show alongside Zadie Smith and A Guy Called Gerald in a multidisciplinary festival of resistance. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/get-up-stand-up-now\">Somerset House, WC2, to 15 September</a></em></p> <h2>Jeff Wall</h2> <p>Wall is an artist of unfinished stories. His photographs carefully, and often beautifully, shape dramas whose beginnings and ends we don\u2019t know. Instead, we see moments full of apparently important symbolism. Recovery, a portrait of a young man who seems to have just gotten over some crisis, and The Gardens, a cinematic narrative in three scenes, continue his fascination with the ways an image can be meaningful. <br><em><a href=\"https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/jeff_wall_masons_yards_2019\">White Cube Mason\u2019s Yard, SW1, Friday 28 June to 7 September</a></em></p> <h2>As Seen on Screen</h2> <p>Since the Lumi\u00e8re brothers, art has tried to keep up with cinema. Cubism and futurism can be seen as attempts to capture the movement of film in restless images. This exhibition brings the story up to date, from Fiona Banner\u2019s project to write down everything in Lawrence of Arabia to work by Sam Taylor-Johnson, whose career trajectory from video art to Hollywood is a screen legend in itself. <br><em><a href=\"http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/arts-council-collection/as-seen-on-screen/index.aspx\">Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, to 18 August</a></em></p> <h2>Leonardo da Vinci</h2> <p>The books of Leonardo da Vinci are among the most beguiling things ever created by humanity. They range from small pocket notebooks to vast albums of drawings. Any sheet might include sublime sketches, intricate writings, a recipe or shopping list: life, art and wonder all mixed up. This exhibition includes a notebook lent by the V&amp;A and selections from the Codex Leicester, owned by Bill Gates. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/events/leonardo-da-vinci-a-mind-in-motion\">The British Library, NW1, to 8 September</a></em></p> <p><em>JJ</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best ... theatre shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d693b305556e4a29002e6390a44eb63061dc5c37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d693b305556e4a29002e6390a44eb63061dc5c37/0_351_3508_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Deep Blue Sea\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Deep Blue Sea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Europe</h2> <p>In his first gig as artistic director of the Donmar, Michael Longhurst revives David Greig\u2019s 1994 play, a breakthrough for the much-lauded Scottish playwright. Europe is set in a small, largely forgotten border town where trains no longer stop. Two refugees turn up and drama \u2013 topical drama indeed \u2013 ensues.

It follows the harrowing, inspiring life of Celie (T\u2019Shan Williams, pictured) growing up in a racially divided US south, and features a score infused with jazz, ragtime, gospel and blues. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.curveonline.co.uk/whats-on/shows/the-color-purple/\">Curve Theatre, Leicester, Friday 28 June to 13 July</a>; <a href=\"https://www.birminghamhippodrome.com/calendar/the-color-purple/\">Birmingham Hippodrome, 16 to 20 July</a></em></p> <h2>The Deep Blue Sea</h2> <p>Thank gawd Terence Rattigan is back in fashion: The Deep Blue Sea is a real theatrical treat. Set in 1950s London, the play follows one day in the dramatic life of Hester Collyer, a woman who has abandoned her respectable husband in favour of a deliciously destructive romance. But what happens when the passion fades and reality sets in? The lead role is taken by Nancy Carroll (pictured), an actor with extraordinary emotional clarity and sway. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.cft.org.uk/whats-on/event/the-deep-blue-sea\">Chichester Festival Theatre, to 27 July</a></em></p> <h2>Aesop\u2019s Fables</h2> <p>Justin Audibert and Rachel Bagshaw co-direct this two-tiered take on Aesop\u2019s fables: one lot for ages four to seven, and one for ages eight to 12. A selection of these Greek fables have been reimagined by an exciting group of spirited and provocative playwrights.

Featuring music by Damon Intrabartolo and lyrics and book by Jon Hartmere, the show follows the students of a strict Catholic boarding school as they explore sex, drugs and queer identity.

The Edge of Democracy (No cert) (Petra Costa, 2019, Brazil) 113 mins This could not be more topical: a film about Brazil\u2019s tempestuous recent political past, from Lula to the impeachment of his successor Dilma Rousseff. This all laid the groundwork for current president, the populist Jair Bolsonaro. It\u2019s a portrait of a bitterly divided nation, which has lessons for all of us. AP Five of the best ... rock &amp; pop Glastonbury After taking 2018 off, the UK\u2019s top mudbath is back with a typically eclectic lineup. Stormzy (pictured) as headliner on Friday should be a proper moment, while the other stages offer the likes of Kamasi Washington, Rosal\u00eda, Tame Impala, Dave and Billie Eilish. There are legends, too: Kylie plays on Sunday 30 Jun and the actual Janet Jackson performs before Liam Gallagher on Saturday 29 June. Worthy Farm, nr Shepton Mallet Wednesday 26 to 30 June Quincy Jones Originally billed as a celebration of Jones\u2019s work on Michael Jackson\u2019s iconic Off the Wall, Thriller and Bad albums, the newly christened Quincy Jones: Presents Soundtrack of the 80s will also now include a smattering of his other productions for the likes of Michael McDonald. Guest singers on the night include Beverley Knight, Daley and, erm, James Morrison. The O2, SE10, Sunday 23 June King Princess New York-born, LA-based Mikaela Straus \u2013 AKA newcomer King Princess \u2013 has fast become a queer icon, peppering her lo-fi pop with readymade Pride slogans such as \u201cmy pussy is God\u201d, from last year\u2019s Pussy Is God, and latest single Cheap Queen\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m a real queen / I can make grown men cry\u201d. It\u2019s also worth following her on Instagram for some properly amusing #content. The Academy, Dublin, Monday 24 June; O2 Forum Kentish Town, NW5, Wednesday 26 June Alphabeat After a seven-year hiatus, Danish sextet Alphabeat \u2013 come on: you remember 2008\u2019s wonky pop classic Fascination and, possibly, 2009\u2019s 80s throwback The Spell \u2013 returned earlier this year with the typically breezy Shadows and the promise of a new album. To celebrate they are playing this one-off London show at central London\u2019s sadly soon-to-close Borderline club. The Borderline, W1, Friday 28 June MC Archie Shepp Archie Shepp was an avant garde, John Coltrane-partnering saxophone firebrand in the 1960s. Nowadays, he is a soulful \u2013 but still sharply political \u2013 octogenarian player-singer who knows jazz and African-American history like the back of his hand. He is joined here by young Parisian pianist Carl-Henri Morisset and others, on classic ballads, blues and rugged swing. Ronnie Scott\u2019s, W1, Monday 24 &amp; Tuesday 25 June JF Three of the best ... classical concerts Brundib\u00e1r Composed in Prague in 1938, and rehearsed in a Jewish orphanage there three years later, Hans Kr\u00e1sa\u2019s children\u2019s opera was subsequently performed in the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1943 and 1944, where the composer was also interned. Among the cast for the original performances of Brundib\u00e1r (Bumblebee) was the mother of Welsh National Opera\u2019s music director Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hanus (pictured), and Hanus now conducts these performances with WNO Youth Opera, as part of the WNO\u2019s Freedom season; David Pountney directs. Wales Millennium Centre: Weston Studio, Cardiff, Saturday 22 &amp; Sunday 23 June Emanuel Ax at 70 Although he has been in the front rank of contemporary pianists for a quarter of a century now, Emanuel Ax\u2019s appearances in Britain often seem sporadic. But the Wigmore Hall is celebrating Ax\u2019s 70th birthday with a generous three-part, all-Schumann programme, in which Ax will play the Arabeske and the Op 12 Fantasiest\u00fccke, accompany baritone Simon Keenlyside in Dichterliebe, and join the Dover Quartet in the Piano Quartet and Piano Quintet. Wigmore Hall, W1, Tuesday 25 June The Cunning Little Vixen Simon Rattle\u2019s collaborations with director Peter Sellars are already a regular part of the London Symphony Orchestra\u2019s season. Now they turn their attention to Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s most joyous, life-affirming opera. This semi-staging of The Cunning Little Vixen, sung in Czech, features Lucy Crowe as the Vixen and Gerald Finley as the Forester, with a supporting cast that includes Sophia Burgos, Peter Hoare and Hanno M\u00fcller-Brachmann. Barbican Hall, EC2, Thursday 27 &amp; 29 June AC Five of the best ... exhibitions Cindy Sherman Ever since portraying herself as a Hitchcock heroine and horror film innocent in the early black-and-white Untitled Film Stills, this essential artist of our age has been using photography and disguise to play with her own image and identity. For Cindy Sherman we are all actors in the film of our life, which gets edgier with time. National Portrait Gallery, WC2, Thursday 27 June to 15 September Get Up, Stand Up Now This epic survey of black creativity since Windrush features 50 years of art that stands up for its rights. Artists of the quality of Anthea Hamilton, Ajamu, Betye Saar, Chris Ofili and Yinka Shonibare CBE (Self Portrait after Warhol, pictured) show alongside Zadie Smith and A Guy Called Gerald in a multidisciplinary festival of resistance. Somerset House, WC2, to 15 September Jeff Wall Wall is an artist of unfinished stories. His photographs carefully, and often beautifully, shape dramas whose beginnings and ends we don\u2019t know. Instead, we see moments full of apparently important symbolism. Recovery, a portrait of a young man who seems to have just gotten over some crisis, and The Gardens, a cinematic narrative in three scenes, continue his fascination with the ways an image can be meaningful. White Cube Mason\u2019s Yard, SW1, Friday 28 June to 7 September As Seen on Screen Since the Lumi\u00e8re brothers, art has tried to keep up with cinema. Cubism and futurism can be seen as attempts to capture the movement of film in restless images. This exhibition brings the story up to date, from Fiona Banner\u2019s project to write down everything in Lawrence of Arabia to work by Sam Taylor-Johnson, whose career trajectory from video art to Hollywood is a screen legend in itself. Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, to 18 August Leonardo da Vinci The books of Leonardo da Vinci are among the most beguiling things ever created by humanity. They range from small pocket notebooks to vast albums of drawings. Any sheet might include sublime sketches, intricate writings, a recipe or shopping list: life, art and wonder all mixed up. This exhibition includes a notebook lent by the V&amp;A and selections from the Codex Leicester, owned by Bill Gates. The British Library, NW1, to 8 September JJ Five of the best ... theatre shows Europe In his first gig as artistic director of the Donmar, Michael Longhurst revives David Greig\u2019s 1994 play, a breakthrough for the much-lauded Scottish playwright. Europe is set in a small, largely forgotten border town where trains no longer stop. Two refugees turn up and drama \u2013 topical drama indeed \u2013 ensues. The cast includes Natalia Tena, Billy Howle and Faye Marsay. Donmar Warehouse, WC2, to 10 August The Color Purple This hit Broadway musical is based on Alice Walker\u2019s novel and Steven Spielberg\u2019s film. It follows the harrowing, inspiring life of Celie (T\u2019Shan Williams, pictured) growing up in a racially divided US south, and features a score infused with jazz, ragtime, gospel and blues. Curve Theatre, Leicester, Friday 28 June to 13 July; Birmingham Hippodrome, 16 to 20 July The Deep Blue Sea Thank gawd Terence Rattigan is back in fashion: The Deep Blue Sea is a real theatrical treat. Set in 1950s London, the play follows one day in the dramatic life of Hester Collyer, a woman who has abandoned her respectable husband in favour of a deliciously destructive romance. But what happens when the passion fades and reality sets in? The lead role is taken by Nancy Carroll (pictured), an actor with extraordinary emotional clarity and sway. Chichester Festival Theatre, to 27 July Aesop\u2019s Fables Justin Audibert and Rachel Bagshaw co-direct this two-tiered take on Aesop\u2019s fables: one lot for ages four to seven, and one for ages eight to 12. A selection of these Greek fables have been reimagined by an exciting group of spirited and provocative playwrights. Adaptations by Chris Thorpe, EV Crowe and Chris Goode might well be the best of the bunch. Unicorn Theatre, SE1, to 4 August Bare: A Pop Opera This coming-of-age rock musical has a touch of Glee about it \u2013 only with much more edge. Featuring music by Damon Intrabartolo and lyrics and book by Jon Hartmere, the show follows the students of a strict Catholic boarding school as they explore sex, drugs and queer identity. Packed with eccentric characters and lit up with great heart and wit, this could prove a real hit for this popular theatre nestled beneath Waterloo station. The Vaults, SE1, to 4 August MG Three of the best ... dance shows Boris Charmatz: 10000 Gestures French choreographer and provocateur Boris Charmatz unleashes a thrilling torrent of movement \u2013 those 10,000 gestures of the title \u2013 as his dancers hop, spin, flail and scratch their bums in a compendium of movement that adds up to something much more. Charmatz will also mastermind free public events over the weekend. Tate Modern, SE1, Saturday 22 &amp; Sunday 23 June Dance@TheGrange Fancy a fine evening out on a Hampshire country estate? Wayne McGregor curates a programme featuring his own company alongside Alessandra Ferri and Ballet Black, plus a chance to see the work of upcoming Australian choreographer Alice Topp. The Grange at Northington, Alresford, Tuesday 25 &amp; Wednesday 26 June Edifice Dance Theatre: Salom\u00e9 Edifice harnesses an unusual combination of ballroom, Latin and contemporary dance to tell a lusty version of Oscar Wilde\u2019s Salom\u00e9. Choreographers Carmine De Amicis and Harriet Maghorn star.

Some platforms at Leeds station have still not been extended to accept longer trains, and modernisation plans for Manchester Piccadilly and Oxford Road stations are still sitting on the desk of the transport secretary, Chris Grayling.</p> <p>In addition, Blake said there was a serious question mark over whether Northern Rail would fulfil its franchise commitment to phase out the much-derided <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/29/pacer-trains-village-halls-send-down-south\">Pacer trains</a> by the end of the year.</p> <p>Jim O\u2019Neill, a former Goldman Sachs economist who was a key architect of the northern powerhouse, said the initiative had suffered from the \u201cWhitehall policy vacuum of the last three years\u201d.</p> <p>Lord O\u2019Neill and Osborne went on numerous trade delegations overseas to promote the northern cities. \u201cNow when I travel to China or wherever, people say: whatever happened to the northern powerhouse?\u201d he said.</p> <p>He criticised Burnham and other mayors for spending too much time moaning and not enough time presenting government with positive ideas. \u201cIn government these guys are viewed as emotional crackpots who are always going on about being the \u2018poor, starving north \u2013 come and help us\u2019,\u201d O\u2019Neill said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f04d5e7bd5cce1ac2c4e59446413244462e7a9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f04d5e7bd5cce1ac2c4e59446413244462e7a9a/0_370_6582_3949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Pacer train arriving at Smithy Bridge station.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There is still a question mark over whether Northern Rail will fulfil its franchise commitment to phase out the Pacer train.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Houchen, who is backing Boris Johnson in the Conservative leadership contest, said he believed the former foreign secretary was fully behind the northern powerhouse project. He said the next big test for government was whether it pledged support for Northern Powerhouse Rail, a new \u00a339bn east-west railway line, in the autumn spending review. </p> <p>O\u2019Neill agreed. \u201cIt is way more vital than HS2. Without it, government can never show it is taking the north seriously,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Jamie Driscoll, the new Labour mayor of the North of Tyne region, said the government must agree to devolve the shared prosperity fund that will replace European grants. \u201cWe can provide a joined-up strategy \u2013 looking at business, environment, transport and education \u2013 in a way that people in Whitehall can\u2019t.\u201d Currently he has just \u00a320m a year extra to spend as he sees fit.</p> <p>He said the government should devolve the budgets \u201cto the people on the ground who actually know what is going on \u2026 Longer-term, we need independent revenue streams and not be bidding for things but have money directly allocated. In my region, you can\u2019t get here on a motorway. If you want to drive from one side of it to another you have to drive on single-lane roads. If the Department for Transport was based in Newcastle no one would have had to make a proposal, written a paper, lobbied, it would just have happened: we would have a good road network.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokeswoman said: \u201cFive years on, the northern powerhouse remains a priority for the government and is delivering results for people across the north with a record number of people in work and nearly 200,000 more businesses today than in 2010.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re investing over \u00a313bn in improving transport \u2013 more than any government in history \u2013 and, with almost half the region represented by five strong metro mayors, we\u2019re keeping our promise for more decisions in the north to be made by the north.\u201d </p>",

Jim O\u2019Neill, a former Goldman Sachs economist who was a key architect of the northern powerhouse, said the initiative had suffered from the \u201cWhitehall policy vacuum of the last three years\u201d. Lord O\u2019Neill and Osborne went on numerous trade delegations overseas to promote the northern cities. \u201cNow when I travel to China or wherever, people say: whatever happened to the northern powerhouse?\u201d he said. He criticised Burnham and other mayors for spending too much time moaning and not enough time presenting government with positive ideas. \u201cIn government these guys are viewed as emotional crackpots who are always going on about being the \u2018poor, starving north \u2013 come and help us\u2019,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. Houchen, who is backing Boris Johnson in the Conservative leadership contest, said he believed the former foreign secretary was fully behind the northern powerhouse project. He said the next big test for government was whether it pledged support for Northern Powerhouse Rail, a new \u00a339bn east-west railway line, in the autumn spending review. O\u2019Neill agreed. \u201cIt is way more vital than HS2. Without it, government can never show it is taking the north seriously,\u201d he said. Jamie Driscoll, the new Labour mayor of the North of Tyne region, said the government must agree to devolve the shared prosperity fund that will replace European grants. \u201cWe can provide a joined-up strategy \u2013 looking at business, environment, transport and education \u2013 in a way that people in Whitehall can\u2019t.\u201d Currently he has just \u00a320m a year extra to spend as he sees fit. He said the government should devolve the budgets \u201cto the people on the ground who actually know what is going on \u2026 Longer-term, we need independent revenue streams and not be bidding for things but have money directly allocated. In my region, you can\u2019t get here on a motorway. If you want to drive from one side of it to another you have to drive on single-lane roads. If the Department for Transport was based in Newcastle no one would have had to make a proposal, written a paper, lobbied, it would just have happened: we would have a good road network.\u201d A government spokeswoman said: \u201cFive years on, the northern powerhouse remains a priority for the government and is delivering results for people across the north with a record number of people in work and nearly 200,000 more businesses today than in 2010. \u201cWe\u2019re investing over \u00a313bn in improving transport \u2013 more than any government in history \u2013 and, with almost half the region represented by five strong metro mayors, we\u2019re keeping our promise for more decisions in the north to be made by the north.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The streaming TV era has brought us many odd pleasures, and here\u2019s one of them: a supernatural drama with the budget and global fanbase to go properly berserk. Dark, a German original drama for Netflix, sets itself in Winden, a small community deep in the dark woods. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/01/dark-review-a-classy-knotty-time-travelling-whodunnit-for-tv\">The 2017 debut episode</a> kicked off with a suicide, an affair and a boy vanishing in circumstances similar to a disappearance 33 years earlier. By the end of the first run, it was revealed that Winden was a spacetime wormhole that some of its residents had learned to navigate.</p> <p>Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stranger-things\">Stranger Things</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/22/the-oa-season-two-review-netflix-brit-marling\">The OA</a>, Dark offers teen viewers the fantasy of events with global or greater importance depending on their own actions: of course parents and authority figures are all liars, but they\u2019re lying about something significant. The nowhere-town of Winden is the battleground for the eternal struggle between good and evil, carried out against a background of endless rain, dead birds in boxes, mysterious horology, Latin inscriptions and sinister priests, all of them the product of the show\u2019s excellent, creepy art direction.</p> <p>People say things like \u201cIt\u2019s all connected\u201d and \u201cEverything happens when it must\u201d. In the season one finale, vexed sixth-former Jonas (Louis Hofmann) discovers that some Winden residents are the same person at different ages, and remarks: \u201cNow I have another grandma, and she\u2019s the principal of my school! Her husband, who\u2019s fucking my mom, is looking for his son, who\u2019s my father! A few days ago, I kissed my aunt!\u201d</p> <p>How to follow that? Well, as season two begins, the big news is that Winden has been destroyed by a nuclear explosion. It is less devastating to the storytelling than it sounds, because the action is evenly shared between the 1920s, 50s, 80s (featuring some terrific back-combing, and a pair of high-waisted fuchsia slacks that deserve their own International Emmy), the present and the grumpy, irradiated 2050s. Protagonists start appearing in different decades with abandon.</p> <p>Lest viewers start pinning mugshots of the characters to their walls and linking them with string, Netflix has taken the unusual step of producing an <a href=\"https://dark.netflix.io/\">online guide</a> to who the ruddy hellfire everyone is. That\u2019s more necessary than ever as Dark continues to gaily fiddle with the established settings of TV time travel by allowing characters to converse with their younger selves. Halfway through season two, Jonas has bigger worries than getting off with his aunt: if he\u2019s not careful, he\u2019ll end up accidentally killing or having sex with himself.</p> <p>The problem is one shared by other wilfully confusing sci-fi sagas. Characters do not typically have conflicts or goals beyond trying to figure out what\u2019s going on. But that search for answers is all the dramatic impetus a show like Dark needs. The narrative is forbiddingly elaborate on purpose. What matters is how it feels to the members of this exclusive little club \u2013 and Dark, with its absolute sincerity and lush production, is a luxurious myth.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The streaming TV era has brought us many odd pleasures, and here\u2019s one of them: a supernatural drama with the budget and global fanbase to go properly berserk. Dark, a German original drama for Netflix, sets itself in Winden, a small community deep in the dark woods. The 2017 debut episode kicked off with a suicide, an affair and a boy vanishing in circumstances similar to a disappearance 33 years earlier. By the end of the first run, it was revealed that Winden was a spacetime wormhole that some of its residents had learned to navigate. Like Stranger Things and The OA, Dark offers teen viewers the fantasy of events with global or greater importance depending on their own actions: of course parents and authority figures are all liars, but they\u2019re lying about something significant. The nowhere-town of Winden is the battleground for the eternal struggle between good and evil, carried out against a background of endless rain, dead birds in boxes, mysterious horology, Latin inscriptions and sinister priests, all of them the product of the show\u2019s excellent, creepy art direction. People say things like \u201cIt\u2019s all connected\u201d and \u201cEverything happens when it must\u201d. In the season one finale, vexed sixth-former Jonas (Louis Hofmann) discovers that some Winden residents are the same person at different ages, and remarks: \u201cNow I have another grandma, and she\u2019s the principal of my school! Her husband, who\u2019s fucking my mom, is looking for his son, who\u2019s my father! A few days ago, I kissed my aunt!\u201d How to follow that? Well, as season two begins, the big news is that Winden has been destroyed by a nuclear explosion. It is less devastating to the storytelling than it sounds, because the action is evenly shared between the 1920s, 50s, 80s (featuring some terrific back-combing, and a pair of high-waisted fuchsia slacks that deserve their own International Emmy), the present and the grumpy, irradiated 2050s. Protagonists start appearing in different decades with abandon. Lest viewers start pinning mugshots of the characters to their walls and linking them with string, Netflix has taken the unusual step of producing an online guide to who the ruddy hellfire everyone is. That\u2019s more necessary than ever as Dark continues to gaily fiddle with the established settings of TV time travel by allowing characters to converse with their younger selves. Halfway through season two, Jonas has bigger worries than getting off with his aunt: if he\u2019s not careful, he\u2019ll end up accidentally killing or having sex with himself. The problem is one shared by other wilfully confusing sci-fi sagas. Characters do not typically have conflicts or goals beyond trying to figure out what\u2019s going on. But that search for answers is all the dramatic impetus a show like Dark needs. The narrative is forbiddingly elaborate on purpose. What matters is how it feels to the members of this exclusive little club \u2013 and Dark, with its absolute sincerity and lush production, is a luxurious myth.",

      "body": "<p>In the 1920s Maud West, AKA \u201cLondon\u2019s Premier Lady Detective\u201d, shared some of the highlights of her brilliant career with the readers of the distinctly dreggier end of the newspaper market. Her stream of thrilling anecdotes featured runaway heiresses, dodgy foreigners, stolen necklaces, car chases and forged wills. There was that time West found herself being shot at by a gang of enraged heavies in the backstreets of Paris. Or the case that involved her shadowing an elegant woman around Britain\u2019s principal naval bases before unmasking her as \u201ca highly-paid enemy spy\u201d. But the real <em>pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance</em> came when West was cornered in a Brazilian drug factory while breezily jotting down the secret recipe for top-notch cocaine.</p> <p>No matter how tricky the situation or dastardly the foe, West insisted that she was never less than in total control. On one occasion an angry blackmailer burst into her Bloomsbury office with a triumphant cry: \u201cI am fortunate in finding you alone Miss West.\u201d At which point West coolly picked up a loaded revolver from her writing table: \u201c\u2018Oh, not quite alone,\u2019 I responded with a laugh.\u201d It was now that the baddies usually gave up, ruefully admitting: \u201cGood Heavens, we are nobbled\u201d, before meekly handing themselves over to the firm but fair hands of a detective like no other.</p> <p>When that particular blackmailer showed up at her premises, West was presumably wearing her ordinary office clothes: a photograph from around this time shows her as a plump-faced, middle-aged woman in a sober yet stylish dress, completed by a single strand of pearls. Yet, as she liked to make very clear to the readers of Pearson\u2019s Weekly, the Sunday Dispatch and a host of other downmarket rags, when she got down to serious detecting West was far more likely to look like someone else entirely. Dressing up as an old village woman allowed her to pass unnoticed as she embarked on her own particular version of <em>Midsomer Murders</em>. Disguising herself as a young floozy in order to entice tipsy young men into giving up their secrets was even easier: \u201cA pair of heavy earrings make me look frightfully common.\u201d Passing herself off as an itinerant fortune teller in order to extract gossip from a local servants\u2019 hall was simply a matter of acquiring \u201ca wonderful robe \u2026 covered with black cats and moons\u201d and waiting for gossipy housemaids to spill the beans.</p> <p>The \u201cdiscretion\u201d that West always emphasised in her professional advertisements was indivisible from her gender. Infiltrating a country house as a parlourmaid allowed her to intercept a fateful letter in a lady\u2019s boudoir before it reached its intended recipient. Decking herself out with those \u201cfrightfully common\u201d earrings earned her an invitation to a gentleman\u2019s private apartment, whereupon she quickly administered a sleeping draft before rifling through her new friend\u2019s drawers for damning evidence that he was engaged in a dastardly blackmail plot. Once, she claimed, she had donned a navy dress and a bicycle and gone into the East End in the guise of a district nurse. It was West\u2019s invisibility as a woman, combined with her ability to represent herself as a series of \u201ctypes\u201d, that made her such an effective detective, at least in her own wild telling. She could go anywhere because she was nobody.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance came when West was caught in a Brazilian drug factory jotting down a secret recipe for cocaine</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>All the same, it was dressing up as a man that West claimed as her particular speciality. She was, she liked to boast to the American press particularly, a dab hand at squeezing into a three-piece suit, sticking on some facial hair and sauntering into such sacred male spaces as a gentlemen\u2019s club in order to strike up a conversation with whichever blackguard she happened to be stalking at the time. Once she was a gambling man called \u201cJimmy\u201d and on another occasion she was a foreign businessman in a bow tie. Yet the photographs accompanying these articles, featuring pantomime prosthetics, are so laughably crude that one wonders whether West really did manage to convince as anything other than a heavyset middle-aged woman with a large bust who for some obscure reason had decided to impersonate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/charliechaplin\" title=\"\">Charlie Chaplin</a>. Her dogged insistence that she spent half her professional life passing successfully as a man does suggest that what we are dealing with here is not so much a master of disguise as a woman with a rich inner life who has found a way of channelling her urgent desire to cross-dress. Either that, or she has correctly intuited that hundreds of thousands of readers around the world find it titillating to read about a lady wearing trousers.</p> <p>In this breezy book, Susannah Stapleton doesn\u2019t go deeply into any of this, but instead keeps her tone relentlessly larky. Indeed, her own persona is that of a latter-day Golden Age lady sleuth who has been commissioned to solve a tricky case of mistaken identity rather than worry too much about its whys and wherefores. Stapleton does, however, pause for long enough to acknowledge that West\u2019s practice of passing herself off as someone else may not have been a matter of personal pathology so much as a symptom of the times. Far from being the barrister\u2019s daughter she claimed, West was actually Edith Elliott, a sailor\u2019s daughter from Deptford, south-east London. In an age of easier divorce, cheap travel and economic uncertainty, it made sense to imagine a new life for yourself if the old one no longer fitted. So it was lucky that there were lady detectives such as West on hand \u2013 she was neither London\u2019s premier nor only female sleuth \u2013 to make sure that civilisation did not buckle in the process. Under her watchful eye, diamond necklaces were restored to their rightful owners, husbands went back to their wives (or at least paid them off handsomely), deeds to country houses were placed in the hands of legitimate heirs, and West went home to her life as a wife and mother in Finchley wearing a dress. The world had become legible once more.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Adventures of Maud West, Lady Detective: Secrets and Lies in the Golden Age of Crime by Susannah Stapleton is published by Picador (\u00a320).

      "bodyText": "In the 1920s Maud West, AKA \u201cLondon\u2019s Premier Lady Detective\u201d, shared some of the highlights of her brilliant career with the readers of the distinctly dreggier end of the newspaper market. Her stream of thrilling anecdotes featured runaway heiresses, dodgy foreigners, stolen necklaces, car chases and forged wills. There was that time West found herself being shot at by a gang of enraged heavies in the backstreets of Paris. Or the case that involved her shadowing an elegant woman around Britain\u2019s principal naval bases before unmasking her as \u201ca highly-paid enemy spy\u201d. But the real pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance came when West was cornered in a Brazilian drug factory while breezily jotting down the secret recipe for top-notch cocaine. No matter how tricky the situation or dastardly the foe, West insisted that she was never less than in total control. On one occasion an angry blackmailer burst into her Bloomsbury office with a triumphant cry: \u201cI am fortunate in finding you alone Miss West.\u201d At which point West coolly picked up a loaded revolver from her writing table: \u201c\u2018Oh, not quite alone,\u2019 I responded with a laugh.\u201d It was now that the baddies usually gave up, ruefully admitting: \u201cGood Heavens, we are nobbled\u201d, before meekly handing themselves over to the firm but fair hands of a detective like no other. When that particular blackmailer showed up at her premises, West was presumably wearing her ordinary office clothes: a photograph from around this time shows her as a plump-faced, middle-aged woman in a sober yet stylish dress, completed by a single strand of pearls. Yet, as she liked to make very clear to the readers of Pearson\u2019s Weekly, the Sunday Dispatch and a host of other downmarket rags, when she got down to serious detecting West was far more likely to look like someone else entirely. Dressing up as an old village woman allowed her to pass unnoticed as she embarked on her own particular version of Midsomer Murders. Disguising herself as a young floozy in order to entice tipsy young men into giving up their secrets was even easier: \u201cA pair of heavy earrings make me look frightfully common.\u201d Passing herself off as an itinerant fortune teller in order to extract gossip from a local servants\u2019 hall was simply a matter of acquiring \u201ca wonderful robe \u2026 covered with black cats and moons\u201d and waiting for gossipy housemaids to spill the beans. The \u201cdiscretion\u201d that West always emphasised in her professional advertisements was indivisible from her gender. Infiltrating a country house as a parlourmaid allowed her to intercept a fateful letter in a lady\u2019s boudoir before it reached its intended recipient. Decking herself out with those \u201cfrightfully common\u201d earrings earned her an invitation to a gentleman\u2019s private apartment, whereupon she quickly administered a sleeping draft before rifling through her new friend\u2019s drawers for damning evidence that he was engaged in a dastardly blackmail plot. Once, she claimed, she had donned a navy dress and a bicycle and gone into the East End in the guise of a district nurse. It was West\u2019s invisibility as a woman, combined with her ability to represent herself as a series of \u201ctypes\u201d, that made her such an effective detective, at least in her own wild telling. She could go anywhere because she was nobody. All the same, it was dressing up as a man that West claimed as her particular speciality. She was, she liked to boast to the American press particularly, a dab hand at squeezing into a three-piece suit, sticking on some facial hair and sauntering into such sacred male spaces as a gentlemen\u2019s club in order to strike up a conversation with whichever blackguard she happened to be stalking at the time. Once she was a gambling man called \u201cJimmy\u201d and on another occasion she was a foreign businessman in a bow tie. Yet the photographs accompanying these articles, featuring pantomime prosthetics, are so laughably crude that one wonders whether West really did manage to convince as anything other than a heavyset middle-aged woman with a large bust who for some obscure reason had decided to impersonate Charlie Chaplin. Her dogged insistence that she spent half her professional life passing successfully as a man does suggest that what we are dealing with here is not so much a master of disguise as a woman with a rich inner life who has found a way of channelling her urgent desire to cross-dress. Either that, or she has correctly intuited that hundreds of thousands of readers around the world find it titillating to read about a lady wearing trousers. In this breezy book, Susannah Stapleton doesn\u2019t go deeply into any of this, but instead keeps her tone relentlessly larky. Indeed, her own persona is that of a latter-day Golden Age lady sleuth who has been commissioned to solve a tricky case of mistaken identity rather than worry too much about its whys and wherefores. Stapleton does, however, pause for long enough to acknowledge that West\u2019s practice of passing herself off as someone else may not have been a matter of personal pathology so much as a symptom of the times. Far from being the barrister\u2019s daughter she claimed, West was actually Edith Elliott, a sailor\u2019s daughter from Deptford, south-east London. In an age of easier divorce, cheap travel and economic uncertainty, it made sense to imagine a new life for yourself if the old one no longer fitted. So it was lucky that there were lady detectives such as West on hand \u2013 she was neither London\u2019s premier nor only female sleuth \u2013 to make sure that civilisation did not buckle in the process. Under her watchful eye, diamond necklaces were restored to their rightful owners, husbands went back to their wives (or at least paid them off handsomely), deeds to country houses were placed in the hands of legitimate heirs, and West went home to her life as a wife and mother in Finchley wearing a dress. The world had become legible once more. \u2022 The Adventures of Maud West, Lady Detective: Secrets and Lies in the Golden Age of Crime by Susannah Stapleton is published by Picador (\u00a320).

Scott Hutchison, the singer and chief songwriter of the Scottish indie-rock band, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/11/body-found-in-search-for-frightened-rabbit-singer-scott-hutchison\" title=\"\">took his own life last year</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/11/body-found-in-search-for-frightened-rabbit-singer-scott-hutchison\" title=\"\">aged 36</a>, after years with depression. Grant Hutchison, the band\u2019s drummer and Scott\u2019s younger brother, feels that the music now belongs to the listeners who were consoled by the band\u2019s deeply empathic music.

The band are therefore keen that it should not be seen as a tribute to a life cut short. \u201cI try to keep looking at it as a celebration,\u201d says the guitarist Andy Monaghan. \u201cIt has taken on a different energy, I guess, but I don\u2019t want to dwell on that. It\u2019s a celebration of what the band had become, and the relationships with the artists who are on there.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://thetwilightsad.com/\" title=\"\">The Twilight Sad</a> cover <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGsYK3xSkio\" title=\"\">Floating in the Forth</a>, in which Scott articulated a desire to end his life alongside his decision not to do so. As the band closest to Frightened Rabbit since the beginning of their careers, the band\u2019s singer, James Graham, says he felt a sense of duty in taking on the track.</p> <p>\u201cWho else could have touched that? It scares me that we did that song. But I felt that we, as his friends, could step up and do it.\u201d The song\u2019s final line, which in the original is sung with a sort of desperate euphoria, is: \u201cI think I\u2019ll save suicide for another year.\u201d In Graham\u2019s version, that line becomes a refrain, emphasising the optimism and hope of his friend\u2019s choice to live. \u201cThen,\u201d he says, \u201cwhat happened happened.\u201d</p> <p>After making two troubling posts on Twitter, Scott left his hotel just west of Edinburgh late at night. His body was found in the same river he had sung about. \u201cI still love the song,\u201d says Grant of Floating in the Forth, \u201cbut I\u2019ll probably never listen to it again.\u201d</p> <p>He recalls the first time his brother let him hear it. \u201cThat was like a gut punch. But it was such a beautiful song. I remember thinking: \u2018Should this go on the album? Is that OK?\u2019 And I remember saying: \u2018What is Mum going to think?\u2019 But that happened with every album, particularly the last one.\u201d This was 2016\u2019s <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21679-painting-of-a-panic-attack/\" title=\"\">Painting of a Panic Attack</a>. \u201cScott having come a lot closer to taking his own life over the years, that was far more worrying than when I first heard Midnight Organ Fight because it was a lot more real.\u201d</p> <p>Scott had an alcohol dependency, according to Grant, something that was related to his depression. He would drink to forget how he felt. That last album contained a song titled I Wish I Was Sober. \u201cBy the time the last record was written,\u201d says Grant, \u201cI knew in my head that this was how it would end. I said to my girlfriend at the time that this is going to happen.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The energy. The feeling. The majority of the time, when our relationship was strong, those nights were indescribable</p> <footer> <cite>Grant Hutchison</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You had braced yourself for his death? \u201cYeah, over a period of maybe a year and a half. There were lots of signs. In terms of the family and how we all coped, I think I was more prepared. I hadn\u2019t made my peace with it because it\u2019s still an incredibly difficult and shocking thing to happen. But I kind of knew that was how he would say goodbye. I knew it wouldn\u2019t be a case of us growing old and one of us going to the other\u2019s funeral when we were 70, 80 years old.\u201d</p> <p>Grant, who has received counselling in the wake of Scott\u2019s death, says that grief hasn\u2019t had a straight trajectory. \u201cThe normal things you\u2019ll read about grief, they didn\u2019t apply to me. What I read a lot were the steps that you go through, but they weren\u2019t linear like that for me. It was like one day, it\u2019s this and the next day, it jumps to this.\u201d Even now? \u201cIt still jumps all the time. Obviously, with suicide, there\u2019s a lot of guilt that comes with it, which is the hardest one to deal with.\u201d</p> <p>Grant says that he was wary of saying to his brother: \u201cDon\u2019t do this\u201d, worried that any direct conversation might only add to the burden of Scott\u2019s pain and stress. (The Samaritans\u2019 suicide prevention advice says that people should not be afraid to tackle the subject of suicide with someone contemplating it, and that anything that helps them to open up and seek help is good.) Grant says: \u201cHis depression and anxiety were bad enough without me going: \u2018I need you to stay.\u2019 It\u2019s a horrible thing to say, but some people just don\u2019t want to be here. I did so many things over the years that probably did stop it happening [for a while].\u201d These included encouraging his brother to have therapy, and to consider cancelling shows and tours to ease the pressure.</p> <p>Although Grant was the younger brother, he acted like the elder: a steadying and responsible presence. Even when they were children, Scott was so anxious about sleeping alone at night that Grant\u2019s bed was moved into his room. Frightened Rabbit was Scott\u2019s nickname as a child, given to him by their mother.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mroE93NtpBM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mroE93NtpBM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The Modern Leper.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Grant is OK at compartmentalising his life, he says, but finds it hard to separate Scott the singer from the family member. An attempt to do so was partly behind his decision a few years ago to take a short break from Frightened Rabbit, reasoning: \u201cOK, if I can\u2019t be in a band with you then I still want you as a brother.\u201d</p> <p>There was distance between them for a time, but Grant says the closeness did return. In the month before Scott\u2019s death, they did a short tour of small venues as part of their <a href=\"http://mastersystemband.com/\" title=\"\">Mastersystem</a> side project, and travelled by van. \u201cIt was a load of fun and no pressure. It felt like going back to where we\u2019d started.\u201d</p> <p>One reason Frightened Rabbit are so important to so many people is because of the overwhelming mutual empathy in the room when they played live. The joy and force of the music, juxtaposed with the sadness and candour of the lyrics, created a sense of a crowd and band with their arms around one another.</p> <p>For the Hutchisons, too, gigs seemed to be the place where those distinctions between brother and bandmate collapsed. \u201cEven when things were not good between us, we always connected,\u201d Grant recalls. \u201cThe energy. The feeling. The majority of the time, when our relationship was strong, those nights were indescribable.\u201d</p> <p>Grant wants to be able to enjoy listening to the music of Frightened Rabbit again. \u201cI\u2019ve got two nieces and a nephew through my older brother, and I hope to one day have kids. And I want Scott to be a big part of their lives.\u201d He would like to be able to play the songs to those children and say: \u201cThis was your uncle. This is what he sounded like. This is what he did with his life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c9c478debb901a6badc568a780ff3933454373eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9c478debb901a6badc568a780ff3933454373eb/0_42_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott on stage in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott on stage in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julia Drummond</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The songs they hear may include material which has not, so far, been released. Scott, working with Monaghan, had recorded demos for the next Frightened Rabbit album, and the vocals are good enough to use.

When a famous musician dies, there is often a well-intentioned tendency to romanticise them as a tragic figure. Ought it be resisted? Liddell nods: \u201cI don\u2019t think Scott\u2019s legacy or memory should be shrouded in darkness.\u201d</p> <p>Since Scott\u2019s death, the Twilight Sad have been performing the Frightened Rabbit song Keep Yourself Warm in concert, intended as a moment of shared catharsis for band and audience. For Graham, what made his friend special as a songwriter was his ability to write about heartbreak in a way that wasn\u2019t simply confessional, but allowed listeners to feel that their own darkness was being expressed.</p> <p>\u201cScott\u2019s voice will always be with us. His words will always be with us,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop shouting from the rooftops or screaming from small stages about how amazing he was.

She tweeted: \u201c[Field] must be immediately suspended or sacked. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who is wondering why no one intervened. So much violence does not seem justified. An investigation needs to take place as soon as possible.\u201d In a statement Field said he reacted \u201cinstinctively\u201d and had been \u201cgenuinely worried\u201d that the protester might be armed. He said he \u201cgrasped the intruder firmly in order to remove her from the room as swiftly as possible\u201d, adding: \u201cI deeply regret this episode and unreservedly apologise to the lady concerned for grabbing her but in the current climate I felt I needed to act decisively to close down the threat to the safety of those present.\u201d Field said he had referred himself to the Cabinet Office to \u201cexamine if there has been a breach of the ministerial code and will of course cooperate fully with their investigation\u201d. The Liberal Democrat former cabinet minister Sir Ed Davey called on Field to resign from the government. \u201cNo ifs, no buts about this. The sight of some penguin-suited Tory minister behaving in a violent way towards a female Greenpeace activist absolutely stinks.\u201d Field\u2019s fellow Conservative MP, Alistair Burt, was shown the clip by the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme and, afterwards, said: \u201cMark will answer for himself but it looks to be a very difficult situation for everyone concerned.\u201d The Tory MP Sir Peter Bottomley defended Field, saying the activist \u201cwas trying to create a fuss. Most viewers would say it\u2019s good that she didn\u2019t succeed.\u201d Last month, Field delivered a speech at a Westminster Hall debate in which he decried violence against and intimidation of female activists across the world. The Foreign Office and Downing Street were contacted for comment. According to the video, the rest of the activists were forced out of the room. After they had been removed, Hammond claimed it was \u201cironic\u201d they had chosen to stage the protest shortly after the government had announced its commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Afterwards, Greenpeace UK countered that the Treasury had \u201ctried to water down\u201d the government\u2019s action on climate change. Also on Thursday night, Sandbach posted an image on social media of messages she said were from a colleague and suggested that similar abuse had been behind the decisions of three female former Tory MPs to leave the party. \u201cBarely is the ink dry on the results and the dark ops begin,\u201d Sandbach, who supported Rory Stewart in the leadership race, wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis from a male conservative MP to me as I sit on the train home.\u201d The messages, which came only hours after Tory MPs voted Boris Johnson and the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, through to the final round of the party leadership contest, read: \u201cYou too are a disgrace. Time you left the party I think.\u201d She tagged it with the words \u201ccompletewankspangle\u201d and later deleted the tweet. In a supplementary tweet that remained live, the MP for Eddisbury added: \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough when you get it from complete strangers. Is it any wonder three female MPs left.\u201d Hunt denounced the messages, and added: \u201cWe have to come together as a party.\u201d Julian Smith, the government chief whip, promised to investigate and offered to meet Sandbach on Monday. Smith said the messages were \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d, and thanked Sandbach for supporting the government in parliamentary votes on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit withdrawal agreement. Sandbach told the Guardian on Thursday night that she and the party were dealing with the incident internally. \ufeff\u2022 This article was amended on 21 June 2019 because an earlier version referred to the Conservative MP Alistair Burt as a Foreign Office minister. Burt resigned from that position in March 2019. This has been corrected.",

Planes were in the air and ships were in position, but no missiles had been fired when word came to stand down on Thursday night, the New York Times quoted an unnamed official as saying. US military and diplomatic officials were expecting strikes on a handful of radar and missile sites after the president\u2019s top national security officials and congressional leaders gathered at the White House, the paper said.

Khamenei has repeatedly said he will not talk to the US until it lifts economic sanctions, adding he does not trust Trump\u2019s motives. The reported contact with Oman suggests that the White House might have been involved in brinkmanship with Tehran, but pulled back when Iran did not flinch. US officials said that Trump was known to want talks, but was also a believer in sending mixed messages to keep his adversaries guessing about his next move.

Trump had earlier appeared keen to calm tensions following the shooting down early on Thursday of the US Global Hawk drone, saying blame might be on a \u201cloose and stupid\u201d Iranian officer acting without authorisation from Tehran.

      "body": "<p>The future of mobile phones is finally here. You can go out and buy a 5G phone, and if you happen to be in one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/25/what-is-5g-and-when-can-i-get-it-in-the-uk\" title=\"\">six cities across the UK in which EE\u2019s 5G network</a> is up and running, you can get the blistering mobile broadband speeds we\u2019ve been promised will revolutionise our mobile lives, again. But should you?</p> \n<p>I\u2019ve spent the past two weeks equipped with the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G on first-out-of-the-gate EE\u2019s 5G network. I streamed 2K HDR movies, downloaded whole albums in seconds and generally used it like I would on my extremely fast 350Mbps home wifi \u2013 data caps be damned.</p> \n<p>So what is 5G like, and is it worth buying into? The answer to both those questions is \u2026 complicated.</p> \n<h2><strong>Bursts of speed</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ff3eb5100a348d8b25cf4a2516b514c24394238\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ff3eb5100a348d8b25cf4a2516b514c24394238/854_901_3709_2225/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Speeds in St. Pauls were some of the highest in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Speeds in St. Pauls were some of the highest in London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EE</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Is 5G faster than 4G? Absolutely. Day to day in the most congested parts of London, it was at least double the speed of EE\u2019s 4G, sometimes up to 10 times faster.</p> \n<p>That meant speeds varied wildly as I trundled through patches of 5G on the train. At <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/hub/stop/HUBEPH/elephant-castle/\" title=\"\">Elephant and Castle</a> in the morning rush hour I got full 5G signal, but only speeds of about 3Mbps \u2013 still double the 1.5Mbps 4G could produce at the same time.</p> \n<p>A few hundred metres down the tracks stuck outside Blackfriars, speeds in excess of 120Mbps were routine, with 4G capping out at less than 30Mbps. A similar experience was had outside Victoria and several other central London stations.</p> \n<p>On foot in 5G areas such as St Paul\u2019s or Covent Garden, it was clear that speeds were much more transformative. On-the-street speeds of 200-300Mbps were the norm in the lunchtime rush, with peaks of 500Mbps or more at less congested times, which is genuinely faster than my home broadband.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"915f76c8-c4a7-47fb-a8bd-d4098bd7f6cc\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>5G is the next generation mobile phone network and it promises much higher connection speeds, lower latency (response times) and to be more reliable than the creaking&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/4g\">4G</a>&nbsp;networks we have now.</p>\n    <p>It will be much faster, with download speeds 5-10 times quicker than 4G to start with, meaning a movie will download in seconds rather than minutes. Over the next few years it should become even faster, as the technology matures. It will also have lower latency, the time it takes for something to happen: tap a link and the download will start faster.</p>\n    <p>But perhaps the most important thing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/5g\">5G</a>&nbsp;will immediately do for users is increase the carrying capacity of the masts, meaning more people can connect at the same time.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/samuel-gibbs\"><b>Samuel Gibbs</b></a>, <i>consumer technology editor&nbsp;</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The speed can be blistering, with full movies downloading from Netflix in seconds. But what is noticeable is how that speed is delivered. It\u2019s rapid: click the button and something happens instantaneously.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s a bit like driving a high performance car. More or less any car can hit 60mph, but a Tesla Model S can do so in 2.4 seconds. You\u2019re not driving any faster, but it is so much more instantaneous it <em>feels </em>faster. 5G inherently feels faster because everything happens so much quicker, even if the data actually downloads at the same speed.</p> \n<p>The other advantage of 5G right now is that you remove the effects of congestion. We\u2019ve all been there: sitting on that packed commuter train or bus with full 4G signal but nothing happening when you tap that link apart from your phone getting hot.</p> \n<p>Even at this early stage 5G cures that problem, meaning you can do what you want, when you want, even if that means streaming the TV show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/19/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-review-the-undead-prove-dead-funny\" title=\"\">What We Do In the Shadows</a> on the morning commute.</p> \n<h2><strong>Wider coverage than expected</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2d473818d85cbe3300f7c8f0883e3761a76f0b13\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d473818d85cbe3300f7c8f0883e3761a76f0b13/0_0_3544_5003/708.jpg\" alt=\"EE\u2019s 5G coverage map\" width=\"708\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">EE\u2019s 5G coverage map</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EE</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It is very early days for 5G in the UK, but it still feels like we\u2019re more prepared for 5G than we were for the similar transition to 4G and 3G before that.</p> \n<p>For one, we have compelling handsets that behave exactly the same as their 4G counterparts. Not some bulky, crippled phone that suffers because of the addition of 5G.</p> \n<p>The OnePlus 7 Pro 5G, for instance, has the same thickness, weight and even battery life as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/31/oneplus-7-pro-review-an-absolute-beast-in-every-way\">excellent 4G version</a>. The only difference, as far as the consumer is concerned, is that it can connect to a 5G network when there\u2019s one active and it only supports a single sim.</p> \n<p>EE too appears more prepared with wider 5G coverage than you might expect. I was surprised to find it in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark_Hill\" title=\"\">Denmark Hill</a> in London\u2019s zone two, for instance, and every day there appeared to be additional patches where the little 5G symbol began to appear in the suburbs of London. It\u2019s not exactly blanket coverage in the six cities in which it is active and it\u2019s mostly available outdoors, but it\u2019s a good start.</p> \n<p>Of course, you still have internet when you\u2019re not on 5G, as you simply swap between 4G and 5G. And sometimes that means it can be hard to tell if you\u2019re on the faster network as the 5G symbol disappears when you start to download a track or watch a video.</p> \n<p>These are the pains of an early adopter. Which is exactly what you are if you buy into 5G right now. But apart from the added expense \u2013 which is about \u00a35 a month on EE \u2013 you\u2019re not getting a worse phone experience. The traditional first-generation pains of poor battery life and excessive heat have been at least partially mitigated.</p> \n<h2><strong>Buy now or wait?</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"219601873ffe3fd4a91656ab45265c2cb5c61bb0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/219601873ffe3fd4a91656ab45265c2cb5c61bb0/533_465_4164_2499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The OnePlus 7 Pro 5G is one of the best phones on the market right now and also happens to have 5G connectivity.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The OnePlus 7 Pro 5G is one of the best phones on the market right now and also happens to have 5G connectivity.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the near future buying a 5G-capable phone will be recommended, simply because we\u2019re keeping our handsets for longer. You may not see the immediate benefits of 5G today, but you will in your second, third or fourth year with your phone. Future-proofing is always a guessing game, but a 4G phone in 2022 might look like a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/19/nokia-3310-review-snake-t9-texts-sleek-design-camera\">new Nokia 3310</a> now. Delightfully retro. Decidedly quaint.</p> \n<p>So should you get 5G now? If you\u2019re in the process of upgrading, have the money to burn, live in an area with at least limited 5G coverage and were already looking at high-end phones such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/31/oneplus-7-pro-review-an-absolute-beast-in-every-way\">OnePlus 7 Pro</a>, there\u2019s no real downside.</p> \n<p>There are a few things of which to be aware. First, if you want a small phone you\u2019re out of luck, as all 5G phones have massive screens right now. Secondly, you will likely need more data allowance than you think you do. When it flows this quickly you end up using more of it. Thirdly, uploads of things such as photos and videos still use the 4G network, as do calls and other non-download related activities.</p> \n<p>And lastly, by next year the second generation of 5G phones will launch, potentially offering better performance, longer battery life and smaller sizes.</p> \n<p>EE is the only game in town right now, but Vodafone will launch its 5G offerings on 3 July with Three launching 5G mobile broadband in London in August and O2 by the end of 2019.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/25/what-is-5g-and-when-can-i-get-it-in-the-uk\">What is 5G and when can I get it in the UK?</a></strong></p></li> \n</ul>",

You can go out and buy a 5G phone, and if you happen to be in one of the six cities across the UK in which EE\u2019s 5G network is up and running, you can get the blistering mobile broadband speeds we\u2019ve been promised will revolutionise our mobile lives, again. But should you? I\u2019ve spent the past two weeks equipped with the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G on first-out-of-the-gate EE\u2019s 5G network. I streamed 2K HDR movies, downloaded whole albums in seconds and generally used it like I would on my extremely fast 350Mbps home wifi \u2013 data caps be damned. So what is 5G like, and is it worth buying into? The answer to both those questions is \u2026 complicated. Bursts of speed Is 5G faster than 4G? Absolutely. Day to day in the most congested parts of London, it was at least double the speed of EE\u2019s 4G, sometimes up to 10 times faster. That meant speeds varied wildly as I trundled through patches of 5G on the train. At Elephant and Castle in the morning rush hour I got full 5G signal, but only speeds of about 3Mbps \u2013 still double the 1.5Mbps 4G could produce at the same time. A few hundred metres down the tracks stuck outside Blackfriars, speeds in excess of 120Mbps were routine, with 4G capping out at less than 30Mbps. A similar experience was had outside Victoria and several other central London stations. On foot in 5G areas such as St Paul\u2019s or Covent Garden, it was clear that speeds were much more transformative. On-the-street speeds of 200-300Mbps were the norm in the lunchtime rush, with peaks of 500Mbps or more at less congested times, which is genuinely faster than my home broadband. The speed can be blistering, with full movies downloading from Netflix in seconds. But what is noticeable is how that speed is delivered. It\u2019s rapid: click the button and something happens instantaneously. It\u2019s a bit like driving a high performance car. More or less any car can hit 60mph, but a Tesla Model S can do so in 2.4 seconds. You\u2019re not driving any faster, but it is so much more instantaneous it feels faster. 5G inherently feels faster because everything happens so much quicker, even if the data actually downloads at the same speed. The other advantage of 5G right now is that you remove the effects of congestion. We\u2019ve all been there: sitting on that packed commuter train or bus with full 4G signal but nothing happening when you tap that link apart from your phone getting hot. Even at this early stage 5G cures that problem, meaning you can do what you want, when you want, even if that means streaming the TV show What We Do In the Shadows on the morning commute. Wider coverage than expected It is very early days for 5G in the UK, but it still feels like we\u2019re more prepared for 5G than we were for the similar transition to 4G and 3G before that. For one, we have compelling handsets that behave exactly the same as their 4G counterparts. Not some bulky, crippled phone that suffers because of the addition of 5G. The OnePlus 7 Pro 5G, for instance, has the same thickness, weight and even battery life as the excellent 4G version. The only difference, as far as the consumer is concerned, is that it can connect to a 5G network when there\u2019s one active and it only supports a single sim. EE too appears more prepared with wider 5G coverage than you might expect. I was surprised to find it in Denmark Hill in London\u2019s zone two, for instance, and every day there appeared to be additional patches where the little 5G symbol began to appear in the suburbs of London. It\u2019s not exactly blanket coverage in the six cities in which it is active and it\u2019s mostly available outdoors, but it\u2019s a good start. Of course, you still have internet when you\u2019re not on 5G, as you simply swap between 4G and 5G. And sometimes that means it can be hard to tell if you\u2019re on the faster network as the 5G symbol disappears when you start to download a track or watch a video. These are the pains of an early adopter. Which is exactly what you are if you buy into 5G right now. But apart from the added expense \u2013 which is about \u00a35 a month on EE \u2013 you\u2019re not getting a worse phone experience. The traditional first-generation pains of poor battery life and excessive heat have been at least partially mitigated. Buy now or wait? In the near future buying a 5G-capable phone will be recommended, simply because we\u2019re keeping our handsets for longer. You may not see the immediate benefits of 5G today, but you will in your second, third or fourth year with your phone. Future-proofing is always a guessing game, but a 4G phone in 2022 might look like a new Nokia 3310 now. Delightfully retro. Decidedly quaint. So should you get 5G now? If you\u2019re in the process of upgrading, have the money to burn, live in an area with at least limited 5G coverage and were already looking at high-end phones such as the OnePlus 7 Pro, there\u2019s no real downside. There are a few things of which to be aware. First, if you want a small phone you\u2019re out of luck, as all 5G phones have massive screens right now. Secondly, you will likely need more data allowance than you think you do. When it flows this quickly you end up using more of it. Thirdly, uploads of things such as photos and videos still use the 4G network, as do calls and other non-download related activities. And lastly, by next year the second generation of 5G phones will launch, potentially offering better performance, longer battery life and smaller sizes. EE is the only game in town right now, but Vodafone will launch its 5G offerings on 3 July with Three launching 5G mobile broadband in London in August and O2 by the end of 2019. What is 5G and when can I get it in the UK?",

      "body": "<p>One of the world\u2019s most prestigious centres of Islamic learning has issued a fatwa against child marriage, saying marriage should be based on the consent of both parties and \u201cparticularly the young woman\u201d.</p> <p>The deputy grand imam of al-Azhar, considered by some Muslims to be the highest authority of Islamic jurisprudence, hammered out the document with his team and young activists at the <a href=\"https://www.africa4girls2030.org/en_US/\">first African summit</a> on child marriage and female genital mutilation, which took place in Senegal this week.</p> <p>If news of the fatwa\u2019s existence can reach imams in countries with high rates of child marriage, activists hope that the practice can be stopped, as they could not deny al-Azhar\u2019s authority.</p> <p>\u201cMarriage in Islam is based on the consent of both parties, particularly the young woman. Such consent requires the young woman to have reached the age of maturity and reason, so that her consent is validly given,\u201d the fatwa read, adding that this age was 18, and quoting parts of the Qur\u2019an and the hadiths of the prophet Muhammad to support it.</p> <p>The summit was organised by Jaha Dukureh, a Gambian campaigner and the founder of <a href=\"http://safehandsforgirls.org/\">Safe Hands for Girls</a>, herself a survivor of child marriage and FGM, who drove a successful campaign to end FGM in her country.</p> <p>Dukureh, who went to Egypt to talk to the al-Azhar clerics last year, described how towards the end of the summit she realised that the fatwa had not yet been issued and went to talk to the imam, Salah Abbas.

      "bodyText": "One of the world\u2019s most prestigious centres of Islamic learning has issued a fatwa against child marriage, saying marriage should be based on the consent of both parties and \u201cparticularly the young woman\u201d. The deputy grand imam of al-Azhar, considered by some Muslims to be the highest authority of Islamic jurisprudence, hammered out the document with his team and young activists at the first African summit on child marriage and female genital mutilation, which took place in Senegal this week. If news of the fatwa\u2019s existence can reach imams in countries with high rates of child marriage, activists hope that the practice can be stopped, as they could not deny al-Azhar\u2019s authority. \u201cMarriage in Islam is based on the consent of both parties, particularly the young woman. Such consent requires the young woman to have reached the age of maturity and reason, so that her consent is validly given,\u201d the fatwa read, adding that this age was 18, and quoting parts of the Qur\u2019an and the hadiths of the prophet Muhammad to support it. The summit was organised by Jaha Dukureh, a Gambian campaigner and the founder of Safe Hands for Girls, herself a survivor of child marriage and FGM, who drove a successful campaign to end FGM in her country. Dukureh, who went to Egypt to talk to the al-Azhar clerics last year, described how towards the end of the summit she realised that the fatwa had not yet been issued and went to talk to the imam, Salah Abbas. She, the African Union youth envoy Aya Chebbi and the Syrian journalist Abdalaziz Alhamza worked with the Egyptian imams to turn their rough draft, scrawled on hotel notepaper, into a formal document. \u201cWe sat there on the floor with them, writing the fatwa. They had to call Egypt to ensure that everything was in line. And then there was a back and forth about the languages, because in Arabic things can be translated different ways. To me, it was just amazing watching that process.\u201d Four in 10 young women in sub-Saharan Africa are married before their 18th birthday. Boys are affected too \u2013 according to recent UN data, roughly one in 30 worldwide were married as children, with the highest number in Central African Republic, where almost a third of boys and men were child grooms. The problem is not limited to Africa \u2013 across the world, 12 million girls are married in childhood every year. In Iraq in 2017, parliamentarians drafted a law that would allow children as young as nine to marry, based on the idea that the prophet Muhammad married his wife Aisha when she was just nine years old. The prime minister blocked the bill last year, but there are fears it will be reintroduced. \u201cWhen you force a girl to get married, you\u2019ve given someone the right to rape her over and over again,\u201d said Dukureh, who was married at 15 and again at 17. \u201cAnd every single day, every time she\u2019s touched \u2026 you don\u2019t forget.

Brian Beal, a professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias, said that his research has found that as much as 99% of clams in many parts of Maine are <a href=\"https://umaine.edu/news/blog/2018/05/15/green-crab-predation-identified-cause-maine-clam-decline/\">dying before they reach adulthood</a>. Many of those are eaten by green crabs.</p> <p>Further south in Ipswich, Massachusetts, the town pays a bounty of $0.40 per pound on green crabs, hoping to save the clams which \u2013 for those who eat them in the US \u2013 put the town on the map. Ipswich shellfish constable Scott LaPreste says the town is currently hauling up about 75,000 pounds of green crabs a year under the program.</p> <p>\u201cIn the past, what we depended on was really cold winters\u201d to control the crab population, he said. \u201cWith the warming of the winters now, we\u2019re not getting that die-off you would expect every winter.\u201d</p> <p>McMahan, the Manomet scientist, first started thinking about green crabs when an art conservator from her native Maine island of Georgetown contacted her after feasting on similar green crabs in Venice, Italy. He wanted to know if people back home were eating them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50a30961e59ef94a2465da3b1069f74fac3c5c06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50a30961e59ef94a2465da3b1069f74fac3c5c06/0_302_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"As the Gulf of Maine warms, the invasive green crab has destroyed habitats and the soft-shell clam population.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As the Gulf of Maine warms, the invasive green crab has destroyed habitats and the soft-shell clam population.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Wood/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Americans tend to eat large crabs with lots of meat that offer a big reward for the work of breaking through their shells. At first glance, the green crab looks like too much work for too little meat.</p> <p>But in Venice, green crab is a delicacy, fried up when the crab briefly sheds its hard exoskeleton to grow and eaten whole.</p> <p>In 2017, McMahan and her partner, lobsterman Chris Jamison, traveled to Venice to see how the crab industry worked there. And last summer, Jamison began trapping green crabs and selling molting ones to coastal Maine restaurants at $3 a piece while using other ones as lobster bait.</p> <p>Last fall, Manomet was awarded a quarter-million-dollar grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to work towards creating a green crab market.</p> <p>Warner, the Green Crab R&amp;D founder, envisions a green crab market. Molting crabs would be sold to restaurants and consumers, pulling in the highest price per crab. Meanwhile, non-molting crabs could be boiled into stock or used as flavoring. Then their shells could be used as compost; Warner is hoping to explore their potential as a fertilizer for cannabis, which is now legal in both Massachusetts and Maine.</p> <p>Crab roe is another potential moneymaker while some of the crabs being collected by Manomet were destined to be dog food.</p> <p>\u201cPeople will and can trap for green crabs alongside clamming, but they need the payoff,\u201d said Warner. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re working on inventing these products.\u201d</p> <p>Maine fishermen once went after different species every season which meant a poor catch of one would not mean ruin. But over the years, those fisheries have mostly disappeared. Today, lobster is the dominant catch, but it is anticipated that if waters continue to warm, it too may become less productive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f4bce17bcfe36ccce5b0e6f8823f2a438593fa90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4bce17bcfe36ccce5b0e6f8823f2a438593fa90/0_256_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marissa McMahan and her partner, lobsterman Chris Jamison traveled to Venice, Italy in 2017 to see the green crab industry firsthand.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marissa McMahan and her partner, lobsterman Chris Jamison traveled to Venice, Italy, in 2017 to see the green crab industry firsthand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Wood/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fishermen such as Jamison say they see the Gulf of Maine changing in real time: he sees more typically tropical fish, lobsters are abundant and a few years ago, he saw a great white shark \u2013 rare in Maine\u2019s waters.</p> <p>But while some promoting green crabs as a food source hope their efforts can restore clam populations, Beal, the University of Maine at Machias professor, believes that is unlikely.</p> <p>\u201cThe most damage that\u2019s occurring by green crabs on soft-shell clams is by crabs that are smaller than your thumbnail,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you can trap crabs that are the size of your thumbnail.\u201d</p> <p>Beal calls the green crab the \u201cconsummate invader\u201d due to its ability to \u201cout-reproduce anything else\u201d as well as its breadth of habitat and diet.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Manomet is currently exploring clam aquaculture \u2013 clam farming \u2013 that could give the shellfish better chances of surviving to adulthood and making it to the dinner plate.</p> <p>But on a recent Thursday morning, McMahan remained focused on the crabs as she and two graduate students measured and catalogued the angry crustaceans on a dock in Georgetown. They looked at the underside of the crabs for signs that they were about to molt \u2013 and separated those ready to shed their exoskeleton so they wouldn\u2019t be eaten by the others once they lost their armor.</p> <p>McMahan says introducing a new sea food is an uphill battle in a part of the country where fish that have long disappeared from the Gulf of Maine \u2013 such as cod and haddock \u2013 are still favorites at the supermarket.</p> <p>But as the water warms, she says seafood consumers will have to adjust to reality.</p> <p> \u201cWe need to just fundamentally think differently about seafood and what we eat \u2013 and what is seafood and what\u2019s good \u2013 because it\u2019s changing.

Ipswich shellfish constable Scott LaPreste says the town is currently hauling up about 75,000 pounds of green crabs a year under the program. \u201cIn the past, what we depended on was really cold winters\u201d to control the crab population, he said. \u201cWith the warming of the winters now, we\u2019re not getting that die-off you would expect every winter.\u201d McMahan, the Manomet scientist, first started thinking about green crabs when an art conservator from her native Maine island of Georgetown contacted her after feasting on similar green crabs in Venice, Italy. He wanted to know if people back home were eating them. Americans tend to eat large crabs with lots of meat that offer a big reward for the work of breaking through their shells. At first glance, the green crab looks like too much work for too little meat. But in Venice, green crab is a delicacy, fried up when the crab briefly sheds its hard exoskeleton to grow and eaten whole. In 2017, McMahan and her partner, lobsterman Chris Jamison, traveled to Venice to see how the crab industry worked there. And last summer, Jamison began trapping green crabs and selling molting ones to coastal Maine restaurants at $3 a piece while using other ones as lobster bait. Last fall, Manomet was awarded a quarter-million-dollar grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to work towards creating a green crab market. Warner, the Green Crab R&amp;D founder, envisions a green crab market. Molting crabs would be sold to restaurants and consumers, pulling in the highest price per crab. Meanwhile, non-molting crabs could be boiled into stock or used as flavoring. Then their shells could be used as compost; Warner is hoping to explore their potential as a fertilizer for cannabis, which is now legal in both Massachusetts and Maine. Crab roe is another potential moneymaker while some of the crabs being collected by Manomet were destined to be dog food. \u201cPeople will and can trap for green crabs alongside clamming, but they need the payoff,\u201d said Warner. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re working on inventing these products.\u201d Maine fishermen once went after different species every season which meant a poor catch of one would not mean ruin. But over the years, those fisheries have mostly disappeared. Today, lobster is the dominant catch, but it is anticipated that if waters continue to warm, it too may become less productive. Fishermen such as Jamison say they see the Gulf of Maine changing in real time: he sees more typically tropical fish, lobsters are abundant and a few years ago, he saw a great white shark \u2013 rare in Maine\u2019s waters. But while some promoting green crabs as a food source hope their efforts can restore clam populations, Beal, the University of Maine at Machias professor, believes that is unlikely. \u201cThe most damage that\u2019s occurring by green crabs on soft-shell clams is by crabs that are smaller than your thumbnail,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you can trap crabs that are the size of your thumbnail.\u201d Beal calls the green crab the \u201cconsummate invader\u201d due to its ability to \u201cout-reproduce anything else\u201d as well as its breadth of habitat and diet. Meanwhile, Manomet is currently exploring clam aquaculture \u2013 clam farming \u2013 that could give the shellfish better chances of surviving to adulthood and making it to the dinner plate. But on a recent Thursday morning, McMahan remained focused on the crabs as she and two graduate students measured and catalogued the angry crustaceans on a dock in Georgetown. They looked at the underside of the crabs for signs that they were about to molt \u2013 and separated those ready to shed their exoskeleton so they wouldn\u2019t be eaten by the others once they lost their armor. McMahan says introducing a new sea food is an uphill battle in a part of the country where fish that have long disappeared from the Gulf of Maine \u2013 such as cod and haddock \u2013 are still favorites at the supermarket. But as the water warms, she says seafood consumers will have to adjust to reality. \u201cWe need to just fundamentally think differently about seafood and what we eat \u2013 and what is seafood and what\u2019s good \u2013 because it\u2019s changing. We\u2019re going to have different things on our plate going forward,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>Joe Biden is building a campaign of reminiscences. The former vice-president and current Democratic presidential frontrunner is pitching voters the idea that the past was better than the present, and that Biden, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/13/joe-biden-age-trump-2020-1361782\">at 76</a>, represents the past.</p> <p>\u201cI believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he represents as an aberrant moment in time,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/politics/biden-campaign-video-announcement.html\">said</a> in his campaign announcement video. \u201cWith Trump gone, you\u2019re going to see things change,\u201d he said last week, referring to the Republican party. \u201cBecause <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-republicans-trump-2020_n_5cff47b6e4b06d839dc4150e\">these folks</a> know better.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/08/biden-trump-week-in-patriarchy-arwa-mahdawi\">Biden and Trump are just two sides of the same misogynistic coin | Arwa Mahdawi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a perception of America that casts our current crisis as a result of the pathological personality of the president, and not as the systemic failure of many institutions to protect the people and enact their will. In this vision, Donald Trump is the problem, not the culture or the political system that created him. Things were better before Trump, Biden seems to believe, and they will go back to normal after he\u2019s gone.</p> <p>Like Trump\u2019s call to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d, Biden\u2019s rhetoric appeals to a vision of the past based more in fantasy than reality. If anything, Biden is appealing to an imaginary bygone American era that many Americans don\u2019t recognize. He sees prosperity where others see falling wages and unlivable healthcare and housing costs. He sees dignified political stability where others see their systematic exclusion from the halls of power. He sees chummy, Kumbaya-singing bipartisan cooperation with Republicans where many see the highly uncivil efforts of the right wing to strip minorities of their livelihoods and rights and to enshrine discrimination into law.</p> <p>As the frontrunner, Biden\u2019s pitch to voters has not been about new ideas or new routes to power, but about a return to the past. But many \u2013 most \u2013 have reason to think that the past was not much better than the present, that the rosy vision of a bygone America where dignity, civility and bipartisanship reigned exists not in history or in fact, but in Biden\u2019s imagination. His evocation of the past does not make these Americans nostalgic, or wistful, or patriotic. It makes them uneasy.</p> <p>One of Biden\u2019s favorite fictions about the past is that there was an era when gender relations were less contentious, and when it was appropriate to treat women and girls with patronizing dismissiveness. He is fond of touching women in strange, inappropriate and overly intimate if not outright sexual ways that betray an obliviousness to their discomfort at best and an entitlement to their bodies at worst.</p> <p>When his strange behavior was brought into the public conversation by <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/03/an-awkward-kiss-changed-how-i-saw-joe-biden.html\">an essay</a> by the Nevada politician Lucy Flores in New York magazine, Biden feigned contrition. But he has since <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-jokes-about-inappropriate-touching_n_5cf6a21fe4b0e8085e41aa72\">made women\u2019s discomfort a punchline</a>, making a series of awkward jokes at the expense of the #MeToo movement, women who complain about sexual harassment and the very notion of consent. \u201cI want the press to know, she pulled <em>me</em> close,\u201d he said at an event in Berlin, New Hampshire. \u201cI just want you to know, I had permission to hug Lonnie,\u201d he said of the woman who introduced him at his campaign launch event, before putting an arm around a young boy\u2019s shoulder and saying: \u201cBy the way, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/05/joe-biden-touching-complaints-jokes-public-appearance\">he gave me permission</a> to touch him.\u201d</p> <p>The most generous way to read these remarks might be to say that they indicate that Biden imagines that in the past, sexism and male supremacy were universally understood to be benevolent, that everyone was with this sort of thing; that back then, sexual harassment didn\u2019t happen, or it happened, but somehow didn\u2019t hurt anyone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ironically, Biden\u2019s delusional nostalgia for the past seems to resonate most strongly with the voters who were there: those older than 45</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ironically, Biden\u2019s delusional nostalgia for the past seems to resonate most strongly with the voters who were there: those older than 45. Though it is still early in the race, polls show Biden significantly ahead, <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-supporters-are-older-and-more-moderate-and-sticking-with-him-so-far/\">especially among older voters</a> and those who identify themselves as moderates or conservatives. Meanwhile, Biden falls somewhat behind among the young, who are more likely to describe themselves as very liberal. In a June CNN poll, he came in second among voters under 45, behind the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who had a plurality with 26% of support.</p> <p>Still, if Biden\u2019s appeal is stronger with older voters, this might not hurt him much. Older Americans are a highly reliable voting bloc, and they tend to lean more conservative than their children and grandchildren. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/02/politics/dem-primaries-exit-polls/\">Voters over 45</a> accounted for a full 60% of Democratic primary voters in 2016; voters aged 18-29 were only 17% of voters in that same contest.</p> <p>In the most recent polls, Biden\u2019s support is slipping, though he still holds a considerable lead. But this decline in his support does not seem to be the result of his behavior toward women; if anything, the older, right-leaning voters of his base find his handsiness endearing and his jokes at the expense of harassment victims funny. In the days after Flores published her essay, as similar accounts of invasive, inappropriate and patronizing behavior by Biden were brought forward by a number of other women, <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-supporters-are-older-and-more-moderate-and-sticking-with-him-so-far/\">his approval ratings didn\u2019t budge</a>. When he jokes to his crowds that he \u201cgot consent\u201d to give a supporter a hug, he gets big laughs.</p> <p>One reason that Biden has been able to hold on to his support is that the older, more conservative Democrats who support him are also those least sympathetic to the #MeToo movement.

      "bodyText": "Joe Biden is building a campaign of reminiscences. The former vice-president and current Democratic presidential frontrunner is pitching voters the idea that the past was better than the present, and that Biden, at 76, represents the past. \u201cI believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he represents as an aberrant moment in time,\u201d he said in his campaign announcement video. \u201cWith Trump gone, you\u2019re going to see things change,\u201d he said last week, referring to the Republican party. \u201cBecause these folks know better.\u201d It is a perception of America that casts our current crisis as a result of the pathological personality of the president, and not as the systemic failure of many institutions to protect the people and enact their will. In this vision, Donald Trump is the problem, not the culture or the political system that created him. Things were better before Trump, Biden seems to believe, and they will go back to normal after he\u2019s gone. Like Trump\u2019s call to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d, Biden\u2019s rhetoric appeals to a vision of the past based more in fantasy than reality. If anything, Biden is appealing to an imaginary bygone American era that many Americans don\u2019t recognize. He sees prosperity where others see falling wages and unlivable healthcare and housing costs. He sees dignified political stability where others see their systematic exclusion from the halls of power. He sees chummy, Kumbaya-singing bipartisan cooperation with Republicans where many see the highly uncivil efforts of the right wing to strip minorities of their livelihoods and rights and to enshrine discrimination into law. As the frontrunner, Biden\u2019s pitch to voters has not been about new ideas or new routes to power, but about a return to the past. But many \u2013 most \u2013 have reason to think that the past was not much better than the present, that the rosy vision of a bygone America where dignity, civility and bipartisanship reigned exists not in history or in fact, but in Biden\u2019s imagination. His evocation of the past does not make these Americans nostalgic, or wistful, or patriotic. It makes them uneasy. One of Biden\u2019s favorite fictions about the past is that there was an era when gender relations were less contentious, and when it was appropriate to treat women and girls with patronizing dismissiveness. He is fond of touching women in strange, inappropriate and overly intimate if not outright sexual ways that betray an obliviousness to their discomfort at best and an entitlement to their bodies at worst. When his strange behavior was brought into the public conversation by an essay by the Nevada politician Lucy Flores in New York magazine, Biden feigned contrition. But he has since made women\u2019s discomfort a punchline, making a series of awkward jokes at the expense of the #MeToo movement, women who complain about sexual harassment and the very notion of consent. \u201cI want the press to know, she pulled me close,\u201d he said at an event in Berlin, New Hampshire. \u201cI just want you to know, I had permission to hug Lonnie,\u201d he said of the woman who introduced him at his campaign launch event, before putting an arm around a young boy\u2019s shoulder and saying: \u201cBy the way, he gave me permission to touch him.\u201d The most generous way to read these remarks might be to say that they indicate that Biden imagines that in the past, sexism and male supremacy were universally understood to be benevolent, that everyone was with this sort of thing; that back then, sexual harassment didn\u2019t happen, or it happened, but somehow didn\u2019t hurt anyone. Ironically, Biden\u2019s delusional nostalgia for the past seems to resonate most strongly with the voters who were there: those older than 45. Though it is still early in the race, polls show Biden significantly ahead, especially among older voters and those who identify themselves as moderates or conservatives. Meanwhile, Biden falls somewhat behind among the young, who are more likely to describe themselves as very liberal. In a June CNN poll, he came in second among voters under 45, behind the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who had a plurality with 26% of support. Still, if Biden\u2019s appeal is stronger with older voters, this might not hurt him much. Older Americans are a highly reliable voting bloc, and they tend to lean more conservative than their children and grandchildren. Voters over 45 accounted for a full 60% of Democratic primary voters in 2016; voters aged 18-29 were only 17% of voters in that same contest. In the most recent polls, Biden\u2019s support is slipping, though he still holds a considerable lead. But this decline in his support does not seem to be the result of his behavior toward women; if anything, the older, right-leaning voters of his base find his handsiness endearing and his jokes at the expense of harassment victims funny. In the days after Flores published her essay, as similar accounts of invasive, inappropriate and patronizing behavior by Biden were brought forward by a number of other women, his approval ratings didn\u2019t budge. When he jokes to his crowds that he \u201cgot consent\u201d to give a supporter a hug, he gets big laughs. One reason that Biden has been able to hold on to his support is that the older, more conservative Democrats who support him are also those least sympathetic to the #MeToo movement. A Pew Research Center survey conducted last year found that moderate and conservative Democrats are more likely than liberal Democrats to be concerned about women making false allegations and about men being fired prematurely. Older Americans overall fear that renewed attention to sexual harassment will negatively affect men in the workplace. These Democrats are still significantly more progressive on gender issues than their Republican counterparts, who are dramatically less favorable toward the rights of sexual harassment and assault victims. But these demographics where Biden dominates are also set apart from the rest of the country \u2013 which, according to Pew, is generally more concerned about men getting away with sexual harassment than men being unfairly fired. Compared with the rest of the country, Biden\u2019s base is older, more hostile to #MeToo and less likely to think that his inappropriate jokes are a problem. But they\u2019re also more likely to vote. Biden might make the reasonable calculation that he can continue to mock and minimize sexual harassment victims with cruel little jokes.

New Yorkers\u2019 love-hate relationship with helicopters goes back some way. In 1953, a company called New York Airways started regularly scheduled passenger service between the city heliports and area airports, marking \u201cthe inauguration\u201d of such services in US cities, according to a 1977 paper published by Duke University. But the now-defunct aviation concern yearned for something flashier and won approval to use a helipad on the famous old Pan Am building, near the Grand Central railway station, aviation historian Shea Oakley said. New York Airways hit financial woes in 1968, bringing the services to a premature end but, Oakley said: \u201cThey always wanted to get back to the Pan Am roof.

Helicopters were subsequently banned from city rooftops. But the allure persisted. Decades before Donald Trump was pictured lumbering onto various official aircraft as president (once with toilet paper on his shoe), he was snapped gazing at New York from a private chopper. The caption read: \u201cDonald Trump, real estate mogul, entrepreneur, and billionaire, utilizes his personal helicopter to get around on August 1987 in New York City.\u201d And billionaire ex-mayor and business tycoon Michael Bloomberg was described as a \u201cfan of \u2019copters\u201d in an April 2012 New York Times article. \u201cHe does not merely enjoy flying in them, he is obsessive about piloting them himself,\u201d the article recounted. Last November, a helicopter problem arose in the middle of the row about Amazon\u2019s announcement that it had picked the New York City borough of Queens for one of its forthcoming \u201cHQ2\u201d second headquarters locations. While leading politicians welcomed the company, a storm blew up from the left over the likely exacerbation of inequality in a fast-gentrifying part of Queens, and the prospect of Amazon receiving billions in government incentives for their plan, which included a new helipad. The 14 November New York Post featured a mock-up image of Amazon CEO and world\u2019s richest person Jeff Bezos brandishing moneybags from an Amazon-branded helicopter, with the headline \u201cQUEENS RANSOM.\u201d The article read: \u201cAmazon gets 2.5B tax break \u2013 and right to a helipad \u2013 to move to NYC.\u201d City councillor Ben Kallos said it made Bezos look like a \u201cBond Villain\u201d. City council speaker Corey Johnson reportedly said: \u201cSo, yes, Jeff Bezos\u2019s commute is all set. What about the rest of the New Yorkers crammed into the subways [the city\u2019s underground rail service] every day?\u201d Amazon wound up abandoning its plans for New York City HQ2. Helicopters have also featured in \u201conly-in-New York\u201d-type criminal lore. In 1981, two people \u201chijacked\u201d a tourism helicopter and flew to the federal jail in Manhattan, trying unsuccessfully to free a convicted drug dealer from a rooftop recreation area. They were foiled by rooftop mesh, but then flew across town and escaped themselves. When Mexican drug lord Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, convicted in New York this year, requested outdoor recreation time while behind bars, prosecutors cited that escape attempt in their successful bid for denial. Following the recent rooftop crash, city mayor and 2020 presidential candidate Bill De Blasio said: \u201cI think we need a full ban on any helicopters going over Manhattan itself\u201d except for emergency services and news outlets. Any such ban probably wouldn\u2019t eliminate the new airport services from the riverside heliports sitting on Manhattan\u2019s flanks, next to the water. So down-to-earth passengers sitting on clogged roads to JFK in their un-winged Ubers will still be able to look up from traffic jams at their uber-Uber rivals in helicopters buzzing by overhead. Maybe they\u2019ll wish they could afford it \u2013 or that they\u2019d taken the train for under $10.",

Guardian Australia understands there have been discussions between New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania with a view to rebooting the policy Scott Morrison dumped after taking the leadership from Turnbull last August. The states are under intense pressure from stakeholders to try to revive the Neg \u2013 which has widespread support in the energy sector and from energy users \u2013 to create a framework that will give investors certainty. The energy sector, which has a fractious relationship with Taylor, has also ramped up public calls after the election for the Morrison government to implement an energy policy that integrates emissions reduction \u2013 as the Neg did. Taylor has thus far declined interview requests from Guardian Australia, but has said post-election that the Morrison government won\u2019t revive the Neg but will instead drive emissions reduction through the Abbott-era emissions reduction fund, which has had its funding topped up. Emissions in Australia have increased since Tony Abbott repealed Labor\u2019s carbon price after taking government in 2013 despite the existence of the Coalition\u2019s emissions reduction fund. The ERF has been rebadged the climate solutions fund, and funded to the tune of $2bn over 15 years, which translates to about $130m a year. South Australia\u2019s Liberal energy minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan told Guardian Australia energy policy in 2019 needed to have an integrated emissions reduction component. \u201cWe must have consideration for emissions reduction in energy policy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s impractical to imagine that emissions reduction couldn\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t be part of energy policy. \u201cIt\u2019s a key component of what\u2019s going on\u201d.

This is the extraordinary and moving story of the late outsider artist inside the papier-mache head, featuring contributions from collaborators such as Jon Ronson and Mark Radcliffe. As the latter observes, Sievey\u2019s antics were somehow extremely silly and extremely clever at the same time.

Instead, they are being landfilled, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/21/philadelphia-covanta-incinerator-recyclables-china-ban-imports\">burned</a> or stockpiled. From Los Angeles to Florida to the Arizona desert, officials say, vast quantities of plastic are now no better than garbage.</p> \n<p>The \u201cmarket conditions\u201d on the sign Pai saw referred to the situation caused by China. Once the largest buyer of US plastic waste, the country shut its doors to all but highest-quality plastics in 2017. The move sent shockwaves through the American industry as recyclers scrambled, and often failed, to find new buyers. Now the turmoil besetting a global trade network, which is normally hidden from view, is hitting home.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll these years I have been feeling like I\u2019m doing something responsible,\u201d said Pai, clearly dumbstruck as she walked away with a full bag. \u201cThe truth hurts.\u201d</p> \n<p>In total, only about half (56%) of the plastic waste that America once exported is still being accepted by foreign markets in the wake of China\u2019s ban. This week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/17/recycled-plastic-america-global-crisis\">the Guardian revealed</a> that what still goes overseas is inundating countries including Vietnam, Turkey, Malaysia and Senegal. But much of what remains has nowhere to go.</p> \n<p>Analysis of US export records shows that the equivalent of 19,000 shipping containers of plastic recycling per month, once exported abroad, is now stranded at home. This is enough plastic to fill 250 Olympic swimming pools each month.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"29de5c294fffdd4be634e26ada7b84b43ed01828\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29de5c294fffdd4be634e26ada7b84b43ed01828/0_0_4480_6720/667.jpg\" alt=\"Pai recently learned that her recycling center would no longer accept much of what she used to bring.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pai recently learned that her recycling center would no longer accept much of what she used to bring.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hardy Wilson/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As municipalities are forced to deal with their own trash instead of exporting it, they are discovering a dismaying fact: much of this plastic is completely unrecyclable.</p> \n<p>The issue is with a popular class of plastics that people have traditionally been told to put into their recycling bins \u2013 a hodgepodge of items such as clamshell-style food packaging, black plastic trays, take-out containers and cold drink cups, which the industry dubs \u201cmixed plastic\u201d. It has become clear that there are virtually no domestic manufacturers that want to buy this waste in order to turn it into something else.</p> \n<p>Take Los Angeles county, the most populous in America. The Guardian has learned that recycling facilities are separating \u201cmixed plastics\u201d from those plastics which still retain value \u2013 such as water bottles, laundry detergent bottles and milk jugs \u2013 and, contrary to what customers expect, sending them directly to a landfill or incinerator. </p> \n<p>Los Angeles county public works estimates that in 2018, the county sent more than half a million tons of plastic to four different landfills, and nearly 20,000 tons of plastic to its waste-to-energy incinerator. And it appears that many other recyclers are doing exactly the same thing.</p> \n<p>\u201cMixed plastics is a broad category that could consist of everything from car bumpers to five-gallon buckets or yogurt containers,\u201d said Habib Kharrat, a supervising engineer for the sanitation districts of Los Angeles county, which serve some cities and unincorporated areas. The recycling business depends on someone being willing to buy the materials that recyclers are selling. Right now, Kharrat said, \u201cit does not appear that there are any local or foreign markets\u201d for mixed plastics, and that what is collected in residential recycling bins and processed at his organization\u2019s facilities is sent for disposal.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"09b094d0-6a77-4f96-a287-045bded0b207\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Every&nbsp;<a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/environment/plastic\">plastic</a>&nbsp;item is given a number from 1-7 to signify the kind of plastic it is made from. The category of \"mixed plastics\" (sometimes also called \"mixed rigid plastic\" in the recycling industry) includes virtually everything except for plastic jugs and bottles labeled No 1 and No 2, which retain a high value. A lot of mixed plastics are items that consumers encounter every day, such as clamshell-style containers, salad and berry tubs, meat trays, cold beverage cups and lids, plastic cutlery, or dairy&nbsp;tubs and lids. Items made of plastic that is rigid and bulky \u2013 crates, coolers, buckets, lawn furniture or play structures \u2013 are also defined by the recycling industry as mixed plastics.</p>\n    <p>Sometimes yogurt tubs and lids, labelled No 5, are pulled from other mixed plastics to be recycled separately, as there is a growing, but limited, US market for recycling them.</p>\n    <p>Bags and plastic wrap, known in the industry as \"film wrap\", are not regarded as mixed plastics but are still extremely problematic. There's little market for them, and they can cause operational problems at recycling facilities when they get caught in machinery,&nbsp;requiring removal and repairs.</p>\n    <p>Since China stopped accepting most bales of mixed plastics in 2017, most US cities have been left with little&nbsp;choice but to landfill or incinerate them.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Coby Skye, the assistant deputy director of environmental programs at LA county public works, confirmed this, blaming China\u2019s decision to no longer accept the lowest-value plastics. \u201cIn the past, recycling facilities would focus on separating plastics with the most value, but most other plastic items would go into a mixed plastic bale. Then China put a stop to those mixed plastic bales. Essentially, they labeled those bales garbage that they were no longer going to purchase at any price.\u201d <br><br>Skye and Kharrat emphasized that the situation was not unique to Los Angeles. \u201cFrom what we\u2019re hearing from our colleagues, what\u2019s happening in Los Angeles county is representative of what is happening all over the US and all over the state as a result of these international policies,\u201d said Skye.</p> \n<p>The China ban revealed an uncomfortable truth about plastic recycling, Skye said: much of this plastic was never possible to recycle at all.</p> \n<p>\u201c[China] would just pull out the items that were actually recyclable and burn or throw<strong> </strong>away the rest,\u201d he said. \u201cChina has subsidized the recycling industry for many years in a way that distorted our views.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2e0085ccda5e76a1edb46ca6f70e93c494c2279\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2e0085ccda5e76a1edb46ca6f70e93c494c2279/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"While plastic bottles still retain value, many other types of plastic have virtually no domestic market.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">While plastic bottles still retain value, many other types of plastic have virtually no domestic market.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>An unfolding crisis</strong></h2> \n<p>With virtually no domestic recycling options for a sizable portion of the plastic the public tries to recycle, those watching closely speak of an industry in crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cMost people have no idea that most plastic doesn\u2019t get recycled,\u201d said John Hocevar, the Oceans Campaign Director for Greenpeace USA, referencing a study which found that <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318567844_Production_use_and_fate_of_all_plastics_ever_made\">just 9% of all plastic ever produced</a> has been recycled. \u201cEven though they are buying something that they only use for a few seconds before putting it in the recycling bin, they think it\u2019s OK because they believe it is being recycled.\u201d</p> \n<p>Commenting on the situation in Los Angeles and elsewhere, he said: \u201cThere\u2019s no question that the No 3,4, 6 and 7 plastics are going into landfills and incinerators. We have a huge problem.\u201d</p> \n<p>It\u2019s not just big cities that are struggling to cope. In some rural communities, where city budgets are tight and transportation costs high, the shift in market forces has been too much to bear. Once, they could make money selling recycling. Now they have to pay people to take it off their hands.</p> \n<p>In Cochise county, home to 130,000 in Arizona\u2019s south-east desert, the cost of recycling plastic \u201cwent through the roof\u201d in recent years, said Peggy Judd, the council chair. As a result, the county is now landfilling all of its plastic waste, even opening a new section in its landfill to handle more.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot less expensive for us to put our plastics in our landfill,\u201d said Judd. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to sort them, truck them, and pay for someone to take them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nearby Nogales, Arizona, is not having much luck either. \u201cWe\u2019re right now landfilling it,\u201d said Kurt Wahl, the general manager of Tucson Recycling &amp; Waste, a private company that handles Nogales\u2019 waste. He said he had tried to find another local contractor to take the recycling but had received an exorbitant quote. \u201cThen they\u2019re landfilling it afterwards, so it\u2019s going to the landfill anyway.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"7898efab0a296806cc14bbec6873e12f4dd09c88\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7898efab0a296806cc14bbec6873e12f4dd09c88/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bales of recycling in Maine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bales of recycling in Maine.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Portland Press Herald/Press Herald via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>From coast to coast, a similar crisis is unfolding:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Monterey County and the city of El Cerrito, both in California, have stopped accepting mixed plastics, local officials said.</p></li> \n <li><p>In Boulder, Colorado, the local not-for-profit recycling organization is stockpiling the roughly 16 tons of mixed plastics it receives each month, in hopes that some kind of domestic market will return. \u201cHonestly, one of the options on the table is to stop taking these things,\u201d said Kate Bailey, program director for the recycler, Eco-Cycle.</p></li> \n <li><p>The recycler for Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Minnesota, Eureka Recycling, has never taken most mixed plastics, because it saw no market.

So far, local environmentalists have resisted the idea. \u201cThe idea we bring all this stuff in and then burn up more fossil fuels to send it halfway across the world is problematic by itself,\u201d said Rafael Bergstrom, the executive director of Sustainable Coastlines Hawaii, but he said the idea of incineration was even worse.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>A waste executive from Republic Services, one of the country\u2019s largest garbage haulers, which serves more than 2,800 communities and has 91 recycling centers, said that one-third of everything collected by recycling trucks went to disposal because it was either contaminated, too small to be sorted or not actually recyclable.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe industry is now underwater in the recycling business because those markets are so disrupted, and China is not going to come back,\u201d said Richard Coupland, vice-president of municipal sales. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be this way for a sustained period of time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Despite the challenges, a handful of wealthy cities with sophisticated technology said they had been able to find foreign markets for mixed plastic. In San Francisco and Seattle, recyclers can extract items from the waste stream that meet China\u2019s new cleanliness standards, and thus can still be exported. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"52372c37ac44d9be1c6faa39dc9cee4dd1a411bb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52372c37ac44d9be1c6faa39dc9cee4dd1a411bb/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Santa Monica prides itself on being a green city.

Yet even here, environmentalism is hitting a wall.</p> \n<p>The Santa Monica community recycling center, the only one on the west side of Los Angeles, was in many ways a recycling success story. Residents could come here to redeem their plastic bottles \u2013 which still have a stable market \u2013 for cash, along with aluminum cans and glass bottles. Anti-waste advocates say this helped keep recycling rates high, diverted waste from landfills and the nearby ocean, and provided a vital source of income for homeless and low-income residents.</p> \n<p>But on 15 June, <a href=\"https://argonautnews.com/the-recycling-market-is-broken/\">the center closed down</a> after the city failed to renew its contract, in large part because of financial difficulties and market volatility in the wake of China\u2019s move.

      "bodyText": "A sign on an upside-down dumpster spelled the end of Pearl Pai\u2019s long romance with plastics recycling. For years, Pai and her family generated almost no trash. She carefully washed, sorted and bagged hard-to-recycle items and drove them two towns over from her home in Berkeley, California, to the area\u2019s best recycling center. But on a gray morning in late May, when she pulled up with a bag of flimsy plastic clamshell-style containers, yogurt tubs and meat trays, the sign informed her that, \u201cdue to poor market conditions\u201d, these items would no longer be accepted for recycling. This is a reality that millions more Americans will have to adjust to. A Guardian investigation reveals that cities around the country are no longer recycling many types of plastic dropped into recycling bins. Instead, they are being landfilled, burned or stockpiled. From Los Angeles to Florida to the Arizona desert, officials say, vast quantities of plastic are now no better than garbage. The \u201cmarket conditions\u201d on the sign Pai saw referred to the situation caused by China. Once the largest buyer of US plastic waste, the country shut its doors to all but highest-quality plastics in 2017. The move sent shockwaves through the American industry as recyclers scrambled, and often failed, to find new buyers. Now the turmoil besetting a global trade network, which is normally hidden from view, is hitting home. \u201cAll these years I have been feeling like I\u2019m doing something responsible,\u201d said Pai, clearly dumbstruck as she walked away with a full bag. \u201cThe truth hurts.\u201d In total, only about half (56%) of the plastic waste that America once exported is still being accepted by foreign markets in the wake of China\u2019s ban. This week, the Guardian revealed that what still goes overseas is inundating countries including Vietnam, Turkey, Malaysia and Senegal. But much of what remains has nowhere to go. Analysis of US export records shows that the equivalent of 19,000 shipping containers of plastic recycling per month, once exported abroad, is now stranded at home. This is enough plastic to fill 250 Olympic swimming pools each month. As municipalities are forced to deal with their own trash instead of exporting it, they are discovering a dismaying fact: much of this plastic is completely unrecyclable. The issue is with a popular class of plastics that people have traditionally been told to put into their recycling bins \u2013 a hodgepodge of items such as clamshell-style food packaging, black plastic trays, take-out containers and cold drink cups, which the industry dubs \u201cmixed plastic\u201d. It has become clear that there are virtually no domestic manufacturers that want to buy this waste in order to turn it into something else. Take Los Angeles county, the most populous in America. The Guardian has learned that recycling facilities are separating \u201cmixed plastics\u201d from those plastics which still retain value \u2013 such as water bottles, laundry detergent bottles and milk jugs \u2013 and, contrary to what customers expect, sending them directly to a landfill or incinerator. Los Angeles county public works estimates that in 2018, the county sent more than half a million tons of plastic to four different landfills, and nearly 20,000 tons of plastic to its waste-to-energy incinerator. And it appears that many other recyclers are doing exactly the same thing. \u201cMixed plastics is a broad category that could consist of everything from car bumpers to five-gallon buckets or yogurt containers,\u201d said Habib Kharrat, a supervising engineer for the sanitation districts of Los Angeles county, which serve some cities and unincorporated areas. The recycling business depends on someone being willing to buy the materials that recyclers are selling. Right now, Kharrat said, \u201cit does not appear that there are any local or foreign markets\u201d for mixed plastics, and that what is collected in residential recycling bins and processed at his organization\u2019s facilities is sent for disposal. Coby Skye, the assistant deputy director of environmental programs at LA county public works, confirmed this, blaming China\u2019s decision to no longer accept the lowest-value plastics. \u201cIn the past, recycling facilities would focus on separating plastics with the most value, but most other plastic items would go into a mixed plastic bale. Then China put a stop to those mixed plastic bales. Essentially, they labeled those bales garbage that they were no longer going to purchase at any price.\u201d Skye and Kharrat emphasized that the situation was not unique to Los Angeles. \u201cFrom what we\u2019re hearing from our colleagues, what\u2019s happening in Los Angeles county is representative of what is happening all over the US and all over the state as a result of these international policies,\u201d said Skye. The China ban revealed an uncomfortable truth about plastic recycling, Skye said: much of this plastic was never possible to recycle at all. \u201c[China] would just pull out the items that were actually recyclable and burn or throw away the rest,\u201d he said. \u201cChina has subsidized the recycling industry for many years in a way that distorted our views.\u201d An unfolding crisis With virtually no domestic recycling options for a sizable portion of the plastic the public tries to recycle, those watching closely speak of an industry in crisis. \u201cMost people have no idea that most plastic doesn\u2019t get recycled,\u201d said John Hocevar, the Oceans Campaign Director for Greenpeace USA, referencing a study which found that just 9% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled. \u201cEven though they are buying something that they only use for a few seconds before putting it in the recycling bin, they think it\u2019s OK because they believe it is being recycled.\u201d Commenting on the situation in Los Angeles and elsewhere, he said: \u201cThere\u2019s no question that the No 3,4, 6 and 7 plastics are going into landfills and incinerators. We have a huge problem.\u201d It\u2019s not just big cities that are struggling to cope. In some rural communities, where city budgets are tight and transportation costs high, the shift in market forces has been too much to bear. Once, they could make money selling recycling. Now they have to pay people to take it off their hands. In Cochise county, home to 130,000 in Arizona\u2019s south-east desert, the cost of recycling plastic \u201cwent through the roof\u201d in recent years, said Peggy Judd, the council chair. As a result, the county is now landfilling all of its plastic waste, even opening a new section in its landfill to handle more. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot less expensive for us to put our plastics in our landfill,\u201d said Judd. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to sort them, truck them, and pay for someone to take them.\u201d Nearby Nogales, Arizona, is not having much luck either. \u201cWe\u2019re right now landfilling it,\u201d said Kurt Wahl, the general manager of Tucson Recycling &amp; Waste, a private company that handles Nogales\u2019 waste. He said he had tried to find another local contractor to take the recycling but had received an exorbitant quote. \u201cThen they\u2019re landfilling it afterwards, so it\u2019s going to the landfill anyway.\u201d From coast to coast, a similar crisis is unfolding: Monterey County and the city of El Cerrito, both in California, have stopped accepting mixed plastics, local officials said. In Boulder, Colorado, the local not-for-profit recycling organization is stockpiling the roughly 16 tons of mixed plastics it receives each month, in hopes that some kind of domestic market will return. \u201cHonestly, one of the options on the table is to stop taking these things,\u201d said Kate Bailey, program director for the recycler, Eco-Cycle. The recycler for Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Minnesota, Eureka Recycling, has never taken most mixed plastics, because it saw no market. Even so, it has seen a major revenue drop and had to lay off workers because of the China crisis. Residents of Bullhead City, Arizona, will soon have to \u201copt-in\u201d to curbside recycling and pay for the service, an official said. The town of Sierra Vista, Arizona, is ending curbside recycling altogether. \u201cI\u2019m hearing a lot of disappointment \u2026 People loved the blue bin program,\u201d said Sharon Flissar, the city\u2019s director of public works. \u201cSome people had heard about the China situation. For them it was very distant, until it hit home.\u201d County officials in Honolulu are pushing to burn recyclables in a local incinerator, arguing it is too expensive to pay to ship them somewhere. So far, local environmentalists have resisted the idea. \u201cThe idea we bring all this stuff in and then burn up more fossil fuels to send it halfway across the world is problematic by itself,\u201d said Rafael Bergstrom, the executive director of Sustainable Coastlines Hawaii, but he said the idea of incineration was even worse. A waste executive from Republic Services, one of the country\u2019s largest garbage haulers, which serves more than 2,800 communities and has 91 recycling centers, said that one-third of everything collected by recycling trucks went to disposal because it was either contaminated, too small to be sorted or not actually recyclable. \u201cThe industry is now underwater in the recycling business because those markets are so disrupted, and China is not going to come back,\u201d said Richard Coupland, vice-president of municipal sales. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be this way for a sustained period of time.\u201d Despite the challenges, a handful of wealthy cities with sophisticated technology said they had been able to find foreign markets for mixed plastic. In San Francisco and Seattle, recyclers can extract items from the waste stream that meet China\u2019s new cleanliness standards, and thus can still be exported. Losing access to recycling Santa Monica bills itself as a green city, with over 100 miles of bikeways and a plan to become carbon neutral by 2050. Yet even here, environmentalism is hitting a wall. The Santa Monica community recycling center, the only one on the west side of Los Angeles, was in many ways a recycling success story. Residents could come here to redeem their plastic bottles \u2013 which still have a stable market \u2013 for cash, along with aluminum cans and glass bottles. Anti-waste advocates say this helped keep recycling rates high, diverted waste from landfills and the nearby ocean, and provided a vital source of income for homeless and low-income residents. But on 15 June, the center closed down after the city failed to renew its contract, in large part because of financial difficulties and market volatility in the wake of China\u2019s move. While curbside recycling will remain, the decision to shut down an outlet that helped incentivize recycling has been met with bitter disappointment, and it marks a troubling trend of communities losing access to their recycling options. \u201cThe City of Santa Monica has spent millions of dollars over the years to keep Santa Monica Bay clean and free of plastics,\u201d said Susan Collins, executive director of the Container Recycling Institute, at a press conference about the facility\u2019s closure. \u201cThe closure of this facility will likely lead to an increase in beverage container litter on Santa Monica\u2019s streets and beaches, and ultimately into the Santa Monica Bay.\u201d Just days before the closure, a group of demonstrators wielding colorful signs gathered outside City Hall to voice their anger. Chants of \u201cKeep it open! Keep it open!\u201d rang through the late afternoon air. Diego Alzaga, a retired veteran, said he topped up his monthly pension of $492 by cashing in bottles and cans, sometimes getting as much as $33 per trip. Hauling his items to the next closest recycling center, seven miles away, was out of the question, he said, because of the difficulty of taking large amounts of recycling on the bus.

      "bodyText": "A man who had been trying to seek medical care has set himself alight in his room on Manus Island, refugees have said. The incident occurred at Hillside Haus, one of three accomodation blocks in Lorengau, which house the hundreds of asylum seeker and refugee men sent there under Australia\u2019s offshore processing policy. Photographs show a significant blaze in one building, attended to by immigration officers and police with fire extinguishers and hoses. Manus-based refugee Shamindan Kanapadhi said a man had set himself on fire inside his room. \u201cHe has been suffering with severe health issues and his medical treatment has been denied for a long time,\u201d Kanapadhi said. \u201cToday he went to the PIH clinic to get some help but they didn\u2019t help him and he was very stressed.\u201d One of the man\u2019s friends who lives with him at Hillside Haus told Guardian Australia the man had locked himself inside his room before the blaze began. \u201cThe security guards arrived to break the door and couldn\u2019t [so] I helped with some other guys and we broke the door, took him from inside,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I see him he can\u2019t speak, [his] face, forehead, left cheek, right cheek, very badly burned. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how he did [the] fire because I was outside with security. The whole thing was five, 10 minutes.\u201d The two men have been on on Manus for six years. \u201cWe are like brothers,\u201d the man\u2019s friend said. \u201cWhen I saw the fire I was very scared. I thought today I lost him.\u201d He said the man had been returned to hospital by Manus security after the blaze was extinguished. It comes during extraordinarily tense times on Manus Island, as refugees and asylum seekers continue to protest against their conditions, and delays in processing their US resettlement claims. A mental health crisis continues to worsen, with more than 90 acts of self-harm and suicide attempts since Australia\u2019s federal election. \u201cWhile the home affairs minister spends his time arguing to repeal the medevac bill, the situation on Manus spins out of control,\u201d said Ian Rintoul, spokesperson for the Refugee Action Coalition. On Thursday, a man climbed a mobile phone tower and stayed there for several hours, saying he had his final interview with US representatives two years ago and was yet to receive an answer. \u201cRight now at least 55 people in Manus and Port Moresby are waiting for that result from America,\u201d journalist and refugee Behrouz Boochani said. \u201cThey are all different nationalities. At least 20 from Iran, six from Pakistan, and one person from Sri Lanka. Ten from Sudan and five from Afghanistan and four from Somalia, and one Bangladeshi. \u201cThe process with America is really like a torture for people \u2013 they don\u2019t talk to people in detention and don\u2019t give results.\u201d More than 500 people have been resettled in the US from Manus and Nauru, with several hundred others rejected. On Sunday the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, acknowledged that the US was unlikely to reach the maximum number of resettlements it agreed to as part of the deal with Australia, of 1,250 people. Last week a Somali man set himself alight at the East Lorengau camp. This story was amended on 25 June 2019 to protect the men\u2019s identities",

Their anger at the abuse erupted in the 1966 riot, prompted by an officer putting his hand on a woman at Compton\u2019s.

The concept was later solidified during community <a href=\"https://www.out.com/out-exclusives/2019/2/18/black-trans-women-created-worlds-first-trans-cultural-district\">negotiations with a real estate developer</a>, who had gained approval from the city to tear down numerous historic LGBT sites to build a residential and hotel project. Activists opposed the destruction of landmarks, but were unable to stop the demolition and development.</p> <p>A group led by black trans women, were, however, able to secure funding from the developer for community services and the official creation of the district, which covers six blocks and is considered the first legally recognized trans district in the world.</p> <p>\u201cWhat does it look like to honor the legacy and the culture we\u2019ve inherited as trans people \u2013 a culture of joy and resilience, in spite of our disparities and marginalization?\u201d said Aria Sa\u2019id, the co-founder and executive director of the district, who moved from Oregon to San Francisco when she was 19 years old and wound up homeless in the Tenderloin. \u201cWe can create a world where we are economically and culturally and socially empowered.\u201d</p> <p>Longer term, that means turning the district into a hub of services and opportunities for trans people, with more community space, housing, job training and businesses \u201cowned and operated by and for trans people\u201d, said Sa\u2019id,<strong> </strong>29.</p> <p>Janetta Johnson, another co-founder of the district, said the project was a way of \u201cpaying for the damage that has been historically caused against black trans people. You treated us like shit for many, many, many years \u2026 Now, we need ownership.\u201d</p> <p>Stryker, the historian, said she would someday like to see the city take over the site of the Compton\u2019s Cafeteria, which closed in 1972, and build some kind of community center for trans people.

The cultural district is also mobilizing to protect black trans women from displacement, as the San Francisco neighborhood rapidly gentrifies.

In fact, if it wasn\u2019t for Dr Susan Stryker, the event might have been almost entirely forgotten. The trans historian was rifling through the Gay and Lesbian Historical Society archives in 1991 when she stumbled on a timeline of historic events that referenced an August 1966 event: \u201cDrag queens protest police harassment at Compton\u2019s Cafeteria\u201d.

Eventually, she met Amanda St Jaymes, a trans woman who had lived in a hotel in the area and was present at the riot. St Jaymes and others told their stories in Stryker\u2019s 2005 documentary, Screaming Queens, which included archival footage of a fearmongering TV news report that described the Tenderloin as a hotbed for \u201chomosexuals and transvestites\u201d to engage in the \u201cmarketplace of vice, degradation and human misery\u201d \u2013 where \u201cscreaming queens\u201d fought at Compton\u2019s, a local diner.

When she was around 17, she hopped on a Greyhound bus from San Jose to San Francisco \u2013 and eventually wound up being a regular at Compton\u2019s Cafeteria. \u201cThey were the most beautiful women I\u2019d ever seen,\u201d said Personna, who was raised in a large Mexican family, with a Baptist minister father. \u201cIt was like I\u2019m home, in a way \u2026 I really felt like I was in wonderland. They took care of me like big sisters. They were just so sweet to me and to each other.\u201d Trans women talked in the documentary about their struggles as sex workers in the neighborhood, and the ways they found brief refuge at Compton\u2019s. The women often faced intense violence from clients and police, and would check up on each other and hang at the restaurant, Personna recalled. The Tenderloin \u2013 two miles from the famous Castro gayborhood, which has long attracted white gay men \u2013 was in some ways safer for the women. But police would bother them wherever they went. Collette LeGrande, a 68-year-old performer, recalled visiting Compton\u2019s at age 15: \u201cMeeting some of those girls, I thought they must have to be really strong.\u201d She remembered seeing a policeman drag a trans woman and beat her with a club: \u201cThere was not much we could do about it.\u201d In Stryker\u2019s film, the women talked about being arrested for all kinds of \u201ccrimes\u201d, including \u201cfemale impersonation\u201d and \u201cobstructing the sidewalk\u201d. Their anger at the abuse erupted in the 1966 riot, prompted by an officer putting his hand on a woman at Compton\u2019s. The women recalled throwing sugar shakers through the glass windows and drag queens beating police with their purses. The night ended with overturned tables, a destroyed police car, a newsstand set on fire, and the women hauled off in officers\u2019 paddy wagons. Creating a trans district: \u2018We need ownership\u2019 The mainstream erasure of Compton\u2019s from discussions of LGBT resistance is partly due to the exclusion of trans people from the gay rights movement and Pride parades in the years that followed. LeGrande said she still encounters gay men in San Francisco who have never heard of it: \u201cFor the average LGB person \u2026 Stonewall is the beginning of the actual movement for them. But for the transgender girls, it\u2019s Compton\u2019s Cafeteria.\u201d A group of younger trans women are now working hard to make sure people don\u2019t forget 1966. But honoring the Compton\u2019s history in the Tenderloin is not just symbolic. \u201cIt\u2019s a life and death thing for many members of the trans community,\u201d said Honey Mahogany, a San Francisco native and co-founder of the Compton\u2019s Transgender Cultural District. Mahogany, who previously worked as a social worker, has seen firsthand in recent years how trans people in the neighborhood struggle to access resources and housing \u2013 and are sometimes pushed out of San Francisco, with little support. The Tenderloin has a reputation in California as being a magnet for homelessness, drug use and crime, with some calling it a \u201ccontainment zone\u201d for illegal activity. But as the tech boom has exacerbated income inequality, the Tenderloin is one of the rare areas that has maintained some affordable housing in the heart of the city, where low-income trans people of color continue to live and gather. For now. \u201cThere is such a huge presence of trans folks \u2013 there\u2019s nowhere else in the city, and maybe the world, where you see so many trans folks concentrated in a small area,\u201d said Mahogany, 35. Local organizers began discussing the creation of a historic district as a way to fight gentrification. The concept was later solidified during community negotiations with a real estate developer, who had gained approval from the city to tear down numerous historic LGBT sites to build a residential and hotel project. Activists opposed the destruction of landmarks, but were unable to stop the demolition and development. A group led by black trans women, were, however, able to secure funding from the developer for community services and the official creation of the district, which covers six blocks and is considered the first legally recognized trans district in the world. \u201cWhat does it look like to honor the legacy and the culture we\u2019ve inherited as trans people \u2013 a culture of joy and resilience, in spite of our disparities and marginalization?\u201d said Aria Sa\u2019id, the co-founder and executive director of the district, who moved from Oregon to San Francisco when she was 19 years old and wound up homeless in the Tenderloin. \u201cWe can create a world where we are economically and culturally and socially empowered.\u201d Longer term, that means turning the district into a hub of services and opportunities for trans people, with more community space, housing, job training and businesses \u201cowned and operated by and for trans people\u201d, said Sa\u2019id, 29. Janetta Johnson, another co-founder of the district, said the project was a way of \u201cpaying for the damage that has been historically caused against black trans people. You treated us like shit for many, many, many years \u2026 Now, we need ownership.\u201d Stryker, the historian, said she would someday like to see the city take over the site of the Compton\u2019s Cafeteria, which closed in 1972, and build some kind of community center for trans people. Currently, 111 Taylor Street is a Federal Bureau of Prisons \u201cre-entry center\u201d, run by Geo Group, a notorious private prison corporation. \u2018The realities we face are still the same\u2019 Honoring the Compton\u2019s riot also means recognizing that many of the hardships of 1966 remain. \u201cAs much as we feel we made progress,\u201d said Sa\u2019id, \u201cthe realities we face and disparities we still face are the same.\u201d That makes the need for the cultural district feel urgent \u2013 a necessary stand against gentrification, in the spirit of the \u201cscreaming queens\u201d who stood up to police. The needs are urgent. In a region with overwhelming tech wealth and a high concentration of billionaires, some low-income LGBT people who live in the Tenderloin suffer through horrific housing conditions. Mahogany, who works as an aide to a San Francisco supervisor, said she recently learned of a tenant in her district who was hospitalized after a decomposing body leaked fluids onto her from the ceiling above. Bedbugs, filth and \u201cunlivable conditions\u201d are common. The TGI Justice Project, a trans rights not-for-profit led by Johnson, is now losing its space in the Tenderloin, a few blocks from the Compton\u2019s site and near the Uber and Twitter headquarters. She has struggled to find a new home. Cecilia Chung, a longtime trans activist in San Francisco, noted that trans women in the Tenderloin also continue to face police harassment \u2013 for sleeping on the street or other laws that criminalize the poor: \u201cThere are still a lot of people in the Tenderloin who are struggling to survive due to \u2026 discrimination they are suffering.\u201d At Pride, Personna said she wants to remind people that their rights are under attack, that \u201cwe\u2019re back in the 1960s\u201d, and that \u201cit could get worse\u201d. When she reflects on Compton\u2019s, the toughest part for her is recognizing that the women who rioted never got to live in a society that respected them. Her eyes welled with tears as she shared the message she would give if she could speak to them now: \u201cLadies, you didn\u2019t live in vain. Your life is serving a bigger purpose now \u2026 And your story is never going to die.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Danny Boyle\u2019s new film, Yesterday, is a spry piece of speculative fiction set in a land that has never heard Sgt Pepper, Hey Jude or Tomorrow Never Knows. On a superficial level, this alternative UK is not so different from our own. The Lowestoft bus still runs on time, friends gather on summer evenings in the beer garden and Ed Sheeran is on the umpteenth leg of his latest tour. But something vital is missing \u2013 and only a handful of people realise what has been lost. As one character puts it: \u201cA world without the Beatles is a world that\u2019s infinitely worse.\u201d</p> <p>Fittingly, Boyle\u2019s film resembles a three-minute pop song itself \u2013 so simply structured as to feel skimpy and disposable until it snags in your brain like an infernal ear-worm and you find yourself pondering its implications for days. On the surface, the story is bright and perky. Underneath, it is desolate: a high-concept comedy about cultural amnesia and a wonderful Britain that might have been. I tell Boyle I think it might be a Brexit movie in disguise and he guffaws in embarrassment and reaches for his cup of coffee. \u201cYeah, well,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could certainly make a case for that.\u201d</p> <p>Seeing as we are in the business of making grand and sweeping claims, let\u2019s go one further. Boyle, it could be argued, is part of the same parallel cool-Britannia that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/05/yesterday-review-the-beatles-richard-curtis-danny-boyle-himesh-patel\" title=\"\">Yesterday</a> is longing for. He is the man who galvanised 90s cinema with Trainspotting, won an Oscar in the 00s for directing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pRlsz4yjpc\" title=\"\">Slumdog Millionaire</a> and presided over the all-embracing splendour of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics_opening_ceremony\" title=\"\">opening ceremony at the 2012 London Olympics</a>. If he is not quite at Paul McCartney level, he is surely within shouting distance. A few weeks ago he rocked up as a guest on BBC\u2019s Top Gear and the producer bellowed: \u201cNational treasure coming through!\u201d Boyle laughs at the memory. \u201cSo yeah, you do get a little of that, the \u2018national treasure\u2019 thing. And that\u2019s all right, it\u2019s not so bad. I\u2019m happy to be a good ambassador.\u201d</p> <p>He pours more coffee and talks about Yesterday, which stars Himesh Patel as Jack, a callow young busker who is knocked off his bike and regains consciousness in a Beatles-free universe that is ripe for the taking. Before long, Jack is fixing a hole, passing off classic songs as his own \u2013 all the while terrified that he is about to be found out. Boyle accepts that it is a nostalgic film \u2013 or, rather, a film that examines the power of nostalgia. He likens it to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/16/rocketman-review-elton-john-biopic-thats-better-at-the-tiaras-than-the-tantrums\" title=\"\">Rocketman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/23/bohemian-rhapsody-review-freddie-mercury-biopic-bites-the-dust\" title=\"\">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>, two other crowd-pleasing pictures about Britain\u2019s musical past. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting trend. In a time of complete uncertainty \u2013 politically, economically \u2013 people latch on to the things they can depend on.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bc53e057af71edc9030e86d864ed933ad7a2a73c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc53e057af71edc9030e86d864ed933ad7a2a73c/0_175_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Danny Boyle and Richard Curtis filming Yesterday with Himesh Patel and Lily James.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danny Boyle and Richard Curtis filming Yesterday with Himesh Patel and Lily James.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Prime/Universal Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Boyle admits that he was always more of a Bowie and Led Zeppelin fan, but that is by the by: the Beatles influenced pretty much everything. Yesterday concentrates solely on the music, but their social and political impact extended well beyond that. \u201cIf you took them out of the equation, the ripple effect would be enormous. We\u2019d probably be living in this massive dystopian universe. It would take a novel to track just how much everything changed.\u201d</p> <p>Boyle is 62: a whippy live-wire, with thick-framed glasses and a shocking pink jumper, like an amiable geography teacher who moonlights as a seaside entertainer. Perhaps he is mellowing with age. Yesterday, for instance, is scripted by Richard Curtis, the saccharine McCartney to Boyle\u2019s acerbic Lennon. Back in the 90s, they were viewed as natural enemies. Wasn\u2019t Trainspotting (which Boyle made in collaboration with producer Andrew Macdonald, writer John Hodge and actor Ewan McGregor) seen as the gritty corrective to Four Weddings and a Funeral?</p> <p>Boyle chuckles and says he never saw it that way, that he always liked Curtis\u2019s work. \u201cThe truth is, after making Trainspotting, we were very cock-a-hoop and we thought: \u2018Now let\u2019s do a romantic comedy.\u2019 So we set off for Utah and made a film called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6K5q72jy9c\" title=\"\">A Life Less Ordinary.</a> Then we came back and over the Christmas period I got sent this script called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RI0QvaGoiI\" title=\"\">Notting Hill</a>. And I read Notting Hill and thought: \u2018Well, <em>that</em>\u2019s a romantic-comedy. I don\u2019t know what the fuck it is we\u2019ve just shot in Utah \u2013 but it certainly isn\u2019t <em>that</em>.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Boyle, for his part, spent the bulk of Beatlemania squirrelled away in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radcliffe,_Greater_Manchester\" title=\"\">Radcliffe</a>, north of Manchester. He spent eight years as an altar boy and briefly considered the priesthood before working in theatre, TV and finally film, which he feels is not a dissimilar calling. As a young man, he thrilled to the work of the 1970s film-makers who seemed intent on pushing themselves and their congregation to the limits. Apocalypse Now, he has suggested, was his Damascene conversion. So if he were to wake up in a world in which Coppola had never made it \u2026 \u201cOh, absolutely,\u201d he says. \u201cYes, of course I\u2019d remake it, 100%, shot-for-shot, I\u2019m obsessed with that film. I\u2019d probably do Nic Roeg\u2019s films as well, because there\u2019s no one else like him, he was our Picasso. That extraordinary 10-year period, Performance to Bad Timing. I\u2019d remake all of those.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bfe40d4a1126a1617c20d2cfa599768695e90e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bfe40d4a1126a1617c20d2cfa599768695e90e3/0_0_3473_2084/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trainspotting, 1996.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trainspotting, 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/CHANNEL FOUR FILMS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Boyle\u2019s work has yet to hit Roeg\u2019s peaks of wildness, it compensates with a bold, buzzing energy of its own. It also has a brightness of vision that is sometimes at odds with the subject matter. Whether he is tackling heroin addiction, zombie apocalypse or life in the Dharavi slums, Boyle runs at the material with a bounce in his step. He rarely allows himself to be burdened by fatalism or misery. \u201cWell, I\u2019m a positive person,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd I suppose that makes me a positive film-maker. I feel an obligation to lift people somewhere else with my films. And I believe in the inherent goodness of human beings. That\u2019s naive \u2013 I recognise that. But it\u2019s what keeps me going through the bad times.\u201d</p> <p>Professionally, at least, Boyle hasn\u2019t suffered many knockdowns. He says he has learned that he is more comfortable on smaller productions, where he has room to manoeuvre and faces less pressure from upstairs. The Beach \u2013 a Hollywood behemoth starring Leonardo DiCaprio \u2013 remains a rare leaden misstep, while he and John Hodge recently bailed out of the next James Bond picture, citing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/21/danny-boyle-exits-james-bond-25\" title=\"\">creative differences</a> with the franchise\u2019s producers. I would like to get the full story on what happened, but his lips are sealed and his hands tied; there is not much he can say. \u201cI was with John and they didn\u2019t really like what we were doing and so it\u2019s far better to part company.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cWhat we were doing was good. But it was obviously not what they wanted.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31b4de221c5d778f9c0857d2fe4ae81cbcc179e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31b4de221c5d778f9c0857d2fe4ae81cbcc179e4/0_266_7952_4771/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Himesh Patel plays the Beatles in Yesterday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Himesh Patel plays the Beatles in Yesterday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Prime/Universal Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Why did he want to get involved with Bond anyway? They\u2019re movies for producers, not directors; he must have known that. Boyle grins. \u201cYou should be my agent,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd, yeah, you\u2019re right. That\u2019s ultimately what you learn. But you\u2019ve got to go into that stuff optimistically. It\u2019s like falling in love. You can\u2019t go in guarded and trying to protect yourself. You have to be open-hearted and prepared to be hurt \u2013 and so what if you get a bit of bruising? You get well-paid and well looked after. So at the end of the day these are champagne problems.\u201d</p> <p>He insists he has put Bond behind him and no doubt that is true. But every now and then he is reminded of the bruising. Last month he went to see Claire Denis\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/08/high-life-review-robert-pattinson-claire-denis-juliette-binoche\" title=\"\">High Life</a> and was especially taken by Robert Pattinson\u2019s performance. \u201cAnd it was so bizarre, because I was sitting there thinking: \u2018Oh my God, they should get him to be the next Bond.\u2019\u201d Isn\u2019t Pattinson a bit too young for the role? \u201cNo, no,\u201d he scoffs. \u201cHe must be in his 30s. How old was Connery? He\u2019s ready now.\u201d</p> <p>Ironically, Boyle\u2019s greatest achievement may not be a movie at all, but his four-hour Olympic opening ceremony in 2012. Isles of Wonder was a joyous salute to British culture and history that commanded a TV audience of 900 million. The event bounded from England\u2019s green and pleasant land, through the industrial revolution to the present day. It found room for Windrush immigrants and NHS nurses, Shakespeare and the Beatles, James Bond and the Queen. Tory MP Aidan Burley dismissed the show as \u201cleftie multicultural crap\u201d, while the Mail\u2019s Stephen Glover labelled it \u201cMarxist propaganda\u201d, but these were voices in the darkness. Even in the moment, Isles of Wonder felt special. It was a celebration of the best of British liberalism, maybe the culmination of it, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"60bc105ab2218e7d49a6186c66865277e1f91b0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60bc105ab2218e7d49a6186c66865277e1f91b0e/0_0_4396_2637/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The NHS section of Boyle\u2019s 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The NHS section of Boyle\u2019s 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jae C. Hong/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the time, Boyle said directing the ceremony had turned him into a patriot \u2013 or possibly made him realise that he had been one all along. He met with so many international Olympic workers who regarded the UK as a model society \u2013 a nation at ease with itself and its history \u2013 that he came away convinced. He saw his country afresh through the eyes of the world.</p> <p>I read back to him what he once said about those international workers: \u201cThey see us as a beacon \u2013 as a modern, progressive country.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, they did,\u201d he groans. He clamps a hand to his brow. \u201cAnd, oh my God, I wonder what they think about us now. Would they even own up to saying that in the first place? You\u2019d have to ask them. But probably not.\u201d</p> <p>It is nice to think back on that Olympic opening ceremony. The further it recedes into the past, the more brightly it shines: the nation\u2019s golden last hurrah, before the days of Brexit and backstops; societal confusion and the burgeoning bad times. Boyle hasn\u2019t sat down to watch it since and says it would feel a bit weird. But he has a painting by his youngest daughter, who was 20 at the time, and was inspired by the industrial section of the show. It is very impressionistic; his one souvenir. \u201cIt\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever had in my life,\u201d he says.</p> <p>By this point I fear that we have become hopelessly lost down memory lane. We started the interview pining for the Beatles; now, we\u2019re coming over all nostalgic about the London Olympics. Boyle shakes his head and stares at the wall. \u201cOh my God,\u201d he says. \u201cYou might be right.\u201d</p> <p>Still, he is at pains to remain positive; it is how he is geared. The times have gone bad and the country is in a mess. But he has faith in its people, its art and its industry. Its ideals are a bedrock, or perhaps a guiding light through the gloom.</p> <p>\u201cI believe that culture lives within us,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s in our DNA and I really believe that, I can\u2019t stress that enough. So when you hear a great song for the first time, it\u2019s actually something you\u2019ve heard before. It\u2019s the culture that\u2019s within us and that\u2019s why it will survive what is going on at the moment. I\u2019m not talking about culture as a last bastion, but as something that survives and endures and that we\u2019ll eventually come back to.\u201d He\u2019s struggling for words and says he wishes he was more articulate. \u201cIt\u2019s progress we\u2019ll come back to,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading towards progress at the moment. But it\u2019s still there, it\u2019s not gone. It\u2019s progress we can return to whenever we want.\u201d</p> <p><em>Yesterday is released in the UK on 28 June</em></p>",

Even in the moment, Isles of Wonder felt special. It was a celebration of the best of British liberalism, maybe the culmination of it, too. At the time, Boyle said directing the ceremony had turned him into a patriot \u2013 or possibly made him realise that he had been one all along. He met with so many international Olympic workers who regarded the UK as a model society \u2013 a nation at ease with itself and its history \u2013 that he came away convinced. He saw his country afresh through the eyes of the world. I read back to him what he once said about those international workers: \u201cThey see us as a beacon \u2013 as a modern, progressive country.\u201d \u201cYes, they did,\u201d he groans. He clamps a hand to his brow. \u201cAnd, oh my God, I wonder what they think about us now. Would they even own up to saying that in the first place? You\u2019d have to ask them. But probably not.\u201d It is nice to think back on that Olympic opening ceremony. The further it recedes into the past, the more brightly it shines: the nation\u2019s golden last hurrah, before the days of Brexit and backstops; societal confusion and the burgeoning bad times. Boyle hasn\u2019t sat down to watch it since and says it would feel a bit weird. But he has a painting by his youngest daughter, who was 20 at the time, and was inspired by the industrial section of the show. It is very impressionistic; his one souvenir. \u201cIt\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever had in my life,\u201d he says. By this point I fear that we have become hopelessly lost down memory lane. We started the interview pining for the Beatles; now, we\u2019re coming over all nostalgic about the London Olympics. Boyle shakes his head and stares at the wall. \u201cOh my God,\u201d he says. \u201cYou might be right.\u201d Still, he is at pains to remain positive; it is how he is geared. The times have gone bad and the country is in a mess. But he has faith in its people, its art and its industry. Its ideals are a bedrock, or perhaps a guiding light through the gloom. \u201cI believe that culture lives within us,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s in our DNA and I really believe that, I can\u2019t stress that enough. So when you hear a great song for the first time, it\u2019s actually something you\u2019ve heard before. It\u2019s the culture that\u2019s within us and that\u2019s why it will survive what is going on at the moment. I\u2019m not talking about culture as a last bastion, but as something that survives and endures and that we\u2019ll eventually come back to.\u201d He\u2019s struggling for words and says he wishes he was more articulate. \u201cIt\u2019s progress we\u2019ll come back to,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading towards progress at the moment. But it\u2019s still there, it\u2019s not gone. It\u2019s progress we can return to whenever we want.\u201d Yesterday is released in the UK on 28 June",

      "body": "<p>The state schools in New York break up for summer next week, giving kids almost 10 weeks of holiday. (The private schools have already been out for a week.) Like daylight saving, this appears to be a historical anomaly pegged to the days when everyone worked on a farm, and children were required to work in the fields for two months. In Manhattan most kids will go straight into summer camp, the cheapest of which \u2013 not counting subsidised social programmes that are heavily oversubscribed \u2013 are about $500 (\u00a3395) per child per week and lets them out at a very uncordial 3pm. The annual grouse about the cost of the city reaches fever pitch at this time of year.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Research shows, somewhat surprisingly, that during the long break parents actually spend more time with their kids</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The childcare hustle is so costly and extreme that if you\u2019re not careful, it can blow through the main advantage of summer: an invitation to spend more time with your children. Research shows, somewhat surprisingly, that during the long break parents actually spend more time with their kids than they used to. According to analysis from the <a href=\"https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/12/17/parenting-in-america/\" title=\"\">Pew Research Center</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/08/facts-about-u-s-mothers/\" title=\"\">in 1965 mothers in the US spent on average 10 hours a week caring for their kids compared with 14 hours now</a>. (For fathers, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/\" title=\"\">those figures are two and a half hours in 1965 and eight hours now</a>.) But my instinct is that, of those 14 hours, a large proportion is spent fretting about where to put the kids the rest of the time, how much it\u2019s going to cost, and whether they are being sufficiently improved by the activities they\u2019re doing.</p> <p>My children start kindergarten in the autumn, and their new school has issued parents with a stern warning about \u201csummer slide\u201d, which over 10 weeks of non-attendance is, I\u2019m sure, is considerable. Advising parents to ensure their kids carry on reading every day is sensible, but it does add to the sense of the summer break as a terrible obstacle to overcome rather than an annual release from pressure. I don\u2019t want to get too Swallows and Amazons about this, but the dedication of summer to worthwhile pursuit seems to undermine its very reason for being.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/20/is-breast-really-best-i-looked-at-all-the-data-to-find-out\">Is breast really best? I looked at all the data to find out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It also feels like a particularly noticeable glitch in modern parenting psychology. I sometimes catch myself complaining about how many extra hours I will have to take off over the next 10 weeks, what a monstrous hassle and expense it all is, why the city is set up to punish working parents \u2013 on and on I go before stopping short, and telling myself to shut up.

      "bodyText": "The state schools in New York break up for summer next week, giving kids almost 10 weeks of holiday. (The private schools have already been out for a week.) Like daylight saving, this appears to be a historical anomaly pegged to the days when everyone worked on a farm, and children were required to work in the fields for two months. In Manhattan most kids will go straight into summer camp, the cheapest of which \u2013 not counting subsidised social programmes that are heavily oversubscribed \u2013 are about $500 (\u00a3395) per child per week and lets them out at a very uncordial 3pm. The annual grouse about the cost of the city reaches fever pitch at this time of year. The childcare hustle is so costly and extreme that if you\u2019re not careful, it can blow through the main advantage of summer: an invitation to spend more time with your children. Research shows, somewhat surprisingly, that during the long break parents actually spend more time with their kids than they used to. According to analysis from the Pew Research Center, in 1965 mothers in the US spent on average 10 hours a week caring for their kids compared with 14 hours now. (For fathers, those figures are two and a half hours in 1965 and eight hours now.) But my instinct is that, of those 14 hours, a large proportion is spent fretting about where to put the kids the rest of the time, how much it\u2019s going to cost, and whether they are being sufficiently improved by the activities they\u2019re doing. My children start kindergarten in the autumn, and their new school has issued parents with a stern warning about \u201csummer slide\u201d, which over 10 weeks of non-attendance is, I\u2019m sure, is considerable. Advising parents to ensure their kids carry on reading every day is sensible, but it does add to the sense of the summer break as a terrible obstacle to overcome rather than an annual release from pressure. I don\u2019t want to get too Swallows and Amazons about this, but the dedication of summer to worthwhile pursuit seems to undermine its very reason for being. It also feels like a particularly noticeable glitch in modern parenting psychology. I sometimes catch myself complaining about how many extra hours I will have to take off over the next 10 weeks, what a monstrous hassle and expense it all is, why the city is set up to punish working parents \u2013 on and on I go before stopping short, and telling myself to shut up. This is an insane way to live and it crushes the joy out of everything. No one I know can take two months off work, and most of us wouldn\u2019t want to: but in spite of the difficulties there has to be a way to regard the summer as a bonus, not a chore; to approach the shortfall in childcare as a gift, not a source of guilt. After all, based on what many of us know from our own childhoods, it\u2019s unstructured time, not the feverish schlep between camp and classes and play dates, that really helps child development.

When compared with the wider Democratic electorate, this cohort of \u201cextremely online\u201d Democrats are far less likely to identify as moderate, are more likely to have participated in a protest and support progressives policies such as Medicare for All. Moderates\u2019 theory on how to win in 2020, as described by one panelist during the conference, is to appeal to the \u201cwoke and the still waking\u201d. The best candidate, they argue, is someone who can mobilize a Democratic base that is increasingly young, diverse and liberal, while still appealing to independents, moderate Republicans and working-class voters who could decide the election. This is not achieved with \u201cwarmed-over 1990s centrism\u201d, said Cowan, but neither is it achieved by \u201c1960s Nordic-style socialism\u201d. \u201cVoters do not want mushy, bland, empty Democratic centrism,\u201d Cowan said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not who this rising generation of swing district winners are.\u201d On Monday evening, one of those new House members, the South Carolina congressman Joe Cunningham, welcomed the group to his district, which the 37-year-old flipped last year after decades of Republican control. Cunningham said he did not win his race by promising Medicare for All or by demonizing Republicans. Rather, he said he won by positioning himself as a moderate who was willing to work across the aisle and occasionally buck his own party. Like a football coach rallying his team before a game, Cunningham said Republicans who run to the right to embrace Trump are \u201cceding more and more ground in the middle\u201d. \u201cThere is so much middle ground to gain in 2020,\u201d he shouted. \u201cI say we take it!\u201d",

Over the next 10 years millions of visitors passed through its fantastical rooms, designed by MIT architects with curved walls and large windows. The house was equipped with plastic chairs and plastic floors, the kitchen with precise stacks of plastic plates and plastic cups. Monsanto\u2019s house trumpeted the wonders of science, as well as the chemical industry and its products. Plastic, it proclaimed, was the material of tomorrow. Tomorrow has come, and plastic is everywhere. In the half century since the Monsanto house closed, plastic has conquered the planet: globally, we now consume a million plastic bottles a minute and more than a trillion plastic bags every year. Nobody lives in curved plastic rooms, but synthetic carpeting, vinyl flooring and laminate counters are all commonplace. And most Americans\u2019 daily routines depend on single-use items and throwaway plastic packaging, much of it flowing into streams and oceans, polluting our ecosystems.

      "body": "<p>Last summer, 24-year-old comedian Jaboukie Young-White coined a new nickname for short men. It wasn\u2019t a jokey name \u2013 a put-down poking fun at the little guy \u2013 but an honorific: \u201cShort kings are the enemy of body negativity,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaboukie/status/1014588640171831296\">he wrote on Twitter</a>, \u201cand I\u2019ll be forever proud to defend them.\u201d</p> <p>In 2019, taking ownership of one\u2019s identity is the ideal mode of being \u2013 and those who carry their genuine, multi-dimensional selves with pride deserve respect.</p> <p>That includes short dudes, a segment of society who, while not exactly persecuted, are certainly prone to being overlooked.</p> <p>Young-White\u2019s paeans to short kings encourage us to confront society\u2019s overvaluation of men\u2019s height, and recognize the guys under 6ft whose positive attitudes render them nothing short of regal. A short king isn\u2019t just any male-presenting person of modest stature \u2013 it\u2019s someone who has the strength of character to flourish in the face of conventional male beauty standards.</p> <p>As such, 5ft 7in, Spiderman actor Tom Holland is a short king, as are Pulitzer-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar (5ft 5in) trans actor Ian Alexander (5ft) and (short) \u201cking in the north\u201d Kit Harington (5ft 7in), who admits he allowed taller actors on the set of Game of Thrones to ruffle his hair.</p> <p>Yet celebrity is by no means a requirement to be a short king. Any short man can be a short king (including my own 5ft 7in boyfriend, my match in height and ginger hair). Young-White (himself 5ft 9in) includes all men under 6ft in his movement, though many have pointed out the average American man is 5ft 10in, making that the more accurate cutoff.</p> <p>Young-White decreed last 21 June as the first \u2018short king appreciation day\u2019, kicking off what has become a year of public declarations of short king love.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/elsabbaa/status/1129563948209057794\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Guys over 6ft have no personality, short kings are always the funniest trust</p>&mdash; aya (@elsabbaa) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elsabbaa/status/1129563948209057794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 18, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/yuh_grac/status/1136087256303919111\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In 2019 we respect short kings</p>&mdash; gracie tea\ud83c\udf3b (@yuh_grac) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yuh_grac/status/1136087256303919111?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 5, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KEBABMETFRIET/status/1138571021865431040\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">short kings are the new wave</p>&mdash; mert ama pert (@KEBABMETFRIET) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KEBABMETFRIET/status/1138571021865431040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 11, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>As to whether or not short men really require kudos just for being secure \u2026 well, it depends on your perspective.</p> <p>Even as society begins to see the danger of shaming individuals for, say, acne or being overweight, diminishing short people is still something Meryl Streep can do on premium cable. (\u201cI find little people untrustworthy,\u201d announces Streep\u2019s character on the new season of Big Little Lies).</p> <p>Micheal Foulk, 33, a 5ft 7in non-binary comedian from Oakland, has noticed a double standard: \u201cIt\u2019ll be like, OK, we\u2019re going to agree that we\u2019re not going to be cruel to people that are heavier set or larger-bodied. But if people are short, it\u2019s like: go off, sis!\u201d</p> <p>Sizeism is hard to avoid on dating apps such as Grindr and Tinder, where users commonly forbid men under 6ft from contacting them.

      "bodyText": "Last summer, 24-year-old comedian Jaboukie Young-White coined a new nickname for short men. It wasn\u2019t a jokey name \u2013 a put-down poking fun at the little guy \u2013 but an honorific: \u201cShort kings are the enemy of body negativity,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, \u201cand I\u2019ll be forever proud to defend them.\u201d In 2019, taking ownership of one\u2019s identity is the ideal mode of being \u2013 and those who carry their genuine, multi-dimensional selves with pride deserve respect. That includes short dudes, a segment of society who, while not exactly persecuted, are certainly prone to being overlooked. Young-White\u2019s paeans to short kings encourage us to confront society\u2019s overvaluation of men\u2019s height, and recognize the guys under 6ft whose positive attitudes render them nothing short of regal. A short king isn\u2019t just any male-presenting person of modest stature \u2013 it\u2019s someone who has the strength of character to flourish in the face of conventional male beauty standards. As such, 5ft 7in, Spiderman actor Tom Holland is a short king, as are Pulitzer-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar (5ft 5in) trans actor Ian Alexander (5ft) and (short) \u201cking in the north\u201d Kit Harington (5ft 7in), who admits he allowed taller actors on the set of Game of Thrones to ruffle his hair. Yet celebrity is by no means a requirement to be a short king. Any short man can be a short king (including my own 5ft 7in boyfriend, my match in height and ginger hair). Young-White (himself 5ft 9in) includes all men under 6ft in his movement, though many have pointed out the average American man is 5ft 10in, making that the more accurate cutoff. Young-White decreed last 21 June as the first \u2018short king appreciation day\u2019, kicking off what has become a year of public declarations of short king love. As to whether or not short men really require kudos just for being secure \u2026 well, it depends on your perspective. Even as society begins to see the danger of shaming individuals for, say, acne or being overweight, diminishing short people is still something Meryl Streep can do on premium cable. (\u201cI find little people untrustworthy,\u201d announces Streep\u2019s character on the new season of Big Little Lies). Micheal Foulk, 33, a 5ft 7in non-binary comedian from Oakland, has noticed a double standard: \u201cIt\u2019ll be like, OK, we\u2019re going to agree that we\u2019re not going to be cruel to people that are heavier set or larger-bodied. But if people are short, it\u2019s like: go off, sis!\u201d Sizeism is hard to avoid on dating apps such as Grindr and Tinder, where users commonly forbid men under 6ft from contacting them. Tinder even made a 2019 April Fool\u2019s joke about launching a \u201cheight verification\u201d update that would prevent guys from exaggerating their stature. Yet short-shaming isn\u2019t harmless. \u201cThere\u2019s a host of studies that show short men are stigmatized in many ways, not only in people\u2019s perception, but in actual real world outcomes as well,\u201d says Joseph Vandello, a social psychologist at the University of Southern Florida. \u201cPeople perceive shorter men as having fewer leadership qualities,\u201d he says, citing findings that majority of American CEOs are over 6ft in and voters prefer tall presidential candidates (including, at 6ft 2in, Trump). All this starts early \u2013 even in kindergarten, studies have found, teachers perceive the shortest boys in their class as less academically capable than their peers. Height is also perceived to correlate directly with masculinity. As Vandello explains: \u201cBecause of [the correlation between height and perceived masculinity], a lot of men feel kind of a chronic sense of anxiety and uncertainty about their manhood status.\u201d Insecurity generally manifests in oversensitivity to insult (which may contribute to the stereotype of short men as angry, resentful, over-compensating Napoleons.) Unfortunately, this hasn\u2019t just been the year of the short king. It\u2019s also been a year of increased media coverage and public awareness of incels \u2013 online communities of \u201cinvoluntarily celibate\u201d men whose self-loathing manifests in derogatory, in some cases extremely violent, behavior towards women, and a pathological obsession with altering their appearance to fit a narrow definition of brawny masculine beauty. The dismaying presence of incels prompts a complicated question: how do we talk about bolstering men\u2019s self-esteem at a time when society is interrogating the injustices of male privilege, and the connection between masculine insecurity and violence? The answer may lay in a reconceptualization of manhood. \u201cI think it\u2019s an interesting time,\u201d says Brendan Steven, a 27-year-old, 5ft 5in writer from Ontario. \u201cMany of us sense that our ideas of the masculine and feminine that we grew up with are too constraining. But at the same time, there are such things as masculine and feminine traits and we value them to some extent.\u201d Like many short men, Steven recalls an adolescence spent believing masculinity was defined by a set of immutable characteristics \u2013 like being tall and imposing \u2013 and that by not fitting that ideal he was \u201ckind of cursed.\u201d But as he grew up, he began thinking about manhood as something he could develop by embodying his values, rather than a blunt appraisal of his physical self. \u201cI think to be masculine, to be manly, whatever that word means, is about doing good in the world.

      "body": "<p>When was the last time you stepped outside and looked up? It\u2019s hard to find the time to do it, and even when we do, high-rise cityscapes, light pollution and \u2013 the bane of all astronomy \u2013 \u201ccloud\u201d often limit the view of what lies beyond. But perhaps it is something we are fundamentally drawn to do. Throughout time, people across the world have looked up and wondered what was out there. Cultures around the globe have built structures to augment their views of the cosmos, and one of the most important sites for contemplating the heavens is undoubtedly Stonehenge.</p> <p>I recently visited this prehistoric monument and as I stood within the ancient stone circle, I felt, perhaps unsurprisingly, a strong connection to the past. Yet at the same time I felt strongly rooted in the present, and yet again, even under cloudy skies, I had a feeling of being part of the expansive universe that lay beyond. It was easy to imagine that our Neolithic ancestors would have gazed at the same skies. It made me think about our connection with the natural world \u2013 or our increasing disconnection from it \u2013 and the importance of conservation and protection, not just of this monument and others like it but of the world that has been rapidly changing around it since those enormous stones were raised 4,500 years ago.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our ancestors seemed to understand the importance of our place in the universe better than we do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Was Stonehenge a Neolithic computer for predicting eclipses, an astronomical observatory, a place of moon worship? And how did its use evolve over the years? Standing in the stones and taking in the huge sky above, I am certain that its \u201cskyscape\u201d is as significant in understanding this as the landscape that it sits in.</p> <p>It is thought that even in Neolithic times Salisbury Plain would have been largely wide-open grassland as it is now \u2013 quite different from the woodlands that would have surrounded it, and a perfect place from which to observe the night sky. In my mind\u2019s eye, I can see generation after generation sitting around fires looking up at the spectacle of the heavens and telling stories inspired by the movement of the planets and the constellations as a way of imparting knowledge about changes in season, weather patterns and the marking of time. Beliefs about the sky, the stars and planets would have been intertwined with practical daily life.</p> <p>Marking the movements of the sun was clearly important to the people who built Stonehenge, as they went to such enormous extents to carefully align the stones.

      "bodyText": "When was the last time you stepped outside and looked up? It\u2019s hard to find the time to do it, and even when we do, high-rise cityscapes, light pollution and \u2013 the bane of all astronomy \u2013 \u201ccloud\u201d often limit the view of what lies beyond. But perhaps it is something we are fundamentally drawn to do. Throughout time, people across the world have looked up and wondered what was out there. Cultures around the globe have built structures to augment their views of the cosmos, and one of the most important sites for contemplating the heavens is undoubtedly Stonehenge. I recently visited this prehistoric monument and as I stood within the ancient stone circle, I felt, perhaps unsurprisingly, a strong connection to the past. Yet at the same time I felt strongly rooted in the present, and yet again, even under cloudy skies, I had a feeling of being part of the expansive universe that lay beyond. It was easy to imagine that our Neolithic ancestors would have gazed at the same skies. It made me think about our connection with the natural world \u2013 or our increasing disconnection from it \u2013 and the importance of conservation and protection, not just of this monument and others like it but of the world that has been rapidly changing around it since those enormous stones were raised 4,500 years ago. Was Stonehenge a Neolithic computer for predicting eclipses, an astronomical observatory, a place of moon worship? And how did its use evolve over the years? Standing in the stones and taking in the huge sky above, I am certain that its \u201cskyscape\u201d is as significant in understanding this as the landscape that it sits in. It is thought that even in Neolithic times Salisbury Plain would have been largely wide-open grassland as it is now \u2013 quite different from the woodlands that would have surrounded it, and a perfect place from which to observe the night sky. In my mind\u2019s eye, I can see generation after generation sitting around fires looking up at the spectacle of the heavens and telling stories inspired by the movement of the planets and the constellations as a way of imparting knowledge about changes in season, weather patterns and the marking of time. Beliefs about the sky, the stars and planets would have been intertwined with practical daily life. Marking the movements of the sun was clearly important to the people who built Stonehenge, as they went to such enormous extents to carefully align the stones. Exactly why they did this, we don\u2019t know. But as Stonehenge Skyscape \u2013 English Heritage\u2019s new digital model of the solar system or \u201correry\u201d \u2013 illustrates, at midwinter the sun barely rises in the sky. It\u2019s possible that our prehistoric ancestors saw the winter solstice as a time when the sun almost seemed to die, before slowly being reborn. This may seem absurd, but as recently as 1812 our lack of knowledge about the sun led people to believe that it was indeed dying. Many thought the end of the world was at hand when sunspots appeared on its surface and its light was dimmed by a haze, which was in fact caused by a volcanic eruption. Lord Byron was inspired to write an apocalyptic poem, Darkness, when his summer holiday on Lake Geneva was overshadowed by dark skies, thunder and torrential rain. He imagined the grim fate of humanity after the sudden death of the sun: I had a dream, which was not all a dream. The bright sun was extinguish\u2019d, and the stars Did wander darkling in the eternal space, Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air; Morn came and went \u2013 and came, and brought no day, And men forgot their passions in the dread Of this their desolation; and all hearts Were chill\u2019d into a selfish prayer for light.

Compared with attacks depicted by photos of bloodied faces in Chatchawalamonkul\u2019s Facebook group, it was a tame encounter. Grab tells the Guardian that the safety of its drivers is its top priority. In a statement the company says it tells its drivers they \u201cshould avoid reciprocating, including all forms of violence and physical assaults\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve been constantly communicating to our driver-partners to avoid confrontation when attacked, contact Grab call centre and gather evidence for the police as soon as they can.\u201d \u2018The root of the problem is deep\u2019 Following the widely reported case of a Grab driver being stabbed in the face this month, Thailand\u2019s top police general, Chakthip Chaijinda, said the force needed to be better at preventing similar attacks and promised more effective weapons searches at road checkpoints. Meanwhile, with Grab pushing for the DLT to legalise the service, many of its drivers hope that violence will subside when the app becomes official. \u201cSometimes the drivers confronting me say: \u2018Tell Grab to become legal, so I can join!\u2019\u201d Chatchawalamonkul says. Chaleamboon agreed that relations could improve if this happens, but that longer-established turf wars would likely endure. Gang mentalities were, he explains, reinforced by unofficial \u201cboss\u201d drivers running the best pickup locations, demanding payments in addition to official city fees to share spots. These costs motivate many drivers to fervently defend their territory, which has no legally binding demarcation. Chaleamboon says: \u201cThe root of the problem is deep.\u201d On Thursday night Soi Udomsuk is calm, police having closed the pickup spots that were at the centre of the violence on Saturday. But other pickup places were still operating a stone\u2019s throw up the road. One of them was Chaleamboon\u2019s. His location wasn\u2019t as visible as some nearby, but he has no desire to fight for customers. \u201cYou have to live within the rules,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like the mafia.\u201d",

A mass will follow, during which the participants will say a prayer called If you look for miracles. A party labelled Love is all around will take place in the evening.</p> <p>Two hundred people had already registered online for the festival within hours of it being officially announced on Wednesday.</p> <p>Fr Oliviero Svanera, the rector of the basilica, said: \u201cI\u2019m a little worried there won\u2019t be enough room.\u201d</p> <p>This is the second time the friars have organised the event. Although the 2018 edition was more low profile, it brought together two couples. \u201cSo Saint Anthony has already played his part,\u201d Svanera said.</p> <p>The idea came about after Svanera and his fellow friars noticed a growing number of people who had yet to find a partner.</p> <p>\u201cEspecially in the 35-40 age group,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people who are single by choice and who are happy, but there are others who feel the loneliness and would like to meet someone to construct a life with.\u201d</p> <p>Svanera added that other commitments often stop people finding a relationship. \u201cEspecially in Italy, where it takes people a long time to settle \u2013 they feel they have to get a degree and a job before they can do that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>There were 8 million single-person households in Italy in 2017, according to the most recently published data, an increase of 1.5% since 2012.</p> <p>The festival, however, is not just about finding love. \u201cIt\u2019s about socialising and making friends,\u201d Svanera said. \u201cAnd yes, with the hope that Saint Anthony intervenes.\u201d</p>",

The friars at St Anthony\u2019s basilica in the northern Italian city of Padua have organised a festival inspired by the tradition among the faithful in the saint\u2019s homeland of Portugal, as well as Latin America, who invoke his intercession to help them find a life partner. People turn to Saint Anthony to retrieve either lost items, stolen goods or people, but also when in search of love. The event on Saturday \u2013 called Saint Anthony, matchmaker \u2013 is open to singles aged between 20 and 50 and will begin in the afternoon with a meeting to allow people to get to know each other. A mass will follow, during which the participants will say a prayer called If you look for miracles. A party labelled Love is all around will take place in the evening. Two hundred people had already registered online for the festival within hours of it being officially announced on Wednesday. Fr Oliviero Svanera, the rector of the basilica, said: \u201cI\u2019m a little worried there won\u2019t be enough room.\u201d This is the second time the friars have organised the event. Although the 2018 edition was more low profile, it brought together two couples. \u201cSo Saint Anthony has already played his part,\u201d Svanera said. The idea came about after Svanera and his fellow friars noticed a growing number of people who had yet to find a partner. \u201cEspecially in the 35-40 age group,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people who are single by choice and who are happy, but there are others who feel the loneliness and would like to meet someone to construct a life with.\u201d Svanera added that other commitments often stop people finding a relationship. \u201cEspecially in Italy, where it takes people a long time to settle \u2013 they feel they have to get a degree and a job before they can do that,\u201d he said. There were 8 million single-person households in Italy in 2017, according to the most recently published data, an increase of 1.5% since 2012. The festival, however, is not just about finding love. \u201cIt\u2019s about socialising and making friends,\u201d Svanera said. \u201cAnd yes, with the hope that Saint Anthony intervenes.\u201d",

The letter was published in support of a campaign by refugee and asylum seeker-led advocacy organisation, Rise, and signed by more than 219 people including former human rights commissioner Prof Gillian Triggs, and author Prof Tony Birch. It urged vice-chancellor Duncan Maskell to join other institutions in divesting from companies contracted by the Australian government for the assessment and detention of asylum seekers on Manus Island and Nauru. \u201cThere have been countless reports and inquiries regarding the deaths, torture and sexual abuse faced by refugees who have been arbitrarily incarcerated within Australia\u2019s mandatory detention centres,\u201d the letter said. The University of Melbourne had a security contract with Wilson, a company that for many years provided security for Australia\u2019s offshore immigration detention centres on Manus Island and Nauru, and which remains on Nauru, but that contract ended in 2017. A spokesman for the university told Guardian Australia the letter had been received. \u201cThe university\u2019s vice-president (administration and finance) and chief operating officer Allan Tait will be meeting with representatives of the Rise group to discuss the open letter and to understand their concerns,\u201d a spokesman said. The university appeared to be unaware that it no longer had a contract with Wilson. Wilson Security\u2019s website states that the university is one of its \u201ckey clients\u201d. In recent years the National Gallery of Victoria, the University of Newcastle, and the Sydney Biennale have all cut ties with companies contracted to Australia\u2019s offshore immigration system, including Wilson Security and former major contractor Transfield/Broadspectrum. The divestment campaign is spearheaded by Rise, which cites members and governing staff from more than 30 refugee and ex-detainee communities in Australia. \u201cRise strongly disapproves of any refugee movement, organisation, policy or individual that creates and/or supports a refugee scheme to imprison refugees and asylum seekers in detention centres and violates our peoples\u2019 civil rights,\u201d it said. \u201cMany of our members have first-hand experience of the harmful effects of the detention system.\u201d Abdul Baig, spokesman for Rise, said Wilson Security and other contractors should not be able to continue profiting from \u201cactively [choosing] to participate in and enforce our community\u2019s torture and abuse in detention\u201d. \u201cAs ex-detainees, we would like to see educational institutions and public service organisations not to be complicit with any security company such as Wilson Security and Serco, who abuses people in torture camps both offshore and onshore.\u201d The letter noted comments by Maskell in the wake of the Christchurch terror attack, on supporting the values of \u201crespect, diversity and inclusion\u201d. \u201cA crucial part of embodying the aforementioned values is being able to embed these within the university\u2019s organisational structure and contracting choices,\u201d the letter said. \u201cApplying these values involves reconsidering the university\u2019s choice to remain complicit in the refugee industrial complex.\u201d This story was amended on Thursday 5 July to make clear that Wilson Security no longer has a contract with the University of Melbourne.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has stopped short of escalating the worsening standoff with Iran in the Persian Gulf, suggesting that the shooting down of a US drone could have been carried out by a \u201cloose and stupid\u201d Iranian officer without authorisation from Tehran, and emphasising that the aircraft was unmanned. After meeting with his top national security officials to discuss Wednesday night\u2019s downing of a Global Hawk spy drone, the president declared: \u201cI would imagine it was a general or somebody that made a mistake in shooting that drone down. \u201cI find it hard to believe it was intentional if you want to know the truth. I think it could have been somebody who was loose and stupid that did it,\u201d Trump told journalists. \u201cIt was a very foolish move.\u201d Trump reinforced the administration\u2019s red line that it would respond militarily if Iranian forces or proxies harm Americans \u2013 but stressed that was not the case on this occasion. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a man or woman in the drone. It would have made a big, big difference,\u201d Trump said. Asked how the US would respond, he said: \u201cYou\u2019ll find out.\u201d Late on Thursday, the New York Times said Trump had initially approved attacks on a handful of Iranian targets, including radar and missile batteries, before pulling back. Citing officials, the paper said the operation was in its early stages and planes were in the air before it was called off. Later, Iran\u2019s foreign minister and the US military offered competing graphics showing the drone\u2019s flight path and where it was brought down. Javad Zarif said Iran had recovered parts of the drone in its waters and that it had originally taken off from the United Arab Emirates. A map issued by US Central Command suggested the drone was brought down in international waters in the Strait of Hormuz. On Thursday night, Democratic congressional leaders urged Trump to work with US allies. House speaker Nancy Pelosi said the administration should \u201cdo everything in our power to de-escalate\u201d, while Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he worried the administration \u201cmay bumble into a war\u201d. He said he told the president during a classified briefing there must be a \u201crobust, open debate\u201d and Congress should have a real say. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, said: \u201cThe president certainly listened to what we had to say.\u201d Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, said: \u201cThe administration is engaged in what I called measured responses.\u201d Political support for the administration\u2019s Middle East policies is shaky. On Thursday, the Senate voted against the White House\u2019s use of an emergency declaration to sell $8bn to its allies in the Gulf without congressional approval. His critics are unlikely to muster enough senators to overturn the expected presidential veto, but Thursday\u2019s vote was a measure of unease over Trump\u2019s close relationship with the Saudi monarchy. Trump said he was sticking to his promise to extract the US from wars in the Middle East, adding: \u201cBut this is a new wrinkle, a new fly in the ointment what happened, shooting down a drone. And this country will not stand for it, that I can tell you.\u201d Iranian officials have said that the shooting down was a deliberate act and a success of the country\u2019s security forces, but claimed that the aircraft was over Iranian territory. The Iranian ambassador to the UN, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, claimed the aircraft was \u201cin stealth mode as it had turned off its identification equipment and engaged in a clear spying operation\u201d. \u201cWhen the aircraft was returning towards the western parts of the region near the strait of Hormuz, despite repeated radio warnings, it entered into the Iranian airspace,\u201d Ravanchi said in a letter to UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. \u201cThe downing of the American drone was a clear message to America \u2026 our borders are Iran\u2019s red line and we will react strongly against any aggression \u2026 Iran is not seeking war with any country, but we are fully prepared to defend Iran,\u201d the IRGC commander, Hossein Salami, said, according to Iranian media. Trump insisted that the Global Hawk drone was over international waters, saying: \u201cWe have it all documented scientifically, not just words.\u201d The US military said the use of a high-powered anti-aircraft missile against a target in international airspace was a danger to commercial airliners in the region. \u201cThis was an unprovoked attack on a US surveillance asset that had not violated Iranian airspace at any time during its mission,\u201d Gen Joseph Guastella, US Central Command\u2019s top air force commander, told reporters. \u201cThis attack is an attempt to disrupt our ability to monitor the area following recent threats to international shipping and the free flow of commerce,\u201d Guastella said. \u201cThe aircraft was over the strait of Hormuz and fell into international waters.\u201d US officials confirmed the downed aircraft was a US navy Global Hawk surveillance drone, which had been hit by an Iranian surface-to-air missile over the strait of Hormuz at 11.35pm GMT. The $130m (\u00a3102m) Global Hawk is the world\u2019s largest surveillance drone, packed with sophisticated electronics and the size of a small commercial airliner. Iranian forces and allied militias had previously fired at and brought down US Reaper drones, but this is the biggest US target Iran has hit to date, as tensions in the region escalate. Close to the same time as the drone was shot down, Houthi rebels in Yemen, who are backed by Iran, hit a Saudi desalination plant with an apparently sophisticated missile, and there have been a string of rocket and mortar attacks on or close to US facilities in Iraq. On Wednesday the Pentagon confirmed it was sending an additional 1,000 troops to the Gulf in response to two attacks on commercial tankers on 13 June which the US has blamed on Iran\u2019s IRGC. Trump downplayed the tanker attacks as \u201cvery minor\u201d but US officials have made clear to Iran that it would view an attack on its forces by Iran or proxy militias as a threshold for a military response. Iran said the US drone was shot down by the \u201c3rd Khordad\u201d air defence system, which is an Iranian equivalent to the Russian Buk system that downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014. The use of such weapons in an area of crowded skies has underlined the dangers of the standoff in the Gulf spinning out of control. The secretary of Iran\u2019s supreme national security council, Ali Shamkhani, had said on Wednesday that Tehran would respond to any intrusion into its airspace or waters. Shamkhani emphasised that Iran robustly protects its aerial and maritime borders, describing its airspace as the country\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d. \u201cNo matter whose plane trespasses into it, we have always given and will give a harsh response to intruders.\u201d Speaking in London, the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said: \u201cThe international community is determined to push back against Iran\u2019s aggressive behaviour.\u201d Saying steps were being prepared to protect shipping in the Gulf, he added: \u201cFreedom of navigation is essential to global security and the world economy. Any attempt to close the strait of Hormuz will provoke a very strong reaction.\u201d",

That\u2019s, of course, a big if, and at 19 years old he\u2019s somewhat difficult to project, so expect him to be something of a long-term thing for the Pelicans. Which is fine for them considering they\u2019re building for the near-future.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0c23cb8f080e828514c75a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-21T00:24:52.784Z\">1.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HPbasketball/status/1141864168946950144\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pelicans trade down enough times to create a wormhole in time and space <a href=\"https://t.co/XiYd041uDs\">https://t.co/XiYd041uDs</a></p>&mdash; Hardwood Paroxysm (@HPbasketball) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HPbasketball/status/1141864168946950144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 21, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0c232e8f080e828514c758\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-21T00:23:04.492Z\">1.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The New Orleans Pelicans now are going to be picking at number 8 here with the selection they picked up with their earlier trade with the Atlanta Hawks.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0c22d68f080e828514c757\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-21T00:21:55.020Z\">1.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">No. 7.

Over two rounds (of which, we\u2019ll be only covering the first), franchises will select college standouts and hope to find the right pieces to improve their rosters (or package in trades). It\u2019s a bit of a crapshoot, and it takes years before we know whether or not teams have hit the jackpot or if they\u2019ve just set their hard-earned draft picks on fire.</p> <p>Of course, that doesn\u2019t prevent us from judging their selections almost immediately. It\u2019s ridiculous but we do live in the Take Economy. Unfortunately, even the most judgmental of us (this writer included) is going to have trouble declaring winners or losers here given the fact that after the first three selections or so, this is one of the most question-mark filled drafts in recent memory. There are simply not enough known quantities on the board to know if any team is making the right decision here.</p> <p>Unless, of course, the New Orleans Pelicans decide to pass on Duke\u2019s Zion Williamson. That\u2019s about as wrong decision as possible. Chances are that it\u2019s not going to happen as there\u2019s a 99.9% chance that they will choose Williamson to be the successor to Anthony Davis, who they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/16/anthony-davis-trade-la-lakers-lebron-james-nba\">agreed to trade to the Los Angeles Lakers</a> earlier this week.</p> <p>In any case, whatever happens over the course of the next few hours, we\u2019ll be here documenting it.

      "bodyText": "That will do it for the first round of the 2019 NBA Draft. Adam Silver, because he\u2019s the boss, will take his leave and enjoy the second round as a mere spectator. As will we. That will end our liveblog for today, but here\u2019s a complete list of all the first-round selections: 1) Zion Williamson, New Orleans Pelicans 2) Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies 3) RJ Barrett, New York Knicks 4) De\u2019Andre Hunter, Atlanta Hawks 5) Darius Garland, Cleveland Cavaliers 6) Jarrett Culver, Minnesota Timberwolves 7) Coby White, Chicago Bulls 8) Jaxson Hayes, New Orleans Pelicans 9) Rui Hachimura, Washington Wizards 10) Cam Reddish, Atlanta Hawks 11) Cameron Johnson, Phoenix Suns 12) PJ Washington, Charlotte Hornets 13) Tyler Herro, Miami Heat 14) Romeo Langford, Boston Celtics 15) Sekou Doumbouya, Detroit Pistons 16) Chuma Okeke, Orlando Magic 17) Nickeil Alexander-Walker, New Orleans Pelicans 18) Goga Bitadze, Indiana Pacers 19) Luka \u0160amani\u0107, San Antonio Spurs 20) Matisse Thybulle, Boston Celtics 21) Brandon Clarke, Oklahoma City Thunder 22) Grant Williams, Boston Celtics 23) Darius Bazley, Memphis Grizzlies 24) Ty Jerome, Philadelphia 76ers 25) Nassir Little, Portland Trail Blazers 26) Dylan Windler, Cleveland Cavaliers 27) Mfiondu Kabengele, Brooklyn Nets 28) Jordan Poole, Golden State Warriors 29) Keldon Johnson, San Antonio Spurs 30) Kevin Porter Jr, Cleveland Cavaliers Oh hey Kevin Porter Jr was the last remaining player that I had a blurb written about. This works out perfectly: Porter Jr should be one of the top picks in the draft, with a high three-point percentage. Unfortunately, he was suspended during his last semester with USC thanks to off-the-court behavior and has been stuck with the label of having \u201cmaturity issues.\u201d In the right environment, he could be a steal in the draft or he could find his way out of the league. Never mind, the Cleveland Cavaliers have traded up for this pick. That\u2019s a lot of second-rounders. Maybe this is the Bol Bol pick at last? The Detroit Pistons via the Milwaukee Bucks will wrap up a very chaotic first round with the 30th pick. Two more picks here in the first round. Up next is the Spurs, with a pick they received from the Toronto Raptors. They go with Keldon Johnson. From Gorz_EoD Who\u2019s been the biggest steal so far? Who\u2019s the biggest blunder? I (obviously) really liked Brandon Clarke for the Grizzlies at 21. I was really confused with the Rui Hachimora pick for the Wizards. The Warriors pick Jordan Poole, welp my mock draft bracket is busted. Did anybody have him in the first round? The Nets have apparently gotten the 76ers first-round pick in 2020 and the No. 56 pick later tonight. Oh and the Golden State Warriors are on the clock. The Clippers go with Kabengele, who happens to be the nephew of Basketball Hall of Famer Dikembe Mutombo. The Brooklyn Nets fans are getting excited for their pick... it would be a shame if they traded it. Which they do, apparently, to the Los Angeles Clippers. Meanwhile. The Celtics have apparently included the 24th pick in a deal that will send Aron Baynes to the Phoenix Suns in return for future draft considerations. The Celtics are obviously clearing cap space in order to make room for a potential big ticket free agent. The Cleveland Cavaliers have selected Dylan Windler out of Belmont with the 26nd pick in the draft. I was distracted because the Celtics have made yet another move\u2026 The Cleveland Cavaliers are up next with the 26nd pick, which they received from the Houston Rockets. Email from Thomas Ramsey: This seems like it\u2019s gonna go forever. Also who do you reckon will have a great season who is a low prospect. It will go on forever, haha. Just a reminder that we\u2019re only liveblogging the first round here, although I\u2019ll be watching til the bitter end. As far as the players still available, if Kevin Porter Jr can avoid off-the-court controversy and Bol Bol\u2019s game isn\u2019t altered by his foot injury they are clearly the most talented players remaining. These are, of course, huge ifs. The Trail Blazers agree with me, apparently. Everybody had high hopes for Nassir coming into college but he showed them very Little in his one year with North Carolina. A late bloomer, who projects to be a 3-and-D kind of player, he\u2019s had enough defensive and offensive hiccups to call that into question. Man does he look the part of a stud, however. Nassir Little has fallen so far. I\u2019m not really sold on him, but at this point in THIS draft you figure somebody\u2019s going to roll the dice. The Portland Trail Blazers are theoretically on the clock now if they also don\u2019t trade down. JUST KIDDING. The Boston Celtics pick Ty Jerome based on the Philadelphia 76ers pick but they\u2026 have also traded this one down. This time to the Phoenix Suns, apparently. The Boston Celtics are on the clock yet again. This is feeling like Groundhog Day. That\u2019s right \u201cfree agent.\u201d Darius Bazley decided to skip college and just a spent a year training, something that makes him a gigantic question mark for teams since they haven\u2019t seen him in a game in a season. The Utah Jazz have decided it\u2019s worth the risk, an interesting player to keep a track of over the course of his career. If Kyrie Irving does indeed leave Boston, leaving the franchise a mess, this quote will win Williams plenty of love among fans. Okay, NOW the Thunder are on the clock. Lots of reports had the Celtics very high on Grant Williams, so this isn\u2019t a surprise at all. He\u2019s considered a great fit when it comes to modern NBA and has a quality basketball IQ. He doesn\u2019t have the frame that teams tend to like, however, so he might be limited. The Boston Celtics are on the clock again. Maybe they take a flyer on Kevin Porter Jr here? Or do they trade down yet again? I am done guessing at this point. The Thunder pick Brandon Clarke, although they will trade him to the Memphis Grizzlies for the 23rd pick and a 2024 second rounder. The Gonzaga big man averaged 3.1 blocks per game last year which is utterly ridiculous. One of the most impressive defenders in the draft and he might be able to contribute on offense as well. No three-point shot to speak of, however, which is not great. The Oklahoma City Thunder are on the clock for their only pick of the evening. Oh that\u2019s because he\u2019s not going to the Celtics. The Celtics want to maximize their chances of coming up with a decent player in this weak draft by trading him to the Philadelphia 76ers for the 24th and 33rd picks. This is a very weird pick. Thybulle is a great defender but provides very little offense. I\u2019m not sure what Danny Ainge is doing here, but he\u2019ll have the 22nd pick here shortly as well so he\u2019s not done. Best pick ever... The Boston Celtics are on the clock now with their second of three first-round picks, this one courtesy of the Memphis Grizzlies. Maybe now Brandon Clarke? What a surprise, the Spurs have picked an international player that not many people had on their radar around this point. I would question it, but the Spurs are basically beyond questioning when it comes to drafting players from overseas. Twitter is saying that \u201cBol Bol is falling,\u201d when around the 20s is actually starting to be around when teams were expected to start seriously considering him. He looks like he could be fantastic, but he\u2019s a huge injury risk. The San Antoino Spurs are next on the clock and whoever they pick will almost certainly end up being great because that\u2019s how it always goes for San Antonio. The Indiana Pacers select Goga Bitadze from Georgia. No, not the University, the actual country. Most mock drafts had him as the second foreign player to go in the draft and they were right, as he played last year for Buducnost. He also has the best name in the draft. I absolutely love this pick for the Pacers, and not just for the name or because I\u2019m a sucker for international players. The Pelicans pick Nickeil Alexander-Walker who is probably NBA-ready, although he\u2019ll never be an All-Star caliber player. He\u2019s a solid combo guard who can do just about everything rather well. The Pelicans are now going to get the second pick that they got from the Hawks (via the Brooklyn Nets) earlier today. Got all of that? Good. Okeke took a heavy slide after his season ended with an ACL tear. The Magic are making a huge risk-reward gamble here, but hey this is the point in the draft where you start to make those bets. It\u2019s been a rough week for Celtics fans and, unsurprisingly, New York is not entirely sympathetic. Oh and the Orlando Magic are on the clock now. The Pistons choose Duomboya, which means I finally get to use my final pre-written spiel. The best foreign player in the mix, the 18-year-old Doumboya currently plays for Limoges CSP. He\u2019s very young, obviously, and would need some time to adjust not only to the NBA but to a new country, but he\u2019s already shown some defensive flexibility. He can turn over the ball quite a bit and is mistake-prone, but he may be the first player to benefit from how Toronto\u2019s Pascal Siakam opened up the NBA\u2019s eyes last year. We\u2019re officially out of the lottery! The Detroit Pistons are here with the 15th pick. The Celtics select Romeo Langford who, despite the fact that I spent literally the last few weeks just focused on the Celtics\u2019 drafting, I know nothing about. He didn\u2019t show up in any pre-draft workouts due to injury, which is not a great sign. Considering that Kyrie Irving is probably gone, they did need a guard. The Miami Heat pick Tyler Herror. Something of a reach, I could have seen Herro easily falling out of the lottery. He\u2019s a quality shooter though and that\u2019s a trait that\u2019s always in high demand. Quality last name too. Some history being made tonight: The Miami Heat are on the clock now. The Celtics fan in me is screaming anybody but Clarke right now. And whither France\u2019s Sekou Doumboya, who I had going in the Top 10? The Hornets take P.J. Washington who improved dramatically during his sophomore year but really might not have the upside or skill to be anything other than a solid role-player. Maybe not a bust, but perhaps not a guy either. That sounds very Hornets. Charlotte Hornets are on the clock with the number 12 pick. We\u2019re officially in on man\u2019s land here as far I\u2019m concerned. Maybe Gonzaga\u2019s Brandon Clarke, just to annoy the Boston Celtics who are probably now hoping he falls to them at No. 14? The Suns will be receiving, via Minnesota, Cam Jordan at number 11. I also did not have him this high. I guess we\u2019re having a run on Cams here. He\u2019s apparently impressed teams with his shooting, including from long distance. The Timberwolves will now be picking for the Suns for the 11th pick of the draft. Yes I know this gets a little convoluted. The Hawks go with Cam Reddish and number 10. It might be an interesting pick but it might depend on how hard Reddish works to become the best version of himself. Reddish had a disappointing Duke career, particularly when compared to Williamson and Barrett, his field goal shooting was particularly poor, and has been labeled something of a slow learner. Still, there\u2019s plenty of talent here, he has all the traits to be a difference-making scorer. He\u2019s 6\u20198\u201d with a 7\u20190\u201d wingspan and if he can learn to harness that at the NBA level he\u2019s going to make the teams that have passed up on him regret it. Chauncey Billups just compared Hachimora to Kawhi Leonard. Okay. The Hawks have another pick here, they received it from the Dallas Mavericks And, okay, I didn\u2019t have Rui Hachimora in my Top 10 so I don\u2019t have a long piece on him. The junior has the capacity to be a scorer, but the Japanese native started late and will take time to develop. The Washington Wizards are on the clock with the ninth pick. Okay, that\u2019s not Cam Reddish. The Pelicans decide to add Jaxon Hayes to their mix. The 6-foot-11 big man, who doubled as a wide receiver in high school, shot nearly 73% from the field in Texas in limited usage and was 74% from the free throw line. If he finds a three-point shot, he could be absolutely deadly. That\u2019s, of course, a big if, and at 19 years old he\u2019s somewhat difficult to project, so expect him to be something of a long-term thing for the Pelicans. Which is fine for them considering they\u2019re building for the near-future. The New Orleans Pelicans now are going to be picking at number 8 here with the selection they picked up with their earlier trade with the Atlanta Hawks. It is indeed Coby White at number seven. The speedy freshman already has an NBA three-point range and was an 80% free throw shooter. Those tend to be skills that translate fairly well at an NBA level. He might be the best offensive point guard in the mix, although he\u2019s not the purest of playmakers. His impressive field goal shooting might take a hit when he\u2019s going up against NBA defenders. I\u2019m going to go ahead and guess that North Carolina point guard Coby White is heading to Chicago. Then, probably, Cam Reddish at number eight? And then after that I have no idea. But that\u2019s what makes it fun. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t follow Woj, he just spoils things. Okay, also because he blocked me a long time ago, but mostly the first thing. The Chicago Bulls, once again, are on the clock with the No. 7 pick. And there\u2019s Jarrett Culver, he\u2019ll be going to the Timberwolves at number six. The 6-foot-7 Culver managed to be the best scorer and passer on his Texas Tech team. He\u2019s the type of player who can potentially run an offense. He\u2019s not much of an outside shooter, however, which could limit his professional game and he\u2019s going to have to start cutting back on shooting from the midrange. A solid defender, even if there are questions about his frame going forward. Do we have our first official \u201cslipping\u201d candidate of the draft in Texas Tech\u2019s Jarrett Culver? Plenty of mock drafts had him going at Number 4. Or will we see him at Number 6. The Minnesota Timberwolves will be making the selection after today\u2019s trade with the Phoenix Suns trade. Just ignore the insignia on the hat. The Cleveland Cavaliers choose Darius Garland out of Vanderbilt. Darius Garland is a risky proposition since we have just five games for Vanderbilt is in his one and only season at college. While that torn meniscus is a question, not to mention his skinny frame, he\u2019s a flashy scorer who has earned comparisons to Damian Lillard. He\u2019s super fast and can also make a well-timed pass when necessary. Gotta love the scenes of college players wearing the hats of teams that everybody in the world knows they will never play for. The Cleveland Cavaliers, choosing for themselves, are up next. The \u201cLos Angeles Lakers\u201d pick De\u2019Andre Hunter at number four, but it\u2019s really the Atlanta Hawks selection. Not a sexy pick, and thus maybe the definitive Hawks pick, but the defensive-minded sophomore should have very little time adjusting to the NBA. He\u2019s a classic 3-and-D prospect who hit an impressive 48.35 from the three-point range last year with Virginia. He doesn\u2019t quite have the upside of many of his peers this high on the draft board but there\u2019s something be said about reliability when there aren\u2019t a lot of sure-things on the table here. Zion Williamson had a tearful interview that has already gone viral. It\u2019s hard not to root for this kid. The Atlanta Hawks, confusingly enough, are on the clock now. They have the number four pick, thanks to their earlier trade with the Pelicans, who received it from the Los Angeles Lakers. The Knicks go the obvious route with R.J. Barrett. Not really another choice here. The home town crowd strongly approves. Barrett might not be as flashy as Williamson or Morant, but he\u2019s proven winner who has been a high school champion and helped Canada win the FIBA World Cup. He averaged 22 points, seven rebounds and four assists per game while playing for Duke. He\u2019s still just coming off a freshman campaign, so he will require further development to get the most out of his talent. New York Knicks are on the clock now. As per usual, the Onion has come up with the pitch-perfect headline for this star-crossed franchise: With the second overall pick, the Grizzlies do indeed choose Ja Morant. One of the best pure shot-creators on the board. Morant emerged as the clear-cut number two player in this draft thanks to his excellent sophomore season with Murray State, which included a head-turning triple-double display in the NCAA Tournament in a win over Marquette. He does have an issue with turnovers, probably needs to add some weight and could need to work on his jump shot to succeed. The Memphis Grizzlies are now on the clock with the number two pick. I would bet literally everything in my bank account* that it\u2019s Murray State guard Ja Morant. *Note: this is not a lot of money. The Pelicans, as expected, select Zion Williamson with the first overall pick. They decide to take the full five minutes, however, just to tease all of the reporters on tight deadlines. Potentially the most talented player to appear in the NBA Draft since, well, Anthony Davis. Williamson brings both size and skill to the table and is a two-way player who should already be capable of contributing both offensively and defensively (that 70.8% field goal percentage certainly does jump out). There are no sure things when it comes to drafting players out of college but man does Williamson come close. The only serious question might be health, as he has suffered foot and MCL injuries in the past. Adam Silver steps up and starts things up, congratulating the Toronto Raptors (to a decidedly mixed reaction from the New York crowd). He highlights that they were truly an international team and that they won without a lottery pick, emphasizing that it doesn\u2019t matter where a player gets picked. Of course, it does. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here. The New Orleans Pelicans are on the clock. They will have five minutes, they won\u2019t need all of them. We\u2019re getting closer to the actual start of the Draft here, about five minutes or so. I suppose unlike most drafts there\u2019s not a lot of suspense here early on. We\u2019re just waiting for Zion\u2019s name to be called, really, but the later picks are going to be filled with surprises. Because of that, the Draft have brought in a record number of picks to Barclays Center tonight. over twenty players and their families. While Bol Bol might be falling down draft boards thanks to injury concerns, it\u2019s hard to draft a big man coming off a foot injury after all, but he should already be a lock for Best Dressed of the Draft. While Bol Bol might be falling down draft boards thanks to injury concerns, it\u2019s hard to draft a big man coming off a foot injury after all, but he should already be a lock for Best Dressed of the Draft. Maybe the biggest competition tonight will be as reporters Adrian Wojnarowski and Shams Charania are battling the league and each other in order to spoil as many picks as possible on Twitter before NBA Commissioner Adam Silver officially makes the announcements. This however, will remain a spoiler-free zone. Also we have a report that the Minnesota Timberwolves have traded up for the number six pick, trading Dario Saric and the number 11 pick to the Phoenix Suns. The Suns also traded the number 32 pick and TJ Warren to the Indiana Pacers for cash earlier today, so they\u2019re essentially swapping Warren for Saric. Okay that\u2019s not a great precedent. No, they\u2019re keeping the number one pick, don\u2019t be silly. Instead, the Pelicans will receive the No. 8, 17 &amp; 35 picks from the Atlanta Hawks, who will pick up the No. 4 &amp; 57 pick along with Solomon Hill and a future second-rounder. Basically, they are trading the biggest pick they received from the Lakers in the Antonio Davis trade and doubling up on their first-round picks tonight. Not a bad trade considering that after the Top Three, there are not a lot of certainties here and Hill was taking up $12.7 million next season. The Hawks clearly have someone they like there at number four (De\u2019Andre Hunter is the rumor). Welcome to the 2019 NBA Draft, where teams select the stars, role players and (sadly) busts of the future. Over two rounds (of which, we\u2019ll be only covering the first), franchises will select college standouts and hope to find the right pieces to improve their rosters (or package in trades). It\u2019s a bit of a crapshoot, and it takes years before we know whether or not teams have hit the jackpot or if they\u2019ve just set their hard-earned draft picks on fire. Of course, that doesn\u2019t prevent us from judging their selections almost immediately. It\u2019s ridiculous but we do live in the Take Economy. Unfortunately, even the most judgmental of us (this writer included) is going to have trouble declaring winners or losers here given the fact that after the first three selections or so, this is one of the most question-mark filled drafts in recent memory. There are simply not enough known quantities on the board to know if any team is making the right decision here. Unless, of course, the New Orleans Pelicans decide to pass on Duke\u2019s Zion Williamson. That\u2019s about as wrong decision as possible. Chances are that it\u2019s not going to happen as there\u2019s a 99.9% chance that they will choose Williamson to be the successor to Anthony Davis, who they agreed to trade to the Los Angeles Lakers earlier this week. In any case, whatever happens over the course of the next few hours, we\u2019ll be here documenting it. If you\u2019d like to contribute to the liveblog, feel free to send us your thoughts, predictions, hopes and analysis either via email (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or Twitter (to @HunterFelt). The ESPN broadcast is about to start here at 7:00pm EST, but it will likely be a bit before teams start making their selections. Hunter will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s a look at the order for tonight\u2019s first round. New Orleans Pelicans Memphis Grizzlies New York Knicks New Orleans Pelicans (from LA Lakers) Cleveland Cavaliers Phoenix Suns Chicago Bulls Atlanta Hawks Washington Wizards Atlanta Hawks (from Dallas) Minnesota Timberwolves Charlotte Hornets Miami Heat Boston Celtics (from Sacramento via Philadelphia) Detroit Pistons Orlando Magic Atlanta Hawks (from Brooklyn) Indiana Pacers San Antonio Spurs Boston Celtics (from LA Clippers via Memphis) Oklahoma City Thunder Boston Celtics Memphis Grizzlies (from Utah) Philadelphia 76ers Portland Trail Blazers Cleveland Cavaliers (from Houston) Brooklyn Nets (from Denver) Golden State Warriors San Antonio Spurs (from Toronto) Detroit Pistons (from Milwaukee)",

      "bodyText": "As children bouncing between Sydney hotel and motel rooms at the whim of heroin-addicted parents, Marcus Bridge and his younger sister saw and felt depths of suffering no one should. They were depths from which their father would never return \u2013 and Bridge, now 27, is hellbent on turning his traumatic past into something positive. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to tell this story,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI think the other guys in the band knew that.\u201d Bridge\u2019s band, Northlane, has reached heights enjoyed by few Australian heavy acts, winning two Arias and selling out countless shows. Their experimental metalcore features sprawling soundscapes and dense breakdowns, alongside abstract, forward-thinking lyrics. But for their fifth album Alien \u2013 Bridge\u2019s third, after joining Northlane in 2014 \u2013 the band and its frontman are ready to tell a more personal story: of addiction, domestic violence and childhood abuse. In his early teens, Bridge says, he was under the guardianship of his father and subjected to verbal and physical abuse by him. At the age of 19, he was living with his grandparents on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches when he learned that his dad had died after an overdose. \u201cI thought you were dreaming / eyes rolled to the stars,\u201d he recalls in Bloodline, the first single from Alien \u2013 and the first song written for the album. Ties with his motherwere severed. Of his relationship with her, Bridge has said: \u201cEven though [she\u2019s] still here, I\u2019ve already said goodbye.\u201d Bloodline\u2019s video clip is set in a squalid room with a filthy mattress and ragged curtains \u2013 an eerily accurate depiction of the places Bridge stayed throughout his childhood. \u201cI was raised in hell / I made it out by myself,\u201d he sings. He found the shoot confronting. \u201cGoing to that house and walking into that scene was like walking into a time capsule,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s something I didn\u2019t anticipate \u2013 I didn\u2019t think was going to happen like that. \u201cActually being there, and seeing it, and being in that environment really took me back. I\u2019ve only watched the video once or twice since it\u2019s been out, because it\u2019s a bit too much.\u201d When Bridge was just seven, a man broke down the door of a Kings Cross motel, stormed in and levelled a gun at his dad. \u201c\u2018Please don\u2019t kill me in the face of my son and daughter,\u2019 I still hear them screaming,\u201d he sings in the album track Freefall. Sleepless, meanwhile, is a shattering depiction of their mother\u2019s inability to prevent Bridge\u2019s sister from succumbing to substance abuse herself. (His sister is now clean and the pair are close.) These are harrowing stories, even in short form, but Bridge says while society is slowly becoming more open to discussions of domestic violence, childhood domestic violence remains in the shadows. \u201cIt\u2019s often masked with metaphor, or presented in the least offensive way it can be,\u201d he says.

      "bodyText": "Psychologists say it may be harder for defence force personnel to seek counselling when Bupa takes over the armed forces healthcare contract from July and reduces the fees paid to them for consultations. The news comes amid growing concern about the alarming rates of mental illness and suicide among defence veterans. The former defence minister Christopher Pyne announced in January that Bupa would replace Medibank as the Australian defence force\u2019s healthcare contractor from 1 July. Bupa has subcontracted Victorian Counselling and Psychological Services to provide mental healthcare to serving defence personnel nationally. An Australian Capital Territory-based private psychologist, who has 50 defence personnel on his books, said the transition from Medibank to Bupa \u201cwas a complete mess\u201d and there had been little proactive communication from Bupa or VCPS. The psychologist, who asked not to be named, said that while he had received a new contract after much wrangling, many of his colleagues were still in the dark about the revised arrangements. There is a huge disparity in payment levels for psychologists depending on whether a patient is a federal public servant covered under the commonwealth workplace safety regulator Comcare scheme, a serving member of the defence force or a veteran. \u201cIf I see a public servant with a paper cut I get paid 210 bucks, and if I see a [soldier] who has been to Afghanistan and has post-traumatic stress disorder I get paid $164 and if they have left the army [and have veteran status] I get paid $120,\u201d the psychologist said. \u201cIt has always been more challenging for defence members to find psychs that would accept the low rate.\u201d Psychologists fear further cuts slated under the new fee structure will undermine an already difficult situation. \u201cI\u2019m torn, I really want to keep seeing \u2026 defence clients but I feel like saying, \u2018No, go away, Bupa,\u2019 because I don\u2019t want to do it for less money,\u201d the ACT psychologist said. Scores of defence personnel are grappling with war-related trauma, depression and anxiety. The waiting lists in Canberra can vary from one to three months. There are 9,364 Australian defence force personnel, including reservists based in the capital. It is understood the previous fee structure will be retained for existing clients to ensure that psychologists do not abandon those patients. The ACT psychologist said VCPS was insisting that psychologists use their system for administration and bookings, which meant running two separate lots of books and an increased risk of errors. Psychologists are also upset by demands from VCPS that they seek blanket consent from all defence personnel clients for access to clinical notes. Under the Australian Psychological Society\u2019s code of ethics, there is a confidentiality obligation that can be broken only through a court subpoena or if a client consents. The Australia Defence Association\u2019s executive director, Neil James, said this was the third time the defence health contract had changed hands since 2012, and each time there had been enormous problems. \u201cThey keep taking the lowest tender without adequate thought to the quality of care,\u201d James said. \u201cBupa is obviously trying to maximise its profit margins by screwing the psychologists.\u201d A VCPS spokeswoman referred Guardian Australia to Bupa for comment. A Bupa spokeswoman said overall preparation for the defence health contract takeover was \u201cprogressing well\u201d. \u201cWe are confident of a smooth transition,\u201d she said. \u201cVCPS has secured a comprehensive network of psychologists and will be able to deliver a seamless service to Defence.\u201d Asked about the fee cut for psychologists, she said: \u201cThe new arrangement with Defence has adopted different service items and consultation times and the fees have changed accordingly.\u201d The Bupa spokeswoman said psychologists had been requested to obtain consent to access clinical reports for the \u201cpurposes of clinical governance, quality and professional supervision, however, this is not a requirement and Defence clients are at complete liberty to withhold consent\u201d. Bupa, a health, insurance and nursing home business that is headquartered in London, has been in the line of fire of the royal commission into aged care. There are nine Bupa nursing homes nationally that have been sanctioned \u2013 they cannot take new residents or receive federal government funding. A resident at Bupa\u2019s nursing home in Eden, New South Wales, was admitted to hospital this year with maggots in a head wound. The company has also been in trouble with the Australian Taxation Office. A spokeswoman for the defence personnel minister, Darren Chester, said the department had undertaken a value-for-money assessment that had considered the price, technical solution and risk of each proposal during the tender process. \u201cDefence is committed to providing a high-quality health service in a timely manner and in a way that supports continuity of care for the patient,\u201d she said. Defence was not privy to the commercial arrangements between Bupa and its subcontractors, she said. \u201cDefence is confident in Bupa\u2019s ability to provide a sufficient network of skilled psychologists to deliver high-quality, timely and clinically appropriate services to Defence members.\u201d \u2022 Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636",

      "bodyText": "The Democrat-controlled house judiciary committee has released a 273-page transcript of frustrated efforts to interrogate Hope Hicks, a former top White House adviser, during a closed-door hearing on Wednesday. The session transcript reveals a seven-hour exercise in prevarication as White House lawyers steered Hicks away from answering questions 155 times. Lawyers prevented Hicks, who previously served as Donald Trump\u2019s White House communications director, from answering a range of questions from the mundane \u2013 \u201cWhere in the West Wing did you sit in relation to the Oval Office?\u201d \u2013 to more substantial inquiries about the resignation of the former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Trump\u2019s firing of James Comey, the the former FBI director. In a rare exception, Hicks, 30, did allow that she viewed Trump\u2019s order to his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to urge Jeff Sessions to \u201cunrecuse\u201d himself from the Russia investigation as \u201codd\u201d. Asked if she would take foreign opposition research from a foreign government, \u201cif that were offered when working on a political campaign\u201d, Hicks responded: \u201cYou know, knowing how much chaos has been sowed as a result of something like the Steele dossier, no, I would not.\u201d She added that she would call the FBI if she was offered information that she felt was \u201clegitimate enough to have our law enforcement dedicate their time to it, sure\u201d. Hicks also said she\u2019s has only spoken to Trump between five and 10 times since she left the White House in February 2018. But those were rare comments in a hearing that the White House has described as a violation of constitutional law separating the legislative and executive branches of government. Administration lawyers argue that Hicks was granted \u201cabsolutely immune\u201d from discussing her time working at the White House, a situation that the committee chairman Jerrold Nadler described as \u201cridiculous\u201d and one which Democrats have vowed to challenge through the courts.

      "bodyText": "The Georgian president, Salome Zurabishvili, has blamed Russia for violence in country\u2019s capital, calling it \u201can enemy and occupier\u201d whose \u201cfifth column\u201d was behind the unrest. Zurabishvili\u2019s comments, issued in a statement, followed violent scenes in the Tbilisi after police used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon to stop crowds from storming the parliament building. The clashes, which Moscow blamed on radical Georgian political forces whom it accused of propagating anti-Russian sentiment, left dozens injured. Thirty-nine police officers and 30 civilians had been treated in hospital for injuries after the clashes, with the number likely to rise, said David Sergeenko, an adviser to the prime minister. Thousands had rallied through the night outside the building in the centre of the capital, Tbilisi, after a Russian MP was allowed to chair a session of parliament on Thursday. The outcry began after Russian MP Sergei Gavrilov took the chair\u2019s seat during an assembly of legislators from Orthodox Christian countries being held in Tbilisi. As news of Gavrilov\u2019s appearance began to circulate, a crowd gathered outside parliament, and by late evening, about 10,000 people were massed outside the building, waving Georgian flags, chanting and later on, attempting to breach the lines of riot police and storm the building. Riot shields and body armour seized from police were passed through the crowds and at one point an injured policeman was dragged to an ambulance by protesters. Georgia and Russia fought a war in 2008, after which Russia recognised two breakaway Georgian regions, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, as independent states. Georgia and most of the international community considers the territories de facto occupied by Russia. The appearance of a Russian MP who has backed independence for the two territories, sitting in the seat of the parliamentary chair and speaking in Russian, caused outrage in Georgia. Some protesters carried abusive signs about Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. Georgian billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, former prime minister and leader of the ruling Georgian Dream party, said in a statement that he \u201cfully shares the sincere outrage of the Georgian citizens\u201d. Former president Mikheil Saakashvili, who now has Ukrainian citizenship and faces criminal charges in Georgia, called on police to join with the protesters. Saakashvili, who has embarked on a political career in Ukraine, has said the Georgian accusations against him are political revenge and has accused Ivanishvili, who made his billions in Russia, of allowing increasing Kremlin influence in Georgia. The protests come after a year of increasingly polarised politics in Georgia, with frustrations over the ruling Georgian Dream party mounting, and the incident with the Russian MP merely proving the final straw. Police fired tear gas canisters into the crowd at regular intervals for hours on end, sending people fleeing to adjacent streets, only to return. Later, in the early hours of Friday, they used rubber bullets and water cannon. By 3am local time, hundreds of police had cordoned off the area around parliament, but a crowd of a few thousand protesters remained, lobbing projectiles and in one case smashing the windows of a police car. The US embassy in Tbilisi in a statement: \u201cWe understand the frustrations that many people are feeling today, and we call on all sides to remain calm, exercise restraint, and act only within the framework of the constitution.\u201d Russian state Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin accused Georgia of failing to uphold the norms of international conventions. \u201cThey could neither provide security at the event, nor protect the Russian delegation from attacks and threats,\u201d he told the Russian news agency Interfax.",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re ending our live coverage for the day, thanks for tuning in! Some key links and updates from the day: Disgraced Alabama Republican Roy Moore has announced he is running for US Senate again in 2020 after failing to win the seat two years ago amid sexual misconduct accusations. Joe Biden continued to deal with the fallout from his latest gaffe in which he discussed his cordial relationship with segregationists early in his career. Trump stopped short of escalating the worsening standoff with Iran in the Persian Gulf, suggesting that the shooting down of a US drone could have been carried out by a \u201cloose and stupid\u201d Iranian officer without authorization from Tehran. The Senate passed a bill that would stop arms sales to the Saudi government over the administration\u2019s objections. A legal team that recently interviewed more than 60 children at a Border Patrol facility in Texas said infants, children and teens have been locked up for up to 27 days without adequate food, water and sanitation. There were a number of new calls for an impeachment inquiry from Democratic members of Congress. The House Judiciary released a transcript of its interview with Hope Hicks, the former Trump confidante, revealing the repeated objections of the White House during her questioning. The National Rifle Association sued its former president, Oliver North. A federal appeals court ruled that new rules from the Trump administration restricting abortion access can take effect while a legal battle over the policy moves forward. Some politics news outside of DC: In Oregon, all 12 Republican state senators literally fled the capitol today to delay a vote on a clean energy bill. The state\u2019s Democratic governor responded by dispatching state troopers to retrieve the Republicans and get the legislative session back on track. The Guardian\u2019s Susie Cagle reports: Senate Republican leader Herman Baertschiger Jr wrote in a statement that the walk-out was \u201cexactly how we should be doing our job\u201d. In a speech on the Senate floor, a visibly frustrated Senate president Peter Courtney begged his colleagues to return. \u201cThis is the saddest day of my legislative life,\u201d he said. If passed into law, the clean energy jobs bill would place a cap on emissions from power, transportation and other industries in the state, and establish a system to auction and trade them. The program would begin in 2021, with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 45% of 1990 carbon levels by 2035, and 20% of 1990 levels by 2050. Full story here: New rules from the Trump administration restricting abortion access can take effect while a legal battle over the policy moves forward, a federal appeals court ruled today. From AP: The rules ban taxpayer-funded clinics from making abortion referrals and prohibit clinics that receive federal money from sharing office space with abortion providers \u2014 a rule critics said would force many to find new locations, undergo expensive remodels or shut down. More than 20 states and several civil rights and health organizations challenged the rules in cases filed in Oregon, Washington and California. Judges in all three states blocked the rules from taking effect, with Oregon and Washington courts issuing nationwide injunctions. One called the new policy \u201cmadness\u201d and said it was motivated by \u201can arrogant assumption that the government is better suited to direct women\u2019s health care than their providers.\u201d Planned Parenthood said it would ask the federal appeals court to reconsider the decision, which affects Title X, a 1970 law that improved access to family planning services. Here\u2019s the response from Dr Leana Wen, president of the Planned Parenthood: Some background on the original rule here: House Republicans have released a statement on their meeting with Trump and have called for a \u201cmeasured response\u201d to Iran. They said the president and his national security team \u201cremain clear-eyed on the situation and what must be done\u201d: The backstory here: Joe Biden has called Cory Booker to \u201ctry to smooth over tensions\u201d, the New York Times reports: A Booker spokesperson said of the call with Biden: Cory shared directly what he said publicly \u2014 including helping Vice President Biden understand why the word \u2018boy\u2019 is painful to so many. Cory believes that Vice President Biden should take responsibility for what he said and apologize to those who were hurt. It appears Biden has not apologized. The controversy started when Biden spoke at a Wall Street fundraiser about \u201ccivility:\u201d and how he previously worked with segregationists in the Senate even though he disagreed with them. More on the background here: Alabama Senator Doug Jones has released a statement on the news that his previous competitor, disgraced Republican Roy Moore, is running again for Senate: Today, Roy Moore has made what was already going to be a divisive Republican primary even more polarizing and extreme. We don\u2019t need any more of that. Worse, it\u2019s now clear that my opponent will either be an extremist like Roy Moore or someone handpicked by Mitch McConnell to be his Senator, not Alabama\u2019s. The only question left is who will be McConnell\u2019s choice? I want to talk to Alabamians about solutions to improve all of our lives, address very real health care concerns, better education, strengthen our security, both militarily and economically, and help attract more businesses to our state. It comes down to solving problems, not divisive partisanship or extreme ideas that do nothing for Alabama families.\u201d The National Rifle Association\u2019s ongoing internal drama has escalated, this time with a lawsuit against the group\u2019s former president. From the AP: The National Rifle Association has sued its former president, Oliver North, for what it called \u201cconduct harmful to the NRA\u201d. The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in New York. It sought a judge\u2019s declaration that the NRA isn\u2019t required to pay North\u2019s legal bills. North stepped down from the post in April. The lawsuit said he \u201cdeparted office after a widely publicized, failed coup attempt\u201d. The suit also accused top NRA official Chris Cox of conspiring with North to oust the organization\u2019s chief executive, Wayne LaPierre. Some context on the recent NRA troubles: Some initial analysis on the Hope Hicks interview transcript \u2013 it appears the White House intervened to block her from answer questions more than 150 times: Then there was this exchange: The House Judiciary has just released a transcript of the interview with Hope Hicks, the former White House communications director and longtime Trump confidante. Read it here: Here\u2019s a look at how some Republican politicians are responding to the news that disgraced Alabama Republican Roy Moore is running again for Senate. A reminder of the sexual misconduct and abuse allegations that led him to lose the Senate race two years ago: During the 2017 race, six women accused Moore of pursuing romantic or sexual relationships with them when they were teenagers as young as 14 and he was an assistant district attorney in his 30s. Two accused him of assault or molestation. Our full story: There have been a number of new calls for an impeachment inquiry from Democratic members of Congress today: Hello - Sam Levin here in the San Francisco office, taking over our live coverage for the rest of the day. A legal team that recently interviewed more than 60 children at a Border Patrol facility in Texas has described a traumatic and dangerous situation, according to a new AP report: The lawyers said roughly 250 infants, children and teens have been locked up for up to 27 days without adequate food, water and sanitation. Some more disturbing details: A team of attorneys who recently visited the facility near El Paso told the AP that three girls, ages 10 to 15, said they had been taking turns keeping watch over a sick 2-year-old boy because there was no one else to look after him. When the lawyers saw the 2-year-old boy, he wasn\u2019t wearing a diaper and had wet his pants, and his shirt was smeared in mucus. They said at least 15 children at the facility had the flu, and some were kept in medical quarantine. Children told lawyers that they were fed uncooked frozen food or rice and had gone weeks without bathing or a clean change of clothes at the facility in Clint, in the desert scrubland some 25 miles southeast of El Paso. Holly Cooper, an attorney who represents detained youth, said: In my 22 years of doing visits with children in detention I have never heard of this level of inhumanity.\u201d Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to the allegations about the conditions, the AP reported. That\u2019s it for me today. Before I pass the blog to my esteemed colleague Sam Levin on the west coast, here\u2019s a quick recap of what you may have missed today. Roy Moore, the hard-right 2017 failed Senate candidate has announced he\u2019s running again in 2020- with no support to be found in the party establishment. Gaffe-prone Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden continues to deal with the fallout from his latest gaffe in which he, voluntarily, and with no prompting from anyone else, brought up his cordial relationship with segregationists early in his career. Trump seemed to downplay any retaliation with Iran for the shooting down of a US drone overnight, suggesting that it may have even been a mistake. The Senate passed a bill that would stop arms sales to the Saudi government over the administration\u2019s objections but does not currently have the votes to overcome a Trump veto, which the president has threatened. Huffington Post reporter Kevin Robillard had some interesting Democratic horserace numbers from the latest Suffolk poll. Unsurprisingly, it contains bad news for NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled on Thursday that he and his allies in the GOP establishment will actively work to oppose Roy Moore\u2019s bid for Alabama\u2019s Senate seat. \u201cHe can do what he wants to, but we\u2019re certainly going to oppose him in every way,\u201d McConnell told the Associated Press shortly before Moore\u2019s announcement. Donald Trump Jr also jumped into the fray, by implying that Moore had jumped into the race contrary to the president\u2019s wishes. Federal prosecutors say that former Trump confidant and current federal defendant Roger Stone violated a gag order with recent social media posts, according to multiple reports. In January the longtime GOP operative was charged with witness tampering, obstructing an official proceeding, and five counts of making false statements. He is currently awaiting trial. Cory Booker announced Thursday, that if elected president he would \u201cimmediately\u201d start the clemency process for some 17,000 federal inmates serving time on drug-related charges. Booker would essentially be using executive power to do what the First Step act, passed last year, declined to do - make sentencing reform retroactive so it applies both to people currently in jail and future criminal defendants. In the last day, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have both come out and offered some level of support for the decriminalization of sex work, reports Vice: Less than 24 hours after Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would be \u201copen\u201d to decriminalizing sex work, the Bernie Sanders campaign told VICE the candidate believes it\u2019s a policy that \u201cshould be considered.\u201d \u201cBernie believes that decriminalization is certainly something that should be considered,\u201d Deputy Communications Director Sarah Ford said in an email Thursday morning. \u201cOther countries have done this and it has shown to make the lives of sex workers safer.\u201d Warren said Wednesday that: I\u2019m open to decriminalization. Sex workers, like all workers, deserve autonomy but they are particularly vulnerable to physical and financial abuse and hardship,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe need to make sure that we don\u2019t undermine legal protections for the most vulnerable, including the millions of individuals who are victims of human trafficking each year.\u201d Alabama Roy Moore has made his candidacy for the 2020 Senate seat in that state official, announcing moments ago. \u201cYes, I will run for the United States Senate in 2020,\u201d Moore said. \u201cCan I win? Yes, I can win.\u201d His opening remarks make it clear he intends to run as an outsider from his own party, which largely abandoned him after the allegations that dogged his 2017 candidacy emerged. Moore is also blaming the NRSC for Donald Trump\u2019s opposition to his candidacy, reports the Montgomery Advertiser\u2019s Brian Lyman. \u201cI think he\u2019s being pushed by the NRSC. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking. I can\u2019t speak for him. But I can say I don\u2019t disagree with him in lots of his policies,\u201d Moore said. California Senator and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris penned an op-ed for NBC News Thursday asking Americans generally, and Donald Trump specifically, to watch Ava DuVernay\u2019s new Netflix series on the Central Park Five. The plea comes just a few days after Trump told reporters that he would not apologize to the five Black men he demonized in 1989 after they were accused of a violent rape they did not commit. Trump infamously took out full-page ads in four New York newspapers advocating that the state reinstate capital punishment so that it could execute the boys, who were coerced into admitting their guilt. The five were exonerated in 2002 after another man admitted to committing the crime and DNA evidence corroborated his account. Harris, a former prosecutor writes: DuVernay\u2019s retelling of the case is a masterpiece. Her four-part series tells the stories of Korey Wise, Raymond Santana, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson and Yusef Salaam. In 1989, these five young boys were wrongfully accused of brutally raping a jogger in Central Park. The series chronicles their unjust detainment, illegal interrogation and the dismissal of evidence that pointed to their innocence, further highlighting the flaws in a system that is supposed to be rooted in truth and justice. Systemic biases and racism cost these boys their childhood. Sensationalized media coverage \u2014 including a 1989 full-page ad placed by Trump \u2014 made it almost impossible for them to be treated fairly. And the trial also exposed the dehumanization of Black children and life-threatening consequences \u2014 things that still occur today. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff wants to make it \u201ccrystal clear\u201d that accepting help or \u201cdirt\u201d from a foreign agent is illegal with a new bill proposal. This is something Donald Trump has repeatedly said, most recently in an interview with ABC News, that he would do. A number of high profile celebrities joined together for a video editorial that describes the Mueller report as \u201cthe most damming evidence ever compiled against a sitting US president.\u201d The video, released by Now This News also excoriated AG William Barr for having \u201clie[d] about its contents\u201d and Trump for echoing that \u201cpropaganda.\u201d The stars include: Robert De Niro Martin Sheen Christine Lahti Laurence Fishburne Stephen King Sophia Bush Jonathan Van Ness Rob Reiner George Takei Rosie Perez Kendrick Sampson The Wall Street Journal is reporting that President Trump plans to issue an executive order on Monday to compel the disclosure of prices in health care. According to people familiar with the matter, the order will direct federal agencies to initiate regulations and guidance that could require insurers, doctors, hospitals and others in the industry to provide information about the negotiated and often discounted cost of care. According to the Journal, Advocates say that consumers and employers \u201cwill benefit because pulling back the secrecy around the prices will allow them to shop for lower cost care and benefits.\u201d Industry groups including hospitals and insurers have balked at the idea however, saying \u201cit could cause costs to climb if some businesses learn competitors are getting bigger discounts. They also say consumers really want to know their own out-of-pocket costs and won\u2019t benefit from full disclosure of negotiated prices.\u201d Apple is asking the US government to exclude its products\u2014including the ubiquitous iPhone\u2014 from President Trump\u2019s next round of proposed tariffs on Chinese imports. The Hill reports that in a letter made public on Thursday, \u201cthe tech giant wrote that the tariffs could give an advantage to Apple\u2019s Chinese competitors as well as reduce Apple\u2019s contributions to the US economy.\u201d \u201cU.S. tariffs would also weigh on Apple\u2019s global competitiveness,\u201d Apple wrote to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. \u201cThe Chinese producers we compete with in global markets do not have a significant presence in the U.S. market, and so would not be impacted by U.S. tariffs. Neither would our other major non-U.S. competitors.\u201d A US tariff would, therefore, tilt the playing field in favor of our global competitors.\u201d -Apple Politico is reporting that longtime former Trump confidante Hope Hicks broke with President Donald Trump during her interview with the House Judiciary Committee this week, telling lawmakers that offers of foreign assistance in U.S. elections should be \u201crejected and reported to the FBI.\u201d That disclosure comes courtesy of house judiciary chairman Jerry Nadler. The remarks from Hicks stand in contrast to Trump\u2019s statement on ABC news last week about what he would do if a foreign power came to him with opposition research on a political opponent. Trump: I think you might want to listen, there isn\u2019t anything wrong with listening... If somebody called from a country, Norway, [and said] \u2018we have information on your opponent\u2019 -- oh, I think I\u2019d want to hear it.\u201d From Politico: \u201cHicks, sat for nearly eight hours behind closed doors with the committee on Wednesday and fielded questions on several subjects related to her tenure as a senior aide on the Trump campaign, the presidential transition period, and in the White House as communications director.\u201d Alabama Republican Roy Moore, whose unsuccessful 2017 campaign for US Senate was marred by allegations he sexually assaulted or pursued teenage girls while in his 30s, is going to try again. The Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, a former federal prosecutor, defeated Moore by a narrow margin in a special election in December 2017 to fill the seat vacated by Republican Jeff Sessions when he became US attorney general. Jones was the first Democrat in a quarter-century to be elected to the US Senate in Alabama. Moore, a 72-year-old former state chief judge known for staunchly conservative views, could face Jones again if he wins the party primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders hold narrow leads in a theoretical showdown with President Trump in North Carolina ahead of the 2020 presidential race, according to a new Public Policy Polling survey released Thursday. From The Hill: Forty-nine percent of registered voters surveyed said they would back Biden in a match-up against Trump, while 46 percent said they would support the president. Five percent, meanwhile, said they are unsure who they\u2019d back. In a match-up against Sanders, 48 percent of North Carolina voters said they\u2019d back the Vermont senator, compared with 47 percent who said they would vote for Trump; 5 percent said they were unsure of their pick. No other candidate leads Trump in the poll. From Associated Press reporter Jill Colvin: I asked Trump today whether he believes there are members of his administration who are trying to push him into conflict w Iran. His response? \u201cNo, not at all. Not at all. In fact, in many cases, it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d Then talked about campaigning on getting out of endless wars. The Washington Post is reporting that the Senate passed measures to block President Trump from using his emergency authority to complete several arms sales benefiting Saudi Arabia on Thursday. From the Post: A bipartisan group of senators, led by Senator\u2019s Robert Menendez (D-NJ) and Trump booster Lindsey Graham (R-SC), had initially filed 22 resolutions of disapproval against the sales \u2014 one for every contract the administration had expedited by emergency order, effectively sidestepping congressional opposition. But after weeks of negotiations, Senate leaders agreed to hold just three votes, which will encompass the substance of all the blocking resolutions, congressional aides said. The Trump administration sent a letter to the Senate Thursday to let lawmakers know that if the bill made it to Trump\u2019s desk, \u201chis advisors would recommend he veto it.\u201d Trump has cited rising tensions with Iran as justification for using his emergency powers to complete the deals. The Post continued: Republican leaders have repeatedly stated their opposition to the effort and support for the president, making the prospect of securing 67 votes for the resolutions \u2014 a veto-proof majority \u2014 difficult. Once the Senate completes its votes, the resolutions will go to the House, where Democratic leaders have been waiting to see whether the Senate would have any difficulty passing the resolutions before taking their own steps to block Trump\u2019s actions. Meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Trump seems to be striking a conciliatory tone on Iran- suggesting that the shooting down of a US drone may even have been accidental. \u201cI find it hard to believe it was intentional,\u201d Trump said. Trump added: \u201cI imagine someone made a mistake...in shooting down the drone. We didn\u2019t have a man or woman in the drone. It would have made a big, big difference.\u201d But the remarks weren\u2019t without bluster either. Donald Trump continues to conduct foreign diplomacy like the reality TV star he is, essentially encouraging the global citizenry to \u201cstay tuned for next week\u201d when asked if he will authorize a strike against Iran amid growing tensions. The comment follows a tweet earlier in the day in which Trump, again opaquely, suggested \u201cIran made a very big mistake!\u201d in response to word that the nation had shot down a US drone. Nancy Pelosi calls the Trump administration\u2019s eight-year delay of a new $20 US banknote honoring abolitionist Harriet Tubman \u201can insult to the hopes of millions.\u201d \u201cThis unnecessary decision must be reversed,\u201d Pelosi continued in a Tweet. The Treasury Department was expected to release the updated bill in 2020, but announced last month that the project would be postponed for at least eight years. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin implausibly cited \u201ccounterfeiting issues,\u201d as the reason for the delay. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday called for an investigation into Mnuchin\u2019s decision. A group of four high-profile Democratic lawmakers, including presidential candidate Kamala Harris, have introduced legislation to Protect the US Justice Department from that they call \u201cWhite House meddling\u201d. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Congressman Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) introduced the Security from Political Interference in Justice Act in what they describe as a bid \u201cto increase transparency in the relationship between the U.S. Department of Justice and the White House and prevent political interference in law enforcement decisions.\u201d The lawmakers go on in a release to say that \u201cThe bill would impose important reporting requirements for contacts between the Justice Department and White House pertaining to specific cases or investigations.\u201d Never before have we seen a president so heedless of the Department\u2019s traditions and spirit, and so singularly focused on his own political and personal self-interest at the expense of justice. This bill would protect the Department against the likes of Donald Trump by shining a much-needed light on the channels that have enabled political influence to flow into the Department.\u201d -Senator Sheldon Whitehouse Biden calls the developments in Iran a \u201cself-inflicted disaster\u201d by the Trump administration. Speaking to reporters Thursday morning, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the US has no appetite to go to war with Iran, after Tehran shot down a U.S. military surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz. Pelosi said that a group of 20 lawmakers was preparing to receive a briefing on the \u201cdangerous situation\u201d in Iran shortly thereafter. The top House Democrat also weighed in on Joe Biden\u2019s very bad 48 hours Thursday, saying she had \u201cno criticism\u201d of his remarks. I have no criticism of what he believes is his story to tell the American people, that he will work with anyone to get a good result for the American people.\u201d -Nancy Pelosi \u201cWhat I think is most important for all the candidates is authenticity, they are who they are, they\u2019ve lived a life and they have grown from their experiences, and I think that\u2019s what he\u2019s trying to tell us,\u201d Pelosi told MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell. Democratic candidates Cory Booker and Joe Biden continue to snip back and forth over Biden\u2019s now widely-panned remarks about working with segregationists. Booker chimed in with a third volley last night on CNN. What matters to me is that a guy running to be the head of our party, which is a significantly diverse and wondrous party, doesn\u2019t even understand and can\u2019t even acknowledge that he made a mistake, whether the intention was there or not,\u201d Booker said. \u201cInstead, he\u2019s fallen back into the defensive crouch that often people say, which is \u2018Cory called me a racist\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m not a racist,\u2019 which is not what I said, and not what I\u2019m calling him.\u201d \u201cThis is the problem. He knows better,\u201d he continued. \u201cAt a time when Donald Trump never apologizes for anything and starts to create that toxic sentiment that you never apologize ... I know Joe Biden. He\u2019s better than this.\u201d The controversy began after comments Biden made at a Wall Street fundraiser at New York\u2019s Carlyle Hotel on Monday, intended to highlight his ability to work across diverse viewpoints to get things done. Biden cited segregationists James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman E Talmadge of Georgia, as two senators with whom he disagreed, but still worked with and \u201cgot things done\u201d. I was in a caucus with James O Eastland,\u201d Biden told guests of the event, briefly imitating the senator\u2019s southern drawl, according to the press pool report. \u201cHe never called me \u2018boy\u2019, he always called me \u2018son\u2019,\u201d he said. He went on to describe Talmadge as \u201cone of the meanest guys\u201d he ever knew but said, \u201cAt least there was some civility. We got things done.\u201d Both senators are remembered for their racist views. Booker chimed in initially: \u201cBiden\u2019s relationships with proud segregationists are not the model for how we make America a safer and more inclusive place for black people, and for everyone.\u201d He also called for the former vice-president to issue \u201can immediate apology\u201d. Biden seemed to take the remarks personally, responding to Booker: \u201cCory should apologize...He knows better. There\u2019s not a racist bone in my body. I\u2019ve been involved in civil rights my whole career. Period,\u201d prompting Booker\u2019s second response on CNN last night. The entire kerfuffle came as Black Americans celebrate the emancipation holiday known as Juneteenth, and as lawmakers on the hill held hearings on reparations for the descendants of US slavery and segregation. Ranking House Judiciary member Doug Collins blasted today\u2019s Mueller report hearing in a statement accusing Democrats of \u201ctheater\u201d and trying to \u201credo\u201d the Mueller report. I\u2019m concerned the majority\u2019s witnesses may not be here to discuss Volume II, or to offer \u201cbipartisan perspectives.\u201d I am glad we are allegedly focusing on election security today, but I urge the majority to stop trying to re-do the Mueller investigation and hold a hearing promptly on election security. We don\u2019t need theater. We don\u2019t need John Dean, Part Two. As to the substance, I\u2019d like to remind everyone: Democrats spent two years claiming the president was a Russian asset who conspired with the Kremlin to steal the election. The special counsel spent two years investigating whether the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia. Well, the special counsel finished his investigation and found no Americans, no one on the Trump campaign, conspired or coordinated with Russians. That was great news for America. I thought it would be great news to all Americans. To my surprise, it wasn\u2019t. Democrats were not only disappointed, they were angry. Angry the president was not a Russian asset. Imagine disliking a president so much you wished he were a foreign agent. That\u2019s where Democrats are today. Despite the Mueller report\u2019s conclusion there was no conspiracy, Democrats have spent the past few months trying desperately to revive their Russia conspiracy theory. Democrats spent two years calling Mueller\u2019s team the best of the best, but, since they didn\u2019t like the outcome, Democrats now want to play prosecutor and re-do Mueller\u2019s investigation. Ivanka Trump was accused on Thursday of violating the Hatch Act that bans government workers from speaking out on political campaign issues, over tweets she wrote ahead of her father\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign launch. Influential Washington-based watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) has filed a complaint against Donald Trump\u2019s daughter and senior aide, who works in the White House as his adviser, albeit unsalaried. She is accused of violating the rule that limits political activity by federal employees. In a letter to the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), part of the Department of Justice, Crew said her tweet, posted on Father\u2019s Day last weekend, just a few days before Trump\u2019s re-election campaign launch in Florida, included his 2016 campaign slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d and claimed \u201cthe best is yet to come\u201d. The complaint comes just a week after the OSC, a US federal watchdog, called on the president to sack Trump Aide Kellyanne Conway over multiple violations of the Hatch Act. Iran has shot down an US drone in the strait of Hormuz, accusing Washington of breaching Iran\u2019s national sovereignty and trying to deepen tensions in the region. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards said on Thursday that they had used a surface to air missile to shoot down what they called a US \u201cspy\u201d drone they claimed was flying in the country\u2019s airspace. US Central Command confirmed that one of its unmanned aircraft had been taken down, but said it was in international airspace. A CentCom spokesman, Capt Bill Urban said it was a US navy Global Hawk surveillance drone, which had been downed by an Iranian surface-to-air missile over the Strait of Hormuz at 11.35pm GMT. \u201cIranian reports that the aircraft was over Iran are false. This was an unprovoked attack on a U.S. surveillance asset in international airspace,\u201d Urban said. Read more In space news, The Navy briefed three senators Wednesday on a number of reported encounters with unidentified aircraft amid growing requests from members of oversight committees. The Hill reports that Virginia Senator Mark Warner\u2019s office confirmed the meeting. \u201cIf pilots at Oceana or elsewhere are reporting flight hazards that interfere with training or put them at risk, then Senator Warner wants answers. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s weather balloons, little green men, or something else entirely \u2014 we can\u2019t ask our pilots to put their lives at risk unnecessarily,\u201d his spokesperson, Rachel Cohen, said in a statement. In other space news, Americans are at odds with the White House plans to send manned missions to the moon and or mars. According to a new poll the country much prefers a space program that focuses on potential asteroid impacts, scientific research and using robots to explore the cosmos. The poll by The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, released Thursday, one month before the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, lists asteroid and comet monitoring as the No. 1 desired objective for the U.S. space program. About two-thirds of Americans call that very or extremely important, and about a combined 9 in 10 call it at least moderately important. By contrast, only about a quarter of Americans said moon or Mars exploration by astronauts should be among the space program\u2019s highest priorities. About another third called each of those moderately important. Billionaire Tom Steyer will air a new commercial on Fox &amp; Friends Friday and Monday advocating for impeachment. According to Politico, Steyer\u2019s group Need to Impeach is putting $700,000 behind the ad and selected the time slot so as to hopefully catch Trump\u2019s eye \u2013 the president is a frequent viewer of the program. \u201cRight now, Donald Trump is committing crimes in the open,\u201d Steyer says in the ad, citing Trump\u2019s ongoing dismissal of congressional subpoenas, and his declaration that he would listen to opposition research supplied by a foreign power in the 2020 campaign. \u201cThe Mueller report identified multiple instances of obstruction of justice,\u201d Steyer continues. Good morning and welcome to the politics blog for Thursday, 20 June. The House Judiciary Committee is kicking off its second \u201clessons from the Mueller report\u201d hearing shortly. The first round, which happened a week and a half ago, featured former Nixon counsel John Dean who testified that there were \u201cexhaustive\u201d and \u201cremarkable\u201d parallels between special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, and the findings compiled in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Today\u2019s hearing, entitled \u201cbipartisan perspectives\u201d, is scheduled to include experts on constitutional law, separation of powers, cybersecurity, and election law.",
