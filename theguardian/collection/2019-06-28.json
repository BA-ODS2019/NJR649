In the last period of McGowan\u2019s parliamentary service, Scott Morrison governed in minority, which made the House of Representatives crossbenchers kingmakers, increasing their influence. Haines acknowledges that period has passed, although she points out circumstances can change when prime ministers govern \u2013 as Morrison is about to when parliament resumes next week \u2013 with a one-seat majority if you exclude the Speaker. But she also wants to project her community focus back into the national conversation about politics rather than just accept the default Canberra determinism of arithmetic. Her goal over the coming term is to make a worthwhile contribution \u201coutside the numbers and power game of Australian politics\u201d \u2013 and that means focusing on activity that\u2019s rarely reported in today\u2019s frenetic political media cycle.

One of her goals is to make a contribution on climate change, which was a top-of-mind issue for constituents in her regional electorate during the recent campaign.

Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Having held Indi, previously a safe Liberal seat before McGowan took it in 2013, in large part because of her positive pitch on climate action, Haines rejects emphatically the notion that 2019 was a climate election and the climate lost. She says people who think that concern about global warming is a niche issue, or an obsession of unrepresentative post-materialist progressives, need to visit her local community. \u201cIf you think that climate politics belongs outside of conservatism, I would say have a look at Indi. \u201cI don\u2019t accept for one moment that the debate on climate is over, and I don\u2019t accept for one moment this notion of a mandate on climate,\u201d she says. \u201cI work with the evidence I have in my electorate and people want to see good strong climate policy that actually reduces emissions.\u201d She points out there are 100 community energy groups operating across Australia and 11 of them are in her electorate. \u201cIf you want to see action on climate at a micro level then come to Indi.\u201d Haines is concerned about the lack of progress over the past 10 years, and is looking for ways to contribute to breaking the policy deadlock which has caused enormous frustration for her constituents. \u201cWe need to stop backing ourselves into corners about whose ideology is right on this.\u201d She says the view from the ground up is that renewable energy projects are positive for regional Australia, and are a huge opportunity for regional cities. As well as shifting the dial on climate policy, the independent also wants to use the next three years to continue to innovate in the way she delivers political representation to her community. The process of getting McGowan elected, and getting herself elected in 2019, holding out competition from major party candidates, has yielded a substantial group of engaged citizens supporting grassroots politics in Indi, but Haines is conscious that she needs to engage beyond \u201cthe orange army\u201d. McGowan and Haines are products of Voices for Indi, a political movement created as a result of dissatisfaction with Australia\u2019s political process and lack of engagement. The techniques used in Indi have been shared with other independents. She says her recent objective has been to ask her activists to engage in conversations with another 20 people with a view to expanding her footprint in the electorate and widening the circles of engagement and deliberation. Haines is particularly focused on getting people currently disengaged with politics to communicate with her \u2013 which is a significant preoccupation in Australian politics at the moment.

I\u2019d feel very comfortable doing that. I\u2019d have no problem,\u201d Trump told reporters, adding that he believed Kim followed his Twitter account. \u201cI guess he does because we got a call very quickly,\u201d he said.</p> <p>If Kim accepts the invitation it will be the leaders\u2019 first meeting since their denuclearisation summit in Hanoi in February <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/28/vietnam-summittrump-and-kim-play-down-hopes-of-quick-results-nuclear-talks\">ended without an agreement</a>.</p> <p>Some North Korea watchers interpreted Choe\u2019s comments as a sign that the meeting will go ahead. Commenting on the KCNA reports, John Delury, a North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnDelury/status/1144826354333962240\">tweeted</a>: \u201cNot to put too fine a point on it, but this is North Korean for \u2018yes\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>The South\u2019s presidential Blue House said nothing had been confirmed at this point and added: \u201cOur position, which hopes for a dialogue between the US and North Korea to take place, remains unchanged.\u201d</p> <p>Trump and Kim have met twice, first in Singapore last June and again in Hanoi in February. Neither summit has produced a comprehensive agreement that would see North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons program in exchange for sanctions relief.</p> <p>But a photo opportunity on the DMZ, no matter how symbolic, is unlikely to go far in resolving their differences on denuclearisation, according to Scott Seaman, director of Eurasia Group Asia.</p> <p>\u201cFor talks to have real legs, either Kim must credibly commit to denuclearisation or Trump must credibly agree to allow Kim to keep some of his nuclear weapons,\u201d Seaman said.</p> <p>\u201cWithout a shared end goal, creating a viable roadmap to reaching it will remain impossible.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s first months in office were marked by belligerent, personal attacks between the president and the North Korean leader over North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.</p> <p>But since the two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/12/solidarity-of-heirs-on-the-trump-and-kim-surreality-show\">met in Singapore</a> last June, the US president has touted a close, personal bond with Kim. That meeting marked the first time a sitting American president had met with the North Korean leader.</p> <p>And when North Korea <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/09/north-korea-has-fired-second-projectile-in-five-days-says-south-korea\">conducted several weapons tests</a> last month, Trump took up a surprisingly moderate tone. \u201cNobody\u2019s happy about it,\u201d the president said.</p> <p>As he enters his re-election campaign, Trump is reliant on at least the appearance of diplomatic progress with North Korea as his principal foreign policy success. He has repeatedly insisted that the two countries were on a collision course to war before he came to office.</p> <p>He told reporters on Saturday that it was a \u201cgood thing\u201d that he and Kim \u201cseem to get along very well\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to get along. Because frankly, if I didn\u2019t become president, we\u2019d be right now in a war with North Korea. You\u2019d be having a war, right now, with North Korea. And by the way, that\u2019s a certainty. That\u2019s not, like, maybe.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s desire to avoid bad news from the Korean peninsula has given Kim some leverage in his bid to have sanctions eased. But while Trump has so far ignored large-scale sanctions-busting by North Korea, Russia and China, he has shown himself unwilling to lift any part of the embargo formally.</p> <p>As he left the White House for Asia earlier this week, Trump was asked whether he\u2019d meet with Kim while he is in the region.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be meeting with a lot of other people ... but I may be speaking to him in a different form,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>Such trips to the demilitarised zone, the heavily fortified border between North and South Korea, are usually undertaken under heavy security and the utmost secrecy.</p>",

If Kim accepts the invitation it will be the leaders\u2019 first meeting since their denuclearisation summit in Hanoi in February ended without an agreement. Some North Korea watchers interpreted Choe\u2019s comments as a sign that the meeting will go ahead. Commenting on the KCNA reports, John Delury, a North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul, tweeted: \u201cNot to put too fine a point on it, but this is North Korean for \u2018yes\u2019\u201d. The South\u2019s presidential Blue House said nothing had been confirmed at this point and added: \u201cOur position, which hopes for a dialogue between the US and North Korea to take place, remains unchanged.\u201d Trump and Kim have met twice, first in Singapore last June and again in Hanoi in February. Neither summit has produced a comprehensive agreement that would see North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons program in exchange for sanctions relief. But a photo opportunity on the DMZ, no matter how symbolic, is unlikely to go far in resolving their differences on denuclearisation, according to Scott Seaman, director of Eurasia Group Asia. \u201cFor talks to have real legs, either Kim must credibly commit to denuclearisation or Trump must credibly agree to allow Kim to keep some of his nuclear weapons,\u201d Seaman said. \u201cWithout a shared end goal, creating a viable roadmap to reaching it will remain impossible.\u201d Trump\u2019s first months in office were marked by belligerent, personal attacks between the president and the North Korean leader over North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. But since the two met in Singapore last June, the US president has touted a close, personal bond with Kim. That meeting marked the first time a sitting American president had met with the North Korean leader. And when North Korea conducted several weapons tests last month, Trump took up a surprisingly moderate tone. \u201cNobody\u2019s happy about it,\u201d the president said. As he enters his re-election campaign, Trump is reliant on at least the appearance of diplomatic progress with North Korea as his principal foreign policy success. He has repeatedly insisted that the two countries were on a collision course to war before he came to office. He told reporters on Saturday that it was a \u201cgood thing\u201d that he and Kim \u201cseem to get along very well\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s good to get along. Because frankly, if I didn\u2019t become president, we\u2019d be right now in a war with North Korea. You\u2019d be having a war, right now, with North Korea. And by the way, that\u2019s a certainty. That\u2019s not, like, maybe.\u201d Trump\u2019s desire to avoid bad news from the Korean peninsula has given Kim some leverage in his bid to have sanctions eased. But while Trump has so far ignored large-scale sanctions-busting by North Korea, Russia and China, he has shown himself unwilling to lift any part of the embargo formally. As he left the White House for Asia earlier this week, Trump was asked whether he\u2019d meet with Kim while he is in the region. \u201cI\u2019ll be meeting with a lot of other people ... but I may be speaking to him in a different form,\u201d Trump said. Such trips to the demilitarised zone, the heavily fortified border between North and South Korea, are usually undertaken under heavy security and the utmost secrecy.",

Gladly, though, five minutes later and Hill appeared resplendent and imperiously hatted in black, backed by three singers and a five\u2013piece band.</p> <p>Currently winding up a 20th anniversary tour in celebration of her debut album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, Hill\u2019s band were a well-oiled machine, responding with all the speed and efficiency of fearful children to their leader\u2019s sharp hand signals and reprimands at the end of each song.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee47b46d7cd50a12a4423693c0f6e313a1c0cbe8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee47b46d7cd50a12a4423693c0f6e313a1c0cbe8/0_101_3267_1960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lauryn Hill performs on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Digging deep ...

Notwithstanding the no-show controversies, her battles with the IRS and even recent allegations of plagiarism, here her voice dug deep within to provide gossamer-light runs over the embellished chords. Finally, the audience were right there with her and Hill ended on that most coveted of phenomena: the Glastonbury singalong to the final chorus.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d1663fb8f082364d7cf335d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-28T19:03:07.596Z\">8.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>BBC Two\u2019s coverage has stopped so I\u2019ve jumped over to iPlayer to watch the incomparable Idles \u2026 Joe Talbot has just delivered an impassioned tribute to his wife, Elizabeth, who has \u201csacrificed all this bullshit\u201d to raise their child.

Surrounded by female dancers in matching long, dark ponytails, she flashes between tenderness and a mode best described as \u201ccome and \u2019ave a go\u201d as she flexes through her kinetic flamenco-rooted pop. When she sings one song totally a cappella, her voice flutters and billows like one of the flags steaming over the Pyramid stage, and the sight of a man in the front row singing \u2013 and truly feeling \u2013 every word makes her lip tremble, her effort to suppress tears palpable. But suddenly, she shifts to a tone of admonishment, summoning a palpable wrath and vengeance that transcends the language barrier (although there are an impressive number of people singing along).</p> <p>Her set \u2013 at first bafflingly under-attended, but soon rammed \u2013 is a masterclass in how to pull off heightened craft without quashing the emotion, in contrasts of light and dark. The traditional <em>palmas</em> \u2013 handclaps \u2013 girding her songs are hardened to uncompromisingly tough beats; one song orbits around the strum of a Spanish guitar, processed and repeated into a subaqueous, menacing pattern. Meanwhile, Barefoot in the Park, her duet with James Blake (not here today) is as light as peachy cirrus. It\u2019s phenomenal, whether she\u2019s performing alone or with her girl gang, and the unrelenting spells of between song applause come as no surprise. Comparisons to Beyonc\u00e9 are audible in the post-show chatter. It\u2019s the rare occasion that they don\u2019t feel like hyperbole.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-28T18:46:50.335Z\">at 7.46pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d165d0e8f081e8727350bbf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-28T18:33:23.762Z\">7.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ccc16ec7514cbbb31fbc85eb7d7147ee25f038a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccc16ec7514cbbb31fbc85eb7d7147ee25f038a5/0_110_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dan Smith of Bastille performs at the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dan Smith of Bastille performs at the Pyramid stage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Grant Pollard/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve barely had time to compute Tim Burgess\u2019s blonde mop and dungarees combo and now BBC2\u2019s coverage has started with the promise of music from Jorja Smith and others.

At times, the frontman screeches like a metaller.

KP \u2013 AKA Mikaela Strauss \u2013 was only born in 1998, but her music is steeped in 90s angst, all gritted-teeth delivery and shimmering soft rock, with an All Saints-style crop top and low-slung baggy jeans to match.</p> <p>But she\u2019s just as much a product of her era, subverting traditional torch songcraft further by centring her perspective as a queer woman. Her single 1950 is a heavenly devotional to a lover, also a tribute to the pioneering lesbians of the past who had to love in secret, and a gorgeous singalong moment. Then there\u2019s Pussy Is God, a self-explanatory number that hews closer to low-key contemporary R&amp;B \u2013 although it\u2019s a little indistinct for such a strident sentiment. </p> <p>So is her set as a whole. Little comes close to the rapturous 1950, it\u2019s all a bit too mid-range, and low on the intrigue that allows Lana Del Rey to elevate similar fare to a cult concern. Bringing on Mark Ronson \u2013 who signed Strauss to his label \u2013 adds a brief frisson of recognition but not much more. Saying that, the woozy pace is perfect for a crowd worn down by the piercing heat.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-28T17:00:42.825Z\">at 6.00pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1644348f081e8727350ae9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-28T16:47:42.217Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I\u2019m in Control, our Janet Jackson themed interrogation of Glastonbury-goers, continues with Stefanie and Andy \u2013 they tell us what they would do if they were in control of the festival.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"217e084bd64e36a550a098f39cc9375fe1d22a05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/217e084bd64e36a550a098f39cc9375fe1d22a05/0_0_1024_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stefanie and Andy at Glastonbury 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Stefanie: They should make the whole thing vegetarian like Mandala does.

Up on the Park stage, Georgia\u2019s intriguing one-woman setup \u2013 an electronic drum kit made up of red hexagon-shaped pads \u2013 draws in curious onlookers, who leave converted by her bass-heavy, emotionally gripping electronic pop: halfway between pirate radio bootleg and Chicago house, sweet as Tegan and Sara yet spooky as Fever Ray. It\u2019s even more impressive, given that she\u2019s playing a set of largely unheard material \u2013 Georgia was supposed to release her second album this year, but the runaway success of singles Started Out and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4Y9V07wry4\">About Work the Dancefloor,</a> both A-listed at Radio 1, prompted her surprised label Domino to push it back to give her time to build.</p> <p>Judging by the response in the field, they\u2019ve got gold on their hands: you know a song is good when it prompts the crowd to manifest a spontaneous, unified dance move, as happens when she plays a track likely titled Pick Up Your Ray Guns (the move is self-explanatory). With their pummelling rhythm sections, many of her songs have a battle cry energy \u2013 \u201cThey can try and stop us now but they won\u2019t succeed\u201d; \u201cA little bit of nonsense to create disturbance\u201d \u2013 which makes them feel of this politicised moment (the stage is surrounded by posters encouraging environmental activism) in a totally natural way, by comparisson with how laboured much of today\u2019s explicitly woke pop can feel. For emphasis, she raises her drumsticks above her head in a warrior pose, and hops off her rig for the occasional celebratory jump, her tight curls bouncing \u2013 a display that\u2019s totally endearing and totally earned.</p> <p>Her set brilliantly juxtaposes grit and tenderness. On one slinky, creeping song, she raps menacingly about vodka jello and amaretto; on a tender, slower love song, she shows her knack for singing with power and vulnerability. She also dedicates a track to a friend\u2019s father who died yesterday, and who attended the first ever Glastonbury festival in 1970. But Georgia\u2019s crowning glory is her frisky club pop, and she closes with the two songs that kickstarted this new phase of her career, one that looks to take her from indie curio to genuine star: after About Work the Dancefloor, a song worthy of Robyn in her Body Talk era, she tells a crowd as sweaty from dancing as from the 28 degree heat that she is lost for words, and seems genuinely humbled. It gets better: she teases the beginning of Started Out, singing its verses tenderly before triggering the sexy, fidgety Mr Fingers-indebted beat. Everyone loses it. The only way it could be better is if it were 2am, not 2pm.

Joining the panel\u2019s host, Guardian columnist John Harris, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/18/michael-braithwaite-man-who-lost-job-over-immigration-status-has-right-to-be-in-uk-confirmed\">Michael Braithwaite</a>, a special needs teaching assistant who lost his job in 2016 after being told his immigration status was questionable. Braithwaite, who came to Britain from Trinidad in 1961, only had his status resolved after his story was featured in the Guardian\u2019s reporting on the Windrush scandal. He said that he was one of the lucky ones, compared with those who have been imprisoned or deported as a result of the hostile environment policy. <br></p> <p>Another panellist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/14/couldnt-hold-newborn-son-families-split-visa-laws\">Laura Clarke</a>, told of how her partner was denied a UK visa due to a Home Office rule that says UK citizens must meet a minimum income threshold of \u00a318,600 for sponsoring a foreign spouse. Clarke met her partner Biniyam Tesfaye while teaching in Ethiopia, but she and her son had been separated from Tesfaye for much of the past three years because of the \u201ccruel\u201d measure. \u201cMy partner missed Christmas, birthdays, even our son\u2019s birth,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Also on the panel were Guardian commentator Gary Younge and Minnie Rahman of charity the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants. Young told the audience that the Windrush scandal was a direct result of a mischaracterisation of immigrants. \u201cThere\u2019s a notion that immigrants are people who take and scrounge \u2013 when in fact they help built this country,\u201d he said.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-28T13:16:14.574Z\">at 2.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d160e9f8f082364d7cf2f76\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kate-hutchinson\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-28T13:00:31.864Z\">2.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Continuing our I\u2019m in Control feature where \u2013 in honour of Janet Jackson \u2013 we ask punters what they would do if they were in charge of Glastonbury, Georgie Rogers offers her thoughts: \u201cI\u2019d want everyone to be able to teleport from area to area so we can maximise party time and save our feet.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1900eb6f1b9b2b38ca984f59a2956344f22b43e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1900eb6f1b9b2b38ca984f59a2956344f22b43e9/0_0_1394_1600/871.jpg\" alt=\"Georgie Rogers at Glastonbury.\" width=\"871\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-28T13:44:56.578Z\">at 2.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d160d978f082364d7cf2f6a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/frances-perraudin\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-28T12:55:59.714Z\">1.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Zac Goldsmith at Glastonbury: 'Boris Johnson is really not a climate sceptic'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e092e6441d009083d75dfb34a9c973112573b18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e092e6441d009083d75dfb34a9c973112573b18/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zac Goldsmith appears at Speakers Corner at the Glastonbury festival 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In what was described by an audience member as a \u201cvery brave\u201d move, Zac Goldsmith appeared on stage at Glastonbury\u2019s Speaker\u2019s Forum on Friday afternoon.

Don\u2019t greenwash the lives lost to austerity.\u201d</p> <p>Goldsmith, an environmentalist and editor of the Ecologist magazine, said there was a role for civil disobedience in combatting climate change. \u201cI think there is a massive place for pressure, whether it\u2019s civil disobedience or direct action or peaceful protest,\u201d he said in response to a question from the audience.</p> <p>\u201cNormally I think a protest is more effective if it doesn\u2019t annoy ordinary people but being heard is essential.

But as recently as 2015, Johnson claimed that \u201cglobal leaders were driven by a primitive fear that the present ambient warm weather is somehow caused by humanity; and that fear \u2013 as far as I understand the science \u2013 is equally without foundation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe is really not a climate sceptic,\u201d said Goldsmith. \u201cHe has written many, many things talking about the imperative of taking action of climate change.\u201d</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the issue of drug-taking came up, in light of Tory-leadership hopefuls being forced to come clan about their histories with illegal substances. \u201cI was expelled from school for drugs, so I can\u2019t really deny it,\u201d said Goldsmith, who elaborated that he had smoked \u201cold fashioned Jamaican woodbine\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t actually think what people get up to in their private lives, particularly before they become an MP, is relevant,\u201d he said. \u201cI think most people have done things that they would rather not see in a newspaper.

Though it takes a while for the energy to get going, their show is loose and free-flowing, as opposed to overly staged. Each player is moving to their own beat \u2013 you can lock into Rosie Turton\u2019s trombone, or Wonky Logic\u2019s woozy keytar, and find your own cosmic groove. On lead vocals, meanwhile, Nadeem Din-Gabisi is the Andre 3000 to Brother Portrait\u2019s Big Boi, whose playful delivery contrasts with his co-pilot\u2019s Ghostpoet-style enunciation.</p> <p>What\u2019s striking, though, is the band\u2019s range. They bring out dancers for the afrobeat-punchy Infinity, clear the stage for an understated duet between the two female vocalists and guest Sampa the Great, and have just as many neo-soul songs as they do sax solos. Their best moments, however, are the upbeat, rowdier ones, a shot of positivity and a vital celebration of genres \u2013 grime, dub, jazz \u2013 that underline the new sound of London.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-02T14:07:49.730Z\">at 3.07pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d16098b8f082364d7cf2f1f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/ammar-kalia\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-28T12:39:34.067Z\">1.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Mahalia reviewed</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea3040786afeb3d3dfd4abcd36882d00e016ce4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea3040786afeb3d3dfd4abcd36882d00e016ce4b/0_742_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mahalia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As far as inspirations for songs go, 21-year-old Leicester singer-songwriter Mahalia seems to have it down pat: \u201cI like to write songs about the guys that I like, the dickheads, the girls that I like and the bitches,\u201d she said defiantly as she opened her early-afternoon set on the John Peel stage.<br></p> <p>Channeling the confessional lyricism of Brandy and early-2000s American neo soul, Mahalia\u2019s honeyed vocals were pitch-perfect as she launched through a selection of songs from her debut album, Diary of Me, and the Seasons EP: the infectious melodies of self-empowerment anthem Do Not Disturb, the trap-soul One Night Only and the jazz-laden Sober. She has a new album coming in September, and the way new single Sinner sounded, with its radio-friendly dancehall rhythm and full-throated chorus, it is set to push Mahalia further into the mainstream.</p> <p>Singing with a permanent smile and dropping out of vocal lines to take regular dance-breaks, Mahalia\u2019s enthusiasm rippled through the crowd \u2013 the perfect enlivener to start the festival.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-28T12:46:36.828Z\">at 1.46pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1606f98f081e87273507dd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/michaelcragg\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-28T12:29:21.205Z\">1.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">M\u00d8 reviewed</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3127ebcb64e7714c04e4e89860cc90206be7f41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3127ebcb64e7714c04e4e89860cc90206be7f41/0_0_1200_1600/750.jpg\" alt=\"M\u00d8 performing at Glastonbury 2019\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my third time at Glastonbury and it\u2019s the first time it\u2019s not raining,\u201d hollers Danish agit-pop practitioner M\u00d8 to suitably relieved cheers.

Despite last year\u2019s underrated third album, Forever Neverland, disappearing without trace, she wins over a surprisingly vast crowd, initiating clapalongs during Pilgrim, pogoing during Burn and shouting out the festival organisers for ditching plastic bottles before introducing the next song as \u201cnot being about water, but wine\u201d, while swigging a glass of red.

      "bodyText": "And the stage goes quiet to the chants of \u201cStormzy! Stormzy! Stormzy!\u201d There\u2019s no encore and rightly so. It\u2019s fair to say he bossed this. There were no grand political speeches, as some might have hoped for (although plenty of nuanced messages through the big screen displays, interludes and stage attire). Instead, Stormzy kept it upbeat, raucous and relentless. It came and went in a flash, yet its impact will last for generations \u2013 a set that told the story of UK grime\u2019s unstoppable rise over the last two decades. \u201cThat was music history. That was black British history,\u201d says Clara Amfo. \u201cIt was a truly inclusive show.\u201d Stay tuned for our review from Alexis Petridis, posted here shortly. Thanks for joining me as Stormzy made history tonight \u2013 over and out! \u201cFinale business!\u201d It\u2019s Big For Your Boots. Did people really think Stormzy might not have enough material for this set?! Fun fact is that when this came out I thought Stormzy was rapping: \u201cI got the big size fours on my feet\u201d \u2013 making it the first UK rap song about having tiny trotters. Blinded By Your Grace Pt 2 getting the full gospel treatment here \u2013 it may as well have been written for Glastonbury. And it gets the full pyrotechnical works too. Stormzy takes a moment to take it all in ... Stormzy is down the front, topless, touching the palms of those at the front. \u201cI feel like the 25 years of my life has led up to this moment right here,\u201d he says, before namechecking the icons who made it possible: Wiley, Dizzee, Skepta, Giggs, Ghetts, Kano, Tinie Tempah, Lethal Bizzle, and then an even longer list of those coming through: Unknown T, Little Simz, Geko, Bugzy Malone, Nadia Rose, Novelist. And now it\u2019s Shut Up, taking things full circle with its sample of XTC\u2019s original grime classic Functions on the Low. Vossi Bop now, Stormzy\u2019s first UK chart-topper. Time to reflect ... it was 2005 when grime first hit Glastonbury festival, albeit on an underground scale, as DJ Cameo brought the likes of Trim and JME to the Roots tent. Since then we\u2019ve had Tinie Tempah, Skepta and Dizzee play the Pyramid stage (really, Dizzee should have headlined, because he owned it every single year). I was going to write something about grime\u2019s journey here but ..\u2026 no time, there are BMX bikers on the stage. Before that, BBC bosses quivered as a video of Ghetts cussing his mouth off was used to introduce Bad Boys. Now Dave is on the stage for Funky Friday. Meanwhile, my typing fingers are down to the actual bone and all I\u2019m doing is writing about what is happening. No time for any added commentary! Dave doesn\u2019t leave the stage without delivering an emotional message: I gotta say thank you bro, before I leave this stage. You\u2019ve made it possible, bro. You\u2019ve allowed man like us to believe, bro. This is your moment, the greatest. I love you, bro! Stormzy is addressing the crowd again before Shape of You: I was meant to bring my brother out but he\u2019s in a stadium on the other side of the world. It goes a little bit like this ... Ed Sheeran can\u2019t be here tonight? This set just gets better and better! How\u2019s it sounding in the crowd? If you\u2019re thinking Stormzy isn\u2019t feeling the pressure of this headline show, then perhaps have a listen to the lyrics to The Crown in which he wrestles with his newfound position as the voice of black Britain: \u201cI tried to be grateful and count all my blessings / But heavy is the head that wears the crown.\u201d Oh here he is. From one Glastonbury headline expert to a soon-to-be other \u2026 Chris Martin is on stage taking it to church by playing the intro to Blinded By Your Grace on a keyboard. I wonder what tips he gave him as to how you get invited back? The pair sit on the piano stool crooning together. After George Ezra\u2019s performance earlier, maybe the 90s \u201cstool-rock\u201d movement is back? More fireworks and another cover, this time Kanye\u2019s Ultralight Beam with the lyrics changed to reference \u201cfallen soldier\u201d Damiola Taylor and his South London roots. This one builds and builds to an epic crescendo Stormzy gets his gospel choir to sing the chorus for his cover of Shanks &amp; Bigfoot\u2019s Sweet Like Chocolate. This is exactly the right time in the set to switch things up with a slightly silly crowd-pleaser Stormzy is now dressed top to toe in white for Cigarettes and Cush. How is he doing all this while I can\u2019t even keep up with the typing?! There\u2019s a break and ... some choreography! Come on, who predicted ballet? \u201cNow there are ballet shoes to match all skin tones\u201d reads the video screen as two black dancers twirl gracefully around the stage. \u201cThis is the greatest night of my entire life. Who\u2019s got energy today?\u201d screams Stormzy before stripping it right back for One Track Freestyle. The slightest of breathers and we\u2019re on to First Things First. The video and lighting set up here is immense, the opposite approach to Kanye\u2019s bold but ultimately disappointing minimalist approach in 2015. It\u2019s Cold now. Stormzy performing the kind of exercise routine you can\u2019t buy at Virgin Active. There are fireworks. And a line everyone at Worthy Farm probably agrees with: \u201cSo tell Boris Johnson, \u2018suck your mum!\u2019\u201d Wearing a black union jack stab vest, Stormzy bounds on stage with energy levels turned up to 11. It\u2019s Know Me From to open things and the crowd are singing back every word. He looks the exact opposite of nervous: \u201cOi Glasto, it\u2019s only the fucking beginning!\u201d From Croydon to Pilton ... Stormzy becomes the first British rapper to headline the Pyramid stage. Strap yourselves in, this could get epic (and sweary \u2013 they\u2019re not censoring it). #merky Kieran speaks for everyone watching on TV right now And then of course there\u2019s this from today ... For Emily Eavis, this booking wasn\u2019t so much a risk as a no-brainer: When I saw him play the 2017 festival on the Other stage, I knew straight away that the next time he played he would be headlining the Pyramid. The reaction in the field was unbelievable. He\u2019s got such a presence and the energy is incredible. More Stormzy quotes to get you in the mood here from his recent interview with Dotty for Radio 1Xtra, in which he tells us what we might expect \u2026 There were so many doubters being like, \u2018Oh he hasn\u2019t got no number one song\u2019 or, \u2018Oh he\u2019s got one album out, he\u2019s not ready\u2019 \u2026 If you think you\u2019re going to give me that Glastonbury 2019 headline slot and I\u2019m not going to give you an incredible performance you\u2019ve gone mad \u2013 you\u2019ve gone crazy. I\u2019ve never come here to play games. As a musician, I take that so seriously. I\u2019m kind of done talking. There\u2019s a build-up and this time round I\u2019m ready\u2026 I got the album and we are going to show the world... exactly why I managed to get here in my career. Back in 2017, Stormzy told Miranda Sawyer on the Observer: I don\u2019t want to be the best rapper in the UK. I want to be the best artist in the UK. That takes my competitors from 20 people to 100 people, because now they\u2019re indie bands, female singers, soul singers, legends, rock icons that I\u2019m competing with. In my head I\u2019m like, \u2018Why can\u2019t I compete with them? Why can\u2019t Stormzy from south London do that as well? Tonight he will become the first black British artist to headline Glastonbury festival. What a journey. This could get emotional If you\u2019ve spent all night watching the BBC coverage tonight then you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that Sheryl Crow was the biggest artist on the planet right now. Over on the ITV2 stage, it looks like a few new lads are heading into the villa \u2026 sorry, got distracted! Besides we\u2019ve no time for that, as BBC Two are back at Glastonbury with the build-up to Stormzy\u2019s set. It has the potential, I think, to be one of the all-time great Glastonbury headline slots. Yes Stormzy is a little short on material but he\u2019s also big on charisma and connection, and that\u2019s what you really need to carry a headline show like this. Plus, he seems to really \u201cget\u201d what Glastonbury is about and what it means to headline such a prestigious slot. We shall find out how he tackles the job in hand shortly \u2026 Our verdict on George Ezra is in and it\u2019s as thus: if he\u2019s as rubbish as he seems why are we all having so much fun? It\u2019s safe to say that Jorja Smith\u2019s vocals are slightly more impressive than Joe Talbot\u2019s during his rendition of Someone Like You. She\u2019s opened with Lost &amp; Found and has gone for a \u201cone leg in monochrome\u201d look that more of us should consider adopting Sat in the middle of the Venn diagram between \u201cIdles fans\u201d and \u201cpeople who like sunsets\u201d, Pip Blom blow up the little Crows Nest stage at the highest point of the Glastonbury site. Their ramshackle but highly melodic indie punk gads about with tongue-lolling energy, and sends a series of dads into raptures. It\u2019s another great guerilla booking for one of the festival\u2019s smallest but best stages, who only announce their lineup each morning; don\u2019t miss Black Midi here later. If Jorja Smith has failed so far to move beyond \u201cimpressive\u201d and \u201caccomplished\u201d on record, despite the early promise of 2016\u2019s single Blue Lights, there\u2019s much more of an emotional connection in her live show. With a voice that recalls a slightly muffled Amy Winehouse circa Frank, and an aloof stage presence that means you can\u2019t take your eyes off her, she sounds genuinely annoyed at herself on Where Did I Go?, while Teenage Fantasy offers up some early opportunities for the massive crowd to dance. On Your Own is even extended into a psych-rock jam before unexpectedly morphing into Sister Nancy\u2019s Bam Bam. At one point, she acknowledges her lack of upbeat material before running through a medley that touches on Drake\u2019s One Dance and ends with her bringing out rapper AJ Tracey for Ladbroke Grove. Of course Smith\u2019s just as comfortable dealing with languid R&amp;B (the lovely Lost and Found), but, occasionally, when the songs aren\u2019t strong enough to carry the weight of the atmospherics \u2013 as on Wandering Romance \u2013 festival-goers\u2019 attention starts to drift. But as the sun sets, you can\u2019t deny her this early career-defining moment. Sheryl Crow has kindly launched into an extended harmonica solo which can only mean one thing \u2013 I get to go for a toilet break. George Ezra\u2019s tedious anecdotes about interrailing around Europe might make me reconsider my previously sunny disposition towards his set. In fact, I\u2019m ditching him and heading to BBC Four now for some coverage before Stormzy starts at 9:50pm on BBC Two. Sheryl Crow is currently telling us that there is only one thing she wants to do (and it\u2019s not, surprisingly, sit in the Guardian office on a Friday night liveblogging). Playing to a truly rammed Park stage, the crowd stretching up the hill to the next little stage of the Bimble Inn, Bristol\u2019s soul-baring, chest-baring, underpants-baring punks seize their moment. What sets them apart is a sentimental streak as wide as the Park\u2019s famous vista \u2013 dedicating songs to mums, nurses and the NHS at large. \u201c I come here and feel like I\u2019m part of something bigger than myself,\u201d frontman Joe Talbot tells the crowd, like a televangelist, and his frank admissions about alcoholism and depression are like truths told in a 12-step program. Perhaps this earnestness is what winds up their critical peers like Sleaford Mods and Fat White Family; the band are very well aware of the beefs, but it\u2019s that earnestness that has earned them ever growing crowds like this. Crucially, they offset it with sarky, propulsive punk, which also makes the injokes - like singing bits of Adele\u2019s Someone Like You and Pyramid stage star Sheryl Crow\u2019s All I Wanna Do \u2013 cute rather than annoying. Perhaps they lack a little bit of range; they often cleave to songs that rely on builds and drops. But in Danny Nedelko, they have a football chant anthem that will light the way to even bigger stages. The end of Lauryn Hill\u2019s set looked great on iPlayer but apparently it was a mixed bag for those who caught the full thing IRL. Here\u2019s Ammar Kalia\u2019s three-star review. For those wondering why Ezra is sat on a stool for the biggest gig of his life \u2013 he rolled his ankle running and can\u2019t stand very well. OK, have switched over to George Ezra, an artist whose fake-bluesman shtick I found incomprehensible for a long time until my nephews played him repeatedly during a recent visit to their house. The earworm must have wriggled inside because I found myself sneakily playing Paradise and Shotgun in the car on the way home. Ezra is not going to challenge your preconceptions of what math-rock can achieve, but on a sunny festival stage he\u2019s basically the dream booking. Here are some superfans who\u2019d been queuing at the Pyramid all day for a top spot ... Idles are now covering a medley of Sheryl Crow\u2019s All I Wanna Do and Adele\u2019s Someone Like You. Possibly they\u2019re doing both songs at the same time, such a racket it is. Now they\u2019ve moved on to Nothing Compares 2 U and a Harry Styles number. This is quite ... weird. Not sure anyone will top this Glastonbury coverage ... can anyone get Tim a job at the Beeb? Idles not only playing an incendiary set but also seem to have stellar advice for other bands on the bill struggling with this heatwave \u2013 simply play in your pants! Every time Lauryn Hill is booked to play a gig, one eternal question arises: will she show? And if she does, how late will she be? So many have Ms Hill\u2019s missed appearances been that to her fans, just the virtue of her turning up seems enough to justify the ticket price. So, at 6.10pm on the Pyramid Stage, 10 minutes after the scheduled start, there was a palpable nervous energy that rippled through the gigantic crowd. Hill\u2019s tour DJ valiantly spun the classic pre-gig fillers: Drop It Like It\u2019s Hot, et al. but the audience was beginning to reckon with another disappointment. Gladly, though, five minutes later and Hill appeared resplendent and imperiously hatted in black, backed by three singers and a five\u2013piece band. Currently winding up a 20th anniversary tour in celebration of her debut album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, Hill\u2019s band were a well-oiled machine, responding with all the speed and efficiency of fearful children to their leader\u2019s sharp hand signals and reprimands at the end of each song. Opening with the anthemic Lost Ones, Hill\u2019s vocals were breathless and somewhat patchy, leaving the bulk of the singing to her harmonising backing trio. It was only on the Fugees\u2019 classic, Killing Me Softly With His Song, which opened with a solo vocal, that a glimpse of Hill\u2019s true talent shone through. Notwithstanding the no-show controversies, her battles with the IRS and even recent allegations of plagiarism, here her voice dug deep within to provide gossamer-light runs over the embellished chords. Finally, the audience were right there with her and Hill ended on that most coveted of phenomena: the Glastonbury singalong to the final chorus. BBC Two\u2019s coverage has stopped so I\u2019ve jumped over to iPlayer to watch the incomparable Idles \u2026 Joe Talbot has just delivered an impassioned tribute to his wife, Elizabeth, who has \u201csacrificed all this bullshit\u201d to raise their child. He asks the crowd to cheer on the mums out there before launching into Mother (some especially good rolling of the \u201cR\u201ds going on here). The thing I like most about this Charlatans performance (other than the dungarees) is how youthful Tim Burgess looks ... and how bad the rest of the band do. A real Dorian Gray thing going on. Won\u2019t anybody think of Rob S? He can\u2019t see a thing for your stupid flags. Rosal\u00eda does not need a wind machine to make clear that she is cooler than literally everybody else at Glastonbury: that much is evident within seconds of her hyper-stylish performance on the John Peel stage. Surrounded by female dancers in matching long, dark ponytails, she flashes between tenderness and a mode best described as \u201ccome and \u2019ave a go\u201d as she flexes through her kinetic flamenco-rooted pop. When she sings one song totally a cappella, her voice flutters and billows like one of the flags steaming over the Pyramid stage, and the sight of a man in the front row singing \u2013 and truly feeling \u2013 every word makes her lip tremble, her effort to suppress tears palpable. But suddenly, she shifts to a tone of admonishment, summoning a palpable wrath and vengeance that transcends the language barrier (although there are an impressive number of people singing along). Her set \u2013 at first bafflingly under-attended, but soon rammed \u2013 is a masterclass in how to pull off heightened craft without quashing the emotion, in contrasts of light and dark. The traditional palmas \u2013 handclaps \u2013 girding her songs are hardened to uncompromisingly tough beats; one song orbits around the strum of a Spanish guitar, processed and repeated into a subaqueous, menacing pattern. Meanwhile, Barefoot in the Park, her duet with James Blake (not here today) is as light as peachy cirrus. It\u2019s phenomenal, whether she\u2019s performing alone or with her girl gang, and the unrelenting spells of between song applause come as no surprise. Comparisons to Beyonc\u00e9 are audible in the post-show chatter. It\u2019s the rare occasion that they don\u2019t feel like hyperbole. I\u2019ve barely had time to compute Tim Burgess\u2019s blonde mop and dungarees combo and now BBC2\u2019s coverage has started with the promise of music from Jorja Smith and others. First up, though, is \u2026 er, Bastille and Lewis Capaldi (the problem with liveblogging is you can\u2019t leg it to the healing tents during moments like these). There\u2019s a bit of a buzz about Rosal\u00eda\u2019s Glastonbury set (\u201cIf you\u2019re not at Rosal\u00eda you\u2019re missing out\u201d \u2013 Laura Snapes, 2019). You can find out more about Madonna\u2019s favourite flamenco star by reading tomorrow\u2019s Guardian Guide cover feature here. Norman, Norman ... if there\u2019s one thing you should have learned about Glastonbury by now it\u2019s that: 1) Nobody wants to be reminded about the toilets. 2) And nobody wants to be reminded just how much cleaner the backstage ones are. So while our writers head off to indulge themselves in the joys of a sunny Glastonbury, you lot now have the joy of following along live with me, Tim Jonze, from the Guardian\u2019s rather less sunny office. I forgot my cider, sadly, but I do have a steaming hot cup of FOMO beside me right now. Still, we\u2019ve got the television \u2013 and each other \u2013 so we\u2019re surely in for a fun-packed Friday night. I\u2019ve just tuned into Lauryn Hill singing the beautiful To Zion, which seems a fairly good place to start as we build up to Stormzy\u2019s historic set. Great lineup tonight up at the Crow\u2019s Nest \u2013 essentially a grab bag of the best in new indie. With the best view on the whole site! My first Vegan Fried Chicken hot wings \u2013 I\u2019ll be honest, I wouldn\u2019t mistake this battered seitan for chicken even after seven pints of cider, but they are indeed \u201cperfectly pleasant\u201d as my Glasto guinea pig put it, especially with a liberal sloshing of tangy hot sauce to disguise the fact wheat protein doesn\u2019t actually taste of anything. \u201cNo annoying bones either\u201d she observes (ah, those annoying chickens with their inconvenient skeletons). Perfect 2am Glasto food. It\u2019s one rule for them and it\u2019s one rule for us, eh? The Charlatans are on right now, on the Other Stage \u2013 a last minute booking after Snow Patrol pulled out due to injuries in the band. Lauryn Hill is currently on the Pyramid stage. Ammar Kalia is watching: \u201cOnly 15 minutes late, she is playing a gospel-focused rendition of her debut album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, on its 20th anniversary, featuring an extended reggae breakdown version of Forgive Them Father and a high-energy Everything Is Everything. The crowd is drifting in and out of attention, though, as she keeps cutting to vocal breaks and recorded album skits.\u201d Full review to come after the set. Our celeb-spotting has been a bit rubbish to be honest. Team Guardian have spotted Dominic Cooper, Zo\u00eb Ball, and that\u2019s about it so far ... except for Dua Lipa, who everyone seems to have seen everywhere. She is out there, to use the appropriate parlance, serving looks. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has wished Stormzy well with his headline set tonight. You may remember that Corbs has form in this regard \u2013 he celebrated the rapper at the 2017 GQ and Mobo awards, saying: \u201cThis year grime artists played a huge part in setting the agenda for British music and, in the General Election, your contribution helped secure the highest youth turnout in a quarter of a century, showing the positive impact grime has on our society.\u201d Stormzy for his part told the Guardian in 2016: \u201cMy man, Jeremy! Young Jeremy, my guy. I dig what he says. I saw some sick picture of him from back in the day when he was campaigning about anti-apartheid and I thought: yeah, I like your energy ... I feel like he gets what the ethnic minorities are going through and the homeless and the working class.\u201d Also delivering best wishes is, er, Raymond Blanc. Our reporter Lanre Bakare has been exploring how British jazz is continuing to have A Moment \u2013 half the Glastonbury lineup seems to be various jazz outfits playing solo or joining forces. Paging Felicity! This wisdom sounds like it was extremely hard-won. And in other food-related commentary: Anyone looking for spiritual enlightenment would have gone some way to finding it at BCUC\u2019s show at West Holts. The Soweto-based band say that \u201cmusic has the power to heal our minds by freeing our bodies\u201d, and they pair ancestral rhythms with raucous punk energy. At times, the frontman screeches like a metaller. The six-piece give everyone a masterclass in how to hype the crowd, with their drum-heavy party music, freewheeling into jazz and gospel, and nonstop dancing. Then they wryly announce: \u201cAnd now, we are going to begin our set\u201d. They are, perhaps, the only band at this festival who can make a vuvuzela solo sound good. But there is also an underlying political undertone, as their singer says that \u201cwhite people have been in South Africa for generations\u201d and so it was \u201cimportant to find a way to live together\u201d. Congas, bass drum and bass collide in a shadowy, sometimes dub-indebted fusion and then erupts into something resembling happy hardcore, Zulu style. By the sounds of the yells from the crowd, plenty of people have found themselves here this afternoon. The Fiona Apple vibes are strong this weekend: Billie Eilish\u2019s showtunes side owes a debt to the LA songwriter, as does the finely wrought melancholy of young New Yorker King Princess. KP \u2013 AKA Mikaela Strauss \u2013 was only born in 1998, but her music is steeped in 90s angst, all gritted-teeth delivery and shimmering soft rock, with an All Saints-style crop top and low-slung baggy jeans to match. But she\u2019s just as much a product of her era, subverting traditional torch songcraft further by centring her perspective as a queer woman. Her single 1950 is a heavenly devotional to a lover, also a tribute to the pioneering lesbians of the past who had to love in secret, and a gorgeous singalong moment. Then there\u2019s Pussy Is God, a self-explanatory number that hews closer to low-key contemporary R&amp;B \u2013 although it\u2019s a little indistinct for such a strident sentiment. So is her set as a whole. Little comes close to the rapturous 1950, it\u2019s all a bit too mid-range, and low on the intrigue that allows Lana Del Rey to elevate similar fare to a cult concern. Bringing on Mark Ronson \u2013 who signed Strauss to his label \u2013 adds a brief frisson of recognition but not much more. Saying that, the woozy pace is perfect for a crowd worn down by the piercing heat. I\u2019m in Control, our Janet Jackson themed interrogation of Glastonbury-goers, continues with Stefanie and Andy \u2013 they tell us what they would do if they were in control of the festival. Stefanie: They should make the whole thing vegetarian like Mandala does. I know it\u2019s on a farm and they promote veganism, but if they\u2019re gonna practice what they preach it should be full. Andy: A full immersive experience of the culture they\u2019re trying to provide. Upon entering the festival they should say, this is the world we are trying to create. People who think they hate veggie food would probably be pleasantly surprised. Stefanie: Apart from that I wouldn\u2019t change anything. We are nitpicking because we love this place! Michael Eavis, the festival\u2019s founding father, has been telling an adoring audience on the Acoustic stage that T Rex\u2019s Marc Bolan was his favourite ever Glastonbury act. Eavis, 83, said that after the Kinks dropped out of the first ever Glastonbury festival in 1970, Bolan agreed to step in for \u00a3500, paid in \u00a3100 monthly instalments. \u201cHe was absolutely amazing,\u201d Eavis said. \u201cHe was so good. It was a lovely sunny evening ... and 500 lovely hippies turned up and it was really wonderful. We lost a fortune actually. And to this day he is still one of my heroes of all time.\u201d He reminisced about the time David Bowie played at 4.30am on the summer solstice in 1971. \u201cHe looked good, with his long hair. He was dressed like a duchess or something.\u201d Eavis said he would carry on running the festival for \u201canother 10 years at least\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping for Fleetwood Mac one day, but we can\u2019t afford them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to bring their prices down\u201d \u2013 perhaps putting paid to rumours the band would headline the festival\u2019s 50th anniversary next year. UK garage producer Conducta is making his Glastonbury debut tonight and has announced it in the waviest fashion imaginable. Those not schooled in the Mac DeMarco style of spacey yacht rock, who stumbled across his sun\u2013drenched afternoon set on the Other Stage, could be forgiven for thinking his band were playing a parody of their music; a novelty group entertaining a crowd that\u2019s well in on the joke. That joke seemed to reach its peak with DeMarco\u2019s 2019 album, Here Comes the Cowboy, which includes songs like Choo Choo \u2013 featuring the refrain \u201cChoo choo take a ride with me\u201d \u2013 and the title track, which simply repeats \u201chere comes the cowboy\u201d over and over. Live, the trolling continued, with the ensemble pulling antics that ranged from DeMarco\u2019s handstand with a cigarette in his mouth, and playing the guitar behind his back, a topless clave break from the rhythm guitarist, and an extended musing on the best pies in the UK, prompted by the Real Sausages and Real Mash stand opposite. Yet, behind all the effrontery is DeMarco\u2019s silky smooth voice and infectious hooks. His band are a well-oiled machine, seamlessly moving through the spangly Americana of his breakout previous records, Salad Days and This Old Dog, keeping the crowd hooked on every key change and instrumental break. Ultimately, it\u2019s hard to know where DeMarco the songwriter ends and DeMarco the performer begins \u2013 or whether there is a difference there at all \u2013 but beneath the cheap laughs is a true musical talent, one which could really capture our attention if it was given a little more room to breathe. That Lewis Capaldi gets about doesn\u2019t he? Here he is popping up during Bastille\u2019s Pyramid stage set, just after his secret set for BBC Introducing. Bastille\u2019s lead singer Dan draped himself in an EU flag too. More people are telling us what they would do if they controlled Glastonbury (our nod to Janet Jackson\u2019s masterful Control). Here\u2019s good-egg-looking Nick. I wouldn\u2019t want to change much to be honest. The way they do it is spot on. They seem to get a good balance between new acts and legends. If I had to pick a legend for that slot next year I\u2019d go for Elton John. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019d be too big for that slot but he could always do the Sunday. I also feel that this year there are too many people here, it\u2019s so rammed, so I\u2019d look into that. But everything else is spot on. I sound like such a super fan but I manage things for a living and it\u2019s so well done here. The atmosphere is so, so good. Our news reporters Lanre Bakare and Frances Perraudin have been assessing the general Glastonbury sentiment towards Boris Johnson. Let\u2019s just say he might want to focus on building a bus from a wine box rather than read the story below. Petit fours \u2013 because who can walk past a sign for an ice cream sandwich without putting off the alternative folk bagpipe rock for a minute? \u00a35 gets you two chocolate cookies with any ice cream flavour you like from the Mendip Moments menu. I\u2019d recommend the banana and salted caramel, and also eating it before it melts all over the clothes you\u2019re planning to wear for the next three days. Fontaines DC seem hellbent on claiming the prize of hardest working band at Glasto. Clearly the three performances the Dublin post-punkers have already lined up at the festival are not sufficient \u2013 they step in at the last minute here after illness put paid to Sam Fender\u2019s set. That work ethic is very much on show in their taut, coiled spring of a set too. Singer Grian Chatten marauds across the stage, radiating a sulky, scratchy intensity. You can barely draw your eyes away from him, a point not lost on the rest of the band: at one point, in a desperate piece of daredevil attention-seeking, guitarist Carlos O\u2019Connell climbs up the John Peel rig, strumming away as he dangles. He needn\u2019t have bothered: Fontaines are exciting enough without the high-wire act, rattling furiously through standouts Big and Boys in the Better Land and prompting an unlikely singalong moment with the barked chorus of Too Real. It\u2019ll be a tough set to top \u2013 though they\u2019ve got three more chances to do just that this weekend. Bastille are currently playing the Pyramid to serious whoops and sunshine euphoria. In honour of Janet Jackson playing the Pyramid stage tomorrow \u2013 including the absolute diamond banger Control \u2013 we\u2019re asking Glastonbury-goers what they would do if they were in control of the festival. Up next is Jo Shepherd: \u201cSeriously, if I was in charge, I\u2019d love to see Thirty Seconds to Mars on the main stage. Also, McFly need to be on the Pyramid stage too, 100%. I\u2019m not kidding. I\u2019d also make sure there weren\u2019t any clashes between big female artists like there are this year. I\u2019d also get Foals to headline next year, because they\u2019ve released an incredible album and have one on the way. I\u2019d love the 1975 to appear too. Actually, I\u2019m surprised they weren\u2019t here this year. In terms of the festival in general, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. It\u2019s such a special place.\u201d Next in our Glastonbury People\u2019s Assembly, Conor thinks Brexit is unfixable: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can fix Brexit. I think it\u2019s unfixable, a shit show. We have to go along with what we\u2019ve voted as a country, whatever people think about which side is right or wrong, because if we don\u2019t go along with it, in the long run ... there will be a much worse Brexit, an unconceivable Brexit where someone like Tommy Robinson gets in [to power]. When people don\u2019t think they\u2019re thought about, or cared about, they often go to extremes.\u201d Gareth Colvin of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has a tip for campers struggling with the heat. \u201cI came to Glastonbury on Wednesday morning. The sun was beaming down on me. I woke up really early, and I said \u2018I\u2019m not having another night like that.\u2019\u201d He left the site, drove to a camping shop an hour and a half away, bought a foil blanket, and returned and taped it over his tent with gaffer tape. \u201cAnd it was really cool this morning. It was like sleeping in a fridge, it was lovely.\u201d The solar-powered fairy lights are not only festive, but demarcate their area, says Colvin. \u201cAnd they\u2019re energy efficient.\u201d Three years after the Brexit vote took place during Glastonbury weekend, and with growing desire for a people\u2019s assembly to discuss what to do about leaving the EU, we\u2019re creating our own Glastonbury People\u2019s Assembly \u2013 asking everyone for their take on what to do next. Over to Rachel and Leslie: Leslie: \u201c[The Irish backstop] was always there \u2013 it just wasn\u2019t talked about [in the first referendum]. So no one could make a valid judgement. The only judgements people made were from the heart.\u201d Rachel: \u201cWe need to have another referendum. I think people are realising the complexity of it. However, it isn\u2019t democratic to do that \u2013 that\u2019s the only dilemma.\u201d For dessert, Vietnamese squid with lime, coriander, garlic, chilli and fish sauce, from the brilliantly named Squid Inc \u2013 smooth and tender as a soft-boiled egg, with a savoury hit from the fish sauce (which they say hails from the beautiful island of Phu Quoc, bringing back painful memories of a holiday where everyone refused to come on a guided tour of the nam pla factory with me). Could have done with a bit more crisping if I\u2019m being nitpicky, but I finished it anyway, obviously Is there anything more joyful than watching a young act experience their first big Glastonbury moment? Up on the Park stage, Georgia\u2019s intriguing one-woman setup \u2013 an electronic drum kit made up of red hexagon-shaped pads \u2013 draws in curious onlookers, who leave converted by her bass-heavy, emotionally gripping electronic pop: halfway between pirate radio bootleg and Chicago house, sweet as Tegan and Sara yet spooky as Fever Ray. It\u2019s even more impressive, given that she\u2019s playing a set of largely unheard material \u2013 Georgia was supposed to release her second album this year, but the runaway success of singles Started Out and About Work the Dancefloor, both A-listed at Radio 1, prompted her surprised label Domino to push it back to give her time to build. Judging by the response in the field, they\u2019ve got gold on their hands: you know a song is good when it prompts the crowd to manifest a spontaneous, unified dance move, as happens when she plays a track likely titled Pick Up Your Ray Guns (the move is self-explanatory). With their pummelling rhythm sections, many of her songs have a battle cry energy \u2013 \u201cThey can try and stop us now but they won\u2019t succeed\u201d; \u201cA little bit of nonsense to create disturbance\u201d \u2013 which makes them feel of this politicised moment (the stage is surrounded by posters encouraging environmental activism) in a totally natural way, by comparisson with how laboured much of today\u2019s explicitly woke pop can feel. For emphasis, she raises her drumsticks above her head in a warrior pose, and hops off her rig for the occasional celebratory jump, her tight curls bouncing \u2013 a display that\u2019s totally endearing and totally earned. Her set brilliantly juxtaposes grit and tenderness. On one slinky, creeping song, she raps menacingly about vodka jello and amaretto; on a tender, slower love song, she shows her knack for singing with power and vulnerability. She also dedicates a track to a friend\u2019s father who died yesterday, and who attended the first ever Glastonbury festival in 1970. But Georgia\u2019s crowning glory is her frisky club pop, and she closes with the two songs that kickstarted this new phase of her career, one that looks to take her from indie curio to genuine star: after About Work the Dancefloor, a song worthy of Robyn in her Body Talk era, she tells a crowd as sweaty from dancing as from the 28 degree heat that she is lost for words, and seems genuinely humbled. It gets better: she teases the beginning of Started Out, singing its verses tenderly before triggering the sexy, fidgety Mr Fingers-indebted beat. Everyone loses it. The only way it could be better is if it were 2am, not 2pm. A star. Heartening news for fans of Two Door Cinema Club: after a break-in at their lockup, a giant fire extinguisher stage prop was nicked, but it\u2019s found their way back to them just in time for their Other Stage set at 8.15pm tonight. It\u2019s unclear whether Sheryl Crow alters her rules vis-a-vis toilet paper at a festival. For those who don\u2019t have this story locked in their memory banks, in 2007 Crow suggested people should limit themselves to one sheet of loo roll per visit, or two to three for those \u201cpesky occasions\u201d. She doesn\u2019t offer up any answers during her mid afternoon slot on the Pyramid stage (her first appearance here in 22 years), when the crowd is a sea of fold-out chairs, three quarter length shorts and sensible hats. She and her seven-piece band don\u2019t waste much time either, opening with If It Makes You Happy \u2013 she bellows out the \u201cI still like to get stoned\u201d line with extra gusto \u2013 before segueing into a beefed up A Change Will Do You Good, which features an altered lyric: \u201cWe need a change in America / that\u2019s all I got to say\u201d. The hits keep coming: for All I Wanna Do, she waltzes along the front row doling out advice \u2013 \u201cYou need to put on some sunscreen\u201d she says to one woman, while a man is urged to drink more water \u2013 before an elongated My Favourite Mistake sees her venturing up into the wings. The hit-heavy start means the set sags slightly when songs from this August\u2019s Threads are aired back to back, but there\u2019s enough charisma on stage to keep people\u2019s attention. Especially cute is when she name checks her two young sons before the planet-focused The Best of Times, the pair acting as guitar techs for the set. The environmental theme continues later when she dedicates the gorgeously lilting Soak Up the Sun to Greta Thunberg. By the time the classic Everyday Is a Winding Road kicks in, she\u2019s back in the crowd\u2019s palm, posing for photos and even sharing a kiss with a sunburnt punter. The secret sets are starting \u2013 Lewis Capaldi turned up unannounced on the BBC Introducing Stage earlier this afternoon. Sturdy helping of beef and vegetable momos from the Tibetan Kitchen, a bit of a bargain as part of the festival\u2019s Food for a Fiver meal deal initiative (look for the stickers on menus - over 75% of stalls are taking part). Just half of this has left me unable to dance for the rest of the afternoon. Make sure you get a big dollop of the chunky chilli and garlic sauce \u2014 it really makes it. The temperature is spiking and the vibes are currently extremely strong. The image below is actually from Glastonbury, not Coachella! Sheryl Crow has had a rapturous singalong reception on the Pyramid stage \u2013 we\u2019ll review her set shortly. Three years after the Brexit vote took place during Glastonbury weekend, and with growing desire for a people\u2019s assembly to discuss what to do about leaving the EU, we\u2019re creating our own Glastonbury People\u2019s Assembly \u2013 asking everyone for their take on what to do next. First up it\u2019s George, 25, from London. \u201cWe definitely need a people\u2019s vote, because the first one seemed to be rigged. Why should we be bound by that one decision they make? It\u2019s an outdated system. Failing that, we should just put Boris in the bin.\u201d Tomorrow we\u2019ll have Lauren Cochrane assessing the fashion trends of Glastonbury 2019, but I can\u2019t see how anyone will top these fine specimens dressed at Glastonbury 2019. Name a more iconic duo, etc, etc. Could there be a little special appearance at each others\u2019 sets? Kudos to anyone who spots Gary Lineker! Bonus points if he\u2019s attempting coitus with some potato snacks. Lots of bonus points. \u201c2 SLEEPS UNTIL KYLIE\u201d \u2013 our favourite flag so far! First conversation of the day: \u201cYou said you want to see Acid Mother\u2019s Temple? Japanese? Very hairy? They\u2019re camped just down there. Eating a pack of Pringles for their breakfast.\u201d Breakfast of champions: hall of famers in the eastern chapter of krautrock, they bring the noise to West Holts. The erupting opening, the unapologetic dirge, the bit where the motorik beat hits, the guitar tickling, the beards \u2013 splendid beards, best of the festival already ... thank the cosmic heavens for letting Kawabata Makoto and the changing cast of the band loose once again. As one of the Guardian\u2019s food writers, I\u2019ve been sent on a quest to find the greatest food at Glastonbury. Across the weekend I\u2019ll be posting my finds \u2013 I\u2019d love to hear your tips! Post in the comments of the liveblog, or tweet me @FelicityCloake. First stop: The Peckish Peacock, largely chosen because it has a big sign declaring it Festival Caterer of the Year 2018 and I couldn\u2019t wait any longer. Fabulous crisp onion pakoras (I called them bhajis but they were nice about it) and a Very Wholesome spinach and chickpea curry. Luckily I travel with my own salt (of course I do). The Left Field stage, Glastonbury\u2019s home of activism and political discussion, opened today with a debate on the legacy of Theresa May\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d, featuring testimony from individuals who had been directly affected by it. Joining the panel\u2019s host, Guardian columnist John Harris, was Michael Braithwaite, a special needs teaching assistant who lost his job in 2016 after being told his immigration status was questionable. Braithwaite, who came to Britain from Trinidad in 1961, only had his status resolved after his story was featured in the Guardian\u2019s reporting on the Windrush scandal. He said that he was one of the lucky ones, compared with those who have been imprisoned or deported as a result of the hostile environment policy. Another panellist, Laura Clarke, told of how her partner was denied a UK visa due to a Home Office rule that says UK citizens must meet a minimum income threshold of \u00a318,600 for sponsoring a foreign spouse. Clarke met her partner Biniyam Tesfaye while teaching in Ethiopia, but she and her son had been separated from Tesfaye for much of the past three years because of the \u201ccruel\u201d measure. \u201cMy partner missed Christmas, birthdays, even our son\u2019s birth,\u201d she said. Also on the panel were Guardian commentator Gary Younge and Minnie Rahman of charity the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants. Young told the audience that the Windrush scandal was a direct result of a mischaracterisation of immigrants. \u201cThere\u2019s a notion that immigrants are people who take and scrounge \u2013 when in fact they help built this country,\u201d he said. Continuing our I\u2019m in Control feature where \u2013 in honour of Janet Jackson \u2013 we ask punters what they would do if they were in charge of Glastonbury, Georgie Rogers offers her thoughts: \u201cI\u2019d want everyone to be able to teleport from area to area so we can maximise party time and save our feet.\u201d In what was described by an audience member as a \u201cvery brave\u201d move, Zac Goldsmith appeared on stage at Glastonbury\u2019s Speaker\u2019s Forum on Friday afternoon. The Conservative MP for Richmond Park and former London mayoral candidate was booed on to the platform, with members of the audience unveiling a banner reading: \u201cTory policy kills. Don\u2019t greenwash the lives lost to austerity.\u201d Goldsmith, an environmentalist and editor of the Ecologist magazine, said there was a role for civil disobedience in combatting climate change. \u201cI think there is a massive place for pressure, whether it\u2019s civil disobedience or direct action or peaceful protest,\u201d he said in response to a question from the audience. \u201cNormally I think a protest is more effective if it doesn\u2019t annoy ordinary people but being heard is essential. I\u2019ve seen the effect of people being heard on parliament in the last few months.\u201d Asked, yes or no, if he supported the Extinction Rebellion movement, he said \u201cYes\u201d. Questioned about his support for Boris Johnson in the Conservative party leadership race, Goldsmith insisted that the front-runner was not a climate change sceptic. But as recently as 2015, Johnson claimed that \u201cglobal leaders were driven by a primitive fear that the present ambient warm weather is somehow caused by humanity; and that fear \u2013 as far as I understand the science \u2013 is equally without foundation.\u201d \u201cHe is really not a climate sceptic,\u201d said Goldsmith. \u201cHe has written many, many things talking about the imperative of taking action of climate change.\u201d Unsurprisingly, the issue of drug-taking came up, in light of Tory-leadership hopefuls being forced to come clan about their histories with illegal substances. \u201cI was expelled from school for drugs, so I can\u2019t really deny it,\u201d said Goldsmith, who elaborated that he had smoked \u201cold fashioned Jamaican woodbine\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t actually think what people get up to in their private lives, particularly before they become an MP, is relevant,\u201d he said. \u201cI think most people have done things that they would rather not see in a newspaper. But one thing that should emerge from this episode is that parliament and government need to acknowledge that drugs laws don\u2019t work.\u201d Glasto is heavy on UK jazz this year and flying the flag, quite literally at the Park stage, are Steam Down, a young 11-piece from south London, one of whom has seemingly been employed just to wave their logo-printed banner in the air during the show. Steam Down are notable among the jazz community for their weekly roadblock jam session in a tiny Deptford space, in which they encourage audience participation and a communal spirit, so it\u2019s curious to see how their spiritual jazz, Afrofuturist spoken word and DIY vibe will fare al fresco, when everyone is sitting down and eating overpriced falafel. Turns out, their set works brilliantly. Though it takes a while for the energy to get going, their show is loose and free-flowing, as opposed to overly staged. Each player is moving to their own beat \u2013 you can lock into Rosie Turton\u2019s trombone, or Wonky Logic\u2019s woozy keytar, and find your own cosmic groove. On lead vocals, meanwhile, Nadeem Din-Gabisi is the Andre 3000 to Brother Portrait\u2019s Big Boi, whose playful delivery contrasts with his co-pilot\u2019s Ghostpoet-style enunciation. What\u2019s striking, though, is the band\u2019s range. They bring out dancers for the afrobeat-punchy Infinity, clear the stage for an understated duet between the two female vocalists and guest Sampa the Great, and have just as many neo-soul songs as they do sax solos. Their best moments, however, are the upbeat, rowdier ones, a shot of positivity and a vital celebration of genres \u2013 grime, dub, jazz \u2013 that underline the new sound of London. As far as inspirations for songs go, 21-year-old Leicester singer-songwriter Mahalia seems to have it down pat: \u201cI like to write songs about the guys that I like, the dickheads, the girls that I like and the bitches,\u201d she said defiantly as she opened her early-afternoon set on the John Peel stage. Channeling the confessional lyricism of Brandy and early-2000s American neo soul, Mahalia\u2019s honeyed vocals were pitch-perfect as she launched through a selection of songs from her debut album, Diary of Me, and the Seasons EP: the infectious melodies of self-empowerment anthem Do Not Disturb, the trap-soul One Night Only and the jazz-laden Sober. She has a new album coming in September, and the way new single Sinner sounded, with its radio-friendly dancehall rhythm and full-throated chorus, it is set to push Mahalia further into the mainstream. Singing with a permanent smile and dropping out of vocal lines to take regular dance-breaks, Mahalia\u2019s enthusiasm rippled through the crowd \u2013 the perfect enlivener to start the festival. \u201cIt\u2019s my third time at Glastonbury and it\u2019s the first time it\u2019s not raining,\u201d hollers Danish agit-pop practitioner M\u00d8 to suitably relieved cheers. Not that she\u2019s dressed for the occasion, with long lace gloves and a wide brimmed black hat making her look like she\u2019s about to bury a lover. It\u2019s a suitable look for a pop star who veers closer to underlying angst than the shimmering synth scapes of her fellow Scandinavians. Despite last year\u2019s underrated third album, Forever Neverland, disappearing without trace, she wins over a surprisingly vast crowd, initiating clapalongs during Pilgrim, pogoing during Burn and shouting out the festival organisers for ditching plastic bottles before introducing the next song as \u201cnot being about water, but wine\u201d, while swigging a glass of red. For the dancehall-tinged Nostalgia, she even gets in the crowd, moshing with the fourth row, before a closing double whammy of her Major Lazer collaboration Lean On and certified banger Final Song cements her as the festival\u2019s early highlight. Hearty applause to our fellow media types at the Metro for this wonderfully troll-y story. Bj\u00f6rn Again\u2019s aesthetic in a nutshell: fake Bj\u00f6rn\u2019s name is written on the back of his polyester blue kimono in comic sans. Opening the Pyramid stage, the fantastically low-rent Abba tribute act leave no potential gag uncracked \u2013 including throwing scratch cards into the crowd during Money, Money, Money \u2013 and play up the couples\u2019 relationship travails in a display hammier than what the nearby sausage stall has on offer. It is, of course, glorious: Benny is in red, fittingly resembling pop\u2019s Santa as he delivers some of the greatest songs of all time to the giant crowd with such extreme gusto you can only imagine his piano keys are reduced to stumps. A woman in the crowd drinks a box of Pinot Grigio straight from the tap. This is the correct response. Not even Fake Benny deciding to drop a rap breakdown during Take a Chance on Me can spoil proceedings, nor the group\u2019s accents, which make the Muppets\u2019 Swedish chef sound like a native speaker, nor the tumbleweed that bounces across the field as Benny claims during a crowd sing-off that his side has the most Stormzy fans: the Venn diagram of their fanbases appears to be two distinct circles. What is bittersweet is the tantalising prospect of the real thing doing it one day \u2013 though going by the evident love behind Bj\u00f6rn Again, their tatty props and golf ball-sized crystal adornments, you suspect the four champs on stage wouldn\u2019t mind being put out of business by the real thing. Until then, long May the ringers reign. Another highlight from yesterday was England\u2019s 3-0 win in the Women\u2019s World Cup, screened on the West Holts stage to jubilant effect. Extinction Rebellion staged a major protest yesterday, which culminated in this pretty stunning helicopter shot: Read up on it all below. Meanwhile at the Unfairground, Glastonbury gonna Glastonbury. In honour of Janet Jackson playing the Pyramid stage tomorrow \u2013 including the absolute diamond banger Control \u2013 we\u2019re asking Glastonbury-goers what they would do if they were in control of the festival. First up to the plate is Roseanne, 27, from London. \u201cIf I had control of Glasto I\u2019d make myself Stormzy\u2019s backing dancer or hype girl. I\u2019d put more showers around, definitely. And I\u2019d let everyone have VIP access for the day or at least give me and my friends a backstage pass.\u201d Everyone goes on about how magical and spiritual Glastonbury is, but, you know, it sort of is? The Vaccines are kicking off the Other stage. You might have expected them to headline it at some point, but indie-rock has waned hard out of the zeitgeist \u2013 a bit of a shame for them, as their last album Combat Sports was their best yet. Well, at least one guy is in absolute raptures. Unveiled at the top of the site, near the Park stage, is a collaboration between Tory antagonists Led By Donkeys and Steve McFadden-based collagist Cold War Steve. Headlining tonight is Stormzy, who has posted an emotive message to Twitter ahead of his performance: What better way to kick off Glastonbury with some free-improv math punk fronted by a man who sounds as if someone force-fed Jeff Buckley a fistful of hornets? If there is one, a surprising amount of people haven\u2019t found it, judging by the packed William\u2019s Green tent for Black Midi\u2019s breakfast set. The Brit School graduates\u2019 (yep, really ) brand of managed chaos can frustrate on record \u2013 not least because of vocalist Geordie Greep\u2019s mannered, strangulated howl. But live it makes sense in a strange way, the passages of meandering jazz giving way to some genuinely thrilling, doomy riffage. A bracing, bludgeoning wake-up call. Ammar Kalia has just met yet more people who can\u2019t get enough of George Ezra, and are camping out at the very front of the Pyramid stage all day long. Kate, 25; Matt, 26 Kate: It\u2019s our first time at Glastonbury, and we were so excited when they announced George Ezra was playing. W e had to get here early and get right to the front. We\u2019ve got coffee and rum to keep us going, and we can\u2019t wait to hear Paradise in the sun. Carol, 50; Mike, 52 Carol: it\u2019s my first time at any festival and my first time camping. We had to get to the front for George Ezra \u2013 he\u2019s just so fun and always has a great time when he\u2019s on stage. We\u2019ve got George in the sun and pink G&amp;Ts \u2013 we don\u2019t need anything else. Kicking off the Pyramid stage are Bj\u00f6rn Again, running through Abba\u2019s bangers. They\u2019ve just dropped Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! and it\u2019s giving me life. We\u2019re at the front of the Pyramid stage, where people are already getting in position for George Ezra, who is on at 8.15pm. Get these people some suncream and water, stat! Karin, 46; Sian, 24; Julia, 48; Pam, 66; Sophie, 36 Sian: There\u2019s three generations of us here, my mum, auntie and grandma. I\u2019ve brought them all along for their first Glastonbury and we can\u2019t wait to see Stormzy. I absolutely love him and I\u2019ve never seen him live before, so I had to be up close and personal. My gran is still to be convinced, so I had to force her to the front! Tobias: I saw George Ezra on the BBC Introducing stage here a couple of years ago and it\u2019s amazing to see him on the Pyramid now, especially for Nancy\u2019s first Glastonbury. We\u2019re not moving \u2013 we\u2019ve just got drinks with us, since we\u2019ve already had a full English brekkie. It\u2019s my third time spending all day at the front \u2013 the last time was for the Arctic Monkeys. There\u2019s just something so special about being at the front \u2013 you get on the big screen and the atmosphere is amazing. You can\u2019t get this kind of experience anywhere else. If you\u2019re not hanging out with the drag queens but are follwoing along at home instead, we\u2019ve made a guide to the best stuff to watch on the BBC who are here all weekend. (The crew have their own lockable showers, which, frankly, is galling.) Last night we were down at Block9, the \u201cnaughty corner\u201d where lots of the best late-night action happens \u2013 including some truly fabulous leather drag kings and queens at the NYC Downlow club, styled like a grimy New York meatpacking-district club. Emphasis on the meatpacking. Get down early tonight as the queues get massive. Tonight there\u2019s a brilliant lineup featuring Midland, Prosumer and Erick Morillo. There was also the unveiling of the awesome IICON stage, home to cutting-edge techno and electronic mayhem set inside a giant head. You may need to hold the hand of your most fragile friend if you happen upon this later. Morning! Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s Glastonbury liveblog. We\u2019ll be following the action on Worthy Farm all weekend long, reviewing the key gigs, but also looking at what the 200,000-odd people attending are getting up to. There will be glitter. Everyone is walking around in a bit of a happy daze thanks to the weather, which is set to be truly scorching today \u2013 there isn\u2019t a cloud in the sky, and they\u2019re handing out free suncream.",

Or they\u2019re going to sue me \u2026 and that wouldn\u2019t be bad either, to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>As well as being a pun on Guitar Center\u2019s returns policy, the album title refers to Callinan\u2019s intention to tone down the bravado \u2013 which, he says, was a reaction to wearing his heart on his sleeve so much in his earlier years. Somehow that vulnerability morphed into playing an outrageous character, he says, without that really being the intention.</p> <p>\u201cIt was easier, as a performer in the age of social media, to betray my own intelligence all the time for a cheap \u2018like\u2019 or two, playing into the vacuum a bit,\u201d he says. \u201cIt came back to bite me, if I can speak candidly. I think some of the reactions that I\u2019ve had on some moral or political grounds have largely come from people being annoyed by my obnoxiousness or my willingness to do dumb things without recourse, when they expected better from me. So when, if, I fucked up, I wasn\u2019t given much grace or shown much mercy.\u201d</p> <p>In Australia, Callinan\u2019s rather stuck between a rock and a hard place. Just as there are those early fans, he suspects, who feel let down by the art pranks he embarked on, there are more recent fans who will feel betrayed by words of contrition. It explains why he was so drawn to one more cover on the album, Robert Wyatt\u2019s Signed Curtain, with its dispiriting acknowledgement that composing a song in order to connect can be a wasted effort.</p> <p>\u201cI found that so heartbreaking,\u201d says Callinan, \u201cthe idea that I would be so hellbent on getting someone\u2019s affection \u2013 or collective affection \u2013 that I would form a band and record this song and sing it with all my heart, only to admit that this is futile.\u201d</p> <p>But that, surely, is the essence of every songwriter, the desire to be understood.</p> <p>\u201cTotally,\u201d he says. \u201cBut few admit their failings and Robert Wyatt just admits that, actually, this is all bullshit. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Kirin J Callinan\u2019s Return To Centre is out now through EMI. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/KirinJCallinan/events/?ref=page_internal\">Callinan is touring Australia through August</a></em></p> <p>\u2022 <em>This article was amended on 1 July to correct a reference to Callinan\u2019s band members</em></p>",

He even \u201cborrowed\u201d the company\u2019s branding for the album artwork. \u201cIf anything, I\u2019m celebrating with them,\u201d he says, trying on that idea like a new coif. \u201cIt would be the ultimate \u2018return to center\u2019 if they see it that way and stock my record and I do in-store performances. Or they\u2019re going to sue me \u2026 and that wouldn\u2019t be bad either, to be honest.\u201d As well as being a pun on Guitar Center\u2019s returns policy, the album title refers to Callinan\u2019s intention to tone down the bravado \u2013 which, he says, was a reaction to wearing his heart on his sleeve so much in his earlier years. Somehow that vulnerability morphed into playing an outrageous character, he says, without that really being the intention. \u201cIt was easier, as a performer in the age of social media, to betray my own intelligence all the time for a cheap \u2018like\u2019 or two, playing into the vacuum a bit,\u201d he says. \u201cIt came back to bite me, if I can speak candidly. I think some of the reactions that I\u2019ve had on some moral or political grounds have largely come from people being annoyed by my obnoxiousness or my willingness to do dumb things without recourse, when they expected better from me. So when, if, I fucked up, I wasn\u2019t given much grace or shown much mercy.\u201d In Australia, Callinan\u2019s rather stuck between a rock and a hard place. Just as there are those early fans, he suspects, who feel let down by the art pranks he embarked on, there are more recent fans who will feel betrayed by words of contrition. It explains why he was so drawn to one more cover on the album, Robert Wyatt\u2019s Signed Curtain, with its dispiriting acknowledgement that composing a song in order to connect can be a wasted effort. \u201cI found that so heartbreaking,\u201d says Callinan, \u201cthe idea that I would be so hellbent on getting someone\u2019s affection \u2013 or collective affection \u2013 that I would form a band and record this song and sing it with all my heart, only to admit that this is futile.\u201d But that, surely, is the essence of every songwriter, the desire to be understood. \u201cTotally,\u201d he says. \u201cBut few admit their failings and Robert Wyatt just admits that, actually, this is all bullshit. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \u2022 Kirin J Callinan\u2019s Return To Centre is out now through EMI. Callinan is touring Australia through August \u2022 This article was amended on 1 July to correct a reference to Callinan\u2019s band members",

This time, Ertz is simply locking down the middle of the field, so much so that Jill Ellis can have the confidence not to play Lindsey Horan. (Not that the Horan benching was a good idea.) </li> <li>You simply cannot sleep on Tobin Heath on the right flank. Imagine if she had as many chances as Rapinoe has had. She might have hat tricks of goals and assists by now. </li> </ul> <p>And give credit to Megan Rapinoe. She\u2019s a lightning rod for controversy, by choice. She might lose five straight 1v1 battles and then kill an opponent on the sixth. She made her name as one of the best crossers of the ball (think of her long floated ball to Abby Wambach at the death against Brazil) and has just added to her game since then.

She has experience playing with an against the French players. She sat out the round of 16 game against Spain until the very end, perhaps because she was carrying a yellow card, and a second would put her out of action for the game against France. </p> <p>As it turns out, that didn\u2019t matter. Out of the four main US midfielders -- Horan, defensive destroyer / attacker <strong>Julie Ertz</strong>, two-way player <strong>Samantha Mewis</strong>, and playmaker <strong>Rose Lavelle</strong> -- Horan is the one that sits. </p> <p>Another option Jill Ellis would have had -- sit <strong>Becky Sauerbrunn</strong>, one of the finest defenders in women\u2019s soccer\u2019s relatively brief history but coming off some minor injury concerns and a major mistake against Spain, to move Ertz to center back. Didn\u2019t do that. </p> <p>It\u2019s the familiar lineup at the back: <strong>Alyssa Naeher</strong> in goal, Sauerbrunn and <strong>Abby Dahlkemper</strong> at center back, attack-minded <strong>Crystal Dunn</strong> at left back, attack-minded <strong>Kelley O\u2019Hara</strong> at right back, Ertz behind Mewis and Lavelle in the middle, <strong>Megan Rapinoe</strong> trying to do better on the left flank than she did against Spain, <strong>Tobin Heath</strong> trying to see more of the ball on the right than she did against Spain, and <strong>Alex Morgan</strong> trying to be fouled out of the play a lot less than she did against Spain. </p> <p>Personally, I\u2019d put Dunn at forward in place of Rapinoe, and I\u2019d go back in time to include Casey Short on the roster so she could play left back. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/USWNT/status/1144662740625215488\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">For our Nation<br>For the \ud83d\udd34, \u26aa\ufe0f and \ud83d\udd35<br>For U.S. all. <br><br>Lineup Notes: <a href=\"https://t.co/Swf85Gglmd\">https://t.co/Swf85Gglmd</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OneNationOneTeam?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#OneNationOneTeam</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/B2sgyUmQ9y\">pic.twitter.com/B2sgyUmQ9y</a></p>&mdash; U.S. Soccer WNT (@USWNT) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USWNT/status/1144662740625215488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 28, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d164ee78f081e8727350b61\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-28T18:00:30.400Z\">7.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Controversy No. 1: Equal pay </strong></p> <p>Please check out the work Caitlin Murray and Sam Morris did with respect to the comparative World Cup bonuses that the US women might achieve in the next 10 days and the US men might achieve before the sun goes supernova. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/jun/28/revealed-the-731003-gender-pay-gap-in-us-world-cup-bonuses\">Revealed: the $730,000 gender pay gap in US World Cup bonuses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is, of course, part of a couple of larger questions, and not just the glass ceiling in American workplaces. </p> <p>The tough part is that FIFA\u2019s bonuses are pretty far from equal.

France, meanwhile, have scored five of their goals in this tournament from set plays.</p> <p>Samantha Mewis, standing at almost 6ft tall, is the tallest outfield player the US have ever had. Wendie Renard, the French center back, has at least two inches on her and is the tallest player in this World Cup. If there\u2019s a play the US will have to watch on corner kicks, it is surely Renard.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s great in the air and a really well-rounded player,\u201d Mewis said Wednesday. \u201cWe all have so much respect for her and I think our setup on set pieces will remain the same \u2013 we just have to make sure were doing our jobs and executing because she\u2019s definitely dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>You can read the full article below:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/28/usa-france-preview-world-cup-uswnt\">USA and France strap in for blockbuster clash of World Cup favorites</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s your game report from the sweltering Parc des Princes ... Are you ready, England? The other problem for the USA -- after all that, now they face a team that was simply dominant in its quarterfinal match. But let\u2019s say this about the USA ... Last time around, Julie Ertz got all the praise while linemate Becky Sauerbrunn was criminally overlooked. This time, Ertz is simply locking down the middle of the field, so much so that Jill Ellis can have the confidence not to play Lindsey Horan. (Not that the Horan benching was a good idea.) You simply cannot sleep on Tobin Heath on the right flank. Imagine if she had as many chances as Rapinoe has had. She might have hat tricks of goals and assists by now. And give credit to Megan Rapinoe. She\u2019s a lightning rod for controversy, by choice. She might lose five straight 1v1 battles and then kill an opponent on the sixth. She made her name as one of the best crossers of the ball (think of her long floated ball to Abby Wambach at the death against Brazil) and has just added to her game since then. She takes fantastic set pieces. Sure, Bouhaddi should\u2019ve done better with the first one, but that was a drive that puts a lot of pressure on a defense. They\u2019re vulnerable. Sure. And if they can run the table here -- beating France, England and then probably Germany -- that\u2019ll be one of the most impressive World Cup runs ever. Even if we\u2019ll still be asking when the defense will be tested. Thanks for all the comments. Hope you enjoyed it, and maybe we\u2019ll get an epic in the semifinals. The questions that remain ... Alyssa Naeher has faced three difficult shots on goal, and two went into the net. Crystal Dunn has been overmatched at left back for the last two games. Kelley O\u2019Hara was playing with fire for the whole game today. Alex Morgan, as many commenters are noting, has been ineffective since drubbing Thailand. Maybe should\u2019ve saved some goals from that game for the future games. And the commenters aren\u2019t happy with coach Jill Ellis ... Rick McGahey: \u201cJill Ellis is the new Maurizio Sarri. Make the same substitution regardless of the actual game situation. Lloyd?\u201d Michael Wilcox on Alex Morgan: \u201cI know she\u2019s the star of the team and everything, but the fact that Ellis won\u2019t substitute her under any circumstances short of crippling injury is also ridiculous.\u201d He continues: \u201cMewis for Lloyd is the dumbest substitution I\u2019ve ever seen. Hope Solo was right, the team wins in spite of Ellis. I play Football Manager and I feel confident I understand positions and roles better than Jill Ellis.\u201d Ironically, given the presence of a commenter from Cork, I was fired in Football Manager by ... Cork City. In her defense ... jay: \u201cjill ellis specifically said that france doesn\u2019t want the ball, so the us will let france have the ball. thus, the us will give up possession and play 5 at the back. and france only scored (just now) on a set piece, not really because of the 5 at the back.\u201d what do people have against capital letters? Your comments: George Meikle: \u201cSeems like USWNT do well with offsides discipline, while France did not do well and was caught many times.\u201d Simon McMahon: \u201cBonsoir Beau. Genuine question, but have they changed the rules during the tournament? The penalty awarded against Scotland in their opening game against England was about 1000% less of a spot kick than the one just not given for France.\u201d Maybe the call in that opening game wasn\u2019t very good? Chris in Cork, where I visited in my honeymoon in 1999 but bypassed on my trip to Ireland this spring, also thinks it was a penalty. What are they saying elsewhere? The US commentators aren\u2019t saying anything. The USA had possession less than 40% of the time. They were outshot 20-10. Their outside backs looked vulnerable. The offense sputtered. And they\u2019ve just beaten the home team, considered to be their toughest opponent in this Cup. 90 min +5: French throw-in, and they can\u2019t find anyone open. This looks like one of the U11 games I ref, where the player simply doesn\u2019t want to throw it away. They throw it away anyway, and now Morgan is in the corner getting away with a push and winning a throw-in. 90 min +4: Oh my. Mbock dispossesses Heath, who catches her and ... it certainly seemed that she slid through the French player\u2019s legs. No call. Going the other way, Bussaglia more obviously fouls Morgan and sees yellow. 90 min +3: Press has been impressive in her brief stint, winning a throw-in to help kill the game. France regain possession. What can they do? 90 min +2: This is a very patient French buildup leading to a telegraphed pass that Dunn easily picks off and plays forward to no one, killing 30 more seconds. 90 min +1: We\u2019ll play five more. Press smartly wins the ball and plays back to O\u2019Hara, who smartly goes to the corner and smartly dives. Ref isn\u2019t interested, but the defender plays the ball off her ankle. Now we have a Heath dribbling exhibition, which I\u2019d pay to watch. 89 min: The French attack is just too tentative. Thiney takes too many touches and finally plays forward just in time for a correct offside call. Some people in the inbox says France have made too many bad decisions going forward. They have, but the US defenders have forced some of those. And then falling behind 0-1 early on was immense. 88 min: When we have a long stoppage, I\u2019ll get to the inbox. Dunn draws a foul at midfield. 87 min: Crystal Dunn, who\u2019s about 5 foot negative 1, is one of two players in the wall. Better than being in the box, where Henry appears to try to score a Maradona-style goal with her hand. Christen Press enters the game for Rapinoe, who was in the right place at the right time multiple times. (RIP Dr. John.) 85 min: France move forward. Ball played off O\u2019Hara. France wants a penalty. None given. Would\u2019ve been harsh, but we\u2019ve seen worse. Back down the field, and France earn another free kick anyway. Renard lurks ... 84 min: The corner kick floats to Henry, who\u2019s triple-teamed and is still called for a foul. OK. Dunn wins the ball and gives it away. She wins it again and blasts it forward, where Rapinoe loses it. 83 min: France goes back to working on Dunn, and they win another corner. Renard steps forward with a fierce look. 82 min: Substitution -- and I warned you. Carli Lloyd, a superb clutch scorer who never was very good at possessing the ball and is not young any more, is into the game in place of Sam Mewis. This makes no sense. None. Whatsoever. And it\u2019ll probably work out anyway. A poor foul from O\u2019Hara, a free kick floated into the box, a US defender (Mewis?) holding people onside, and Renard easily deposits the header into the box. And then Le Sommer comes out, with Asseyi coming in. Sure, let\u2019s be controversial ... Ruth Purdue: \u201cWho wants to ask Hope Solo why the best team in the world is playing 5 at the back and refusing to come out?\u201d Well, she\u2019s writing for The Guardian. What say you, editors? 79 min: A real save from Naeher! Le Sommer gets a boot on the ball in the box against O\u2019Hara, and Naeher has to leap to punch the lob over the bar. The corner kick goes nowhere. 78 min: Free kick to France. Majri plays ahead of the line of players in the box. No French players run forward onto it. Naeher catches. The ball eventually gets to Henry on an O\u2019Hara giveaway, and the French attacker blasts a 20-yard shot, again straight at Naeher. 76 min: Oh come on. That was beautiful, even it was North Carolina grad to North Carolina grad. (I went to Duke.) Crystal Dunn -- again, a better attacker than defender -- races down the left and crosses back to Heath. The flag goes up. We have some sort of VAR intervention, and apparently one fiber of Dunn\u2019s boot was offside. Cascarino has come on for France, and Sauerbrunn welcomes her to the game with a leg sweep. Ouch. 75 min: Nothing\u2019s happening. George Meikle points to a difference between the USA and a Mourinho team: \u201cBig diff being USA WOMEN want to play their hearts gutz out for each other, coach, maybe us(?).\u201d Yes, I see everyone on Twitter and in the mailbox gloating about Rapinoe and a possible invitation to some address about 15 miles east of me. I know, I know. Take it to the politics section. Or tweet away. 73 min: Foul by Morgan, and we need to ask what subs to make. Probably another defensive-minded substitution, maybe Tierna Davidson for Dunn. But Jill Ellis will probably come up with some reason to bring on Carli Lloyd. 71 min: Replay shows Henry jumped on Horan\u2019s back and managed to hurt herself banging into Horan\u2019s head. Clever tweet: And here\u2019s that goal: Maybe France should consider marking Rapinoe next time. Just can\u2019t give her easy chances. 69 min: And just when I say Rapinoe hasn\u2019t been effective despite scoring twice, she races forward and forces a recovery run from Diani. She\u2019s been pretty good today, but it\u2019s going to be frustrating when she\u2019s named player of the match ahead of, say, Julie Ertz. I\u2019m almost speaking too soon, as a French cross finds Gauvin, but the header is wide and she was offside, anyway. The five US defenders are playing a good line here. 67 min: And I was about to post this from Raymond Smith ... \u201cThese defensive, look-for-the-breakaway tactics are Jose (Mourinho) tactics. It didn\u2019t work for United, and I\u2019ll bet it won\u2019t work for the USA either!\u201d Yes, but Mourinho already used up all the good luck he\u2019ll ever have in his career. The U.S. players have not. Somehow. To be fair, they\u2019ve also been very, very good. France didn\u2019t suddenly forget how to play. I want to see VAR. Really seemed like Heath was offside. But she does the hard work, crosses, deflects, and Rapinoe has inexplicably scored four goals in two games without being particularly effective. Replay shows Heath was on. Now can I say it\u2019s over? 63 min: SUBSTITUTION. Here comes Lindsey Horan at last, replacing Lavelle. Yeah, they\u2019re parking the bus. But Gauvin wins a header between two of the three central defenders, and Naeher actually has to make a save. 62 min: Le Sommer, almost certainly offside, gets the ball on the left and crosses. Majri blasts the ball off O\u2019Hara. Did that hit her in the wrist (tucked in ahead of her torso, so no handball)? She\u2019s hurt. Tactics, tactics ... 61 min: France have 59% possession and 11 shots. None on target. We may be at a ticker-tape parade in a couple of weeks asking when someone\u2019s going to test Alyssa Naeher. 59 min: Played ahead to Diani, but if Dunn is two things, she\u2019s a potent attacker (rather wasted at left back) and a speedster, and she breaks things up. Simon Loft: \u201cCan you win a corner, or a throw-in, off a pony-tail? France were denied a corner in about the 53rd min\u201d Don\u2019t give the VAR crew any ideas. 58 min: CHANCE FOR FRANCE. It starts with Diani again beating Dunn. The ball is played back, then floated to the far post, where neither Renard nor Naeher can get to it. Le Sommer shoots but has no path to goal. 57 min: Le Sommer works on the left again against O\u2019Hara and wins a corner. Will France remember that they have Renard? They do, but it\u2019s headed clear -- maybe Ertz, maybe Dahlkemper. I need a bigger TV. That opening sequence: 54 min: And another delayed offside call. And probably incorrect, but France had regained possession anyway. It\u2019ll just be a topic of conversation with the ref assessor later. France possessing now, but maybe 80 yards from the US goal. And now 100. That won\u2019t help. 53 min: Thiney plays the corner, where Le Sommer goes up for it and heads it into the next arrondissement. She tries to claim a deflection, but it was not to be. At the other side, Heath is offside. 51 min: Le Sommer slaloms past O\u2019Hara and Dahlkemper, but it\u2019s alleged defensive midfielder (now basically a third center back) Ertz coming in to sweep it away for a throw-in. Seems unfair. At least let France have a corner. Henry gains a shot from distance, then a second, and this one is deflected for that corner. I must be ahead of the time-space continuum somehow. 50 min: Ruth Purdue: \u201cWidth is the answer for France and the way around this US team. The Americans squeeze the centre for space and France struggle to go through there. Get the full back higher and switch the play quicker. There is space in behind.\u201d On cue, O\u2019Hara fails to cope with pressure, and the ball is played into the box, where Dunn gives it away. So many holes in the US team, but can anyone punish them? Doug Burton: \u201cFrench supporters seem to be resigned to a slow death. They need to lift the team for them to have a chance. US basically came into their house and are sleeping on the couch with their shoes on, eating all their food and leaving garbage everywhere.\u201d Sounds like a disgruntled AirBnB owner. 48 min: France concede another corner under frankly minimal pressure. The ref again wants to chat with people in the box, specifically Torrent. Aly Wagner says France will want to stop Julie Ertz. They barely do so, and the USA wave hands looking for a handball. Or a foul. Actually, Crystal Dunn played it with her arm, but that\u2019s probably not what the USA meant. 46 min: CHANCE FOR USA. A 20-yard shot from Mewis forces Bouhaddi to dive and stretch. Heath is there to send in the rebound from a tough angle, and Bouhaddi saves for a corner. Morgan has a shot from the corner that\u2019s blocked by Henry, and that seemed to hurt. What\u2019s French for \u201calarm clock\u201d? I\u2019m 12 feet away from a 27-inch diagonal screen that was high-tech when we got it in 2006. Teams are back on the field. Want to look ahead? Not writing off France here, but someone from this game will face England, and Eni Aluko has some words of caution before that semifinal: England looked better yesterday than either team look here, but Aluko\u2019s warning seems fair. And one US star seems to have bounced back, which sounds odd coming back from a game in which she scored twice from the spot: \u201cWithout question, my standout of the attacking Americans is Rapinoe. Her goal may have had a touch of luck about it, but given the week she\u2019s had this is quite the show of intent to silence the critics. I\u2019ve yet to see the ball stripped from her I think,\u201d says Matthew Richman. Meanwhile, Peter Oh asks about the USA\u2019s third-string keeper: \u201cAny chance of Franch being introduced from the bench to help stanch any staunch resistance by the French?\u201d I think a branch just fell on my house. (BTW -- yes, I\u2019m part French, but I\u2019m actually more English and Scottish. And apparently American, according to my birth certificate.) Quick note: Kelley O\u2019Hara already has a yellow in this tournament. Needs to be careful. Seemed clear from the conversation that she is one step away. Jamison MacLachlan is still unhappy: \u201cFrance making adjustments. US not to much. The US can\u2019t sit and defend a 1-0 lead for another 45. It\u2019s hot, there will be a mental lapse, a bad bounce, a terrible VAR decision.\u201d So is Brian Doll: \u201cUs midfield is unbelievably sloppy with their passes not sure if they have actually completed more than five. This game needs a person to put their foot on the ball and calm things down. Game tailor made for Horan yet she is on the bench.\u201d Aren\u2019t the USA winning this one? And one more from Arlo Katts: \u201cI\u2019m getting no sense of the ebb and flow of the game from this commentary. There\u2019s no analysis, just reportage of what the US team is doing. Have France not turned up?\u201d They have not. Give credit to France for having most of the possession after a disastrous opening 10 minutes. But the USA are content to be a counterattacking team now, and France have shown little sign of breaking them down. All it takes is one set piece, though. France still have the proverbial puncher\u2019s chance. 46 min +2: The last meaningful touch of the half is a hard but untroubling blast from Rapinoe. 45 min: More French possession with little intent. Peter McMurry: \u201cI\u2019m surprised France isn\u2019t attacking more down the left flank - Majri looks the most energetic French player, but Renard keeps ignoring her in order to play the ball over to the right, despite Diani having no joy so far. I don\u2019t understand. Also, Thiney has done nothing and should be subbed off.\u201d Right on cue, Diani slips free for a header in the box that goes wide. And Dunn has not looked the part at left back through the whole tournament. She plays eight positions, probably five of them better than left back. 43 min: O\u2019Hara dives to win a foul from Gauvin at midfield. (Granted, I\u2019m watching on a small screen. Your view may differ.) The ball works out to Rapinoe, who plays back to Dunn, who is always eager to get into the attack but had better options than shooting there. First US shot in a while, but not one of interest. France have 61% possession, five shots -- not one on target. 41 min: A US player -- looks like Mewis -- somehow wins the header off the free kick away from Renard, but it\u2019s nowhere near the frame. 40 min: Off the free kick from the O\u2019Hara foul, we once again have a seminar with our ref. After the long wait, the ball floats straight to Naeher. At the other end, Bouhaddi decides she has been idle for a while, so she races off her line on a whim. That action solves nothing, and Rose Lavelle is needlessly fouled for a US free kick that Tobin Heath (remember her?) will take. 38 min: Alex Morgan lifts her studs up. Whistle blows. Morgan says she didn\u2019t touch her. She kinda did. Through ball from France is cut out by O\u2019Hara, running twice as fast as everyone else. And then O\u2019Hara slams into Majri. Literally. Not sure how she avoided yellow there. OK, it\u2019s not over. France have looked better here. 37 min: Not much possession for the USA at the moment. Ruth Purdue asks: \u201cHave they changed the rule about having to receive the ball outside the box from a goal kick?\u201d Yes, and I\u2019m not looking forward to my referee recertification test. See, I\u2019m not alone ... 33 min: The corner kick gets to Henry, but the header goes well over. France are at least putting a few things together. Still no shots on target. 32 min: Still not sure what happened with Morgan. Replay showed she might have landed badly after going up for a header, but she walks off with little trouble and immediately asks to come back in. We resume, and Diani takes the ball from Dunn and goes forward. Mewis blocks the cross for a corner. 29 min: A corner kick for France, which might be their best chance to get something going thanks to the height of Wendie Renard. The ball floats past her head, and as France try to cycle it back in, they\u2019re offside. Again. That\u2019s at least four. Alex Morgan is down, which gives us an unofficial hydration break. Not sure what\u2019s up, but the trainers are out. 28 min: Things have quieted down a bit. The USA are clearly content to press in spurts and wait for France to hand over the ball. 25 min: Not saying the USA have parked the bus, but while France play the ball around midfield, we can clearly see a line of five keeping France at bay. And it pays off with an offside call. So if you wanted Ertz to play center back today, congratulations. Now she is. Two from Mary Waltz in the inbox: \u201cSpain shut down Morgan with constant tough,not dirty, play well before the box area. With the early yellow will France be able to duplicate those tactic. French goalie just assumed a tip in on that goal.\u201d Also: \u201cDunn still looks shaky. If France focuses on her this match is far from over.\u201d But they won\u2019t. It\u2019s over. Note to emailers -- I am not going to mention the person whose name rhymes with \u201crump\u201d and is a part-time resident of Washington, DC. Sorry. 21 min: Do you know me? This is Tobin Heath. She plays right forward for the USA. She barely saw the ball against Spain but was very effective when she did. She\u2019s one of the most skilled players in US women\u2019s history. Rose Lavelle just tried to play the ball to her, but the pass was about 10 yards (9 meters) off target. 18 min: A sweet cutback from Diani to beat Dunn, and that sets up a series of near-chances. Still nothing to trouble Naeher. France\u2019s defenders play the ball around, hoping they\u2019ve weathered the storm while only conceding one goal. And Rapinoe is down in pain again. Amandine Henry, who has played in the USA, chats with the ref. The Seattle-Portland rivalry is everywhere. 16 min: I can\u2019t possibly keep up with the US attack today. Neither can Bouhaddi, who has to race out of her box to play the ball away from Rapinoe (who was offside, the replay shows, but VAR is far behind). Then Mewis falls in the box with no contact, and Aly Wagner thinks it should be a card. Every sports journalist who watched women\u2019s soccer religiously -- every four years -- would be aghast. They think US women don\u2019t dive. Nice one here ... Our Caitlin Murray, for one, does not think this is over. Hey, maybe Jill Ellis will bring in Carli Lloyd for Abby Dahlkemper just to make it interesting. 14 min: Torrent whacks Rapinoe\u2019s ankle from behind as is lucky not to see yellow. (As you may recall from the last MBM, I am not a US homer. This has just been dreadful from France so far.) 13 min: Finally some attacking possession for France, and actually, it\u2019s a half-decent chance in the end as Le Sommer gets her head on the second cross attempt. Naeher snares it, but replay showed it was going ... Pardon me -- Morgan shoots at the other end. Can we possibly try Spain\u2019s defense with France\u2019s offense? Would they have a chance? Look, so many French players play for Lyon, who win every game by a score of 308-0. You think they know how to play from behind? Forget it. It\u2019s over. But follow along with us anyway 8 min: France finally attack on Dunn\u2019s flank. They\u2019re offside. Well, maybe. Looked OK on the replay. OK, no deflection, and the three-time global goalkeeper of the year just lost the ball in traffic. It\u2019s over. Calling it now. Bring on USA-England. Rapinoe\u2019s free kick goes into traffic and emerges on the other side. Surely it was deflected? 5 min: We spend a rather long time setting this up for some reason .. and ... 4 min: YELLOW CARD to Mbock! The USA take a quick throw-in, and Mbock grabs Alex Morgan as she races down the left flank near the box. Free kick now that Rapinoe will take. She has been erratic with these. 2 min: Speaking of left backs who attack, Amel Majri (wearing No. 10) tries to work her way past O\u2019Hara into the US box. She falls. There was no contact. Not a good idea. Refs from Ukraine don\u2019t fall for that. 1 min: Instead of going straight at the left-back who isn\u2019t a left-back, Crystal Dunn, France try to walk a tightrope down their left. The USA go the other direction, Rapinoe finds space to play to Ertz, and the USA already have as many shots on goal from the run of play as they did against Spain. Kickoff: The countdown is English. The kickoff is French. The ball is out of play. OK, all silliness aside -- this is one of those matchups you dream of seeing in sports. It\u2019s a privilege to be here to talk about it. Here we go ... Speaking of penalty controversies, today\u2019s officials are ... The first was rather obvious, wasn\u2019t it? Anyway, tonight\u2019s people in green are ... Referee: Kateryna MONZUL (UKR) AR1: Marina STRILETSKA (UKR) AR2: Oleksandra ARDASHEVA (UKR) FO: Kate JAZEWICZ (AUS) Reserve AR: KIM Kyoung Min (KOR) VAR: Danny MAKKELIE (NED) AVAR1: Chantal BOUDREAU (CAN) AVAR2: Pawel GIL (POL) Whoa, whoa ... a Canadian? With a French name? A few more of your pregame thoughts before I go into full-bore game mode. I mean full-blown. Hopefully not full bore. alincoln on Twitter, presumably referring to Horan\u2019s omission from the starting XI: \u201cRemember when Greg Ryan started Scurry over Solo against Brazil in 2007 WC?This is Ellis\u2019 Greg Ryan moment and will also be her last game as HC of the USWNT.\u201d Was there an off-field issue with Horan? Joe Pearson has already has wine. I\u2019m on my third soda, which I never do. I don\u2019t think caffeine affects me, though -- hey, should I rewire the entertainment center while I watch? I think I\u2019ll also juggle. Julian Borrill: \u201cRed, white, blue - US ... Bleu, blanc, rouge - France\u201d Je parle francais un peu, mais ma vocabulaire est tres mal. I\u2019m the product of US schools. You\u2019re all lucky I can speak English. Peter Oh: \u201cI like the sound of \u201cthe Statue of Liberty derby\u201d. Hopefully this match will be remembered only for the actions of the ladies on the pitch, and I\u2019m not talking about the referees. No VARc de Triomphe, please!\u201d Actually, I heard they checked the video again, and they\u2019ve taken back the penalty awarded on the Lavelle we-won\u2019t-say-dive incident against Spain. We\u2019ll have to play the rest of that game again. Anthems are underway, and France has the USA beaten there. Pregame scenes As ever, I\u2019m astounded at the disposable income Americans can conjure for things like this. I can\u2019t even afford to see my alma mater play basketball, but I made poor career choices. \u201cPoor\u201d as in financial. This is clearly its own reward. Speaking of the red, white and blue, we have this from the mailbag from Jamison MacLachlan ... \u201cThe one HUGE Achilles Heel the US has is that they seem to have an inability to either recognize they need to make adjustments in game or they refuse to. ... If the US plays the way they did against Spain....lacking awareness and creativity in adjusting on both sides of the ball....it could be a long night for my red white and blue.\u201d Which red, white and blue, though? Speaking of the seven European teams in the last eight, Shane Hart asks a question of all England fans: Who do you want to win? Red, white and blue! I lost the tweet that referred to this game as the Statue of Liberty matchup. At least we\u2019re remembering that wonderful celebration of democratic ideals and not selling \u201cfreedom fries\u201d any more. From our correspondent on the scene ... Brandon Dwonch, in the inbox: \u201cI have not looked towards to a game this much since the Champions League Final.\u201d But he says it\u2019ll be goalless, and France will win 4-3 in PKs. (Or, as we pedants call it, kicks from the mark.) Worth noting -- the USA didn\u2019t have a lot of shots on goal in the game against Spain. To be precise, three, including the two penalties. Also on the interwebs ... Predictions I picked the USA to win it all before we started, and I\u2019m sticking with it. I also picked Australia to reach the final, so I may not be good at this. Today, I\u2019m thinking if the US women score the first goal, it\u2019s all but over. The French have a word for how that will feel -- D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. The host country has had a good team throughout the 2010s, but medals have been elusive. In 2011, two late goals by Abby Wambach and Alex Morgan pushed the US to a 3-1 win in the semifinals. They\u2019ve never been closer to the top three than that. Controversy No. 3: The heat Tom Lutz informs me that, contrary to what I said previously, our sun cannot go supernova. That will be of little comfort in France, which just saw a record temperature of 45.9C. That\u2019s nearly 115 degrees in US temperatures. Or, as we sometimes call it, Death Valley hot. But at Parc des Princes, it\u2019s merely 30 degrees. That\u2019s 86 in the USA, the land of stubborn measurements. And we\u2019re told it\u2019s not the same humidity as those of us who dwell on the US East Coast swim in every day. Unchanged from the last game. And it\u2019s pretty much as projected from our team guide. Wendie Renard has made the odd uncharacteristic mistake here, but she and Griedge Mbock are a generally sound defensive partnership. And like the US women, they have more attackers than they can possibly start, with Delphine Cascarino being the in-vogue supersub. AKA Controversy No. 2: Lindsey Horan\u2019s omission Lindsey Horan is a tremendous two-way midfielder. She has experience playing with an against the French players. She sat out the round of 16 game against Spain until the very end, perhaps because she was carrying a yellow card, and a second would put her out of action for the game against France. As it turns out, that didn\u2019t matter. Out of the four main US midfielders -- Horan, defensive destroyer / attacker Julie Ertz, two-way player Samantha Mewis, and playmaker Rose Lavelle -- Horan is the one that sits. Another option Jill Ellis would have had -- sit Becky Sauerbrunn, one of the finest defenders in women\u2019s soccer\u2019s relatively brief history but coming off some minor injury concerns and a major mistake against Spain, to move Ertz to center back. Didn\u2019t do that. It\u2019s the familiar lineup at the back: Alyssa Naeher in goal, Sauerbrunn and Abby Dahlkemper at center back, attack-minded Crystal Dunn at left back, attack-minded Kelley O\u2019Hara at right back, Ertz behind Mewis and Lavelle in the middle, Megan Rapinoe trying to do better on the left flank than she did against Spain, Tobin Heath trying to see more of the ball on the right than she did against Spain, and Alex Morgan trying to be fouled out of the play a lot less than she did against Spain. Personally, I\u2019d put Dunn at forward in place of Rapinoe, and I\u2019d go back in time to include Casey Short on the roster so she could play left back. Controversy No. 1: Equal pay Please check out the work Caitlin Murray and Sam Morris did with respect to the comparative World Cup bonuses that the US women might achieve in the next 10 days and the US men might achieve before the sun goes supernova. This is, of course, part of a couple of larger questions, and not just the glass ceiling in American workplaces. The tough part is that FIFA\u2019s bonuses are pretty far from equal. In 2018, France got $38 million. This year, the winner will get $4 million. So your options are these ... It\u2019s Brazil-Germany in the men\u2019s World Cup. It\u2019s Ronda Rousey vs. Cris Cyborg, had Rousey stuck with MMA and gone back up to her old weight class. It\u2019s Kelly Clarkson vs. Susan Boyle in an all-star battle of reality-contest singers. It\u2019s big. Grande. Incroyable. Super Bowls are hyped for two weeks. This game has been hyped since the World Cup draw was made in December, assuming the USA and France would win their groups and their eighth-final games. (As it turns out, each team made hard work of it.) So this could be a contest of titanic proportions. Or it could be Mike Tyson knocking out Michael Spinks in 91 seconds. But let\u2019s hope not. The winner faces England, which will be the next epic match. Beau will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s Caitlin Murray on how today\u2019s game may be settled: The set piece battle \u201cWe take set pieces very seriously,\u201d Megan Rapinoe said in France before the USA\u2019s first game of the tournament. \u201cThose are moments you can practice, you can set things up, you can potentially catch the other team off guard, go quickly or if you\u2019e got tricky plays. We have a lot of specialists in all the different areas of set plays.\u201d Although the Americans are traditionally been strong on set pieces, such scenarios haven\u2019t been the deciding factor for the Americans yet. France, meanwhile, have scored five of their goals in this tournament from set plays. Samantha Mewis, standing at almost 6ft tall, is the tallest outfield player the US have ever had. Wendie Renard, the French center back, has at least two inches on her and is the tallest player in this World Cup. If there\u2019s a play the US will have to watch on corner kicks, it is surely Renard. \u201cShe\u2019s great in the air and a really well-rounded player,\u201d Mewis said Wednesday. \u201cWe all have so much respect for her and I think our setup on set pieces will remain the same \u2013 we just have to make sure were doing our jobs and executing because she\u2019s definitely dangerous.\u201d You can read the full article below:",

      "body": "<p>The justice secretary, David Gauke, has survived a vote of no confidence by his local Conservative association, defeating efforts by hard Brexit groups such as Leave.EU to potentially deselect the cabinet minister from his South West Hertfordshire constituency.</p> <p>The motion accused Gauke of \u201cwilful obstruction\u201d towards implementing the 2016 EU referendum result by opposing a no-deal exit. Although Gauke supported remain in the referendum, he repeatedly voted for Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement in parliament.</p> <p>During the meeting \u2013 which ended with a vote of 123-61 in Gauke\u2019s favour, with one abstention \u2013 the proposer of the motion admitted that he had only joined the Conservative party in February. He called the MP a \u201cBrexit wrecker\u201d with an \u201cextremist anti-leave stance\u201d in his speech.</p> <p>Replying, the minister said that of the 50 people who pushed for the motion, \u201cthe majority have joined in the last 12 months\u201d. He said that \u201cthere [was] an attempt to fundamentally change the nature of the Conservative party\u201d taking place.</p> <p>\u201cAre we morphing into a new party, the Brexit party?\u201d Gauke asked. \u201cIf so, I\u2019m not the candidate for you. If I have to change my tune under the threat of deselection, then I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Following the vote, Gauke tweeted: \u201cTonight, I argued that: We should not allow the Party to be taken over by entryists. We should be a broad church. No deal would be immensely damaging to the UK. I defeated a motion of no confidence 123 to 61. I am grateful to the members of my association for their support.\u201d</p> <p>The result was applauded by fellow moderate Tories, with Rory Stewart, whose leadership bid Gauke had supported, tweeting that it had been a \u201ctribute to the power of truth, to his association and a tribute above all to David Gauke\u201d. </p> <p>Former foreign officer minister Alastair Burt said: \u201cTotal support for a great colleague, and strong, decent Conservative. Good on his association in standing up to those who may not be singing from a truly Conservative script.\u201d</p> <p>And Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson tweeted the word \u201cGood\u201d followed by three applause emojis.</p> <p>The decision by the association is a defeat for the Leave.EU campaign group. On Thursday, it tweeted: \u201cTomorrow we claim our first Cabinet scalp as DavidGauke is up for deselection in South West Herts\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LeaveEUOfficial/status/1144201903980650496\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tomorrow we claim our first Cabinet scalp as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidGauke?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DavidGauke</a> is up for deselection in South West Herts.<br><br>With a new leader and potential election, now is the time to make the Conservative party conservative again.

      "bodyText": "The justice secretary, David Gauke, has survived a vote of no confidence by his local Conservative association, defeating efforts by hard Brexit groups such as Leave.EU to potentially deselect the cabinet minister from his South West Hertfordshire constituency. The motion accused Gauke of \u201cwilful obstruction\u201d towards implementing the 2016 EU referendum result by opposing a no-deal exit. Although Gauke supported remain in the referendum, he repeatedly voted for Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement in parliament. During the meeting \u2013 which ended with a vote of 123-61 in Gauke\u2019s favour, with one abstention \u2013 the proposer of the motion admitted that he had only joined the Conservative party in February. He called the MP a \u201cBrexit wrecker\u201d with an \u201cextremist anti-leave stance\u201d in his speech. Replying, the minister said that of the 50 people who pushed for the motion, \u201cthe majority have joined in the last 12 months\u201d. He said that \u201cthere [was] an attempt to fundamentally change the nature of the Conservative party\u201d taking place. \u201cAre we morphing into a new party, the Brexit party?\u201d Gauke asked. \u201cIf so, I\u2019m not the candidate for you. If I have to change my tune under the threat of deselection, then I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d Following the vote, Gauke tweeted: \u201cTonight, I argued that: We should not allow the Party to be taken over by entryists. We should be a broad church. No deal would be immensely damaging to the UK. I defeated a motion of no confidence 123 to 61. I am grateful to the members of my association for their support.\u201d The result was applauded by fellow moderate Tories, with Rory Stewart, whose leadership bid Gauke had supported, tweeting that it had been a \u201ctribute to the power of truth, to his association and a tribute above all to David Gauke\u201d. Former foreign officer minister Alastair Burt said: \u201cTotal support for a great colleague, and strong, decent Conservative. Good on his association in standing up to those who may not be singing from a truly Conservative script.\u201d And Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson tweeted the word \u201cGood\u201d followed by three applause emojis. The decision by the association is a defeat for the Leave.EU campaign group. On Thursday, it tweeted: \u201cTomorrow we claim our first Cabinet scalp as DavidGauke is up for deselection in South West Herts\u201d. After the result, Gauke tweeted mischievously at Leave.EU\u2019s co-founder Aaron Banks, saying \u201cNot so fast there, Aaron\u201d. Gauke has held the seat since 2005 and was returned at the 2017 election with a majority of 19,550, increasing his personal vote to 35,128, almost 60% of the electorate. Ministers from both sides of the Brexit divide rallied to support Gauke before the vote took place. The work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, tweeted: \u201cTonight\u2019s motion of no confidence in @DavidGauke is ludicrous. Rounding on colleagues in this way is the type of behaviour you\u2019d expect from the hard left.\u201d She said Gauke had her \u201cfull support\u201d and expressed hope that Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt would also back him. Leave.EU swiftly replied to Rudd, who backed remain, warning that she would face similar moves in her ultra-marginal Hastings constituency, which she holds by just 346 votes. Hunt did tweet support for his colleague \u2013 who is now backing him for the leadership \u2013 saying that Gauke \u201cis an outstanding cabinet colleague and we need him to carry on doing such a great job!\u201d The Brexit minister, James Cleverly, exasperatedly pointed out on Twitter that there was \u201cno deselection mechanism\u201d in the party and complained about having \u201cthese Leave.EU stories amplified by the press for months and no Conservative MP has been deselected\u201d. Cleverly, a former leave-supporting deputy chairman of the Conservatives who has said a no-deal would be \u201cdeliverable but [not] easy or effortless\u201d, said Gauke was \u201ca great MP and a huge asset to our party\u201d. Claire Perry, the energy minister who campaigned to remain, compared those seeking to unseat Gauke to Labour\u2019s left. \u201cIt\u2019s a @LeaveEUOfficial \u201cmomentum moment\u201d. Their hit list ignores the fact that MPs like David have voted repeatedly for a firm EU exit \u2013 if other MPs had joined us rather than indulging in their Brexit fantasies we would be out by now.\u201d Former ministers Phillip Lee and Dominic Grieve were not as fortunate as Gauke, having lost votes of no confidence by their local associations this year. On Thursday, Leave.EU claimed: \u201cActivists in East Surrey have now amassed more than the 50 signatures required to initiate deselection proceedings against the former universities minister Sam Gyimah.\u201d He resigned in November 2018 after voting against May\u2019s Brexit deal and subsequently endorsed the holding of a second referendum.",

Rapinoe is more than a mouthpiece, she is, in the words of her teammate Kelley O\u2019Hara, \u201ca baller\u201d. No player has been directly involved in more goals in the World Cup than Rapinoe since she made her debut in the competition in 2011 and, although Wendie Renard\u2019s header launched a spirited late fightback, Les Bleues were not able to find the equaliser in an end-to-end spectacle.</p> <p>The elimination of the French means that England have confirmed the presence of a Team GB Tokyo Olympics slot for 2020 as one of the top three European qualifiers from this World Cup. An hour before kick-off the Parc des Princes was already heaving in the searing heat, a French record temperature of 45.9C having been reached in the southern area of Gallargues-le-Montueux.

With 30,000 France fans expected to outnumber the visiting supporters three to one, the home side had the natural advantage but the volume was almost matched by the US contingent.</p> <p>Rapinoe stood silent, hands by her side for the American national anthem as expected.

      "bodyText": "It was fitting that the social justice activist Megan Rapinoe, the focus of unwanted presidential attentions before the game for her \u201cI\u2019m not going to the fucking White House\u201d comment, was the player to power the USA into a semi-final with England, her two goals emphatically ending France\u2019s hopes of a men\u2019s and women\u2019s World Cup double. \u201cLe Grand Match\u201d was a slightly more measured billing from Fifa than Rapinoe\u2019s hopes of a \u201ctotal shit-show circus\u201d but either way this meeting between the holders and the hosts did not disappoint. Rapinoe is more than a mouthpiece, she is, in the words of her teammate Kelley O\u2019Hara, \u201ca baller\u201d. No player has been directly involved in more goals in the World Cup than Rapinoe since she made her debut in the competition in 2011 and, although Wendie Renard\u2019s header launched a spirited late fightback, Les Bleues were not able to find the equaliser in an end-to-end spectacle. The elimination of the French means that England have confirmed the presence of a Team GB Tokyo Olympics slot for 2020 as one of the top three European qualifiers from this World Cup. An hour before kick-off the Parc des Princes was already heaving in the searing heat, a French record temperature of 45.9C having been reached in the southern area of Gallargues-le-Montueux. In Paris the temperature had dropped to a still fiery 29C by the 9pm kick-off. In a sight unfamiliar to regular women\u2019s football attendees, touts shifted among the throbbing crowds filing through the streets. With 30,000 France fans expected to outnumber the visiting supporters three to one, the home side had the natural advantage but the volume was almost matched by the US contingent. Rapinoe stood silent, hands by her side for the American national anthem as expected. Alex Morgan also did not sing, perhaps prompted into silence by president Trump\u2019s criticism of her colleague\u2019s stand. Four minutes into the match Rapinoe lined up a free-kick from a tight angle on the left after Griedge Mbock had pulled back Morgan. Rapinoe\u2019s strike slipped past the waiting Julie Ertz at the near post, through the legs of the France captain, Amandine Henry, the hero in extra time of France\u2019s last-16 tie with Brazil, and past the helpless and unsighted goalkeeper, Sarah Bouhaddi. It was a hammer blow for the home nation and the expected 14 million French TV viewers but for the neutral a delight, springing the game wide open from the off. That said, with the US never having lost a World Cup match when scoring first (34 wins and four draws) and the French never having won a World Cup game when conceding first, records would have to be broken in the following 87 minutes to reverse the fortunes of Les Bleues. France\u2019s first effort came 10 minutes later. Eug\u00e9nie Le Sommer flicked a header towards goal but Alyssa Naeher, a weak point in the USA\u2019s world-class line-up, held on to it to ease any nerves. The fitness of Le Sommer was a concern before this tie but the joint-leading goalscorer for France at World Cups was in full flow as she powered at the right-back O\u2019Hara time and again.

There was certainly praise, but some of the praise could be read as mildly passive-aggressive. Dutton insisted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/26/bad-blood-five-things-we-learned-about-the-week-the-coalition-went-to-war-with-itself\">during this week\u2019s Sky News special exhuming the days of yore</a> (yes, that\u2019s last August) that he, Peter Dutton, could have won the May election.</p> <p>Dutton noted the recent election win was a team effort (\u201call of us had the discipline through the campaign to provide him with advice to stay on message\u201d). He also predicted that Morrison would now \u201cfind his stride in this three years\u201d (which begged the question where the \u201cstride\u201d had been previously) and Scott would lead them all to wonderful things, like a decade in power.</p> <p>Now perhaps I\u2019m seeing low-level snark where there isn\u2019t any. But I doubt it. And even if there was absolutely no edge to Dutton\u2019s commentary, even if he wasn\u2019t trying to remind Morrison publicly that the right faction of the Liberal party is still there, and he leads it, the fact of the matter is Dutton\u2019s lusty prosecution of the history wars was unhelpful to Morrison, who wants to kick off the coming parliamentary term as if he is leading a soft and fragrant and cuddly first-term government, not a pack of jackals stripping a carcass at the fag end of the hundred year war.</p> <p>To nail this point we can line the two dispositions up in split screen. Dutton has been yammering all week about The August Incident. In contrast Morrison, who was interviewed for the Sky News series and supplied less than garrulous responses through a smile that looked more like gritted teeth, has said as little as possible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/28/disappearance-of-australian-in-north-korea-troubling-scott-morrison-says\">Disappearance of Australian in North Korea 'troubling', Scott Morrison says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked in Osaka on Friday to reflect on a revelation this week that Turnbull sought, during last year\u2019s melee, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/27/christian-porter-confirms-tense-exchange-with-turnbull-over-duttons-tilt-at-pm\">to raise with the governor general the constitutional eligibility of his challenger</a> Dutton, Morrison went full Peloponnesian Wars. \u201cAncient history,\u201d he said. \u201cWere you aware of that at the time?\u201d his interviewer, the ABC\u2019s Greg Jennett, inquired politely. \u201cAll of that is ancient history,\u201d Morrison said, clipped.</p> <p>Whatever Dutton\u2019s claims to collective counsel equalling victory, Morrison spent the recent election campaign as a solo act. He swept the roiling chorus from public view. What a relief that must have been, just to lock them all in a cupboard for five weeks, and inspect carrots, and mullets, and the Townsville Strand. But government isn\u2019t a solo act, and government is about to recommence.</p> <p>Morrison\u2019s authority within the Liberal party is now significant. In no way am I discounting that reality. He won an election that most of his colleagues expected to lose right up until the votes started to be counted on 18 May. But he\u2019s not a solo act any longer. The gravity of government, and the stresses and strains of leading this group of people, in full public view, asserts itself again from next week.</p> <p>Liberals are optimistic as they pack their bags for Canberra. People think the hundred year war is now behind them because most of the monocled generals shoving them out of the trenches are now out of the parliament.</p> <p>People assert they\u2019ve now jumped a generation, and the inference is sanity will now prevail. Tony Abbott is gone. Turnbull is gone. Julie Bishop is gone.

Mathias Cormann, who was the critical figure in ending Turnbull\u2019s prime ministership by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/09/cormann-returns-fire-after-turnbull-accuses-him-over-leadership-coup\">the public act of withdrawing his support</a>, remains, but looks like he\u2019s been through a near-death experience that he\u2019d be in no hurry to repeat.</p> <p>Morrison would not have wanted the new parliament to open at a time when all the books and docu-dramas about last year\u2019s leadership ructions are all hitting the public domain because that clutters his opening days as prime minister, and this time he\u2019s prime minister for real, not the night watchman.</p> <p>But all of this is fine if it\u2019s transient, if it\u2019s the storm before the calm.

      "bodyText": "Peter Dutton has taken up meditation. He shared this nugget of information on breakfast television this week. \u201cA couple of good mates who have been very successful in sport and business swear by it,\u201d the home affairs minister told the Nine network. It\u2019s hard to know whether this dedication to mindfulness is good or bad news for Scott Morrison, who is spending the weekend with Donald Trump and other world leaders at the G20 before returning for the opening session of the new parliament next week. Dutton has been Eddie Everywhere this week, reprising his starring role as undertaker to Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s prime ministership. Turnbull was blamed by Dutton for provoking critics into a leadership challenge with a preemptive spill, blamed for digging in and fighting for his job, blamed for speaking out periodically when he should be waiting gratefully for a diplomatic post or some other \u201cthank you for pissing off quietly\u201d trinket. Dutton was pitiless with Turnbull, who, history shows, prevented him from becoming prime minister last year by reacquainting himself during his last days in office with the ruthless character he had spent a whole prime ministership containing as part of a fruitless attempted detente with the conservative faction. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning When it came to Morrison, the bloke who sprinted through the middle and grabbed the trophy, Dutton\u2019s tone was harder to pinpoint. There was certainly praise, but some of the praise could be read as mildly passive-aggressive. Dutton insisted during this week\u2019s Sky News special exhuming the days of yore (yes, that\u2019s last August) that he, Peter Dutton, could have won the May election. Dutton noted the recent election win was a team effort (\u201call of us had the discipline through the campaign to provide him with advice to stay on message\u201d). He also predicted that Morrison would now \u201cfind his stride in this three years\u201d (which begged the question where the \u201cstride\u201d had been previously) and Scott would lead them all to wonderful things, like a decade in power. Now perhaps I\u2019m seeing low-level snark where there isn\u2019t any. But I doubt it. And even if there was absolutely no edge to Dutton\u2019s commentary, even if he wasn\u2019t trying to remind Morrison publicly that the right faction of the Liberal party is still there, and he leads it, the fact of the matter is Dutton\u2019s lusty prosecution of the history wars was unhelpful to Morrison, who wants to kick off the coming parliamentary term as if he is leading a soft and fragrant and cuddly first-term government, not a pack of jackals stripping a carcass at the fag end of the hundred year war. To nail this point we can line the two dispositions up in split screen. Dutton has been yammering all week about The August Incident. In contrast Morrison, who was interviewed for the Sky News series and supplied less than garrulous responses through a smile that looked more like gritted teeth, has said as little as possible. Asked in Osaka on Friday to reflect on a revelation this week that Turnbull sought, during last year\u2019s melee, to raise with the governor general the constitutional eligibility of his challenger Dutton, Morrison went full Peloponnesian Wars. \u201cAncient history,\u201d he said. \u201cWere you aware of that at the time?\u201d his interviewer, the ABC\u2019s Greg Jennett, inquired politely. \u201cAll of that is ancient history,\u201d Morrison said, clipped. Whatever Dutton\u2019s claims to collective counsel equalling victory, Morrison spent the recent election campaign as a solo act. He swept the roiling chorus from public view. What a relief that must have been, just to lock them all in a cupboard for five weeks, and inspect carrots, and mullets, and the Townsville Strand. But government isn\u2019t a solo act, and government is about to recommence. Morrison\u2019s authority within the Liberal party is now significant. In no way am I discounting that reality. He won an election that most of his colleagues expected to lose right up until the votes started to be counted on 18 May. But he\u2019s not a solo act any longer. The gravity of government, and the stresses and strains of leading this group of people, in full public view, asserts itself again from next week. Liberals are optimistic as they pack their bags for Canberra. People think the hundred year war is now behind them because most of the monocled generals shoving them out of the trenches are now out of the parliament. People assert they\u2019ve now jumped a generation, and the inference is sanity will now prevail. Tony Abbott is gone. Turnbull is gone. Julie Bishop is gone. Christopher Pyne \u2013 who once told a reporter Turnbull was \u201cAslan to me\u201d, and went to town on Dutton in this week\u2019s Sky special \u2013 is also gone. Mathias Cormann, who was the critical figure in ending Turnbull\u2019s prime ministership by the public act of withdrawing his support, remains, but looks like he\u2019s been through a near-death experience that he\u2019d be in no hurry to repeat. Morrison would not have wanted the new parliament to open at a time when all the books and docu-dramas about last year\u2019s leadership ructions are all hitting the public domain because that clutters his opening days as prime minister, and this time he\u2019s prime minister for real, not the night watchman. But all of this is fine if it\u2019s transient, if it\u2019s the storm before the calm. But the people who will decide that are not Morrison, but the men and women of the Liberal and National parties. That\u2019s the truth. We can all bang on in semi-reverential or portentous tones about post-election Morrison\u2019s authority, and pin mythological qualities on him; we can pretend leaders have magical powers to suppress the worst instincts of their colleagues, and have the ability to hit corrosive ambition with a stun gun and that\u2019s the end of it \u2013 but it\u2019s complete crap, and we don\u2019t help prime ministers and party leaders, or the health of democracy, by promulgating this sort of fantasy. On the Sky documentary this week, Arthur Sinodinos, who has been a bureaucrat, a prime ministerial adviser in the Howard era, and a minister, had typically interesting things to say about the difficulties of the current governing environment. He said when he returned to Canberra in 2011 \u201cthe atmosphere was quite different to what it used to be; the authority of leaders seems to be considerably diminished\u201d. Sinodinos said the 24/7 media environment gave all MPs access to a platform, and the drive to differentiate yourself from the colleague next to you sowed the seeds of dysfunction and division. It would be a valuable exercise, I reckon, to ask Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull \u2013 the cast of Australian prime ministers who have governed in the current age of disruption \u2013 to tell us how powerful they felt in possession of the prime ministerial office.

We are just going to have to watch, and wait. The story of the next three years starts Tuesday, with the opening of the 46th parliament.",

Some teams have performed to a really high level throughout the tournament, but I think it\u2019s fair to say England have not been one of them. They were expected to be serious title contenders but they were yet to produce a performance that completely lived up to their billing. Here, at last, they nailed it. Now they have played five, won five, conceded once and are looking genuinely world class.</p> \n<p>Neville said he would give his players a chance in the tournament, and he has kept his word. He trusts his group, and tactically against Norway he was spot on. A goal so early will always have a significant impact, and Jill Scott\u2019s strike in the third minute destroyed the Norwegians\u2019 momentum.</p> \n<p>Having come into the game on the back of that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/23/norway-break-australias-hearts-in-womens-world-cup-last-16-shootout\" title=\"\">phenomenal performance against Australia</a>, brimming with self-belief, within seconds they\u2019re kicking off again needing to claw one back. But Martin Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s side found they couldn\u2019t get their key attacking players into the game: England doubled up tactically against Hansen, for example, and didn\u2019t let her dribble \u2013 every time she got past a player there was another wall she had to hit. Millie Bright was particularly good at making sure she was always there to support her teammates, and being that second wall. That meant Hansen was unable to lead Norway\u2019s counterattacking game like she did against Australia, and in the end she did nothing that really harmed England.</p> \n<p>When Norway did get into promising positions in the first half, they repeatedly made poor decisions. There was one moment when Lucy Bronze pressed in midfield and left a gap in behind that Reiten and Kristine Minde raced into. If Reiten passed they would probably have scored, but she chose to shoot. Later, after England had taken control of the game by scoring two further goals, Norway had a few chances to reduce the deficit.</p> \n<p>Steph Houghton cleared one shot off the line and made a number of last-minute interventions, while Karen Bardsley saved well from Herlovsen, but there was a lack of finishing ability.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7faff3b7ad9cee93f78a3121383602563d1a6dd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7faff3b7ad9cee93f78a3121383602563d1a6dd/73_278_4897_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demi Stokes (right) had a fine game against Norway and looks like she will start at left-back in Tuesday\u2019s semi-final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demi Stokes (right) had a fine game against Norway and looks like she will start at left-back in Tuesday\u2019s semi-final.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcio Machado/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This was England\u2019s fourth successive clean sheet but the statistic slightly flatters them: their opponents are creating chances \u2013 Cameroon had a goal disallowed by the tightest of VAR offside decisions and a one-on-one that ended with a shot straight at Bardsley \u2013 and this could prove costly in the semi-final.</p> \n<p>Having reached this stage England can no longer get away with making sloppy errors at the back and relying on the forwards to score an early goal (a happy habit: in four of their five games so far England have been ahead by the 15th minute). Though the defence was far from perfect Demi Stokes \u2013 who has been sharing the left-back position with Alex Greenwood \u2013 was solid, is very good when isolated one-against-one, and deserves now to keep her place for the semi-final.</p> \n<p>It was in attack that England truly shone, producing a display of super-clinical finishing. In their three group-stage matches they were guilty of leaving their opponents in the game, twice winning by a single goal when they could have been more comfortable.</p> \n<p>Norway, however, never got a chance to catch their breath. Ellen White hit the post once and completely missed the ball from Bronze\u2019s pull-back in the third minute, which Scott was fortunately able to convert, but this was another excellent display from the striker. She has scored five goals so far, matching America\u2019s Alex Morgan and Australia\u2019s Sam Kerr, from only nine shots on target and 15 overall. Toni Duggan on the left side of England\u2019s attack was not at her best \u2013 Beth Mead replaced her in the second half and could come into the starting XI for the semi-final \u2013 but the partnership of Bronze and Nikita Parris on the right was both dynamic and destructive.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4ac7b116-4d76-4824-b843-72c0eccbe6a0\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>The first official Women\u2019s World Cup was in China in 1991 \u2013 England missed that one, but have qualified five times since.

      "bodyText": "What an exceptional performance England produced in their quarter-final victory over Norway. It might have come as a surprise to anyone who saw the last-16 games, in which the English beat Cameroon despite quite a sloppy defensive display while Norway were superb as a unit against Australia, with a string of outstanding individuals such as Caroline Graham Hansen, Guro Reiten and Isabell Herlovsen. England were incredible on Thursday, producing the best display I have seen from them in a long time to make Norway appear feeble. There has been incremental growth under Phil Neville. England won the SheBelieves Cup in March, where they beat Brazil and Japan and drew with the USA, but if that was an eye-catching achievement this was another step up. Under the greatest possible pressure, at the greatest tournament of them all, they were so dominant, displayed such control and had such a clinical edge from the first minute to the 90th. Some teams have performed to a really high level throughout the tournament, but I think it\u2019s fair to say England have not been one of them. They were expected to be serious title contenders but they were yet to produce a performance that completely lived up to their billing. Here, at last, they nailed it. Now they have played five, won five, conceded once and are looking genuinely world class. Neville said he would give his players a chance in the tournament, and he has kept his word. He trusts his group, and tactically against Norway he was spot on. A goal so early will always have a significant impact, and Jill Scott\u2019s strike in the third minute destroyed the Norwegians\u2019 momentum. Having come into the game on the back of that phenomenal performance against Australia, brimming with self-belief, within seconds they\u2019re kicking off again needing to claw one back. But Martin Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s side found they couldn\u2019t get their key attacking players into the game: England doubled up tactically against Hansen, for example, and didn\u2019t let her dribble \u2013 every time she got past a player there was another wall she had to hit. Millie Bright was particularly good at making sure she was always there to support her teammates, and being that second wall. That meant Hansen was unable to lead Norway\u2019s counterattacking game like she did against Australia, and in the end she did nothing that really harmed England. When Norway did get into promising positions in the first half, they repeatedly made poor decisions. There was one moment when Lucy Bronze pressed in midfield and left a gap in behind that Reiten and Kristine Minde raced into. If Reiten passed they would probably have scored, but she chose to shoot. Later, after England had taken control of the game by scoring two further goals, Norway had a few chances to reduce the deficit. Steph Houghton cleared one shot off the line and made a number of last-minute interventions, while Karen Bardsley saved well from Herlovsen, but there was a lack of finishing ability. This was England\u2019s fourth successive clean sheet but the statistic slightly flatters them: their opponents are creating chances \u2013 Cameroon had a goal disallowed by the tightest of VAR offside decisions and a one-on-one that ended with a shot straight at Bardsley \u2013 and this could prove costly in the semi-final. Having reached this stage England can no longer get away with making sloppy errors at the back and relying on the forwards to score an early goal (a happy habit: in four of their five games so far England have been ahead by the 15th minute). Though the defence was far from perfect Demi Stokes \u2013 who has been sharing the left-back position with Alex Greenwood \u2013 was solid, is very good when isolated one-against-one, and deserves now to keep her place for the semi-final. It was in attack that England truly shone, producing a display of super-clinical finishing. In their three group-stage matches they were guilty of leaving their opponents in the game, twice winning by a single goal when they could have been more comfortable. Norway, however, never got a chance to catch their breath. Ellen White hit the post once and completely missed the ball from Bronze\u2019s pull-back in the third minute, which Scott was fortunately able to convert, but this was another excellent display from the striker. She has scored five goals so far, matching America\u2019s Alex Morgan and Australia\u2019s Sam Kerr, from only nine shots on target and 15 overall. Toni Duggan on the left side of England\u2019s attack was not at her best \u2013 Beth Mead replaced her in the second half and could come into the starting XI for the semi-final \u2013 but the partnership of Bronze and Nikita Parris on the right was both dynamic and destructive. England now need to be wary of overconfidence. Neville was asked about Bronze after the game and was obviously going to be effusive, but to say she should win the Ballon d\u2019Or was perhaps a step too far. For a start, the winner of this year\u2019s trophy is likely to be chosen from the team who win the World Cup: focus on that first, and then worry about the individual awards that may follow. Of course, there can be no doubt that she is an exceptional player and an incredible athlete. Her ability to create, to run with the ball, to strike the ball and, as Norway saw, to score goals has redefined what a right-back can be in the women\u2019s game, and that is what the world\u2019s best players do. It is right to say she is among the world\u2019s best, but there are a few others in that conversation who also happen to be semi-finalists. Given her recent performances, White might also be among them. Neville also spoke about the USA and France scouts who were sitting behind the England bench, saying he \u201cwaved at them after the goals\u201d. This might be perceived as being a little flippant, particularly when England have never won a World Cup or a European Championship while the USA, for example, have won everything going. I remember watching Croatia\u2019s Luka Modric\u2019s post-match interview after England\u2019s defeat in the semi-final of the men\u2019s World Cup last year, alluding to the arrogance of the English media who considered Croatia weaker opposition.

In these moments, we see testament to Hill\u2019s much-lauded status as one of hip-hop\u2019s foremost lyricists and one of contemporary soul\u2019s most passionate vocalists.</p> <p>So, on the Pyramid stage, 10 minutes after the scheduled start, there was a palpable nervous energy that rippled through the gigantic crowd. Hill\u2019s tour DJ valiantly spun the classic pre-gig fillers: Drop It Like It\u2019s Hot, et al but the audience was beginning to reckon with another disappointment. Happily, though, five minutes later and Hill appeared resplendent and imperiously hatted in black, backed by three singers and a five\u2013piece band.</p> <p>Currently winding up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/24/lauryn-hill-review-miseducation-reconfigured-with-curfew-busting-floss\">a 20th anniversary tour</a> in celebration of her debut album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, Hill\u2019s band were a well-oiled machine, responding with all the speed and efficiency of fearful children to their leader\u2019s sharp hand signals and reprimands at the end of each song.</p> <p>Opening with the anthemic Lost Ones, Hill\u2019s vocals were breathless and somewhat patchy, leaving the bulk of the singing to her harmonising backing trio. Sadly, Hill\u2019s heavy lean on the band continued throughout her 60-minute set, including a gospel-drenched version of Superstar, a meandering doo wop Can\u2019t Take My Eyes Off You and a bouncy reggae Forgive Them Father.</p> <p>In fact, it felt as if Hill had played these songs so many times in the last two decades that she couldn\u2019t bear to play them as recorded any longer. This is not necessarily a bad thing \u2013 referencing the jazz and James Brown traditions of the perpetual live rework \u2013 yet with songs so distinct and recognisable as those on the much-loved Miseducation, it was an unnecessary extravagance to remix each number.</p> <p>The crowd felt it too, with the pre-recorded album skits played out between songs and the extended breakdowns into a gospel call-and-response on Forgive Them Father and a walking bass Can\u2019t Take My Eyes Off You leading people to talk among themselves or even wander off. Perhaps most painfully, her biggest hit, Doo Wop, was left to the backing singers, while Hill hurtled through her verses, shouting sections of the rap rather than employing her signature rap-singing flow.</p> <p>It was only on the Fugees\u2019 classic, Killing Me Softly With His Song, which opened with a solo vocal, that a glimpse of Hill\u2019s true talent shone through. Notwithstanding the no-show controversies, her battles with the Internal Revenue Service in the US and even recent allegations of plagiarism, here her voice dug deep within to provide gossamer-light runs over the embellished chords. Finally, the audience were right there with her and Hill ended on that most coveted of phenomena: the Glastonbury singalong to the final chorus.</p>",

Hill\u2019s tour DJ valiantly spun the classic pre-gig fillers: Drop It Like It\u2019s Hot, et al but the audience was beginning to reckon with another disappointment. Happily, though, five minutes later and Hill appeared resplendent and imperiously hatted in black, backed by three singers and a five\u2013piece band. Currently winding up a 20th anniversary tour in celebration of her debut album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, Hill\u2019s band were a well-oiled machine, responding with all the speed and efficiency of fearful children to their leader\u2019s sharp hand signals and reprimands at the end of each song. Opening with the anthemic Lost Ones, Hill\u2019s vocals were breathless and somewhat patchy, leaving the bulk of the singing to her harmonising backing trio. Sadly, Hill\u2019s heavy lean on the band continued throughout her 60-minute set, including a gospel-drenched version of Superstar, a meandering doo wop Can\u2019t Take My Eyes Off You and a bouncy reggae Forgive Them Father. In fact, it felt as if Hill had played these songs so many times in the last two decades that she couldn\u2019t bear to play them as recorded any longer. This is not necessarily a bad thing \u2013 referencing the jazz and James Brown traditions of the perpetual live rework \u2013 yet with songs so distinct and recognisable as those on the much-loved Miseducation, it was an unnecessary extravagance to remix each number. The crowd felt it too, with the pre-recorded album skits played out between songs and the extended breakdowns into a gospel call-and-response on Forgive Them Father and a walking bass Can\u2019t Take My Eyes Off You leading people to talk among themselves or even wander off. Perhaps most painfully, her biggest hit, Doo Wop, was left to the backing singers, while Hill hurtled through her verses, shouting sections of the rap rather than employing her signature rap-singing flow. It was only on the Fugees\u2019 classic, Killing Me Softly With His Song, which opened with a solo vocal, that a glimpse of Hill\u2019s true talent shone through. Notwithstanding the no-show controversies, her battles with the Internal Revenue Service in the US and even recent allegations of plagiarism, here her voice dug deep within to provide gossamer-light runs over the embellished chords. Finally, the audience were right there with her and Hill ended on that most coveted of phenomena: the Glastonbury singalong to the final chorus.",

Yesterday\u2019s Senegal-Algeria served as a warning against overhyping matches, but there can be no denying that this one has the potential to be a doozy. It\u2019s Morocco against Ivory Coast, for goodness sake! And Herv\u00e9 Renard, aiming for a third triumph with a third country, against his former sidekick Ibrahim Kamara, striving to lead the Elephants to where Renard previously took a far stronger herd.</p> <p>Neither side looked like future champions in their openings games at this tournament but both made off with 1-0 wins and have lots of room to improve. Winning today would guarantee a place in the knockout stages. On paper you\u2019d have to make Morocco slight favourites \u2013 in Hakim Ziyech and Youn\u00e8s Belhanda they have two ingenious creators \u2013 but they have an ageing defence and have not been on song lately, having spluttered through the qualifying stages (drawing with Comoros and Malawi is not a portent of imminent greatness), lost all of their warm-up games and needed a last-minute own goal to creep past Namibia in their first match. And, of course, they have a recent history of underperforming at this tournament, having somehow failed to make it out of the group stages since 2004. Renard was brought in to address that failing, so let\u2019s see how he goes about it here.</p> <p>The Elephants have not exactly wowed onlookers on their way here either. They finished second in their qualifying group below Guinea and laboured to beat South Africa in their first match here. But there are hints that they might be emerging from what we may call a transitional period, and they have attackers who can do serious damage, most thrillingly Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9, who has been linked this summer with a move to every big club with a half-decent scouting system, and also to Manchester United (honk!). Maybe even Wilfried Zaha will get a run out today. We await the team news with interest. Until then, let\u2019s look on the bright side and say we have a barnstormer in store. It\u2019s on! </p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "That was a terrific performance by Morocco, perhaps the best in the tournament so far. They take three points thanks to a wonderful goal - created by Amrabat, scored by En-Nesyri - and they could have had a few more. Their passing and movement were lovely, especially on the counter-attack. Ivory Coast weren\u2019t awful but were inferior: but they will progress to the knockout stages if they beat Namibia in their last group game, while Morocco are already there so can face South Africa without stress. Morocco substitution: Da Costa on, Boussoufa off. 90+3 min: Morocco launch another super counter-attack. Hakimi leads it, then slips the ball wide to Boussoufa, who picks out Mazraoui running in from the right. But the Mazraoui volleys against the crossbar from 10 yards! What a lovely goal that would have been! 90+2 min: There will be at least another two minutes. Can Ivory Coast come up with something special? 89 min: The freekick from 40 yards finds it was to Traor\u00e9 at the far side of the Moroccan box. With his back to goal he takes a touch to tee himself up and then performs an overhead kick. It\u2019s on target but the keeper saves without bother. 88 min: Belhanda nips the ball wide to Mazraoui. He\u2019s dispossessed by Wonlo. Ivory Coast get a counter-attacj going, until Belhanda sabotages it by pulling back Bony. 86 min: En-Nesryi has led the line superbly today. He jumps now between two defenders to flick on a long ball towards Boufal, who\u2019s offside. 84 min: A bit of sloppiness creeping into Morocco\u2019s play as they try to see this out. Belhanda gives the ball away in midfield and is fortunate not to be punished, as the ensuing move leads to a Bony heading just wide from 10 yards. Morocco substitution: Mazraoui on, Amrabat off after a top performance. 82 min: Bony rises high to flick on a header at the near post. P\u00e9p\u00e9 tries to turn it in at the back but, despite stretching, can\u2019t reach it. Meanwhile, Amrabat is down again, this time complaining off a sore foot. 80 min: P\u00e9p\u00e9, who\u2019s been quiet, curls over a freekick from the left. It pinballs around the Moroccan box before they manage to boot it clear. 78 min: A break in play as Amrabat demands treatment for a perceived elbow to his head. That\u2019s his imagination playing tricks on him... 76 min: Bony concedes a freekick after controlling the ball not with his chest but his arm. That may well be his first touch. The Elephants don\u2019t appear to have much of a clue as to how to get back into this game. It\u2019s beginning to take on the air of a 1-0 pummelling... Morocco substitution: Boufal on, Ziyech off. The Ajax player looks miffed to be coming off but he was not at his best today, though he did playa couple of slinky passes. 74 min: Amrabat, another top performer today, clips a decent cross into the box. En-Nesyri beats the defender to it but flashes his header wide of the far post from eight yards. 73 min: Gnoghouo has played the sweeper-keeper role very well today. He has again hurtled off his line just now to tidy up, beating En-Nesyri to the ball by a whisker. 71 min: Looks like Amrabat was looped into those clips of Wayne Rooney from midweek. He tries to lob the keeper from inside his own half. It flies over the keeper, all right, but about 10 yards over the bar, too. Ivory Coast substitution: Bagayoko on, Aurier off. So there\u2019ll be no action for Zaha today. Might aswell take out his phone an check for incoming messages from Arsenal ... 67 min: Hakimi sprints into the box and takes a tumble as Traore challenges. But there was no contact and the ref is right to wave play on. El Ahmadi gets a yellow for protesting. 66 min: With Ivory Coast momentarily down to 10 men, Morocco try to tae advantage. They string together another flowing move from left to right. It concludes with Dirar fizzing a low cross into the middle. En-Nesyri meets with a dainty flick at the edge of the six-yard box. Fine save by the keeper! 64 min: A blow for the Elephants as Aurier, who\u2019s had a good game so far, pulls up lame. Or rather, he falls to the ground in pain, seemingly having pulled a muscle. It doesn\u2019t look like he can continue. Ivory Coast substitution: Bony on, S\u00e9ri off. Poor Wilf Zaha, still sitting on the bench while Wilf Bony is given a game ahead of him. It\u2019s for tactical reasons, in fairness, as Kamara obviously figures that two outright strikers are what is required here. 62 min: A flowing Moroccan move: Ziyech to Boussoufa to Hakimi to ... no one! The final ball goes astray after the Atlas Lions swept 30 yards forward and into the box. 61 min: Ziyech has a blem from 22 yards. The ball wobbles over the bar. 60 min: Ziyech pings in a freekick from the right. En-Nesyri gets his head to it from six yards out ... but steers it over the bar! 57 min: Wonlo, angry at not being given a freekick after being shoved in the back in an aerial challenge, flies into a tackle on Boussoufa, taking man and ball. Textbook route to a yellow card. 55 min: Amrabat tackles back down the right to dispossess Wonlo. Ziyech then tries to trigger a counter-attack with a smart crossfield pass. But Aurier puts an end to that. Ivory Coast substitution: Cornet on, Gradel off. Still no Zaha ... 52 min: Saiss finds Amrabat with a raking long pass from the back. Aurier dispossess him with an impeccable sliding tackle. 50 min: Ivory Coast have yet to get going in this half. Morocco are in charge. 48 min: Hakimi flies down the left again, then cuts back into the box and lets fly. Aurier blocks his shot, conceding a corner. 47 min: Eager to pick up where they left off, Morocco make a bright start to this half, probing down the right and then, via a crossfield pass by Benatia, down the left. Hakimi\u2019s cross is hoofed to safety. 46 min: Let\u2019s have some more, shall we? No subs during the break and let\u2019s hope there\u2019s no changes to the team\u2019s attacking approaches, either. \u201cThe Ivorian keeper keeps on attempting to locate his forwards with passes but missing them,\u201d reckons. Felix Wood. \u201cI guess Bono still hasn\u2019t found what he\u2019s looking for.\u201d Oh, Felix, where\u2019s your pride (in the name of love)? More to the point, where\u2019s Wilf? If the score stays the same, you\u2019ve got to think Zaha will be sprung from the bench. That was an exhilarating half and Morocco fully deserve their lead. And what a daisy of a goal it was, too. Some of their passing and movement has been delightful. But the Elephants have had their moments, too, and there\u2019s every chance there\u2019ll be more goals in this. The winners, remember, will book a place in the last 16. 45 min: Kodjia gets a lecture and stern finger-wagging from the referee after giving Sa\u00efss\u2019 shirt a sneaky tug before throwing himself to the ground. 44 min: A much better delivery by Ziyech, depositing the ball at the edge of the six-yard box from a freekick. Traor\u00e9 does very well to hook it away. 43 min: Ziyech sends a corner out for a throw-in on the far side. His deliveries have left a lot to be desired so far. But his play in the open has been dandy. 42 min: Moments after Serey Die tests the keeper with a fine shot from distance, Seri tries something similar. This, too, is well hit, but it whizzes past the upright. 40 min: What a counter-attack! Hakimi raged out of his defence, driving 50 yards forward and then threading a pass through to Amrabat, who duped the defence with a gorgeous dummy, letting the ball roll into the path of En-Nesyri, who ignores an attempted tackle and tries to guide the ball into the far corner from 16 yards. Good save by Gbohouo! 38 min: Aurier romps down the right, then chops back on to his left foot and sends over a cross ... that drifts a yard over the bar. 36 min: Benatia heads away a freekick at the expense of a corner. The delivery is poxy. 34 min: Morocco have really found a nice rhythm. Their passing and movement is seriously stretching the Ivorians. 32 min: Amrabat makes a canny run into space on the right and is picked out by Dirar. He then sends over an inviting cross, which two attackers and two defenders try to meet, but everyone misses! 29 min: Ziyech whips in a dangerous freekick from the lefet. Wonlo does well to clear before En-Nesyri can connect. 27 min: This is shaping up to the be game of the tournament so far. It\u2019s high-intensity fare with quality to match, and a brilliant goal already in the bag. 24 min: Bono hurtles out to the edge of his box and dives at the feet of Gradel, pushing the ball away from the striker ... but straight to P\u00e9p\u00e9! The forward tries it on the run past the two covering defenders and into the net, but he misses the target by a yard. So close to an instant equaliser! Told you this was fun. 23 min: Mali scored a couple of foxy blasters the other da, but En-Nesyri has jsut scord the goal of the tournament so far, I reckon. That\u2019s a brilliant goal! Amrabat created it with a jinking run past three players and a marvellously cute ball through to En-Nesyri, who rewarded it with an immaculate finish, slamming low past the keeper from 12 yards! 21 min: There\u2019s a bracing pace to this contest and plenty of attacking intent. It\u2019s fun. 19 min: Lovely play by Morocco! Belhanda slipped a sweet pass through to Dirar, flying down the right. The full-back fires in a useful cross, which En-Nesyri met at the near post with a first-time shot. From a difficult angle it flies into the sidenetting. 19 min: Another testing delivery from P\u00e9p\u00e9, this time from a corner. Benatia is equal to it, heading away under pressure. 17 min: Kodjia dribbles past Sa\u00efss and into the box before Hakimi intervenes to concede a corner. Pep\u00e9 clears. 15 min: Pep\u00e9 delivers a dangerous cross from the left, but no one manages to get on the end of it. 14 min: Ziyech tries to dupe the keeper by going straight for goal from the freekick out wide. But Gbohouo didn\u2019t look surprised as he watched the ball sail high over his bar. 13 min: That\u2019s not so hot from Aurier: pushing Amrabat in the back gives away a needless freekick just to the right of the Ivorian box... 12 min: While Aurier has impressed on the right, Pepe has yet to have any impact. His first real involvement was a flop, as he failed to control a crossfield pass. 11 min: En-Nesyri races forward to try to get on the end of an astute through-ball, but Gbouhouo read it well and charges out off his box to welly clear. 9 min: Aurier has made an impressive start. He\u2019s snuffed out several Moroccan attacks and launched a couple of good Ivorian ones. 8 min: Slick interplay by Morocco down the left. Hakimi tries to dodge his way into the box but Aurier keeps his eye on the ball and prods it out for a corner. 6 min: Traor\u00e9 does well to clear a cross by Ziyech as Morocco apply serious pressure. 4 min: Gboubouo comes to meet a corner. Under no pressure he could catch it but decides against and punches it over the bar instead for another one. Stick it on him, would be my advice. Instead it\u2019s sent towards Benatia near the penalty spot and he can\u2019t direct his header on target. \u201cIs that really Bono playing as goalkeeper for Morocco?\u201d blurts Sam Willingham. \u201cI assume he\u2019s wearing number One?\u201d Yes, he is, actually. But it\u2019s not the Bono you\u2019re thinking of: when it comes to goalkeeping this guy has his limitations but is still even better than the real thing. 2 min: What a start! Aurier roars down the right and flashes a lovely cross to the far post. Kodjia arrives at speed to send a downward header bouncing towards the net from six yards. But Saiss gets back to make a superb clearance of the line! 1 min: We have kickoff! Morocco do the honours. Behold the teams! The Elephants are in their all-white away kit, allowing Morocco sport their usual red-jersey and green-short ensemble. Any Arsenal fans wanting to remind themselves of what Wilf Zaha can do will have to hope that Morocco take the lead so that Ivory Coast have to throw on an attacker. And perhaps they would be happy if the Moroccan goal came from Youssef En-Neysri, the Leganes striker who has also been linked with a move to Arsenal (and who didn\u2019t do much against Namibia in the first match). Eric Bailly, since you ask, did not start in 2017 and injury precludes him from taking part in this tournament. But he has turned up at the stadium to support his teammates. Nine of the players who start for Morocco today also started when they beat Ivory Coast 2-0 in Abidjan in 2017 to qualify for the World Cup. Only four of the Ivorians feature today (Zaha started last time, in case you\u2019re wondering), but that includes the goalkeeper and two of the defenders (Aurier and Kanon) who were somehow unable to prevent these two goals: Morocco: Bono; Dirar, Benatia, Sa\u00efss, Hakimi; Boussoufa, El Ahmadi; Amrabat, Ziyech, Belhanda; En-Nesyri Subs: Mazraoui, Bennasser, Fajr, Da Costa, Boufal, Idrissi, Boujab, EL Kajoui, Abdelhamid, Bourabia Ivory Coast: Gbohouo; Aurier, Traor\u00e9, Kanon, Wonlo; Serey Die, Kessie; P\u00e9p\u00e9, Seri, Gradel; Kodjia Subs: Ira, Doumbia, Zaha, Assal\u00e9 Cornet, Bony, I Sangar\u00e9, Bagayoko, B Sangar\u00e9 Referee: A N\u00e9ant (Cameroon) Hello and welcome to another heavyweight duel in an Africa Cup of Nations that looks wide open. Yesterday\u2019s Senegal-Algeria served as a warning against overhyping matches, but there can be no denying that this one has the potential to be a doozy.

      "bodyText": "For someone who is so loved, Ashleigh Barty knows a lot about loneliness. \u201cI would love to be home every single minute of every single day,\u201d says the world No 1 and French Open champion, whose home is 12,000 miles away in Queensland, but whose heart and soul for the next fortnight will be at Wimbledon. She knows, too, about the deadening weight of expectation, the spirit-crushing hopes of others that nearly finished her career before it had properly started, and she is forever grateful that she survived with the help of friends and family. \u201cThe most important thing is all the people around me I trust,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are genuine, real human beings. So, besides the tennis, we have relationships off the court first and foremost \u2013 and then the tennis comes second. Every single member of my team is like family to me.\u201d It is an odd view for a young, driven athlete to take: that her sport comes second \u2013 although Andy Murray has been making similar noises about the autumn of his career. They have much in common. It is hard, also, to picture her in any way disconsolate, so upbeat is the 23-year-old\u2019s demeanour. However, 10 years ago, when she was a sparkling teenage presence around Ipswich, about 25 miles south-west of Brisbane, all smiling exuberance and clever ground strokes, a sponsor sent her to Las Vegas to spend a week with the royal couple of tennis, Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf. Soon afterwards, the hype was ramped up to a level she was not expecting. As she recalls: \u201cI was 13, 14, playing against other WTA players. It was an eye-opening experience. Any time you get to rub shoulders with legends, it\u2019s incredible. To be able to speak with them \u2013 albeit very briefly \u2013 made memories that I will never forget.\u201d Barty returned home and started winning trophies, often beating players older and more experienced than herself. Australians, who value sport on a par with religion and way above politics, had found their Joan of Arc. Then Barty hit a wall. One year on Tour, she was out of the country for all but 73 days. \u201cThere are different pressures [growing up as a prodigy], but it\u2019s how you deal with them. And I didn\u2019t deal them with them well. I didn\u2019t deal with all the noise that was going on around me while I was younger.\u201d As she prepares for the tournament that suits her game perhaps best of all, expectations mount again after her maiden grand slam victory in Paris this month. Adored by old friends as well as a new audience enchanted by her quiet self-confidence, rapid-fire straight talking and good humour, she is, as she says \u201cliving the dream\u201d. But Barty can see past the well-meaning words and the smiles of others. When the 20-year-old British player Katie Swan failed to make the main draw at Roland Garros, she revealed she had considered pulling out of the qualifying tournament. Swan, whose sunny disposition has hidden her anxieties from even close friends, said she feared \u201cdisappointing my family, team and all the people around supporting me\u201d.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/18/rosalia-review-flamenco\">Rosal\u00eda</a> always knew she would be famous. \u201cI\u2019m a spiritual person so I had a vision of this moment in my life,\u201d she says the day before her cover of Spanish Vogue drops, and a week on from being namechecked by Madonna in an interview (more on that later). In the space of just two years she has evolved from singing flamenco standards on her death-obsessed debut album Los \u00c1ngeles, to controversially modernising that genre\u2019s folkloric traditions via the high-gloss sheen of R&amp;B on her breakthrough collection <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/01/rosalia-el-mal-querer-review-flamenco-pop-star-is-a-formidable-new-talent\">El Mal Querer</a>, swiftly becoming pop\u2019s most exciting new superstar in the process. Last year, in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/arts/music/rosalia-flamenco-el-mal-querer.html\">a New York Times profile</a>, the 25-year-old was hailed as \u201cthe Rihanna of flamenco\u201d.</p> <p>Along the way, she has picked up fans ranging from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/07/james-blake-interview-overgrown\">James Blake</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/13/alicia-keys-here-review\">Alicia Keys</a> (to whom she\u2019s been giving Spanish lessons) and director Pedro Almod\u00f3var, who cast her in his latest film Pain and Glory. That\u2019s thanks in part to the album\u2019s crossover hit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/01/rosalia-el-mal-querer-review-flamenco-pop-star-is-a-formidable-new-talent\">Malamente</a>, full of complex handclap rhythms and sleek electronic pulses, which landed her five Latin Grammy nominations and a performance at the MTV Europe music awards. Its <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rht7rBHuXW8\">head-spinning, Hype-Williams-does-Top-Gear video</a>, featuring Rosal\u00eda executing flawless choreography in the back of a lorry, and later being lifted skywards on the prongs of a forklift, currently stands at 85m YouTube views. Its mix of industrial, modern and traditional (matadors lure motorbikes rather than bulls; cape-wearing penitents glide around on skateboards) is a perfect encapsulation of Rosal\u00eda\u2019s merging of Spain\u2019s past and present. It\u2019s been a busy 12 months, capped this weekend with a performance at Glastonbury that will see her reach a whole new audience, a la <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/sep/04/christine-and-the-queens-heloise-letissier-interview\">Christine and the Queens in 2016</a>, and tighten her grip as global pop\u2019s latest innovator.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLFUhty8EF4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CLFUhty8EF4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>If this newfound fame has unsettled her, she is not showing it. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been preparing all my life for this moment,\u201d she says on the phone from a Barcelona studio. Her grasp of English is much better than she gives herself credit for \u2013 \u201cOh my God, my English is the worst!\u201d she screams in frustration at one point \u2013 considering all her songs are performed in Spanish. \u201cI\u2019m working harder now than at any other point in my life because I have a fear of losing what I have,\u201d she adds. \u201cBefore, I had nothing; I didn\u2019t have any contacts in the industry, nobody around me was a musician, so it was really hard. But I also had nothing to lose so I\u2019ve always been fearless.\u201d</p> <p>That determination has been put to the test recently with accusations from certain sections of the Spanish media that Rosal\u00eda\u2019s use of flamenco iconography \u2013 traditions fostered by the art form\u2019s historical ties to Spain\u2019s marginalised Gypsy (or Gitanos) community in Andalusia \u2013 amounts to cultural appropriation. Rosal\u00eda was born in the more affluent region of Catalonia and critics have cited her use of Gitano vocabulary and phrasing as problematic. \u201cFlamenco is suffering a kind of institutional racism that whitewashes the art form and markets it like a piece of meat wrapped up in plastic,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-11-14/award-winning-rosal-flamenco-fame-questioned-spains-roma-community\">Gitana activist Noelia Cort\u00e9s told Public Radio International</a> in 2018. While Rosal\u00eda\u2019s initial position was defensive, citing in interviews the fact that she studied flamenco from a young age as proof of her passion (she has a bachelor\u2019s degree in flamenco vocal performance), she offers a slightly more balanced take today.</p> <p>\u201cIt is very important that people understand how important flamenco is to the Gypsy community,\u201d she says, choosing her words carefully. \u201cThere have been some amazing Gypsy artists. It\u2019s important that we give visibility to that, but at the same time people have to be fair and recognise that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/26/paco-de-lucia-flamenco-guitarist-dies\">Paco de Luc\u00eda</a> was the biggest guitar player in this style of music in the world and he wasn\u2019t Gypsy. Lola Flores was the biggest Spanish female flamenco icon and she wasn\u2019t Gypsy. Music is beyond races, beyond territories.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"be27c0ec0124a5b916c86bcaff7b9022160e564c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be27c0ec0124a5b916c86bcaff7b9022160e564c/0_303_2351_2938/800.jpg\" alt=\"Performing at S\u00f3nar in 2018.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Performing at S\u00f3nar in 2018.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xavi Torrent/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She says she is aware, too, of her privileged position and keen to create a platform \u201cthat\u2019s helpful for all the people who don\u2019t have the opportunities\u201d. She grows angry, however, when reflecting on the implication that she is nothing more than a capitalist construct and that flamenco is merely an adornment to a campaign with a huge marketing budget; the <a href=\"https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/music/2018/11/15/Rosalia-flamenco-singer-Spain-Roma-feminist-Latin-Grammys-winner/stories/201811010274\">Association of Feminist Gitanas for Diversity (AFGD)</a> last year dismissed her as a \u201cposeur\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen an artist becomes pop, it\u2019s because the people choose it,\u201d she says, now speaking at a canter. \u201cYes, you can have that dream to be a big pop star, but it\u2019s the audience that puts you in that position. I never had a paid marketing campaign, it was never like that. Never. The content was, and is, radical and it worked. When Malamente was released I had no label [she is now signed to Columbia].

At the age of 13, she and sister Pili (now her stylist) would hang out near parks with older friends who\u2019d blare its tales of emotional blood-letting from their car stereos. She was captivated instantly. When I ask why, she hesitates, adding a \u201cthis is my personal opinion\u201d caveat, so as not to ruffle any feathers. \u201cI would say, for me, flamenco is so pure, so raw,\u201d she says. \u201cI love pop culture but sometimes I miss the root, the rawness. With flamenco, I felt like I always needed it, I just didn\u2019t know it. It\u2019s purer than anything else for me. If you don\u2019t put the truth into it, it won\u2019t work. I don\u2019t know what it will be but it won\u2019t be flamenco.\u201d If flamenco is the music of passion, of experience, of a life well lived, where does the wise-beyond-her-years sadness that permeates her songs emanate from? The answer, it turns out, is Carl Jung. \u201cHe talks about a collective unconsciousness, and I love this concept. I\u2019m a spiritual person, and I really think that we don\u2019t just die.\u201d</p> <p>Despite being inspired by Flamenca, an obscure 13th-century novel about a jealous husband who locks his wife in a tower, El Mal Querer (it roughly translates as \u201ctoxic love\u201d) has tracks that reference both Justin Timberlake\u2019s Cry Me a River and Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s Say My Name. \u201cJustin Timberlake was everywhere [growing up],\u201d she says. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/jun/19/artsfeatures3\">Destiny\u2019s Child</a> was something I\u2019d hear all the time in Spain, too; same with the Spice Girls and Britney Spears. These were icons. They influenced me and I have no problem giving them credit [for that]. I love it the same way I love Mozart or Bach.\u201d Who was her favourite Spice Girl? \u201cI just loved the bus!\u201d she says. \u201cThey used to have a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/25/spice-girls-review-nostalgia-live-croke-park-dublin\">Spice Girls</a> bus and I dreamed of having a bus like that.\u201d In fact, growing up in Sant Esteve Sesrovires, a small town on the outskirts of Barcelona, surrounded by factories, Rosal\u00eda would obsess over any large vehicle. \u201cI used to constantly see trucks and study the drivers\u2019 lifestyle,\u201d she says. Years later, she would subvert this \u201cvery masculine space\u201d in her videos for Malamente and the lilting Pienso En Tu Mir\u00e1, in which truck drivers bleed out through their hearts. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting for me to explore visually; to put women in places that usually have a male energy.\u201d One of El Mar Querer\u2019s more aggressive songs, De Aqui No Sales, samples a revving motorbike to create its off beat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47557b94bc60f1320ce4c5e02207291e53f7ffd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47557b94bc60f1320ce4c5e02207291e53f7ffd5/0_119_5000_3214/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Performing at Flamenco White Night in C\u00f3rdoba in 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Performing at Flamenco White Night in C\u00f3rdoba in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rafa Alcaide/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Growing up, her musical icons were all female: besides Britney, Bey and the Spice Girls, she loved Janis Joplin, Lola Flores and Lil Kim.

It\u2019s important we give visibility to women in an industry that\u2019s still very masculine.\u201d Obsessing over Lil Kim inspired another of Rosal\u00eda\u2019s recent visual statements: her mythical beauty gang in the Aute Cuture video are bedecked with the kind of intricate nail embellishments that turn talons into weapons. \u201cI think [having] long nails is a radical feminist symbol,\u201d she says. \u201cVery extreme.

Things got complicated, according to Madonna, when \u201ca manager stepped in and then an agent stepped in and then five people were involved and then they wanted to charge an extraordinary amount of money and then it was 36 people [wanting to attend], and I was like: \u2018Wait, what?\u2019 so it never happened.\u201d Rosal\u00eda is keen to clear up any misunderstanding. \u201cI was very excited because I am a big Madonna fan,\u201d she starts carefully. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into this too much, but I can tell you that it was no more than eight people around me, not 36, which is crazy.

      "bodyText": "Rosal\u00eda always knew she would be famous. \u201cI\u2019m a spiritual person so I had a vision of this moment in my life,\u201d she says the day before her cover of Spanish Vogue drops, and a week on from being namechecked by Madonna in an interview (more on that later). In the space of just two years she has evolved from singing flamenco standards on her death-obsessed debut album Los \u00c1ngeles, to controversially modernising that genre\u2019s folkloric traditions via the high-gloss sheen of R&amp;B on her breakthrough collection El Mal Querer, swiftly becoming pop\u2019s most exciting new superstar in the process. Last year, in a New York Times profile, the 25-year-old was hailed as \u201cthe Rihanna of flamenco\u201d. Along the way, she has picked up fans ranging from James Blake to Alicia Keys (to whom she\u2019s been giving Spanish lessons) and director Pedro Almod\u00f3var, who cast her in his latest film Pain and Glory. That\u2019s thanks in part to the album\u2019s crossover hit Malamente, full of complex handclap rhythms and sleek electronic pulses, which landed her five Latin Grammy nominations and a performance at the MTV Europe music awards. Its head-spinning, Hype-Williams-does-Top-Gear video, featuring Rosal\u00eda executing flawless choreography in the back of a lorry, and later being lifted skywards on the prongs of a forklift, currently stands at 85m YouTube views. Its mix of industrial, modern and traditional (matadors lure motorbikes rather than bulls; cape-wearing penitents glide around on skateboards) is a perfect encapsulation of Rosal\u00eda\u2019s merging of Spain\u2019s past and present. It\u2019s been a busy 12 months, capped this weekend with a performance at Glastonbury that will see her reach a whole new audience, a la Christine and the Queens in 2016, and tighten her grip as global pop\u2019s latest innovator. If this newfound fame has unsettled her, she is not showing it. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been preparing all my life for this moment,\u201d she says on the phone from a Barcelona studio. Her grasp of English is much better than she gives herself credit for \u2013 \u201cOh my God, my English is the worst!\u201d she screams in frustration at one point \u2013 considering all her songs are performed in Spanish. \u201cI\u2019m working harder now than at any other point in my life because I have a fear of losing what I have,\u201d she adds. \u201cBefore, I had nothing; I didn\u2019t have any contacts in the industry, nobody around me was a musician, so it was really hard. But I also had nothing to lose so I\u2019ve always been fearless.\u201d That determination has been put to the test recently with accusations from certain sections of the Spanish media that Rosal\u00eda\u2019s use of flamenco iconography \u2013 traditions fostered by the art form\u2019s historical ties to Spain\u2019s marginalised Gypsy (or Gitanos) community in Andalusia \u2013 amounts to cultural appropriation. Rosal\u00eda was born in the more affluent region of Catalonia and critics have cited her use of Gitano vocabulary and phrasing as problematic. \u201cFlamenco is suffering a kind of institutional racism that whitewashes the art form and markets it like a piece of meat wrapped up in plastic,\u201d Gitana activist Noelia Cort\u00e9s told Public Radio International in 2018. While Rosal\u00eda\u2019s initial position was defensive, citing in interviews the fact that she studied flamenco from a young age as proof of her passion (she has a bachelor\u2019s degree in flamenco vocal performance), she offers a slightly more balanced take today. \u201cIt is very important that people understand how important flamenco is to the Gypsy community,\u201d she says, choosing her words carefully. \u201cThere have been some amazing Gypsy artists. It\u2019s important that we give visibility to that, but at the same time people have to be fair and recognise that Paco de Luc\u00eda was the biggest guitar player in this style of music in the world and he wasn\u2019t Gypsy. Lola Flores was the biggest Spanish female flamenco icon and she wasn\u2019t Gypsy. Music is beyond races, beyond territories.\u201d She says she is aware, too, of her privileged position and keen to create a platform \u201cthat\u2019s helpful for all the people who don\u2019t have the opportunities\u201d. She grows angry, however, when reflecting on the implication that she is nothing more than a capitalist construct and that flamenco is merely an adornment to a campaign with a huge marketing budget; the Association of Feminist Gitanas for Diversity (AFGD) last year dismissed her as a \u201cposeur\u201d. \u201cWhen an artist becomes pop, it\u2019s because the people choose it,\u201d she says, now speaking at a canter. \u201cYes, you can have that dream to be a big pop star, but it\u2019s the audience that puts you in that position. I never had a paid marketing campaign, it was never like that. Never. The content was, and is, radical and it worked. When Malamente was released I had no label [she is now signed to Columbia]. I made El Mal Querer with my friend; we produced it together, and worked on it for more than a year and a half. If you\u2019re a creative person and use creativity a lot in the way you treat your craft then you are probably going to succeed. When people say marketing and shit like that, they don\u2019t understand; you can\u2019t force people!\u201d She lets out a half-laugh, half-gasp, suddenly aware of how frustrated she\u2019s become. Rosal\u00eda relaxes when explaining why she was drawn to flamenco in the first place. At the age of 13, she and sister Pili (now her stylist) would hang out near parks with older friends who\u2019d blare its tales of emotional blood-letting from their car stereos.

      "body": "<p>Anyone arriving at Chester-le-Street just after two o\u2019clock would have been bewildered to find two umpires, 11 men in green and two batsmen flat on the ground, faces nose deep in the grass as a swarm of bees buzzed across the square. But there was no sting in the tale for Eoin Morgan, as Sri Lanka fluffed the understudy lines suddenly thrust at them and declined the offer to draw level on points with England \u2013 without completely removing the possibility of qualifying for the semi-finals as the complicated last-gasp dance continues.</p> <p>The nine-wicket victory with more than 12 overs remaining was only South Africa\u2019s second win in what has been a personal dog\u2019s dinner of a tournament. Their solitary victory before this was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/15/imran-tahir-afghanistan-south-africa-cricket-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">a slow crawl against Afghanistan</a>. Yet there were signs of life in this autumnal triumph \u2013 a disciplined bowling display, sucking the Sri Lankans into self-destruct mode, and some incidental high-class fripperies with the bat from Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/28/jos-buttler-england-india-world-cup\">Jos Buttler admits England\u2019s players have been frustrated by their form</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amla clonked two balls of the first over of South Africa\u2019s reply to the boundary, leaning gloriously into a stroke on the off side before flicking the next ball through midwicket as Lasith Malinga drifted on to his pads. But in Malinga\u2019s next over he repeatedly rooted his feet to the ground while awkwardly jousting outside off stump. A little later he pulled out a lofted shot that crawled to a standstill short of the boundary. Then a poky nudge, followed by the purest of cover drives.</p> <p>And so it went on, sumptuousness followed by inelegance, on a slow pitch that proved tricky for any strokeplay other than the most gung-ho.</p> <p>The only wicket to fall in the innings was that of Quinton de Kock, who after three fours was mesmerised by one of Malinga\u2019s low-armed slingers, a dipping speedy yorker that crept between bat and pad to crash into the stumps. Du Plessis, the tall-standing foil to Amla\u2019s shuffling master, finished 96 not out, clocking up his third fifty of the World Cup. He also hit the shot of the day \u2013 a dancing, towering six which was the 265th of the tournament \u2013 88 metres straight over the Lumley End off Suranga Lakmal. His next ball was pulled masterfully through midwicket for four. Amla finished unbeaten on 80, his biggest scare coming when he gave himself out after seeing a reviewed lbw on the big screen, only to be called back when it was revealed the ball pitched outside leg stump.</p> <p>Their unbroken stand of 175 was South Africa\u2019s highest of the tournament and gave some easy afternoon pleasure to a full ground enjoying the first of its three World Cup fixtures, a gentle breeze cooling the ground in anticipation of the heatwave on its slow march north.</p> <p>Du Plessis won the early-morning toss and had a bowl, looking for some seam movement on a good pitch. What was he after? \u201cA win,\u201d came the rather desperate answer. South Africa had won 16 of their last 18 ODIs against Sri Lanka but World Cup campaigns can run sides low.</p> <p>Sri Lanka had been given permission by the ICC to pull on their lucky yellow change jerseys that they had worn when they beat England but luck turned out to be in short supply.</p> <p>Dimuth Karunaratne was out to the very first ball of the morning, caught off guard by some bounce from Kagiso Rabada, his horizontal bat limp as the ball billowed to Du Plessis at second slip. From there Kusal Perera and Avishka Fernando decided to live by the sword, slotting four fours each as their left-hand right-hand combination threw the bowlers off their line.

      "bodyText": "Anyone arriving at Chester-le-Street just after two o\u2019clock would have been bewildered to find two umpires, 11 men in green and two batsmen flat on the ground, faces nose deep in the grass as a swarm of bees buzzed across the square. But there was no sting in the tale for Eoin Morgan, as Sri Lanka fluffed the understudy lines suddenly thrust at them and declined the offer to draw level on points with England \u2013 without completely removing the possibility of qualifying for the semi-finals as the complicated last-gasp dance continues. The nine-wicket victory with more than 12 overs remaining was only South Africa\u2019s second win in what has been a personal dog\u2019s dinner of a tournament. Their solitary victory before this was a slow crawl against Afghanistan. Yet there were signs of life in this autumnal triumph \u2013 a disciplined bowling display, sucking the Sri Lankans into self-destruct mode, and some incidental high-class fripperies with the bat from Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis. Amla clonked two balls of the first over of South Africa\u2019s reply to the boundary, leaning gloriously into a stroke on the off side before flicking the next ball through midwicket as Lasith Malinga drifted on to his pads. But in Malinga\u2019s next over he repeatedly rooted his feet to the ground while awkwardly jousting outside off stump. A little later he pulled out a lofted shot that crawled to a standstill short of the boundary. Then a poky nudge, followed by the purest of cover drives. And so it went on, sumptuousness followed by inelegance, on a slow pitch that proved tricky for any strokeplay other than the most gung-ho. The only wicket to fall in the innings was that of Quinton de Kock, who after three fours was mesmerised by one of Malinga\u2019s low-armed slingers, a dipping speedy yorker that crept between bat and pad to crash into the stumps. Du Plessis, the tall-standing foil to Amla\u2019s shuffling master, finished 96 not out, clocking up his third fifty of the World Cup. He also hit the shot of the day \u2013 a dancing, towering six which was the 265th of the tournament \u2013 88 metres straight over the Lumley End off Suranga Lakmal. His next ball was pulled masterfully through midwicket for four. Amla finished unbeaten on 80, his biggest scare coming when he gave himself out after seeing a reviewed lbw on the big screen, only to be called back when it was revealed the ball pitched outside leg stump. Their unbroken stand of 175 was South Africa\u2019s highest of the tournament and gave some easy afternoon pleasure to a full ground enjoying the first of its three World Cup fixtures, a gentle breeze cooling the ground in anticipation of the heatwave on its slow march north. Du Plessis won the early-morning toss and had a bowl, looking for some seam movement on a good pitch. What was he after? \u201cA win,\u201d came the rather desperate answer. South Africa had won 16 of their last 18 ODIs against Sri Lanka but World Cup campaigns can run sides low. Sri Lanka had been given permission by the ICC to pull on their lucky yellow change jerseys that they had worn when they beat England but luck turned out to be in short supply. Dimuth Karunaratne was out to the very first ball of the morning, caught off guard by some bounce from Kagiso Rabada, his horizontal bat limp as the ball billowed to Du Plessis at second slip. From there Kusal Perera and Avishka Fernando decided to live by the sword, slotting four fours each as their left-hand right-hand combination threw the bowlers off their line. But both fell for 30, snared by the excellent man of the match, Dwaine Pretorius, playing his first World Cup game. Theirs were to be the highest scores in a total of 203 as Sri Lanka\u2019s middle order chose to live by the sofa, stodging along, settling in, slow between the wickets, happy to block out balls \u2013 there were 187 dots in the innings \u2013 until suddenly throwing the popcorn in the air in big-hitting panic and getting out. Malinga, still a crowd favourite after all these years and who, incidentally, can still touch his toes at the start of his spells, had time to swat a burly boundary before being last man out, with three balls of the innings to spare. Things are likely to be rather more tense when England play here on Wednesday in what could be a sudden-death game against New Zealand. After the game Pretorius said: \u201cThe guys are stoked, we showed what we are capable of, I\u2019m just sad that it\u2019s too late.\u201d England live in terror that the opposite could be true for them \u2013 they have already shown us what they can do, only to fall at the last.",

      "bodyText": "Jacqueline Donachie\u2019s An Era of Small Pleasures is based on those tiny moments of light relief parents experience when their children are young \u2013 maybe over a silent five-minute cup of coffee. But it is not relevant that the people that assisted Donachie in creating it were all women with young children. \u201cThey are artists\u201d she emphasises, \u201cit is coincidental\u201d. And, even though the three participants in Donachie Rhodes Ryan at the Freelands Foundation appear because they received funding from the Freelands award as mid-career female practitioners, their gender is not relevant. They are artists; artists without the \u201cfemale\u201d prefix. There is no millennial pink here or a spangly sign, nor is there heavy-handed curatorial themes of \u201cthe body\u201d, \u201cdomesticity\u201d or \u201cfeminism\u201d. Donachie Rhodes Ryan unites Donachie, Lis Rhodes and Veronica Ryan, the first three women to receive the Freelands award since it was established in 2016. The \u00a3100,000 prize is presented to a gallery outside of London hoping to present a survey exhibition of a mid-career female artist who is yet to receive recognition, ringfencing \u00a325,000 for the individual to produce a new work. This was a proactive response from the foundation who \u2013 after commissioning a report into how gender affects artistic career progression \u2013 discovered a large discrepancy between art students (66% female in 2018) and professional practitioners (68% male represented by top private London galleries in 2018). After the rush of emerging opportunities fade, \u201cthey just disappear\u201d says Freelands Foundation creative director Henry Ward. In a bid to rectify the historical pattern of forgetting and undervaluing female artists, the foundation shines the spotlight on its winning artists once more to mark the publication of their most recent report into gender (Representation of Female Artists in Britain During 2018). Ryan, who won the award in 2018 and will exhibit at Spike Island in 2020, presents Salvage, a reassessment of her early work that literally disappeared when it was lost in the Momart fire in 2004. On simple industrial storage shelves, Ryan arranges yams and sweet potatoes, plaster casts of fruit and vegetable trays, plush cushions, a coil of teabags and layers of fabric part way through the tie-dying process. It is a cabinet of curiosities, encapsulating Ryan\u2019s current explorations into materiality and her long-term interest in categorisation. A fascination with materiality also appears in Donachie\u2019s An Era of Small Pleasures with a 16-metre chain made of leather.

      "body": "<p>Simple, straight answers are often rare in Formula One, so the honest and the heartfelt stand out immediately. As the Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, considers another home grand prix in Austria where his drivers will again face a possible bludgeoning from Mercedes, his passion for the sport is unmistakable. The desire to win remains a driving force, as is his emotional attachment to F1, which Horner believes now more than ever desperately needs to make a success of its reinvention in 2021.</p> \n<p>He has ridden the rollercoaster with Red Bull since 2005, when they entered the sport. He built the team into the all-conquering force that took four drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 championship doubles with Sebastian Vettel between 2010 and 2013. It was some journey for the man who had persuaded his parents that he should put off going to university to pursue a career in racing, then switched to running his own team before Red Bull brought him into F1.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/18/red-bull-christian-horner-says-f1-need-competitive-racing\">Red Bull\u2019s Christian Horner says F1 is in need of competitive racing</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What followed the highs, however, was a brutal comedown. Since the regulation changes of 2014 that have seen Mercedes dominant, Red Bull have been forced to scrap for every \u2013 rare \u2013 win. In the team\u2019s motorhome at the circuit that bears their name, nestling in the Styrian mountains, Horner admits it has been an emotional trip. \u201cYou win, then you want to defend it, then you want the triple ... it\u2019s almost like a drug,\u201d he says. \u201cWinning is very addictive, that\u2019s why it\u2019s very hard when suddenly \u2013 boom \u2013 you are not the favourites any more.\u201d </p> \n<p>Now 45 years old, Horner called it a day on racing when he was 25 to switch his energies to running his Arden team in F3000.</p> \n<p>When Red Bull\u2019s owner, Dietrich Mateschitz, bought Jaguar to enter F1 in 2005, he took on Horner. At 31 he was the sport\u2019s youngest team principal and with grand ambition (and Mateschitz\u2019s largesse), promptly poached the designer Adrian Newey from McLaren. By 2010 they had forged Red Bull into a formidable force. \u201cI am great believer that, if you put your mind to anything, you can achieve anything,\u201d he says. \u201cI did a deal with my parents to take a year out before university at the end of 1992 to try and forge a career in motor sport. I still haven\u2019t gone. I left school at 18 and that was it.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe driving, by the time I went to Red Bull, seemed an awfully long time behind me, then it was all about trying to build. I wanted to succeed, I wanted to get the team into a winning position. Dietrich showed great faith in a 31-year-old to give me the opportunity to come here and get on with it.\u201d</p> \n<p>His team go into this weekend\u2019s race at the Red Bull Ring with Max Verstappen having taken the win for them here last year.

      "bodyText": "Simple, straight answers are often rare in Formula One, so the honest and the heartfelt stand out immediately. As the Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, considers another home grand prix in Austria where his drivers will again face a possible bludgeoning from Mercedes, his passion for the sport is unmistakable. The desire to win remains a driving force, as is his emotional attachment to F1, which Horner believes now more than ever desperately needs to make a success of its reinvention in 2021. He has ridden the rollercoaster with Red Bull since 2005, when they entered the sport. He built the team into the all-conquering force that took four drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 championship doubles with Sebastian Vettel between 2010 and 2013. It was some journey for the man who had persuaded his parents that he should put off going to university to pursue a career in racing, then switched to running his own team before Red Bull brought him into F1. What followed the highs, however, was a brutal comedown. Since the regulation changes of 2014 that have seen Mercedes dominant, Red Bull have been forced to scrap for every \u2013 rare \u2013 win. In the team\u2019s motorhome at the circuit that bears their name, nestling in the Styrian mountains, Horner admits it has been an emotional trip. \u201cYou win, then you want to defend it, then you want the triple ... it\u2019s almost like a drug,\u201d he says. \u201cWinning is very addictive, that\u2019s why it\u2019s very hard when suddenly \u2013 boom \u2013 you are not the favourites any more.\u201d Now 45 years old, Horner called it a day on racing when he was 25 to switch his energies to running his Arden team in F3000. When Red Bull\u2019s owner, Dietrich Mateschitz, bought Jaguar to enter F1 in 2005, he took on Horner. At 31 he was the sport\u2019s youngest team principal and with grand ambition (and Mateschitz\u2019s largesse), promptly poached the designer Adrian Newey from McLaren. By 2010 they had forged Red Bull into a formidable force. \u201cI am great believer that, if you put your mind to anything, you can achieve anything,\u201d he says. \u201cI did a deal with my parents to take a year out before university at the end of 1992 to try and forge a career in motor sport. I still haven\u2019t gone. I left school at 18 and that was it. \u201cThe driving, by the time I went to Red Bull, seemed an awfully long time behind me, then it was all about trying to build. I wanted to succeed, I wanted to get the team into a winning position. Dietrich showed great faith in a 31-year-old to give me the opportunity to come here and get on with it.\u201d His team go into this weekend\u2019s race at the Red Bull Ring with Max Verstappen having taken the win for them here last year. It was, however, against the odds. Both Mercedes went out with mechanical failures and the victory perhaps typifies Red Bull\u2019s place since 2014. They have had to scrap hard for just 12 wins, out-powered by Mercedes and in the last two seasons by Ferrari as well. This year\u2019s switch to Honda engines has worked well but they remain in third place. \u201cEach win has been hard-fought for or opportunistic. We have had to think on our feet and work smartly and adaptably as a team,\u201d says Horner. They did well to take second place in the 2014 and 2016 constructors\u2019 championships but have not been in a title fight for five years. Horner and Red Bull have repeatedly raised the issues of the lack of competition at the front of the grid, as would be expected from a team no longer occupying that slot. Indeed Mateschitz has threatened to leave the sport. There is no sense now that he will do so but Horner is unequivocal that the 2021 regulations they are currently negotiating must work, not least after the uninspiring fare on offer at the French Grand Prix. \u201cThe product is fundamentally wrong and it\u2019s the product that needs addressing,\u201d he says. \u201cThe FIA and Formula One Management need to take a firm view. The classic indictment is the quality of the last race in France, one of the most boring I can remember being involved in.\u201d He represents Red Bull, of course, but agrees with Lewis Hamilton\u2019s opinion that the teams need to be removed from the decision-making process. \u201cThere is too much vested interest and not enough thinking about what is good for F1,\u201d he says. Hamilton attended the regulations meeting of the FIA, teams and FOM two weeks ago and was not impressed. \u201cI think he could see some of the frustrations,\u201d says Horner. \u201cI was actually quite aligned with some of his thinking and he was aligned with some of mine. The problem is nobody is thinking about the sport. They are all thinking about their own teams and interests.\u201d Horner does not believe in dwelling on the past but, as F1 wrestles with its future, he believes there are lessons to be learned from his early days. \u201cWhen I started there was Frank Williams, Flavio Briatore, Ron Dennis, Eddie Jordan and Peter Sauber round the table.

Now I say what I believe is right for the sport, which unfortunately people sometimes think is self interest. But what I remember about Ron, Flavio and Frank was that they would think about what was right for F1 even if it would hurt their own team, and sometimes we lack that.\u201d There is no doubt self-interest in Red Bull\u2019s position but also an earnestness in Horner\u2019s words that is hard to ignore.

The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.<br></p>\n    <p>At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran\u2019s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/16/sanctions-against-iran-to-be-lifted-after-compliance-with-nuclear-deal\">lifted in January 2016</a>, reconnecting Iran to global markets.</p>\n    <p>The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran\">Iran</a>&nbsp;were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council\u2019s five permanent members \u2013 China, France, Russia, the UK and the US \u2013 and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.</p>\n    <p>On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/saeedkamalidehghan\">Saeed Kamali Dehghan</a>,</b>&nbsp;<i>Iran correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Such a collapse would probably lead the EU to join the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/23/iran-may-pull-further-away-from-nuclear-deal-after-latest-sanctions\">US in imposing sanctions</a>, which might bring a military response by Iran as it tries to find levers to force the west to loosen the vice on its economy.</p> \n<p>At the talks, the three European powers \u2013 France, Germany and the UK \u2013 tried to assuage Iranian doubts that Europe was sticking to its side of the 2015 bargain by pressing ahead with the long-planned mechanism to facilitate trade between Iran and Europe without being hit by US sanctions.</p> \n<p>The lead EU negotiator, Helga Schmid, hailed the discussions as constructive and said the first transactions had been completed through the mechanism, known as Instex.</p> \n<p>The EU was also due to supply a modest \u20ac3m (\u00a32.7m) credit line to kickstart the mechanism as a signal of good intent.</p> \n<p>However, Araghchi said: \u201cFor Instex to be useful for Iran, Europeans need to buy oil or consider credit lines for this mechanism, otherwise Instex is not like they or us expect.\u201d</p> \n<p>The EU has always said Instex will be confined to easing trade in humanitarian goods, such as food and medicine \u2013 a form of trading the White House says is not subject to its sanctions regime. </p> \n<p>Iran had billed the Vienna meeting as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/27/iran-holds-back-threat-breach-nuclear-deal\">the last chance</a> to salvage the deal.</p> \n<p>The Chinese envoy, Fu Cong, said Beijing rejected the US policy of unilateral sanctions, suggesting China may be willing to defy the US threat.</p> \n<p>But the US special representative on Iran, Brian Hook, insisted the US would put sanctions on all Iranian oil exports. \u201cWe will sanction any illicit purchases of Iranian crude oil. There are right now no oil waivers in place,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Hook said the US economic grip on Iran was intended to force Tehran to renegotiate the original nuclear deal, turning it into a binding international treaty that also covers wider issues including Iran\u2019s ballistic missile programme, its regional interference and its treatment of dual national prisoners.</p> \n<p>He also promised the US would go ahead with plans to impose sanctions on Iran\u2019s chief diplomat, Javad Zarif. He said Iran\u2019s goal was to bring the Middle East under the thrall of Tehran\u2019s \u201cMarxist theocratic\u201d ideology.</p> \n<p>Hook was in London to urge the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a UN body, to back his plan for a UN-endorsed maritime protection force, modelled on an established UN anti-piracy force off the coast of Somalia.</p> \n<p>He said Iran, by its threats to Gulf shipping, was \u201ccourting a financial and environment disaster\u201d, and was breaching all maritime rules by turning off its ship collision avoidance transponders in an attempt to smuggle oil out of Iran and avoid being tracked by the US.</p> \n<p>\u201cAn outlaw regime is violating basic maritime law and now represents a maritime threat across the Gulf,\u201d Hook said after meeting the IMO secretary general, Kitack Lim.</p> \n<p>Hook went further than before by accusing Iran of planning to gain a stranglehold on all international oil-related shipping by controlling not just the Gulf of Oman, off the Iranian coast, but also the Red Sea shipping lanes through the Bab al-Mandab strait off Yemen that take oil into the Arabian Sea and on to Asia.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0d8c00ad-e450-457b-88eb-86a5f699455a\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The strait of Hormuz, which provides passage from the Gulf of Oman to the open sea, is the most important gateway for oil exports in the world. With Iran on its northern shore, and the UAE and Oman on its southern shore, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) calls it the world\u2019s worst 'chokepoint'</p>\n    <p>In 2016, 18.5m barrels of crude oil were transported each day through the strait of Hormuz, compared with 16m through the strait of Malacca, which runs between the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Malaysia and Thailand, connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. 5m barrels of crude oil are transported annually through the next largest chokepoint, the Suez canal.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/phillipinman\"><b>Phillip Inman</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>His claim shows the extent to which the US regards defeat of the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen as integral to the wider defeat of Iran. </p> \n<p>\u201cIf we do not prevent Iranians from laying down deep roots in Yemen, they will be in a position to threaten to close the strait of Hormuz and Bab al-Mandab,\u201d Hook said. </p> \n<p>\u201cThey are seeking to do in Yemen what they succeeded to do in Lebanon. They would like to \u2018Lebanonise\u2019 Yemen and become a power broker on the Saudi southern border and to be in a position to harass the Emiratis and Saudis, and to be another threat in their threat matrix to freedom of navigation. We are pushing back on Iran\u2019s long game in Yemen.\u201d</p> \n<p>The sanctions, hailed by Hook as unprecedented, have so far cut Iranian oil exports to 400,000 barrels a day, levels that have put the Iranian government deep into debt.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a clerical regime that wants to remake the Middle East in its image \u2013 and that would deeply destabilise the Middle East to have regimes following the same Marxist theocratic regime,\u201d Hook said.</p> \n<p>Describing the state of tension in the region, he said Iran\u2019s goal \u201cis to scare the global oil market to keep the price up and to keep the world on edge\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Iran said some progress had been made at a meeting with world powers on its nuclear accord \u2013 but probably \u201cstill not enough\u201d to keep the landmark 2015 deal alive. \u201cIt was a step forward, but it is still not enough and not meeting Iran\u2019s expectations,\u201d said Iran\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, after the talks on Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t think the progress made today will be enough to stop our process \u2013 but the decision will be made in Tehran.\u201d Tehran has threatened to withdraw from key commitments in the deal, probably on 7 July, a move that might force European powers to reluctantly join the US and quit the deal signed in 2015. Araghchi said: \u201cThe decision to reduce our commitments has already been made in Iran and we continue on that process unless our expectations are met.\u201d But he also said a ministerial-level meeting would be held soon, probably giving Europe a further chance to save the deal from imminent collapse. Such a collapse would probably lead the EU to join the US in imposing sanctions, which might bring a military response by Iran as it tries to find levers to force the west to loosen the vice on its economy. At the talks, the three European powers \u2013 France, Germany and the UK \u2013 tried to assuage Iranian doubts that Europe was sticking to its side of the 2015 bargain by pressing ahead with the long-planned mechanism to facilitate trade between Iran and Europe without being hit by US sanctions. The lead EU negotiator, Helga Schmid, hailed the discussions as constructive and said the first transactions had been completed through the mechanism, known as Instex. The EU was also due to supply a modest \u20ac3m (\u00a32.7m) credit line to kickstart the mechanism as a signal of good intent. However, Araghchi said: \u201cFor Instex to be useful for Iran, Europeans need to buy oil or consider credit lines for this mechanism, otherwise Instex is not like they or us expect.\u201d The EU has always said Instex will be confined to easing trade in humanitarian goods, such as food and medicine \u2013 a form of trading the White House says is not subject to its sanctions regime. Iran had billed the Vienna meeting as the last chance to salvage the deal. The Chinese envoy, Fu Cong, said Beijing rejected the US policy of unilateral sanctions, suggesting China may be willing to defy the US threat. But the US special representative on Iran, Brian Hook, insisted the US would put sanctions on all Iranian oil exports. \u201cWe will sanction any illicit purchases of Iranian crude oil. There are right now no oil waivers in place,\u201d he said. Hook said the US economic grip on Iran was intended to force Tehran to renegotiate the original nuclear deal, turning it into a binding international treaty that also covers wider issues including Iran\u2019s ballistic missile programme, its regional interference and its treatment of dual national prisoners. He also promised the US would go ahead with plans to impose sanctions on Iran\u2019s chief diplomat, Javad Zarif. He said Iran\u2019s goal was to bring the Middle East under the thrall of Tehran\u2019s \u201cMarxist theocratic\u201d ideology. Hook was in London to urge the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a UN body, to back his plan for a UN-endorsed maritime protection force, modelled on an established UN anti-piracy force off the coast of Somalia. He said Iran, by its threats to Gulf shipping, was \u201ccourting a financial and environment disaster\u201d, and was breaching all maritime rules by turning off its ship collision avoidance transponders in an attempt to smuggle oil out of Iran and avoid being tracked by the US. \u201cAn outlaw regime is violating basic maritime law and now represents a maritime threat across the Gulf,\u201d Hook said after meeting the IMO secretary general, Kitack Lim. Hook went further than before by accusing Iran of planning to gain a stranglehold on all international oil-related shipping by controlling not just the Gulf of Oman, off the Iranian coast, but also the Red Sea shipping lanes through the Bab al-Mandab strait off Yemen that take oil into the Arabian Sea and on to Asia. His claim shows the extent to which the US regards defeat of the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen as integral to the wider defeat of Iran. \u201cIf we do not prevent Iranians from laying down deep roots in Yemen, they will be in a position to threaten to close the strait of Hormuz and Bab al-Mandab,\u201d Hook said. \u201cThey are seeking to do in Yemen what they succeeded to do in Lebanon. They would like to \u2018Lebanonise\u2019 Yemen and become a power broker on the Saudi southern border and to be in a position to harass the Emiratis and Saudis, and to be another threat in their threat matrix to freedom of navigation. We are pushing back on Iran\u2019s long game in Yemen.\u201d The sanctions, hailed by Hook as unprecedented, have so far cut Iranian oil exports to 400,000 barrels a day, levels that have put the Iranian government deep into debt. \u201cThis is a clerical regime that wants to remake the Middle East in its image \u2013 and that would deeply destabilise the Middle East to have regimes following the same Marxist theocratic regime,\u201d Hook said. Describing the state of tension in the region, he said Iran\u2019s goal \u201cis to scare the global oil market to keep the price up and to keep the world on edge\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Vladimir Putin is on a high. Kicked out of the G8 in 2014 after the start of his military operations in Ukraine, he\u2019s been making full use of the G20 summit in Osaka to bask in meetings with world grandees and soak up all the international media attention he possibly can, complete with a not very challenging interview with the Financial Times. Ever the opportunist, he takes what\u2019s on offer, he glides, he smirks. And he watches with glee as we huff and puff at his provocations, whose over-riding purpose is to keep us on edge and play on our divisions. This is now international showtime for Putin. After all, few people outside Russia paid much attention to his four-hour annual Direct Line TV show last week. I did watch part of it though, and what struck me was that Putin is getting older, and that he\u2019s deploying particularly intensive PR work to try to neutralise a flurry of domestic tensions. Russian friends tell me the country \u201cfeels like 2010, when things were starting to bubble up\u201d, ahead of the street protests that broke out during the following two years. Russia\u2019s economy isn\u2019t doing brilliantly. Putin\u2019s decision to have the investigative journalist Ivan Golunov released and the handing over of the initiative to local protesters in Ekaterinburg in a recent dispute over the building of a cathedral were unexpected developments. OK, this wasn\u2019t the end of political repression, but these were gestures that seemed an attempt to signal a softer touch \u2013 if only for now. As Fiona Hill, one of the best Russia analysts around and now a departing Trump adviser, wrote in her 2012 book, Mr Putin, Operative in the Kremlin: \u201cUncovering the \u2018real Putins\u2019 requires looking beyond the staged performances and the deliberately assumed guises that constitute the Putin political brand.\u201d File the comment to the FT about liberalism being \u201cobsolete\u201d in that category. A few years ago, take note, he was saying the exact opposite, telling us: \u201cI\u2019m a liberal.\u201d Words tossed out like this have little meaning. They\u2019re like small grenades or stink bombs aimed at deepening our self-doubt, despondency and fractiousness. To fathom this, read Peter Pomerantsev\u2019s book, Nothing is True and Everything is Possible, a memoir from inside Russia\u2019s state propaganda machine. Putin will love western far-left and far-right criticisms of \u201cliberalism\u201d, just as he enjoys whatever anger can be fired up among eastern European politicians who are understandably worried about his next territorial encroachment.

In a consistently good cast, Peter Hoare\u2019s sad Schoolmaster, Jan Martin\u00edk\u2019s dour Parson and M\u00fcller-Brachmann, gritty sounding and fierce, stand out. The choral contributions \u2013 from the London Symphony Chorus and the children of the LSO Discovery Voices \u2013 are extremely fine. The work itself, meanwhile, has long been among Rattle\u2019s personal favourites. \u201cIt\u2019s the piece that made me want to become an opera conductor,\u201d he writes in the programme, and he conducts it with great affection, keenly alert both to its drama and the astonishing beauty of its evocation of the natural world. The playing is outstanding. \u2022 Repeated at the Barbican, London, on 29 June.",

      "body": "<p> The \u201cwicked stepmother\u201d may have its roots in Norse mythology and Grimms\u2019 fairy tales, but the stereotype was still much in force in<strong> </strong>1975, when Brenda Maddox, who has died aged 87, wrote The Half Parent: Living with Other People\u2019s Children. The semi-autobiographical book began with an account of her meeting, in her late 20s, her future husband John Maddox\u2019s children, a \u201cboy of eight and girl of five, whose lives I was going to put right\u201d.</p> <p>It was a chilly summer night. John and the children\u2019s mother had been separated for some time. Six weeks earlier,<strong> </strong>the mother<strong> </strong>had taken her own life. Green lichen grew on the outside of the house; inside, mildew was coming through the walls. Their mother\u2019s decline had forced the children (Piers and Joanna, now known as Imma) to become precociously self-reliant. Exiled to the top floor of their home, they fought much of the time, ate nothing but sweets and baked beans \u201ccooked\u201d on a toy electric stove, wore what they chose and stayed outside as late as they wanted. For much of the decade that followed, during which Brenda married their father and went on to have three more children of her own, the two stepchildren tussled with her even as they wanted a sense of order in their lives, a mother figure who went to their school plays and sat in the front row. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have had a harder job,\u201d commented one psychiatrist whom she interviewed for the book.</p> <p>At that time, books about blended families were still unusual in Britain, and The Half Parent would be passed by hand from family to family as they negotiated the grating reality of trying to create domestic bliss. Published when Brenda was 43, it was the spur she needed to give up her job as home affairs editor of the Economist and become a full-time author. And it gave her the confidence to go ahead with her next project, the life of Nora Barnacle, James Joyce\u2019s wife and muse and the inspiration for the character Molly Bloom in Ulysses, even when much of the Joycean literary establishment advised her not to.</p> <p>Joyce\u2019s quasi-official biographer, Richard Ellmann, wrote to her saying how much he disliked \u201cbook-length studies of people who are clearly not of great importance themselves\u201d. He took pains to point out that Barnacle\u2019s meagre correspondence and literary output would make it \u201cpossible neither to give a full character portrayal, nor to evolve a feminist tract\u201d about her.</p> <p>Brenda persisted and proved him wrong. In the libraries of Dublin and Trieste she found a wealth of correspondence. The famous \u201cdirty letters\u201d between Joyce and his muse helped make Nora: The Real Life of Molly Bloom a bestseller. It won the Los Angeles Times award for biography in 1988, and was translated into eight languages. In 2002 it was <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158033/\" title=\"\">made into a film </a>starring Ewan McGregor and Susan Lynch. Brenda had Ellmann\u2019s letter framed and hung it in her lavatory.</p> <p>Meticulous research, married to a highly readable writing style and a sharp eye for the telling anecdote or detail, won Brenda a number of further biographical commissions, including DH Lawrence: The Story of a Marriage (1994), Yeats\u2019s Ghosts: The Secret Life of WB Yeats (1999), Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA (2002) and Maggie: The Personal Story of a Public Life (2003), a tie-in to a four-part television documentary, Maggie: The First Lady, broadcast on ITV, that Brenda always said she wrote \u201cfor the money\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShe wrote effortlessly,\u201d said her son Bruno, to whom Nora is dedicated. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a morning when I didn\u2019t wake up to the sound of her clacking away on her typewriter. But there was always something defensive about the way she threw herself into words.\u201d</p> <p>Born Brenda Murphy into a largely Italian-American family in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, her father, Brendan, a doctor, died when she was three. Her mother, Edith (nee Giamperoli), who had had meningitic polio, used a wheelchair, but still managed to support the family through giving square-dancing lessons.</p> <p>Brenda attended Bridgewater high school. Her flair for writing then won her a scholarship to Radcliffe College, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her local priest advised her to turn down the offer, for fear that the cerebral temptations of the Ivy League might lead her to turn her back on Catholicism. \u201cAnd that,\u201d Bruno remembers her saying, is \u201cexactly what happened\u201d.</p> <p>Jobs were scarce when Brenda graduated in 1955. She first found work at a greeting card company. Her repeated attempts to get into journalism eventually found her a job as science correspondent for the Quincy Patriot Ledger on Boston\u2019s South Shore. In the summer of 1958, at a UN-sponsored \u201catoms for peace\u201d talk in Geneva, she would later write, she \u201cfelt someone looking at me across the room\u201d. </p> <p>The eyes belonged to John Maddox, then science correspondent of the Guardian, later editor of Nature. They married in 1960 and settled in Roehampton, south-west London. Brenda worked from home for the Economist while raising four children (a son died in infancy).

I\u2019m naturally concerned by the lack of due process and consistency in how my case is being handled. I\u2019ve been a loyal Labour member for 43 years, and will do my utmost to fight for my membership.\u201d</p> \n<p>More than 120 Labour MPs and peers led by the deputy leader, Tom Watson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/27/chris-williamson-labour-mp-suspension-lifted-antisemitism-anger-jewish-members\">demanded on Thursday that Williamson be ejected</a> for suggesting the party was \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d about antisemitism. It also followed the submission of a separate letter signed by nearly 70 Labour staff members expressing their anger at the readmission.</p> \n<p>On Friday, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, added his voice to the call for action, saying he was \u201cdeeply concerned about the decision to readmit Chris Williamson to the Labour party\u201d.</p> \n<p>Starmer tweeted: \u201cI do not understand the rationale behind the decision. The NEC should overrule it and refer it to the NCC. The EHRC [Equality and Human Rights Commission] should also be invited to look at the specifics of this case.\u201d</p> \n<p>The motion, signed by MPs including Yvette Cooper, Margaret Hodge, Wes Streeting, David Lammy and Diana Johnson, calls for Williamson to have the whip withdrawn for 12 months under the standing orders of the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) and for the case to be referred to the party\u2019s parliamentary committee when it meets Corbyn next week. If approved, the case would go to a vote of the full PLP at Westminster the following week.</p> \n<p>The motion states: \u201cDue to the exceptional circumstances in this case we are of the view that the allegation of bringing the Labour party into disrepute made against Chris Williamson warrants an investigation by the parliamentary committee under this standing order and full consideration given to a recommendation of removal of the whip to the PLP. We therefore seek to ask the PLP to take action to suspend the whip from Chris Williamson for a period of a year.\u201d</p> \n<p>Williamson did receive backing on Friday night from the Jewish Voice for Labour group. In a statement it said: \u201cThe fairness of the [disciplinary] process is undermined by hostile, personal campaigns such as that being waged against Chris, who is a hard-working and diligent MP with great standing in his constituency and a strong record of anti-racist campaigning.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/28/labour-corbyn-williamson-antisemitism\">Of all the hills to die on, why on earth has Labour chosen Chris Williamson? | Marina Hyde</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/27/labour-suspends-chris-williamson-over-antisemitism-remarks\">Williamson was suspended by the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/27/labour-suspends-chris-williamson-over-antisemitism-remarks\">PLP</a> after footage first revealed by the Yorkshire Post showed him being cheered by activists in Sheffield as he said of accusations of antisemitism within Labour: \u201cI\u2019ve got to say, I think our party\u2019s response has been partly responsible \u2026 Because, in my opinion, we\u2019ve backed off far too much, we\u2019ve given too much ground, we\u2019ve been too apologetic.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c847f49b-f719-4762-967f-babbbef18ddd\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eTeBxc-ysX8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The MP, who is a close ally of the Labour leader, later issued an apology saying he regretted his choice of words and had been \u201ctrying to stress how much the party has done to tackle antisemitism\u201d.</p> \n<p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/chris-williamson-back-in-labour-party-after-antisemitism-remarks\">the suspension was lifted</a>, Williamson tweeted that he had received an \u201cavalanche of goodwill messages\u201d.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Friday, Jon Lansman, the founder of the grassroots Corbyn-backing Momentum group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/28/jeremy-corbyn-told-chris-williamson-must-go-by-momentum-founder\">said Williamson \u201chas to go\u201d</a>.

      "bodyText": "Chris Williamson has had his suspension as a Labour MP reimposed two days after it was lifted, following a wave of anger within the party at the handling of the investigation into his comments about antisemitism. The backlash against Jeremy Corbyn and other senior Labour figures led to more than 60 Labour MPs signing a motion formally beginning moves to have Williamson again suspended from the parliamentary party. The Derby North MP had the Labour whip restored after a national executive panel comprising MPs Keith Vaz and George Howarth and constituency representative Huda Elmi, ruled he should receive only a reprimand for suggesting the party was \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d about antisemitism. However, Vaz subsequently said he had been drafted on to the panel at the last minute and felt the decision should be reconsidered. A Labour source said that, following Vaz\u2019s comments, the Labour general secretary, Jennie Formby, had written to the party\u2019s national executive to say Williamson\u2019s case would be on the agenda for the next meeting of its disputes committee. The source added: \u201cSubsequently, the whip is not restored, as the decision is still pending.\u201d They stressed that Corbyn himself could not get involved in the process. On Friday night after the news emerged, Williamson tweeted: \u201cThey say a week is a long time in politics: it seems two days is even longer. I\u2019m naturally concerned by the lack of due process and consistency in how my case is being handled. I\u2019ve been a loyal Labour member for 43 years, and will do my utmost to fight for my membership.\u201d More than 120 Labour MPs and peers led by the deputy leader, Tom Watson, demanded on Thursday that Williamson be ejected for suggesting the party was \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d about antisemitism. It also followed the submission of a separate letter signed by nearly 70 Labour staff members expressing their anger at the readmission. On Friday, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, added his voice to the call for action, saying he was \u201cdeeply concerned about the decision to readmit Chris Williamson to the Labour party\u201d. Starmer tweeted: \u201cI do not understand the rationale behind the decision. The NEC should overrule it and refer it to the NCC. The EHRC [Equality and Human Rights Commission] should also be invited to look at the specifics of this case.\u201d The motion, signed by MPs including Yvette Cooper, Margaret Hodge, Wes Streeting, David Lammy and Diana Johnson, calls for Williamson to have the whip withdrawn for 12 months under the standing orders of the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) and for the case to be referred to the party\u2019s parliamentary committee when it meets Corbyn next week. If approved, the case would go to a vote of the full PLP at Westminster the following week. The motion states: \u201cDue to the exceptional circumstances in this case we are of the view that the allegation of bringing the Labour party into disrepute made against Chris Williamson warrants an investigation by the parliamentary committee under this standing order and full consideration given to a recommendation of removal of the whip to the PLP. We therefore seek to ask the PLP to take action to suspend the whip from Chris Williamson for a period of a year.\u201d Williamson did receive backing on Friday night from the Jewish Voice for Labour group. In a statement it said: \u201cThe fairness of the [disciplinary] process is undermined by hostile, personal campaigns such as that being waged against Chris, who is a hard-working and diligent MP with great standing in his constituency and a strong record of anti-racist campaigning.\u201d Williamson was suspended by the PLP after footage first revealed by the Yorkshire Post showed him being cheered by activists in Sheffield as he said of accusations of antisemitism within Labour: \u201cI\u2019ve got to say, I think our party\u2019s response has been partly responsible \u2026 Because, in my opinion, we\u2019ve backed off far too much, we\u2019ve given too much ground, we\u2019ve been too apologetic.\u201d The MP, who is a close ally of the Labour leader, later issued an apology saying he regretted his choice of words and had been \u201ctrying to stress how much the party has done to tackle antisemitism\u201d. After the suspension was lifted, Williamson tweeted that he had received an \u201cavalanche of goodwill messages\u201d. Earlier on Friday, Jon Lansman, the founder of the grassroots Corbyn-backing Momentum group said Williamson \u201chas to go\u201d. Referring to Williamson\u2019s response to the lifted suspension, Lansman tweeted: \u201cThis tweet reveals not one iota of contrition nor any acknowledgement of wrongdoing following a further formal warning from the Labour party for behaviour grossly detrimental to the party. Such contempt for the party\u2019s verdict! He has to go!\u201d",

So what can we expect from a Johnson premiership, based on his claimed past record and promises on the campaign trail?</p> <h2>Success as foreign secretary</h2> <p><strong>What he has claimed</strong>: When Johnson has talked about his time in the Foreign Office, he has mainly pointed to the UK\u2019s success in persuading other nations to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/26/four-eu-states-set-to-expel-russian-diplomats-over-skripal-attack\">expel Russian diplomats</a> following the Sergei Skripal poisoning.</p> <p><strong>The reality</strong>: The Skripal aftermath is hard to assess \u2013 such efforts are international, and span dozens of officials and ministers \u2013 but critics would point to Johnson\u2019s otherwise very mixed record in the job, notably his gaffes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jun/19/zaghari-ratcliffe-husband-says-boris-johnson-made-mistakes\">over Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe</a>.</p> <h2>Crime</h2> <p><strong>What he has claimed</strong>: Johnson has mainly talked up his eight years as London mayor, from 2008, saying he halved the city\u2019s murder rate and reduced knife crime.</p> <p><strong>The reality</strong>: Much more mixed. London had 155 murders in 2008 and 109 in 2016. Even at the lowest level, of 94 in 2016, this is a 40% reduction. The number for total knife crimes in the city varied, but was almost the same when he left office as in 2008.</p> <h2>Poverty</h2> <p><strong>What he has claimed</strong>: Johnson has said, several times, that he tackled poverty as mayor, such that while in 2008 the city had four of the six poorest boroughs in the UK, after his two terms, no London boroughs were in the top 20.</p> <p><strong>The reality</strong>: Hard to tell, as it is not clear what measure of \u201cpoverty\u201d is being described. The most common on a borough-wide level is known as index of multiple deprivation, but these are just for England, and the results do not match the claims. London did become wealthier overall during Johnson\u2019s time in charge, but inequalities also increased.</p> <h2>Olympics</h2> <p><strong>What he has claimed</strong>: He has repeatedly called the 2012 Olympics in London \u201ca huge success\u201d, implicitly claiming credit.</p> <p><strong>The reality</strong>: The Games were seen as going well \u2013 but much of the planning was already in place before Johnson took over. In contrast, the aftermath has been more mixed, notably the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/01/sadiq-khan-west-ham-london-stadium\">\u00a3300m or so</a> of costs to convert the main stadium for use by West Ham United.</p> <h2>Garden bridge</h2> <p><strong>What he has claimed</strong>: Johnson has argued the abandoned plan for a park-meets-bridge across the Thames would have been a triumph had his successor as mayor, Sadiq Khan, not pulled the plug on the project.</p> <p><strong>The reality</strong>: The business and transport cases for the bridge were always hugely weak, and the project only lasted as long as it did because of Johnson\u2019s patronage. Johnson also has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/19/boris-johnson-under-growing-pressure-over-scrapped-garden-bridge\">yet to answer</a> questions over decisions he made allowing the charity behind the project to spend huge amounts of public money before planning consents were completed, which resulted in losses rising above \u00a340m.</p> <h2>Brexit</h2> <p><strong>What he has promised</strong>: To swiftly negotiate a new withdrawal agreement with the EU, at the same time ramping up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/14/uk-businesses-urged-to-step-up-preparations-for-no-deal-brexit\">no-deal preparations</a> to ensure departure on 31 October.</p> <p><strong>Does it stack up</strong>: The EU has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/11/no-renegotiation-withdrawal-agreement-french-minister\">repeatedly insisted</a> it will not reopen the withdrawal agreement, and even if it did, the timetable is hideously tight.

It was a good game. We did ourselves justice, the talent we have in the dressing room. Set up by a good bowling performance. I thought we didn\u2019t start well. The nature of the wicket told me that it had to be straight lines you had to bowl. It looked like a wicket where if you have a consistent top of the stumps line and length it would be difficult, and that turned out to be true.</p> <p>It feels bittersweet.

A week ago, this looked like a stinker between two sides with no chance. But then the butterly flapped it wings: Sri Lanka beat England and the race for the top four was turned on its head. In turn, the destiny of Dimuth Karunaratne\u2019s charges remains in their hands. </p> <p>By contrast, their opponents today, South Africa, were the second team formally punted from the tournament when they were thrashed by Pakistan on Sunday at Lord\u2019s. The final margin didn\u2019t do justice to just how abject they were with the bat in pursuit of 285, never even remotely in the hunt. It summed up the Proteas\u2019 limp month in the country, putting in one underwhelming effort after another. </p> <p>Yes, Faf du Plessis\u2019 team whitewashed Sri Lanka in this format earlier this year, and sure, they have knocked them off in 16 of their last 18 ODIs. But that doesn\u2019t mean an awful lot to them now as they enter this slow, post-elimination goodbye.</p> <p>The degree of difficulty for Sri Lanka remains, needing to win all three of their games, but it is not quite as steep as it is being suggested when comparing that position to the other sides in the pelaton, Pakistan and Bangladesh. If they get up today, their next must-win game is against another side who won\u2019t be progressing: West Indies. Then comes India to finish, but one step at a time. </p> <p>In terms of the venue, this time last year England chased down Australia\u2019s 314 in just 44 overs. We haven\u2019t seen many games like that in this comp, but we\u2019re right to assume they will be friendly batting conditions first up. And it should be a sunny day, the temperature expected to top 20 degrees in county Durham. </p> <p>So what will it be? Some more Malinga magic to keep this chasing group at seven? Or will South Africa play for (I promise this the only time I\u2019ll say...) pride? I\u2019m looking forward to finding out with you throughout the morning. Stay in touch in the usual OBO ways, dropping me a line or firing off a punchy tweet. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-28T08:40:10.741Z\">at 9.40am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "And with that, I\u2019m done. Finally South Africa have found the silver lining to their cloud. Bye! A little weekend reading for you: Faf du Plessis is quietly pleased. Long time coming. It was a good game. We did ourselves justice, the talent we have in the dressing room. Set up by a good bowling performance. I thought we didn\u2019t start well. The nature of the wicket told me that it had to be straight lines you had to bowl. It looked like a wicket where if you have a consistent top of the stumps line and length it would be difficult, and that turned out to be true. It feels bittersweet. It doesn\u2019t feel like it means that much, because you feel it\u2019s a little bit too late. But the basics of batting we showed really well today. One big partnership and then everything feels so much easier. All of a sudden almost every over you can put the bowler under pressure. We haven\u2019t done that consistently in the tournament. Dimuth Karunaratne says Sri Lanka\u2019s inability to rotate the strike and milk the singles is what decided the match against them. \u201cWe have to win our two matches, compete really good,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to work hard at the batting, bowling and every department and do well in those matches.\u201d Here\u2019s the latest table. Sri Lanka are down but not out, though they now have to beat both West Indies and India. Jonathan Edwards hands Dwaine Pretorius the man of the match trophy. \u201cThe guys are absolutely stoked,\u201d he says. \u201cThe guys showed today what we\u2019re all about as a unit. I\u2019m just a bit sad that it only came now.\u201d \u201cNever mind the pundits and the wickets,\u201d wails Brian Withington, \u201cwhy oh why are teams reserving their best performances for when they play England?\u201d I think it is a long-acknowledged phenomenon that teams raise their game against the best in the world. Thus the fact that England have lost a couple, while Australia, New Zealand and India have only lost two between them, proves that England are indeed the best team. We should probably just stop the tournament now and hand Eoin Morgan the trophy. 37.2 overs: South Africa 206-1 (Amla 79, Du Plessis 96) Thisara Perera\u2019s second delivery goes down the leg side and away for four, and that\u2019s it! The umpire says Du Plessis got something on it, so he finished four short of his hundred. 37th over: South Africa 201-1 (Amla 79, Du Plessis 92) Amla cuts the first past backward point. I thought he might run a single and allow his captain to bring up his ton at his leisure, but instead they come back for a second, and then another two. There will be no century. 36th over: South Africa 196-1 (Amla 74, Du Plessis 92) Malinga completes his allocation, still trying his yorkers. Du Plessis is on the receiving end of one, and manages to push it down the ground for four. That leaves him eight from his century, conveniently with eight needed for victory. He tries to smear the next through the covers but picks out a fielder. 35th over: South Africa 191-1 (Amla 73, Du Plessis 88) Just two runs off the first five balls of Udana\u2019s over, but then Du Plessis hits the last past mid-on for four. 34th over: South Africa 185-1 (Amla 72, Du Plessis 83) Malinga\u2019s penultimate over (though of course it could turn out to be his last), and with one ball remaining he switches to go round the wicket at Du Plessis, who had just speared one past fine leg for four. It\u2019s another single. South Africa need 19 from 96 balls. 33rd over: South Africa 178-1 (Amla 71, Du Plessis 77) A few more singles are milked, before Du Plessis hacks a wide one past backward point for four. Just 26 runs required now, so the match could be finished in the next over. Theoretically. 32nd over: South Africa 169-1 (Amla 69, Du Plessis 70) Thisara Perera\u2019s still going. He seems to have been bowling all afternoon, but in fact it\u2019s only his fifth over. I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s happened. Single, dot, single, dot, single, dot. Some while-we-wait-for-South-Africa-to-dot-the-I\u2019s-and-cross-the-T\u2019s reading: 31st over: South Africa 166-1 (Amla 68, Du Plessis 68) This is definitely not Sri Lanka\u2019s day. I think we can declare that now, whatever the win predictor\u2019s saying. Amla takes one look at the first replay, tucks his bat under his arm, pulls off his gloves and heads for the dressing-room. But it transpires that the ball pitched fractionally outside leg, and he\u2019s beckoned back! Amla is out lbw here! He\u2019s gone upstairs, but only because it might be fun to look at the TV for a bit. He\u2019s surely out... 30th over: South Africa 159-1 (Amla 65, Du Plessis 65) South Africa have retreated into their shell since Faf\u2019s two-ball, 10-run blitz a couple of overs back. Five more singles here, off Thisara Perera. Of course, there\u2019s no need for them to hurry, what with them needing 45 runs from 120 balls. 29th over: South Africa 154-1 (Amla 62, Du Plessis 63) Four more singles, and another wide. Here in Blighty it\u2019s almost 5pm; anyone got any good weekend plans? 28th over: South Africa 149-1 (Amla 60, Du Plessis 61) As of the start of the over, bowled by Lakmal, the required run rate had dipped below three. By its end it was down to 2.5. Du Plessis takes the single he needs to reach 50, and then the next ball he faces is lifted back past the bowler and out the ground! After a lengthy delay while a replacement is located he rockets the next through midwicket for four! Meanwhile Pete Salmon has got the OBO\u2019s proof-readers exercised. \u201cThat was Zeno\u2019s paradox, not Aristotle\u2019s,\u201d sniffs the Guardian\u2019s own Beau Dure. 27th over: South Africa 136-1 (Amla 59, Du Plessis 49) De Silva bowls, and it goed down the leg side, flicks up off Kusal, loops up, is caught by a diving, sprinting slip, which is an awful lot of action for a single wide. That\u2019s the 13th extra of the innings, or 6.4% of South Africa\u2019s target. 26th over: South Africa 131-1 (Amla 58, Du Plessis 47) Malinga\u2019s eighth over is predictably yorker-heavy, and brings a single followed by five dots. \u201cI kind of feel like Avitaj Mitra\u2019s question is as much a philosophical conundrum as it is a mathematical one,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cBut, yeah, right now it almost feels like England will have a 0% chance against India, if that answers the question.\u201d 25th over: South Africa 130-1 (Amla 57, Du Plessis 47) De Silva bowls. Some singles are scored. \u201cGood question from Avitaj Mitra (over 21). Presumably the win predictor is like Aristotle\u2019s paradox that a thing in motion can never arrive at its destination as it always has to travel halfway before it gets there, over and over again,\u201d writes Pete Salmon. \u201cThe win predictor can never reach 0 until a team wins, so no team can ever win because the win predictor is always greater than 0. Just one more way the win predictor has ruined cricket, by establishing the impossibility of victory.\u201d 24th over: South Africa 126-1 (Amla 55, Du Plessis 45) A Malinga maiden. He\u2019s presumably bowling because Sri Lanka need wickets like the proverbial desert needs the rain, but the field isn\u2019t really conducive to the taking of them, with an empty cordon and nobody in aggressive, in-yer-face positions. So it\u2019s all down to Malinga, who attempts another yorker, which Amla digs out well. 23rd over: South Africa 126-1 (Amla 55, Du Plessis 45) Edge! Du Plessis swings his bat and diverts the ball well wide of the solitary slip and away for four. 22nd over: South Africa 119-1 (Amla 53, Du Plessis 40) Malinga\u2019s back, and there\u2019s a lovely yorker, which seemed to also show a bit of late movement, to Amla, which causes the batsman no trouble whatsoever. It did seem a bit on the slow side. He tries again to Du Plessis, who exhibits only slightly more discomfort. 21st over: South Africa 115-1 (Amla 52, Du Plessis 37) \u201cSo, just checked the win predictor. SL have a 1% chance (pretty generous, in my view),\u201d writes Avitaj Mitra. \u201cWhat I want to know is, is there a point within the 50 overs for the chasing team where the predictor shows 0% for either team, objectively speaking. Can you absolutely determine if a team simply has no chance of winning?\u201d I know not, but I suspect they\u2019ve done some rounding up to get all the way to 1% there, particularly given that it was also 1% six overs back. 20th over: South Africa 111-1 (Amla 51, Du Plessis 35) Amla takes his score to 50 with a single. Do we think South Africa are going to make this interesting with a bit of free hitting, or are they happy with the single life? 19th over: South Africa 105-1 (Amla 49, Du Plessis 31) Udana does his first bowling of the day, and singles off the first two balls tickle South Africa\u2019s score into triple figures. There are also singles off the next four, and a bonus wide to boot. This, not unpredictably given the target, is turning into a stroll in the sunshine. 18th over: South Africa 98-1 (Amla 46, Du Plessis 28) Mendis bowls, and he gets a bit of turn and bounce, the ball hitting the shoulder of Amla\u2019s bat and spinning away safely. 17th over: South Africa 94-1 (Amla 44, Du Plessis 26) Freebies! Lakmal bowls down the leg side, and Kusal Perera dives past the ball, which flies between one glove and the other and rumbles away. Then Du Plessis hammers a bumper through midwicket for four and finally he skitters down the pitch but the ball skews off his bat and loops over backward point for a couple. 16th over: South Africa 81-1 (Amla 43, Du Plessis 19) Just a couple of singles. The umpires detect a slight downturn in South Arica\u2019s run-scoring, and call for drinks. 15th over: South Africa 79-1 (Amla 42, Du Plessis 18) The win predictor gives Sri Lanka a 1% chance of glory, and Amla then dents that with a beautifully-timed stroke that sends the ball rolling enthusiastically past point for four. Still, the sun\u2019s shining. 14th over: South Africa 72-1 (Amla 36, Du Plessis 17) Jeevan Mendis now. The required run rate is only just above 3.5, and Sri Lanka need wickets in the plural and at pace (either that or a return of the bees and a succession of retired stungs). Sri Lanka, comparison fans, were 77-3 at this stage of their innings. 13th over: South Africa 69-1 (Amla 35, Du Plessis 16) Du Plessis drives through the covers twice. Happily for Sri Lanka they stuck a sweeper there after the first shot, so one goes for four and the other earns but a single. The captain takes a very sharp single to mid-off off the last ball of the over, and was maybe just about home when the ball whistled past the stumps. 12th over: South Africa 62-1 (Amla 34, Du Plessis 10) Amla lifts the ball down the ground, and stands there admiring it as the ball loops up, lands perhaps 10m from the rope and pretty much stays still. Only then do the batsmen realise they should have been running all along, and they thus score a mere two. 11th over: South Africa 58-1 (Amla 31, Du Plessis 9) Malinga is stood down, with Lakmal returning. \u201cIn the first round of games there were half a dozen times the bails didn\u2019t come off when they probably should but I haven\u2019t seen any incidents since then,\u201d recalls Jim Graham. \u201cDid they change them? The Malinga yorker is the sort of ball that might not have taken a wicket in an early game.\u201d They did talk about changing something about the stump set-up, and may indeed have done so, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a ball hit the stumps as gently as in those incidents in recent days, including that wicket. I do think these are remarkably solid stumps, and it\u2019s probably them rather than the bails that are to blame. It\u2019s remarkable how much effort it takes to take them out of the ground. It seems that you can throw the ball as hard as you like towards the base of the stumps and they\u2019ll go absolutely nowhere. 10th over: South Africa 53-1 (Amla 26, Du Plessis 9) Perera bowls short and wide, and Amla dismisses it for four. Then, a single and a dot later, Du Plessis comes forward and spears just wide of a fielder at cover for four more. 11 off the over, which should make Malinga feel better. 9th over: South Africa 42-1 (Amla 19, Du Plessis 5) Malinga\u2019s fifth over, and his have cost six apiece on average, a fair chunk more than his team-mates\u2019. He also got the wicket, of course, and his team need a few more of those. 8th over: South Africa 36-1 (Amla 16, Du Plessis 3) No bowler in the world has dismissed Faf du Plessis more often in ODIs than Thisara Perera. He\u2019s dismissed him five times (next is Pat Cummins on four, followed by five people including Malinga with three; full list here). So Perera comes in, and Du Plessis is predictably guarded. Maiden. 7th over: South Africa 36-1 (Amla 16, Du Plessis 3) South Africa has reined in their boundary-hunting impulses since the wicket, though as I type that Amla is teased into a drive by Malinga, and the ball whistles past the bat. 6th over: South Africa 34-1 (Amla 15, Du Plessis 2) Suranga Lakmal now, and there\u2019s a leg bye off the first and a couple off the last, though Du Plessis would probably have had a four a little earlier but for a fine stop from Avishka Fernando at cover. 5th over: South Africa 31-1 (Amla 15, Du Plessis 0) Malinga keeps giving Amla invitations to score off his pads. This time there isn\u2019t quite enough on it for the ball to reach the rope, and the batsmen run three. Then, though, the wicket, and some much-needed encouragement for the Sri Lankans. He\u2019s still got the magic, has he not? Malinga\u2019s straight yorker slips between bat and pad and clips leg stump! 4th over: South Africa 28-0 (De Kock 15, Amla 12) That\u2019s fluid cricket! De Kock drives just wide of extra cover for four, then after inside-edging safely behind his legs a deft/panicked/bit-of-both late cut sends the ball rolling away for four more. 3rd over: South Africa 20-0 (De Kock 7, Amla 12) De Kock pushes the first ball down the ground for four, and later Amla, after a couple of uncomfortable swishes and prods, repeats his midwicket flick from over one, with identical results. Thanks to Charlie for the link to this video, of these very same teams taking bee-related evasive action in an ODI a couple of years ago. Un-bee-lievable*. * Sorry 2nd over: South Africa 10-0 (De Kock 2, Amla 8) Dhananjaya de Silva does some early spinning, and De Kock gets a single from the penultimate delivery. I forgot to mention that it was Malinga who bowled the first over, but then you knew that. 1st over: South Africa 9-0 (De Kock 1, Amla 8) Amla sweetly times a drive through the covers for four. Languid, I think is the word. The next is flicked off his ankles, past midwicket for four more. The last beats the edge (there did seem to be a tiny noise, but there was no appeal so perhaps I invented it). South Africa have had one big opening stand at this World Cup, Amla and De Kock putting on 104 against Afghanistan, but otherwise the first pair has only once contributed more than 22 runs, and in their two games since the Afghanistan match has managed nine (against New Zealand) and four (against Pakistan). The players retake the field. This is the fifth time in this World Cup that South Africa have fielded first. So far they have won one and lost three of the previous games. \u201cGive South Africa a target and they will find a way not to reach it,\u201d notes Uma Venkatraman. \u201cAdam signed off saying that \u201cSouth Africa [are] in a very strong position to end Sri Lanka\u2019s top four campaign\u201d but Sri Lanka can lose today and still qualify if Pakistan are Beaten by Bangladesh and Bangladesh are beaten by India, unless underdogs England manage to scrape a victory in one of their two final matches,\u201d jibes Martyn Fairbrother. Hello everyone. Well, that was fun. Yes, I\u2019m referring to the bit with the bees. Please do send me my thoughts, either by email here or by twittering here. An innings that never, got going. Eight of Sri Lanka\u2019s batsmen made it to double figures but only Kusal Perera and Avishka Fernando made it to 30 - both dismissed on that score from ordinary shots. With those two behind them, South Africa were able to put the squeeze on and did so wonderfully through the middle overs. Due to the consistent wickets that fell through that period, there was very little left to work with in the final ten, where just 40 runs were added. Dwaine Pretorius finished with the excellent throwback figures of 3/25 from his ten overs and is speaking to TV. \u201cIt was a tough wicket and we had to be disciplined,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone backed each other up quite well and the partnerships worked. It was our most disciplined performance of the tournament so far. Basic cricket: hitting the top of off.\u201d That\u2019s me done. I\u2019ll hand over to Simon Burnton with South Africa in a very strong position to end Sri Lanka\u2019s top four campaign. Thanks for your company. Bye! Malinga moved Sri Lanka to 200 with a lovely crack to the point boundary but hit the next ball in the air, du Plessis this time completing the innings at mid-off. Morris finishes with 9.3-0-46-3. South Africa need 204 to win. 49th over: Sri Lanka 198-9 (Lakmal 3, Malinga 0) Well, it should have been two-in-two to finish and complete the innings, Lakmal giving catching practice to du Plessis at mid-on, but he\u2019s grassed the regulation chance. Rabada: 10-2-36-2. Udana tried to make room to slap a short ball but it went straight in the air instead, Rabada claiming the catch in the middle of the pitch. He deserved a second (at least) after all his fine work since starting the day with a wicket first ball. 48th over: Sri Lanka 195-8 (Udana 16, Lakmal 2) Udana berates himself for another swing/miss to start Morris\u2019 ninth over. He does get bat on the ball to the next, falling just short of Amla at backward point on the edge of the circle. The slower ball is too good for him again, making three dots to begin before the yorker ends up at mid-off for one. Lakmal\u2019s turn, turning one square. THE PLAYERS ALL HIT THE DECK because a swarm of bees have arrived! Umpires too. Yes, this has been a dire innings without much to note but we\u2019ll always have that moment. 47th over: Sri Lanka 192-8 (Udana 14, Lakmal 1) Rabada is back after his frugal middle spell, those two maidens helping drain this Sri Lankan innings of any momentum at an important time. He immediately beats Udana with a delivery that\u2019s too good, the same man swinging and missing when trying to clear cow corner later in the over. Sure enough, the bumper comes next with Udana doing just enough to get it away from his helmet and down to the ground. Four off. 46th over: Sri Lanka 188-8 (Udana 11, Lakmal 0) Phehlukwayo gives Udana something in the slot to finish and he pin-points his slap/drive through extra cover for four. Nice strike. The Cricket Ground DJ plays the song they normally only give a blast when a six is hit. Make of that what you will. I found it the other week; rude not to share this TOTP performance from 1981. \u201cAll oiled up and ready.\u201d Perera has a crack at Phehlukwayo but doesn\u2019t get much of it, Rabada taking a fine diving chance running in from the rope. The third ump confirms the clean catch. 45th over: Sri Lanka 182-7 (T Perera 20, Udana 6) Tahir to bowl out his tenth and doing it well. He deserved a wicket for all the pressure he has created at the bowling crease today. That\u2019s not to be, but he\u2019ll take the 0/36 from ten. 19 runs have been added from the first five overs of this final power play. Grim. 44th over: Sri Lanka 179-7 (T Perera 18, Udana 5) Phehlukwayo is landing both his stock and slower balls here, the bumper as well. They are starting to swing but the contact just isn\u2019t there. Five off it. 16 from 26 this partnership. 43rd over: Sri Lanka 174-7 (T Perera 16, Udana 2) Perera nearly gives a catch out to midwicket but it doesn\u2019t quite make it to the sweeper. Four of Tahir\u2019s six balls are dots, his figures 0/33 with one over to bowl. As usual, the 40-year-old leggie (WHERE\u2019S THE STEVE CARELL MOVIE ON THIS?) has been excellent. 42nd over: Sri Lanka 171-7 (T Perera 13, Udana 2) Phehlukwayo sent down five overs earlier when Kushal Perera and Fernando were going nicely. It\u2019s a very different game now. The sweepers at midwicket, mid-on and third man are scored to, Phehlukwayo helping out with a badly sprayed slower ball. But that\u2019s their lot. \u201cSurely Sri Lanka are the team with both the best Powerplay 1 run rate and the worst Powerplay 2 run rate?\u201d poses Avitaj Mitra. \u201cMakes you reminisce about Sangakara and Jayawardene and even Dilshan.. who could milk singles in the middle overs like it was the easiest thing in the world.\u201d It made sense for Mendis and Mathews to chill for a bit after losing both set men but not for that to become the standard for the rest of the innings. They\u2019ve brought this on themselves today. 41st over: Sri Lanka 167-7 (T Perera 11, Udana 1) Tahir has three overs to bowl in this happy hour period, if Sri Lanka ever visit the bar, that is. Udana has mad skills at the death with the ball, but what\u2019s his long handle like? We don\u2019t get to find out here, four singles picked up; the boundary never threatened. 40th over: Sri Lanka 163-7 (Perera 8, Udana 0) Morris finishes with a bumper as well. It being the end of the 40th, another fielder can now exit the circle. Mendis tried to repeat the shot he played for six in the previous over against Morris but this time picked out the man at long leg. Good bowling. 39th over: Sri Lanka 159-6 (J Mendis 16, T Perera 7) Well, here we go! Sri Lanka are back in the act (for now at least) taking 15 from this Duminy over. Mendis, emboldened by his six in the last set, goes over the top of the man on the circle up at mid-on for four. That\u2019ll do. They\u2019re helped by five wides when de Kock can\u2019t glove a flat ball down the legside. To finish, another misdirected delivery, three tickled to fine leg by Mendis. That\u2019ll do, JP. Have a blow. 38th over: Sri Lanka 145-6 (J Mendis 11, T Perera 3) They still have four wickets in hand but it feels like South Africa could finish them off in a real hurry. Oh, and this should be the seventh, Perera taking on Faf at mid-on, the captain unable to nail the throw at the non-strikers\u2019 end. He would have been gone by at least three metres. Mendis\u2019 turn and he finally makes decent contact, slapping Morris over deep backward square for the first six of the innings! Shot! \u201cI\u2019m struggling to recall the last time a Sri Lankan first innings took such a pasting on OBO, with a guaranteed defeat to follow,\u201d asks Brian Withington. \u201cPossibly Rob Smyth on duty last week for the England game can refresh our memories?\u201d What they have going for them: South Africa are chasing these runs after lunch. 37th over: Sri Lanka 136-6 (J Mendis 4, T Perera 1) Thisara Perera is known for giving it a wallop and what they would give for a bit of that today. He\u2019s off the mark down the ground first ball, the hapless Perera then playing out the rest. He nearly chops Duminy on, which might be preferable for Sri Lanka at this stage. The left-hander is 4 from 36 and it is not getting any better . The run rate? 3.67 (!). Oh dear. They\u2019ve had a shocker today, Sri Lanka. In response to JP\u2019s first ball, his opposing number has a dip at a reverse sweep and makes an absolute meal of it. 36th over: Sri Lanka 135-5 (Dhananjaya 24, J Mendis 4) Back to back maidens from Rabada? Are you kidding me? Mendis has 4 from 32 balls and this is not good enough. They won\u2019t make 200 at this rate. Once again, very 1999 World Cup areas. 35th over: Sri Lanka 135-5 (Dhananjaya 24, J Mendis 4) Phehlukwayo replaces Tahir, which I\u2019m a bit surprised about given the hold he had on both players. The change suits Dhananjaya, who has enough time to free his arms and carve a powerful cut shot to the point rope and move into the 20s. Time to get busy. 34th over: Sri Lanka 128-5 (Dhananjaya 19, J Mendis 2) Rabada replaces the efficient and effective Pretorius. Dhananjaya is defending and leaving, which is sound enough logic in terms of preserving his wicket but I really don\u2019t see what they get out of letting him churn through a maiden in the 33rd over. Rob Connelly says nice things about the OBO. Thanks for your company. He is asking for a look at the World Cup table, which I\u2019ll pop in here now. 33rd over: Sri Lanka 128-5 (Dhananjaya 19, J Mendis 2) Tahir continues, and why wouldn\u2019t he? Mendis is picking him, but that\u2019s only part of the battle. He can\u2019t beat the fielders on the circle, just one run added. The leggie has three to come 32nd over: Sri Lanka 127-5 (Dhananjaya 18, J Mendis 2) The end of a fantastic stint from Dwaine Pretorius, finishing with 10-2-25-2, the vital wickets of Fernando and Mendis both his after coming back into the XI today. Bowled. Drinks! 31st over: Sri Lanka 123-5 (Dhananjaya 15, J Mendis 2) A boundary! The first for quite some time, Dhananjaya taking on the final Tahir delivery, lashing it off the front foot to the rope at extra cover. It\u2019s a start. \u201cLove the phrase \u2018entitled whining\u2019 (Over 23),\u201d said Peter Salmon. \u201cTrying to work out its relationship to \u2018virtue signalling\u2019. For me the most worrying thing is that he expects a taxi driver to \u2018chill out\u2019. He\u2019s obviously living in another reality.\u201d 30th over: Sri Lanka 115-5 (Dhananjaya 8, J Mendis 1) How do Sri Lanka handle this? Of course, a loss here and it\u2019s all over. So do they try and crawl to 220 and hope? Or do the chance their hand through Dhananjaya and go up the risk/reward scale? Since Fernando and Perera departed, all intent has been missing. At least they scored as single off Pretorius this time around, his second spell 1/1 off three. 29th over: Sri Lanka 114-5 (Dhananjaya 7, J Mendis 1) Nothing to ease the squeeze off Tahir, who is already through five overs for 17 runs. I reckon he\u2019ll still be bashing around as South Africa\u2019s No1 spinner for the 2023 World Cup. Check out Moeen Ali\u2019s new column. He\u2019s been brilliant so far in this weekly spot. 28th over: Sri Lanka 111-5 (Dhananjaya 5, J Mendis 0) Jeevan Mendis is the new man at No7, Pretorius giving him nothing. Five dot balls makes a wicket maiden, the 12 balls the all-rounder has sent down since his return all scoreless. He has 8-2-21-3. As you do. Very 1999 World Cup figures. There is the big wicket! After completely drying up the Sri Lankan star, Morris has done it with a shortish ball, Mendis miscuing to point. They\u2019re in strife now. 51 balls he faced for his 23. Grim. 27th over: Sri Lanka 111-4 (Mendis 23, Dhananjaya 5) Finally some runs through the back half of this Tahir over, Mendis then Dhananjaya starting to pick out the sweepers. They really need to get it ticking over now, the run rate just on four. 26th over: Sri Lanka 106-4 (Mendis 19, Dhananjaya 4) Fantastic return from Pretorius, the man with two wickets to his name, now getting an addition to his maiden column as well. Sri Lanka really have been stopped in their tracks. 25th over: Sri Lanka 106-4 (Mendis 19, Dhananjaya 4) Tahir bounces through another over for just two. After a couple of ropey balls to start, he\u2019s right back in his groove. Mindful of his major responsibility here, Mendis is taking no risks. 24th over: Sri Lanka 104-4 (Mendis 18, Dhananjaya 3) Excuse me while I catch up, lost the wifi for a few minutes. Doesn\u2019t look like we have missed much. Two here from the Morris over. He has four up his sleeve, so that might be all for now. 23rd over: Sri Lanka 102-4 (Mendis 18, Dhananjaya 1) Another good over for the Proteas, Mendis taking the wrong\u2019un through midwicket for one and Dhananjaya doing likewise to finish but with four dots in there too. Over the last five overs, Sri Lanka have added 1/16. Good captaincy from du Plessis to squeeze after the third wicket fell, not allowing Mathews to properly settle. \u201cFurther to Nick Parish\u2019s comments on Bairstow\u2019s rather entitled whining, isn\u2019t it the case that all the teams have had to play on these pitches and they\u2019re pretty dissimilar to what any of them are used to, save possibly NZ?\u201d asks Geoff Wignall. That was the kicker. The comments about failure culture, misguided as they were with this team (for mine), could be kind of understood. This bit... not so much. 22nd over: Sri Lanka 100-4 (Mendis 17, Dhananjaya 0) The new man defends the one remaining delivery in the successful Morris over. South Africa have a big opportunity to run through Sri Lanka here, especially if Mendis falls soon. Yuk. Mathews makes room to try and mow Morris out through midwicket but chops on instead. After showing a lot of patience, that\u2019s another wicket they\u2019ve thrown away from a delivery that didn\u2019t deserve it. Earlier in the over he popped him over mid-on for four, still. That\u2019s not pretty cricket. 21st over: Sri Lanka 96-3 (Mendis 17, Mathews 7) Tahir Time! He picked up a wicket in his first over on Sunday at Lord\u2019s but he won\u2019t be in the book with the full toss he gives Mathews to begin here, struck with control to midwicket for one, nor the half-tracker to Mendis, which is put away for four. The veteran finds his range before long, Mendis defending then watching the hard-spun legbreaks. 20th over: Sri Lanka 91-3 (Mendis 13, Mathews 6) Morris gives Mendis a bit of room to begin, obliging with a push past point for two. There\u2019s a single to third man on offer later, Mathews also picking up one behind square to long leg. Both sides seem happy with where the game is currently at. 19th over: Sri Lanka 87-3 (Mendis 10, Mathews 5) Rabada pushes through another very tidy one, his maiden ruined by Mendis who steered the final ball to third man for one. Mathews is five off 21 and Mendis 10 from 29. But I don\u2019t expect this will worry either of them if it means getting a couple of Rabada overs out of the way. \u201cI heard you and Geoff briefly discussing Bairstow\u2019s comments on the podcast yesterday,\u201d says Jack Jorgensen. \u201cI wholeheartedly agree with the perception that these comments could blow up. The UK press is so unforgiving, and even if there was nuance in Bairstow\u2019s original statements, its been lost in the headlines making the rounds. Add to that Michael Vaughan on Twitter again this morning, its starting to unravel. Even as an Aussie I\u2019m starting to watch through my fingers, waiting for the next calamity!\u201d Yep. A win on Sunday and all will be forgotten. But if they don\u2019t... well, to quote those great philosophers Daphne and Celeste: \u201cU.G.L.Y you ain\u2019t got no alibi.\u201d 18th over: Sri Lanka 86-3 (Mendis 9, Mathews 5) Morris returns too and immediately finds the edge of Mathews, falling just short of Amla at first slip. After spraying a wide, the big seamer is into his work, angling in at Mathews attacking his stumps and giving him nothing. Looks like a glorious day at Durham. The last time that Sri Lanka played an international there was in 2016 when Alastair Cook clocked his 10,000th Test run. Other things happened that week - a lovely Chris Woakes spell and a lavish Moeen ton - but not a lot more. England won by plenty. 17th over: Sri Lanka 85-3 (Mendis 9, Mathews 5) Sensing an opening before these two important players get set, Faf brings Rabada back - the man who took a first ball wicket earlier today. He\u2019s right on the mark at Mendis, who is defending with a straight bat before squeezing out one behind square. Mathews does the same to finish, timing nicely just behind square to keep the strike. \u201cPicking up the point about dry pitches,\u201d writes Nick Parish, \u201cI was a bit worried about Bairstow\u2019s complaints about all the difficult pitches England have had to cope with, and comparing them with the pitches of the last two years. As well as making excuses (despite saying he wasn\u2019t making excuses), he is surely aware that last summer was three months of uninterrupted sunshine, while this June has seen rain of biblical proportions. I don\u2019t know much about preparing wickets, but I feel a bit for the groundsmen expected to produce flat, dry tracks during a typical British summer.\u201d What I know for sure: if England are knocked off by India on Sunday, YJB is going to cop more abuse than he ever has in his sporting life. I\u2019m not saying that is necessarily fair, but he will be the poster child for all that is wrong, and so on. 16th over: Sri Lanka 83-3 (Mendis 8, Mathews 4) Even though his previous two overs picked up wickets, this is a more probing set from Pretorius after the drinks break, finding Mathews\u2019 inside edge then getting some excellent carry from a ball just outside the off-stump. Just one from it. Nicely bowled. Gary Naylor is back with his latest take from The Shires. 15th over: Sri Lanka 82-3 (Mendis 7, Mathews 4) Oooh! Not far away from a run out to finish, Mendis racing to the danger end from the final Phehlukwayo ball, calling Mathews through for a quick single to midwicket. Earlier, Mathews pushed well out to cover for three, timed off the back foot. Don\u2019t worry about Big Ang. An tweet in from @vkmagus: \u201cWhenever I see these permutations and equations towards the end of the group stages Harry Belafonte starts singing to me \u2018It is clear as mud but it covered the ground\u2019\u201d 14th over: Sri Lanka 77-3 (Mendis 6, Mathews 1) Easy does it, Mathews deflecting the fifth ball of the Pretorius over down to third man to get himself moving. He copped a lot of stick when taking this approach last week (for 85 not out off, well, a lot of balls) against England but he was proven very right a few hours later. A press release has entered my inbox advising that Carlos Brathwaite has been fined 15 per cent of his match fee yesterday for showing dissent. Always here for you with the big breaking news on the OBO, me. 13th over: Sri Lanka 76-3 (Mendis 6, Mathews 0) Phehlukwayo gives Mendis something to settle into on leg stump, clipping his first boundary of the day. South Africa have given away far too many runs on the pads so far this morning. The all-rounder is back on the mark for the rest, keeping the star right-hander quiet. \u201cGood morrow, Adam.\u201d And to you, John Starbuck. \u201cWhen England did so well in Durham, as you mentioned, wasn\u2019t it a blazing hot day? It\u2019s unfamiliar, but we even have bright sunshine here in Yorkshire too. So how much of England\u2019s past success was down to the conditions, especially last year? Big scores are usually expected in the dry.\u201d You\u2019re right. It was early in the Football World Cup; I recall watching Australia lose to Denmark in the press box during the first innings. Might have also been the longest day of the year? Felt like it when the sun was out at 10pm from the pub. 12th over: Sri Lanka 72-3 (Mendis 2, Mathews 0) Mendis and Mathews, the Sri Lankan engine room, have a lot of work to do here now. The former skipper does are you would expect, carefully defending his first few deliveries. On the evidence of what we saw last week against England, he won\u2019t be in a hurry. Smart cricketer. \u201cYou are going to have to be patient on this pitch,\u201d adds Mel Jones on TV. \u201cDo teams need a half hour between the toss and the first ball?\u201d replies Shankar Mony, quite fairly, to something I said earlier. \u201cWhy cant both sets of openers be ready and we have play 10 minutes after the toss? For a game that is competing for eyeballs with other quicker sports (all other sports are quicker), cricket could do with less dilly dallying, I say.\u201d Yep, point taken. Pretorius has two in five balls! He\u2019s castled Perera with an off-cutter that didn\u2019t have a lot going on, the opener trying to steer it behind point but instead chopping it on. Another poor dismissal, all told. 11th over: Sri Lanka 70-2 (K Perera 29, Mendis 1) A steady ovr from Phehlukwayo to begin the accumulation phase, three singles added; Mendis off the mark to fine leg. \u201cLove the Ian Chappell/Piers Morgan contretemps,\u201d writes Peter Salmon. \u201cReminds me of the first time I really understood sport. Aus v Eng, 1979-80. Nine years old, in the lobby of the Hilton Hotel across from the MCG waiting for the players to come down. Australia 1/155 chasing England\u2019s 306. Saw Chappelli in his civvies walking to the door with his gear, 53 not out overnight. Scurried up to him and said, \u2018Please Mr Chappell, can I have your autograph?\u2019 Without breaking stride he said, \u2018No kid, no. I need you to fuck off.\u2019 I have never admired anyone else as much as I admired him at that moment. Good Guardian cred too.\u201d On that latter point, Geoff and I talked to him about his activism earlier in the year. He knows he has a big megaphone but made a decision to use it carefully. A great Australian, that\u2019s for sure. 10th over: Sri Lanka 67-2 (K Perera 28, Mendis 0) Mendis, Sri Lanka\u2019s star No4, defends the one ball to come in the successful over. Ten runs and a wicket from it. After twice tucking into ropey Pretorius deliveries on leg stump to take full advantage during the final over of the power play, Fernando has fallen from the penultimate ball! It\u2019s not much of a delivery either, miscuing when trying to go long and straight, the ball landing with du Plessis at mid-on. Frustrating cricket. 9th over: Sri Lanka 57-1 (K Perera 23, Fernando 26) Phehlukwayo has impressed during this World Cup as well, with the ball especially, and gets a chance now in place of Rabada. But there is no pressure here at the moment, five singles taken even though the field is still up. That\u2019s quite unusual, and good batting. \u201cThe only way for England to be certain to qualify is to beat both New Zealand and Idea,\u201d emails Martyn Fairbrother. \u201cThey will then be on 12 points, the only other team that can reach twelve points is Sri Lanka, but qualification is then decided by number of games won, so England would still qualify. If England only win one of the two games, then they will finish on 10 points. Sri Lanka can reach 12 points. Pakistan or Bangladesh (but not both) can reach 11 points. If Pakistan / Bangladesh is tied (or not played) then potentially England Pakistan and Bangladesh will finish on 10 points and 4 wins \u2013 qualification will be decided by net run rate.\u201d That clears it up! I think England might actually be helped by the fact that they probably have to win both games. Forget about the rest. 8th over: Sri Lanka 52-1 (K Perera 20, Fernando 24) Sri Lanka\u2019s 50 is up with a tidy little tuck from to fine leg by Fernando, down to the rope. Bouncing back well, Pretorius is up for leg before when beating Fernando\u2019s inside edge but it is going well over middle stump, the technology shows after the fact. 7th over: Sri Lanka 45-1 (K Perera 19, Fernando 19) Rabada goes again and it doesn\u2019t come off, three risk-free singles added - a legside wide as well - before Perera leans into a full toss, putting it away through point. His third boundary. \u201cDoes Avishva Fernando remind anyone else of Aravinda DeSilva?\u201d asks Sampath Kumar. He might be a fraction more lavish in his strokeplay, but I can see where you are coming from. Aravinda, I have it on good authority, is in the countryright now. I\u2019m trying to get him to talk to me about Sri Lanka\u2019s poor 1999 World Cup. 6th over: Sri Lanka 37-1 (K Perera 13, Fernando 18) Pretorius replaces Morris and does the job Faf du Plessis wants from him after a couple of busy overs for the Sri Lankans, keeping them to just a single with his tidy medium pace. 5th over: Sri Lanka 36-1 (K Perera 12, Fernando 18) If you can ignore the first ball, this is a fantastic start for Sri Lanka! Granted, four byes come from a ball that misses Fernando\u2019s inside edge and the stumps and de Kock\u2019s gloves all by about an inch. But he keeps his cool, finishing with a quite outstanding straight drive that races away to the rope. There is a lot to like about the new Sri Lankan No3. Where was he earlier in the tournament? Nae bother, he might have arrived just in time. 4th over: Sri Lanka 26-1 (K Perera 11, Fernando 13) And again! Perera gets on the front foot this time to crunch Morris through cover. A couple of singles puts him back on strike by the end of the over and he\u2019s again beaten by Morris but the early signs are good for the man who made such a famous century against South Africa at Durban earlier in the year. \u201cJP Duminy yet again benefiting from, well, just sort of being around,\u201d observes Nick Toovey. \u201cHe\u2019s got the air of the guy in the school cricket team that\u2019s there to crack jokes, or is a prefect, or had a fluke day at open trails. When was his last performance of note?\u201d Four years ago, he balanced them nicely but now, I can\u2019t work it out either. Made a brilliant ton at the MCG in 2008, don\u2019t you know. I remember that day for earning the worst sunburn of my life. The scars remained years later. Thanks, JP. 3rd over: Sri Lanka 20-1 (K Perera 6, Fernando 12) Fernando is not going to mess around with the field up, crunching a ball that isn\u2019t that short through cover for Sri Lanka\u2019s second boundary. He\u2019s beaten later in the set, which happens at Durham - the TV tells us that seamers move it there more than any other of these World Cup venues - but they\u2019ve pushed back nicely after the golden duck to begin. 2nd over: Sri Lanka 14-1 (K Perera 6, Fernando 6) Chris Morris is opening up with the other new ball, a bowler I should have mentioned earlier when looking for positives. His figures won\u2019t reflect it but he\u2019s been very good at times without a lot of reward. Fernando picks up his second three, this time clipping with ease off his pads. Nice start from the No3. Morris is getting some decent movement but down the legside beyond Perera. After a brief sidescreen disruption (for the umpteenth time this tournament) he dishes up a short, wide ball, Perara creaming it through point for a boundary. You can\u2019t bowl there to him. 1st over: Sri Lanka 6-1 (K Perera 2, Fernando 3) Watching the replay, Karunaratne was trying to get his hands underneath the spitting Rabada delivery but completely misjudged the pace and bounce. Nice shot from Avishka Fernando to get underway, punching with perfect timing past point for three. He was outstanding in the power play against England this time last week after they lost a couple of early wickets; let\u2019s hope for much of the time. Kusal Perera is also off the mark with a couple off his hip. The end of a successful over to begin for Rabada. First ball of the game! Rabada bangs it in short of a length at the captain\u2019s body, the ball crashing into the handle of the bat and lobbing up to du Plessis in the gully. Easy game, this! The players are on the field! And I better hurry up because something has happened first ball! Blimey! \u201cRight.\u201d Yes, right on, Matthew Dony. \u201cTangentially related to cricket (as he regularly tweets about it...), but Piers \u2018The Spanner\u2019 Morgan has tweeted about a two star review his latest self-serving documentary received from the Guardian. He tweeted, \u2018The day these sandal-clad, virtue-signalling kale-munchers like my work, I will retire from public life.\u2019 So, during any lulls in play today, could you reach across the big Guardian desk (that all writers from all departments obviously sit around) and exert some pressure to amend the review? Offering bribes, if necessary. Make it a glowing 5 star puff-piece, and then hold him to his promise to disappear from view. Even as a freelancer (which gives you a pass on the sandals and kale, don\u2019t worry) It\u2019s your duty to help de-Piers British life.\u201d Better still: the world could simply deal with him the way Ian Chappell did. Worth a google. How do South Africa lose any sporting contest after hearing that? Right, back to my inbox. \u201cGood morning, mate.\u201d Amod Paranjape, always a pleasure. \u201cOur side (India) must be boring for a few people. But for middle aged fans like me, Bumrah, Shami , Bhuvi are a whiff of fresh air. (And who waits in the Wings; Seniors Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Shardul Thakur etc, Juniors; Shubham Mavi, Navdeep Saini, etc). Also kindly curse your blasted side for me. They have given Pakistan a chance and against Pakistan in knockout stages, India historically falters.\u201d The great thing about writing a lot of OBOs is that people think that I am English. I mean, I sort of am. I live here with my very English partner and I have a red passport thanks to my mother. But I\u2019m very much a Melbourne lad. To your actual point: people seem to have forgotten that if Sri Lanka roll over last Friday, there are probably 11 dead rubbers at the back end of this World Cup. Anyway, I\u2019m not going to die on that hill today as I\u2019m pleased we have a juicy ending coming up. They\u2019re on the way for anthems! Which means we have plenty of time with Sri Lanka\u2019s. As I said to Emma John on the excellent Spin pod the other week, it\u2019s too long to be a Eurovosion entry. That\u2019s all I measure songs by. I need better hobbies. South Africa: Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock (wk), Faf du Plessis (c), Aiden Markram, Rassie van der Dussen, JP Duminy, Andile Phehlukwayo, Dwaine Pretorius, Chris Morris, Kagiso Rabada, Imran Tahir. Sri Lanka: Dimuth Karunaratne (c), Kusal Perera (wk), Avishka Fernando, Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Dhananjaya de Silva, Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Isuru Udana, Lasith Malinga, Suranga Lakmal. Suranga Lakmal is in for Nuwan Pradeep: an experienced right-arm seamer for an experienced right-arm seamer. Dimuth Karunaratne says Sri Lanka would have batted. So everyone is happy. They have one change, which I\u2019ll give you with the full teams in a moment. \u201cWe just want to win this match and go forward by defending a total in this match.\u201d Nasser asked Faf what he wants to get out of these last two games? \u201cWin.\u201d Simple as that. They are playing an extra batsman; JP Duminy in for David Miller (injured) with Dwaine Pretorious back for Lungi Ngidi (rested). Is it just me, or is it a bit weird that the toss in this tournament has been held 25 minutes before each game rather than 30? I know that TV rules the world and their broadcast begins half an hour before. But still. Anyway, that is coming up now. \u201cMorning Adam.\u201d Hi Matt Potter. \u201cRecently started listening to yours and Geoff\u2019s podcast and I\u2019ve found it thoroughly enjoyable, so cheers for that.\u201d Our pleasure. \u201cWhat positives do you think SA can take from this tournament? I can only think of Rassie van der Dussen, who\u2019s had a good tournament all considered, and the fact that Imran Tahir is immune to ageing, which is nice.\u201d Yep, it\u2019s Rassie and Imran Tahir. I\u2019d add Lungi Ngidi, who has shown what a big bag of tricks he has when bowling at the death. And we\u2019ll always have that Rabada spell to India at Southampton. But other than that, not a lot. I won\u2019t be the first to observe this, but a big chance they go all England post-2015 World Cup, isn\u2019t there? \u201cHello Adam.\u201d Good morning, Kumar Pushparaj, opening the day for our inbox. \u201cThis competition seems to be wide open in terms of who is going to secure the fourth Spot. Considering the scenario that England, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, all win their coming two matches, then it will be all down to India to decide who reaches the Semis. With that India Sri Lanka Fixture on 6th July.\u201d You\u2019re forgetting Bandladesh! But yes, there are two games that could settle it: India v Sri Lanka and Pakistan v Bangladesh at Lord\u2019s. In both scenarios, England would need to lose to India and probably New Zealand as well (I think). It has taken 30 days, but at long last this World Cup gets some north-eastern exposure, arriving at Durham for the first of three fixtures. A week ago, this looked like a stinker between two sides with no chance. But then the butterly flapped it wings: Sri Lanka beat England and the race for the top four was turned on its head. In turn, the destiny of Dimuth Karunaratne\u2019s charges remains in their hands. By contrast, their opponents today, South Africa, were the second team formally punted from the tournament when they were thrashed by Pakistan on Sunday at Lord\u2019s. The final margin didn\u2019t do justice to just how abject they were with the bat in pursuit of 285, never even remotely in the hunt. It summed up the Proteas\u2019 limp month in the country, putting in one underwhelming effort after another. Yes, Faf du Plessis\u2019 team whitewashed Sri Lanka in this format earlier this year, and sure, they have knocked them off in 16 of their last 18 ODIs. But that doesn\u2019t mean an awful lot to them now as they enter this slow, post-elimination goodbye. The degree of difficulty for Sri Lanka remains, needing to win all three of their games, but it is not quite as steep as it is being suggested when comparing that position to the other sides in the pelaton, Pakistan and Bangladesh. If they get up today, their next must-win game is against another side who won\u2019t be progressing: West Indies. Then comes India to finish, but one step at a time. In terms of the venue, this time last year England chased down Australia\u2019s 314 in just 44 overs. We haven\u2019t seen many games like that in this comp, but we\u2019re right to assume they will be friendly batting conditions first up. And it should be a sunny day, the temperature expected to top 20 degrees in county Durham. So what will it be? Some more Malinga magic to keep this chasing group at seven? Or will South Africa play for (I promise this the only time I\u2019ll say...) pride? I\u2019m looking forward to finding out with you throughout the morning. Stay in touch in the usual OBO ways, dropping me a line or firing off a punchy tweet.",

Cricket is increasingly pushed to the margins, a vanishing square of green. Defeat is frankly no good to anyone.</p> <p>Plus, of course, England are still well-placed to do the opposite. They can win four games from here. The dry weather will help. Other teams also have flaws.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Deserve\u2019s got nothing to do with it.\u2019 Jonny Bairstow knows what the problem is. Two days after the invertebrate batting collapse against Australia, six days after the invertebrate batting collapse against Sri Lanka, Bairstow spoke out this week. Some English people \u2013 journalists presumably; self-motivating strawmen definitely \u2013 don\u2019t want England to win the ICC World Cup. This apparently is the problem. It is a misguided suggestion on the most basic level. For the last four years this England team has been a source of pure visceral pleasure. Even the most jaded of observers wants to watch Jos Buttler somersaulting his way to 77 off 33 balls, as opposed to Jos Buttler on a green pitch batting with all the assurance of a three-legged dog trying to cross a busy dual carriageway. More to the point, this is to misunderstand the business. There is a huge slice of media self-interest in England winning the World Cup. Out there beyond the bubble they\u2019re not exactly gasping for England-lose-again-at-obscure-summer-sport stories. Cricket is increasingly pushed to the margins, a vanishing square of green. Defeat is frankly no good to anyone. Plus, of course, England are still well-placed to do the opposite. They can win four games from here. The dry weather will help. Other teams also have flaws. Never mind the angst, or those weird press conferences where Eoin Morgan pronounces his words with clipped and regal disdain, looking like the president of the space federation taken hostage and forced at gunpoint to sit in front of a board covered with adverts and talk about field settings and bowling changes in the powerplay.

The UK prime minister and Russian president shared a frosty handshake at the start of their meeting. May\u2019s spokeswoman said the PM had told Russia the UK had \u201cirrefutable evidence\u201d Moscow was behind the attack.</li> <li><strong>Boris Johnson</strong> and<strong> Jeremy Hunt</strong> faced questions from Tory members at the latest leadership hustings in Exeter. Johnson reiterated his promise that the UK would leave the EU on 31 October and refused to rule out proroguing parliament to circumvent MPs blocking a no-deal exit. Hunt on the other hand said he did not see 31 October as a hard deadline. He said if there is a deal in sight, he would not rip it up and leave without one. Hunt ruled out bringing May\u2019s withdrawal agreement to another Commons vote.</li> <li>One of the questions was about Iran, with Johnson praising Donald Trump for \u201ctalking sense\u201d on the country and accusing Tehran of being \u201cbent on all sorts of mischief\u201d. He added: \u201cWe need to very vigilant about Iran and that government.\u201d</li> <li>Hunt spoke about his regret over the handling of the junior doctors\u2019 dispute, which began in 2016. It <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/26/junior-doctors-agree-to-82-pay-rise-ending-four-year-dispute\">ended this week when junior doctors agreed a new contract</a>, which comes with an 8.2% pay rise over four years. \u201cWhat I realised is I wasn\u2019t getting [the] message across to junior doctors themselves,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cI was getting the message across to Conservative members, but not these 51,000 junior doctors, who work amazingly hard and are the future of the NHS.\u201d</li> <li>The Irish PM, Leo Varadkar, said the EU would not reopen the withdrawal agreement, no matter who became the next prime minister. He told a summit in Manchester the EU \u201cmean what we say\u201d. </li> <li>Ian Paisley challenged the BBC over a programme that made claims about him taking luxury foreign holidays. He said the broadcaster should provide evidence to the parliamentary standards commissioner.

You can share your own thoughts by commenting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/28/theresa-may-to-meet-putin-g20-summit-in-japan-tory-leadership-boris-johnson-live-news\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>\u2018Everyone now assumes it\u2019s going to be a no-deal Brexit\u2019</strong></p> <p>I had an interesting chat yesterday with a big cheese from my chamber of commerce. Three things are worth reporting here. One, everyone now assumes it\u2019s going to be a no deal, except for things like air travel, security, and they\u2019ve planned for it. There\u2019s also much Brexit fatigue. Expect no rescue from these quarters. Two, folks here expect the pound to collapse badly, leading to loan defaults, personal bankruptcies and all kinds of woes among the local British expat community; some of that has already started, also confirmed by the head of my BNP Paribas branch yesterday. Three, Brexit politicians have been so awful that for many watchers, it has made [Emmanuel] Macron look so much better by contrast. All who have viewed a little or much of the UK political goings on have come out liking Macron and the EU more. <a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/130558195\">Lupin813</a></p> <p><strong>\u2018No deal or no Brexit\u2019</strong></p> <p>The way the UK handled the negotiation process has been farcical. It has been a circus, and now either clown Boris or juggler Hunt will complete the chaotic catastrophe. The current and only choices are no deal or no Brexit. No deal is reckless insanity which will cripple the UK for decades and no Brexit is the only sane, rational choice. <a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/130557963\">Gizzit</a></p> <p><strong>\u2018Putin gave his seal of approval to Trump\u2019s actions\u2019</strong></p> <p>The article on Putin today made interesting reading. He gave his seal of approval to Trump\u2019s actions, the rise of the populist right in the west and claimed liberalism is dead. The way Britain is now slowly moving with Boris and Farage towards their model must make folk proud to be British. I wonder what our brave war dead would think of this after they gave their lives in defence of freedom. At least Donald Tusk again could be relied on to counter Putin\u2019s usual guff. <a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/130559459\">newwavearmy</a></p> <p><strong>\u2018The removal of illegal immigrants should be a result of processes followed where that is the consequence, rather than the objective\u2019</strong><br></p> <p>What happened in the Home Office is quite simple to understand. For the Home Office to function, the removal of illegal immigrants should be a result of processes followed where that is the consequence, rather than the objective. When you turn that around and say processes must lead to removal, the functionality of the department collapses. The person with the primary responsibility for that is Theresa May. <a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/130559916\">kristinezkochanski</a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-03T08:44:58.096Z\">at 9.44am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d15f4748f081e872735070f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-28T11:06:09.341Z\">12.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26fe146ed725361c8db532f33d95e22c35331999\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26fe146ed725361c8db532f33d95e22c35331999/0_16_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson at a Conservative leadership hustings event in Exeter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson at the Conservative leadership hustings event in Exeter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On <strong>Donald Trump\u2019s</strong> ban on Huawei, <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> said: \u201cWe should not be doing anything to deter our most valuable intelligence partners.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May has told Vladimir Putin \u201cthe use of a deadly nerve agent\u201d in Salisbury was \u201cpart of a wider pattern of unacceptable behaviour\u201d during a bilateral at the G20. The UK prime minister and Russian president shared a frosty handshake at the start of their meeting. May\u2019s spokeswoman said the PM had told Russia the UK had \u201cirrefutable evidence\u201d Moscow was behind the attack. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt faced questions from Tory members at the latest leadership hustings in Exeter. Johnson reiterated his promise that the UK would leave the EU on 31 October and refused to rule out proroguing parliament to circumvent MPs blocking a no-deal exit. Hunt on the other hand said he did not see 31 October as a hard deadline. He said if there is a deal in sight, he would not rip it up and leave without one. Hunt ruled out bringing May\u2019s withdrawal agreement to another Commons vote. One of the questions was about Iran, with Johnson praising Donald Trump for \u201ctalking sense\u201d on the country and accusing Tehran of being \u201cbent on all sorts of mischief\u201d. He added: \u201cWe need to very vigilant about Iran and that government.\u201d Hunt spoke about his regret over the handling of the junior doctors\u2019 dispute, which began in 2016. It ended this week when junior doctors agreed a new contract, which comes with an 8.2% pay rise over four years. \u201cWhat I realised is I wasn\u2019t getting [the] message across to junior doctors themselves,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cI was getting the message across to Conservative members, but not these 51,000 junior doctors, who work amazingly hard and are the future of the NHS.\u201d The Irish PM, Leo Varadkar, said the EU would not reopen the withdrawal agreement, no matter who became the next prime minister. He told a summit in Manchester the EU \u201cmean what we say\u201d. Ian Paisley challenged the BBC over a programme that made claims about him taking luxury foreign holidays. He said the broadcaster should provide evidence to the parliamentary standards commissioner. Paisley told the BBC: \u201cIf the BBC think I have done anything wrong, all the BBC has to do is to submit evidence to the parliamentary commissioner. The independent authority can examine on all of those matters and make their own ruling. That\u2019s the only comment I can make.\u201d That\u2019s it from us for today. Thanks very much for following and your comments BTL. Ireland\u2019s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said whoever became the UK\u2019s next prime minister would get a \u201cfair hearing\u201d from the EU but warned \u201cwe mean what we say\u201d about not re-opening negotiations on the withdrawal agreement. Varadkar spoke alongside the UK\u2019s minister for the Cabinet Office, David Lidington, and Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, at the end of a British-Irish Council summit meeting in Manchester. He said \u201cit needs to be understood that we mean what we say\u201d. \u201cThat is: the withdrawal agreement won\u2019t be re-opened, without a backstop there will be no transition period or implementation phase, but that we are willing to examine the joint political declaration and make amendments to that if that enables us to proceed to an orderly Brexit with a guarantee there will be no hard border between north and south, which is our shared objective.\u201d Lidington said Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt had both said they did not want a no-deal Brexit, and it was important to \u201ctake their word on that\u201d. He also said it was clear tariffs and checks would be applied to UK trade on day one of a \u201cno-deal crash-out\u201d. But he said there would be a window when EU leaders would want to hear what Theresa May\u2019s successor had to say, and the government\u2019s position was still to leave with a deal. Sturgeon said there was a \u201creal danger\u201d of no-deal becoming inevitable \u2013 and it was futile to waste time trying to re-negotiate. Theresa May has called the Salisbury poisoning a \u201ctruly despicable act\u201d. Ian Paisley has challenged the BBC to present any evidence of alleged wrongdoing to a parliamentary watchdog following the latest claims about him taking luxury foreign holidays. Paisley said the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone, could examine the issues raised. The DUP North Antrim MP declined to be drawn on the specifics of Tuesday\u2019s night\u2019s BBC Spotlight programme, which included a claim that an undeclared family holiday to the Maldives was partly paid for by a former government minister in the Indian Ocean country. Paisley told the BBC: \u201cIf the BBC think I have done anything wrong, all the BBC has to do is to submit evidence to the parliamentary commissioner. \u201cThe independent authority can examine on all of those matters and make their own ruling. That\u2019s the only comment I can make.\u201d Asked if his constituents deserved a fuller explanation, he added: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about my constituents; my constituents and me have a very good and sound relationship.\u201d Paisley was suspended from the House of Commons for 30 days for \u201cserious misconduct\u201d for failing to declare two family holidays to Sri Lanka in 2013. The MP survived parliament\u2019s first ever recall petition. Local independents have prised away a seat in Mansfield previously held by a Labour councillor who narrowly defeated them to win a mayoral poll in May. The Labour loss came at the hands of the Mansfield Independent Forum in the Sandhurst ward of Mansfield district council. The seat had been vacated by Labour\u2019s Andy Abrahams after he won the directly elected Mansfield mayoral poll on 2 May. He won by just two votes against the Mansfield Independent Forum candidate, Kate Allsop, in the second round of counting under the single transferable vote system. Mansfield Independent Forum now has 14 of the 36 seats on the council, while Labour also has 14 plus the mayoralty. Theresa May has told Vladimir Putin \u201cthe use of a deadly nerve agent\u201d in Salisbury was \u201cpart of a wider pattern of unacceptable behaviour\u201d during a bilateral at the G20. The UK prime minister and Russian president shared a frosty handshake at the start of their meeting. May\u2019s spokeswoman said the PM had told Russia the UK had \u201cirrefutable evidence\u201d Moscow was behind the attack. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt faced questions from Tory members at the latest leadership hustings in Exeter. Johnson reiterated his promise that the UK would leave the EU on 31 October and refused to rule out proroguing parliament to circumvent MPs blocking a no-deal exit. Hunt on the other hand said he did not see 31 October as a hard deadline. He said if there is a deal in sight, he would not rip it up and leave without one. Hunt ruled out bringing May\u2019s withdrawal agreement to another Commons vote. One of the questions was about Iran, with Johnson praising Donald Trump for \u201ctalking sense\u201d on the country and accusing Tehran of being \u201cbent on all sorts of mischief\u201d. He added: \u201cWe need to very vigilant about Iran and that government.\u201d Hunt spoke about his regret over the handling of the junior doctors\u2019 dispute, which began in 2016. It ended this week when junior doctors agreed a new contract, which comes with an 8.2% pay rise over four years. \u201cWhat I realised is I wasn\u2019t getting [the] message across to junior doctors themselves,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cI was getting the message across to Conservative members, but not these 51,000 junior doctors, who work amazingly hard and are the future of the NHS.\u201d Hunt believes \u201cit is wrong for parliament to take no deal off the table \u2026 if they do that, we\u2019re less likely to get a deal.\u201d He has now left the stage to bring the hustings to an end. Hunt says he would \u201clove\u201d to have Boris Johnson in his cabinet if he becomes prime minister, saying \u201che has changed the course of our history through his leadership of the leave campaign\u201d. Hunt says he cannot understand why there are \u201cfar too many drugs in our prisons\u201d. He believes too many young people leave school without sufficient reading and writing skills. Hunt also cites a study in Iceland about how parents spending time with their children led to young people being less likely to develop problems including obesity. The foreign secretary has spoken of his regrets over the handling of the junior doctors dispute, which began in 2016 and he described as \u201cbitter and difficult\u201d. \u201cWhat I realised is I wasn\u2019t getting [the] message across to junior doctors themselves,\u201d Hunt says. \u201cI was getting the message across to Conservative members, but not these 51,000 junior doctors, who work amazingly hard and are the future of the NHS. \u201cWhat I learned is as Conservatives, we have to be better on social media. They are getting information from Facebook and Twitter. \u201cAs prime minister, I want to approach social media in a different way, your thinking, dilemmas. I am not saying go Trump on social media, but we have to engage.\u201d Hunt has ruled out bringing Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement back before the House of Commons. On why he will not commit to leaving the EU by 31 October, he said: \u201cIf you make it a hard deadline and parliament stops you then you have to have a general election \u2026 and we would be crucified.\u201d Hunt said character mattered in choosing the next Tory leader but politicians\u2019 private lives should not be part of the process. \u201cWe all have things in our private life, things that we did 20 years ago that we would not want our mum and dad to find out about \u2026 I\u2019ve got lots and I\u2019m not going to tell you, Ian, sorry \u2013 and my wife is sitting in the front row, so that\u2019s another reason,\u201d he said. \u201cI think when we are in a constitutional crisis, frankly the biggest constitutional crisis of my lifetime, it demeans that competition if we start having huge discussions about people\u2019s private lives, and I think we should stick to the issues facing the country.\u201d On university tuition fees, Hunt said: \u201cI do worry some of the courses do not offer students value for money, if you have \u00a350,000-\u00a360,000 debt and do not have the prospect of earning enough to pay that debt back.\u201d He added: \u201cI cannot justify why the interest rate on student loans is 6%, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair. It risks discrediting the system.\u201d Jeremy Hunt has said he is committed to HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail, but delays to its opening are frustrating, comparing it to the railway network in Osaka being built within two years. He added that \u201cthe train service to Devon and Cornwall is totally inadequate\u201d. When asked whether he would abolish inheritance and capital gains tax, Hunt said: \u201cI would like to reduce lots of taxes. \u201cInheritance tax is one of the most unfair taxes. I said I would have a radical cut to corporation tax to fire up the economy.\u201d Hunt added that business rates are \u201cabsolutely crippling\u201d. On the proposal for milkshakes to be covered by the sugar tax, Hunt said he spent six years trying not to go into McDonald\u2019s during his time as health secretary, but eventually succumbed to temptation. \u201cI like my milkshakes. We do need to tackle our obesity crisis. It disproportionately affects people from poorer families,\u201d he said. \u201cThe quickest way is for people who manufacture milkshakes to reduce the sugar in them. You threaten them, you don\u2019t need to follow through with the dreaded sugar tax.\u201d Jeremy Hunt has said 31 October is not a \u201chard deadline\u201d for Britain to exit the EU. \u201cWe both [he and Boris Johnson] want to get out by 31 October,\u201d he said. If there is a deal in sight in the week leading up to it, I am not going to rip the whole thing out and leave. I would be prepared to leave without a deal if there isn\u2019t one in sight.\u201d On Theresa May\u2019s talks with Vladimir Putin today at the G20 summit, Jeremy Hunt said: \u201cIt is possible to rebuild relations if Russia changes its behaviour. Last year, Russia used chemical weapons on British soil [in Salisbury]. My worry about Russia is they are up to their old tricks. \u201cMy dad was in the navy \u2013 thanks to that generation, we won the cold war. I will increase spending on defence by 2.5% [of] GDP over five years.\u201d Jeremy Hunt promises to get more young people to vote Conservative and pledges he will not cause an election before delivering on Brexit. The foreign secretary said that if elected he would be the \u201cfirst prime minister you have had who was an entrepreneur\u201d. He told the audience: \u201cWhat do entrepreneurs do? We negotiate. You have to be prepared to walk away if you don\u2019t get the deal you want. Secondly, you have to figure out what the other guys want to do.\u201d Jeremy Hunt is on stage. He begins by asking the audience, if you live in Devon for two years as he did, are you a local or a \u201cgrockle\u201d? The audience seems to go with the latter. Guardian readers have been discussing Brexit, Vladimir Putin and the hostile environment below the line, in comments compiled by my colleague Gerry Hart. You can share your own thoughts by commenting here. \u2018Everyone now assumes it\u2019s going to be a no-deal Brexit\u2019 I had an interesting chat yesterday with a big cheese from my chamber of commerce. Three things are worth reporting here. One, everyone now assumes it\u2019s going to be a no deal, except for things like air travel, security, and they\u2019ve planned for it. There\u2019s also much Brexit fatigue. Expect no rescue from these quarters. Two, folks here expect the pound to collapse badly, leading to loan defaults, personal bankruptcies and all kinds of woes among the local British expat community; some of that has already started, also confirmed by the head of my BNP Paribas branch yesterday. Three, Brexit politicians have been so awful that for many watchers, it has made [Emmanuel] Macron look so much better by contrast. All who have viewed a little or much of the UK political goings on have come out liking Macron and the EU more. Lupin813 \u2018No deal or no Brexit\u2019 The way the UK handled the negotiation process has been farcical. It has been a circus, and now either clown Boris or juggler Hunt will complete the chaotic catastrophe. The current and only choices are no deal or no Brexit. No deal is reckless insanity which will cripple the UK for decades and no Brexit is the only sane, rational choice. Gizzit \u2018Putin gave his seal of approval to Trump\u2019s actions\u2019 The article on Putin today made interesting reading. He gave his seal of approval to Trump\u2019s actions, the rise of the populist right in the west and claimed liberalism is dead. The way Britain is now slowly moving with Boris and Farage towards their model must make folk proud to be British. I wonder what our brave war dead would think of this after they gave their lives in defence of freedom. At least Donald Tusk again could be relied on to counter Putin\u2019s usual guff. newwavearmy \u2018The removal of illegal immigrants should be a result of processes followed where that is the consequence, rather than the objective\u2019 What happened in the Home Office is quite simple to understand. For the Home Office to function, the removal of illegal immigrants should be a result of processes followed where that is the consequence, rather than the objective. When you turn that around and say processes must lead to removal, the functionality of the department collapses. The person with the primary responsibility for that is Theresa May. kristinezkochanski On Donald Trump\u2019s ban on Huawei, Boris Johnson said: \u201cWe should not be doing anything to deter our most valuable intelligence partners. I really saw this as foreign secretary, it is a relationship we cannot afford to put at risk.\u201d He also said he was \u201cnot that attracted\u201d to lowering the voting age as we do not get enough 18- to 24-year-olds voting. The Labour MP David Lammy has tweeted about reports that Boris Johnson described the French as \u201cturds\u201d in a BBC documentary while he was foreign secretary. Johnson said he could not recall the remarks. Boris Johnson also distanced himself from offering a cabinet position to his leadership rival Jeremy Hunt if he becomes prime minister. \u201cI have a very high regard for Jeremy,\u201d he said, before being reminded by the host, Iain Dale, that it traditionally happens. Johnson added: \u201cI am not making commitments to anybody.\u201d Boris Johnson would not pledge to have a quota of 50% women in cabinet, but said he would \u201cbe advancing the interests of women in government and parliament like I did in City Hall\u201d. Boris Johnson also spoke about his proposal for a points-based immigration system. \u201cIf you look at the rural sector, there are farming communities that need seasonal labour. It has gone on for decades, if not centuries,\u201d he told the audience. \u201cThat\u2019s entirely right. But you should [do] it according to the needs of the economy and sector. What has gone on is no control at all. \u201cNo one knows on what basis they come in, the jobs to go to or what skill was required. A points-based approach is democratic consent to what is going on. A system that reflects the needs of the UK economy.\u201d Johnson added: \u201cI do think freedom of movement does not work. That was not working for us any more.\u201d Boris Johnson was asked why he ducked the Channel 4 and Sky News leadership debates. In response, he said: \u201cNo one could have done as many hustings as I have done. \u201cAs Conservatives, it\u2019s important not to tear great lumps out of each other. My policies have received a great deal of scrutiny. Thou shall not speak ill of another Conservative. I am doing at least two head-to-head debates \u2013 that is more than enough to glut the appetite.\u201d On Iran, Johnson said: \u201cWe need to very vigilant about Iran and that government. \u201cThey are bent on all sorts of mischief in the region. One of the areas that Donald Trump talks sense, and there are many areas, it is right to work with the Americans and European friends to constrain Iran in the region. \u201cThis is a young, dynamic population, high rates of female literacy, education, they are very tech-savvy. \u201cThey want to engage with us. We have to find ways of getting over the mullah\u2019s grip on society.\u201d Boris Johnson says stamp duty land tax in London is causing \u201chuge problems\u201d following reports he is considering abolishing the levy on homes worth less than \u00a3500,000 and reversing stamp duty increases on more expensive homes. On reports that he called the French \u201cturds\u201d in a BBC documentary aired last year that was cut, he responded: \u201cI have no recollection of this comment.\u201d In response to a question on whether milkshakes will be covered by the sugar tax, Johnson joked as to whether it was connected to them being thrown at politicians in recent months. \u201cThere is an obesity problem in this country. Something we all deal with and wrestle with,\u201d he said. \u201cNot eating is a very good solution, by the way. I am reluctant to impose new taxes that impose disproportionately those on low income. \u201cIf you want kids to lose weight, make the streets safe, like we did in London. Encourage kids to walk and cycle to school. It\u2019s calories in, calories out.\u201d Among the highlights of Boris Johnson\u2019s speech to Tory members was his pledge to exit the EU by 31 October. He also said \u201cisn\u2019t it time the A303 is modernised?\u201d and \u201ceducation funding needs to be levelled up\u201d across the country. Johnson added that it was an \u201cutter disgrace\u201d that parts of rural England do not have full-fibre broadband and are faced with the \u201crevolving pizza wheel of doom\u201d. Boris Johnson, referred to as \u201ccontestant number one\u201d by the host, Iain Dale, is on stage at the hustings in Exeter. He told the audience: \u201cI don\u2019t know of a time we got 9% in national election. The hour is darkest before the dawn. We can turn this thing around.\u201d Marina Litvinenko, the widow of Alexander Litvinenko, has told the Guardian she was disappointed that Theresa May had agreed to meet Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Osaka. She said the prime minster had failed to mention Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun \u2013 the two Russians accused of poisoning her husband in November 2006 with a radioactive cup of tea. Putin has refused to extradite the pair. A public inquiry in 2016 found them responsible for Litvinenko\u2019s murder. It concluded Russia\u2019s president had \u201cprobably\u201d approved the hit. Marina Litvinenko said: \u201cMrs May has said nothing about what happened to my husband. He was a British citizen when he died. The two suspects for his murder should be brought to justice.\u201d She added she was incensed by Putin\u2019s comments in his interview with the FT. \u201cPutin said we should forget what happened in Salisbury to the Skripals, that they weren\u2019t worth five kopecks. He didn\u2019t mention my husband,\u201d she said. \u201cLugovoi is now a deputy in Russia\u2019s duma. How the new prime minister handles relations with Moscow will be crucial. He may be tempted to start a new relationship without questions. I hope not.\u201d Marina Litvinenko was speaking at a Russian opposition conference organised by Free Russia in The Hague. Theresa May has told Vladimir Putin \u201cthere cannot be a normalisation of our bilateral relationship until Russia stops the irresponsible and destabilising activity\u201d, Downing Street has said, following her meeting with the Russian president at the G20 summit. Supporters of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are flanking the entrance to Sandy Park conference centre in Exeter ahead of the latest hustings. Jeremy Hunt has his say on Vladimir Putin\u2019s remarks that liberalism is \u201cobsolete\u201d. It comes as Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said he \u201dstrongly [disagreed]\u201d with the Russian president\u2019s sentiments. \u201cWhoever claims that liberal democracy is obsolete also claims that freedoms are obsolete, that the rule of law is obsolete and that human rights are obsolete,\u201d Tusk said. \u201cWhat I find really obsolete are authoritarianism, personality cults and the rule of oligarchs, even if sometimes they may seem effective.\u201d The Home Office has been accused of being \u201creckless\u201d for failing to monitor the impact of its \u201chostile environment\u201d immigration policy, according to a leaked draft review into the Windrush scandal. Channel 4 News and the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants obtained extracts from the review, which reportedly said the department \u201cfailed to monitor, or effectively evaluate, the effectiveness and impact of compliant environment measures\u201d. It added: \u201cThis appears particularly reckless considering the significant warnings that the department was given about their potential consequences.\u201d Wendy Williams, HM inspector of constabulary, who led the review, said there was a \u201cdefensive culture that results in an unwillingness to learn from past mistakes\u201d. She wrote: \u201cWhile everyone I spoke to was rightly appalled by what happened, this was often juxtaposed with a self-justification, either in the form of it was unforeseen, unforeseeable and therefore unavoidable \u2026 or a failure on the part of individuals to prove their status.\u201d The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, called for an end to the hostile environment policy. \u201cThis damning review details the terrible experiences of many of the Windrush generation under the Tories\u2019 cruel and degrading hostile environment,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government is still failing to address the injustices they have caused: British citizens have lost their jobs, lost their homes and been deported.\u201d A Home Office spokesman said: \u201cWe do not comment on leaked documents.\u201d Boris Johnson is considering an emergency budget for a no-deal Brexit including tax cuts, an overhaul of stamp duty and an assault on regulation if he becomes prime minister, according to reports. Under the plan, the budget, which normally takes place in October or November, is likely to be brought forward to September, the Times reported. The proposals include an \u00a311bn-a-year proposal by Dominic Raab to increase the national insurance contribution threshold from \u00a38,632 to \u00a312,500. Johnson is also considering an overhaul of stamp duty. As well as abolishing the levy on homes worth less than \u00a3500,000, his team is considering reversing stamp duty increases on more expensive homes. At present, only the first \u00a3125,000 of a property is exempt from stamp duty. Other policies being considered include a \u201cTrump-style\u201d temporary prohibition on new regulations and raising the threshold for the annual investment allowance above the present level of \u00a31m to promote business. Johnson\u2019s team will discuss the plans next week at a meeting chaired by Sir Edward Lister. Three senior sources from the campaign told the newspaper that the ideas were under discussion. Ahead of the Tory leadership hustings today, Simon Jenkins believes Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt will have to ditch a no-deal Brexit or face an election. Theresa May has begun her meeting with Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit. The pair shook hands but did not smile before sitting down to begin their talks in Osaka. Prior to the talks, May said Donald Trump\u2019s ban on Huawei could influence UK businesses\u2019 decisions about using the Chinese telecoms company\u2019s technology. A UK review of 5G supply chains will be published \u201cin due course\u201d, the prime minister said. The US has put Huawei on a so-called entity list, effectively banning US companies from selling components and technology to it. May said: \u201cThe decision by the United States for Huawei to be put on the entity list has obviously brought another factor into this issue and individual companies will be wanting to consider what the impact of that has.\u201d Labour MP Jess Phillips believes Jeremy Corbyn must withdraw the whip from Chris Williamson - the MP at the centre of an anti-Semitism row - as a \u201cmatter of principle\u201d. Ms Phillips is one of more than 120 MPs and peers calling for the removal of Mr Williamson from the parliamentary party following his readmission on Wednesday. The Derby North MP was originally suspended after saying the party was \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d in the face of criticism of the way it dealt with cases of anti-Semitism. Ms Phillips said Mr Williamson had been guilty of \u201ca litany of offensive behaviour towards the Jewish community and those fighting anti-Semitism\u201d. She told the BBC\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThis is a matter of principle about racism, about the Labour Party being the party of equality, the party that is anti-racist. That reputation is slipping away from us every day.\u201d Our political editor Heather Stewart is in Japan for the G20 summit. Theresa May spoke to journalists at Yamamoto Noh Theatre and, in keeping with Japanese cultural traditions, the prime minister removed her shoes before entering the venue. Ahead of her meeting today with Vladmir Putin at the G20 summit in Osaka, Theresa May has called for the suspects in the Salisbury novichok attack to be \u201cbrought to justice\u201d. The UK believes two officers from Russia\u2019s military intelligence service were behind the poisoning of the former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in March 2018. Scotland Yard and the Crown Prosecution Service say there is sufficient evidence to charge two Russians \u2013 who go by the names of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov \u2013 for attempted murder. Skripal and his daughter survived the poisoning, but Dawn Sturgess died last July after coming into contact with the poison by handling a contaminated perfume bottle. May told the BBC that Russia needs to stop its \u201cdestabilising activities\u201d. In a separate interview with ITV, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s not business as usual and it can\u2019t be business as usual with Russia until they stop the sort of acts we have seen them doing around the world. \u201cI want to see the individuals, against whom charges have been brought, brought to justice.\u201d The Kremlin denies any involvement. Putin has insisted the suspects are civilians, not criminals. A crude remark by Boris Johnson about the French was cut from a BBC documentary following concerns at the Foreign Office over how it could affect diplomatic relations. The former foreign secretary accused the French of being \u201cturds\u201d over Brexit, with the comment due to appear in the Inside the Foreign Office programme in November, the Daily Mail reported. But the Foreign Office asked for it to be cut, with a Whitehall memo suggesting the comment would make Anglo-French relations \u201cawkward\u201d, according to the newspaper. A spokeswoman for the BBC said: \u201cThe programme set out to reflect the realities of life inside the Foreign Office, the production team made judgments about what was in the programme and they are satisfied that the programme achieves its ambitions and has the content they wanted.\u201d The Foreign Office declined to comment. Leadsom, who resigned from her post in May over Brexit, told the Today programme: \u201cBoris is the man who is going to take us out of the European Union. Only by being prepared to walk away will we get a good deal.\u201d She is also hopeful of a deal being struck before Halloween because of the incoming EU commissioners, \u201cwho would not want their legacy to be the United Kingdom being an unsolved mystery\u201d. Andrea Leadsom, the former leader of the House of Commons, was pressed on the Today programme about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. Boris Johnson had said the chances of no deal are \u201cmillion-to-one against\u201d, despite promising to leave on 31 October. During a lively interview with the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson, Leadsom said: \u201cI\u2019m not a bookie, I can\u2019t give you odds. \u201cIts impossible to predict the future. What Boris is indicating is it\u2019s not his intention to leave without a deal.\u201d Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live politics blog. We have a busy day ahead with Theresa May to meet the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Osaka \u2013 their first meeting since the poisonings in Salisbury last year \u2013 as well as updates on the Tory leadership hustings.",

      "body": "<p>At 8.56pm and 40 seconds on Saturday 3 June 2017, Kirsty Boden sat down at a table in the sunken courtyard of the Boro Bistro restaurant.</p> <p>In the shadow of Southwark Cathedral, Boden, a 28-year-old nurse, ate dinner with two friends. They drank wine, talked about love and work, and made friends with the people on the next table.</p> <p>Their summer evening out, surrounded by the bustle of London Bridge, stretched on past 10pm. Almost every moment of it was recorded on CCTV. And then, at 10.07pm and 17 seconds, there was a mighty crash \u2013 and debris rained down into the courtyard from a white van that had ploughed into railings overhead.</p> <p>For Boden, her friend Melanie Schroeder said, it was the choices made in those instinctive first moments that would prove decisive. At the inquest into the deaths of eight people during that night\u2019s terrorist attack, Schroeder recalled: \u201cWith the crash of the van and the rubble falling, Kirsty jumped up and said words to the effect of: \u2018I\u2019m a nurse, I have to go and help, I need to see if they need help.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>A waiter at the restaurant, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, also rushed to help.

      "bodyText": "The attack on London Bridge and Borough Market lasted just 10 minutes. In that time, the three terrorists killed eight people and seriously injured 48 others, 19 critically, before themselves being shot dead. Even after the attackers were felled, the emergency services continued to believe the assault could be ongoing, such was the level of confusion on the scene. This is how the atrocity unfolded*: 3 June 2017 9:58pm\u201310:02pm The white van used by the attackers passes south over London Bridge before turning round. 10:06pm 53secs The van mounts the pavement for first time on London Bridge, striking and injuring three people. 10:06pm 58s-10:07pm 1s The van leaves pavement for a second time, striking Xavier Thomas, 45, who was flung over the bridge\u2019s balustrade into the Thames. His fiancee Christine Delcros was also struck and badly injured but survived. 10:07pm 7s The van mounts pavement for a second time, striking Chrissy Archibald. The 30-year-old Canadian is trapped under the chassis of van which travels across the bridge\u2019s central reservation before being released and run over by it. 10:07pm 17s The van crashes into railings on Borough High Street, just south of London Bridge. 10:07pm 19s\u201322:07.30s Sara Zelenak, 21, is stabbed seven times close to where the van crashed. James McMullan, 32, another of the eight victims is stabbed as he apparently tried to help her. 10:07pm 31s The first 999 call is made, reporting a road traffic accident. 10:07pm 32s-10:08pm The attackers run down steps from Borough High Street towards the courtyard outside Boro Bisto, below street level. As they do so, they stab waiter Alexandre Pigeard, who is on his way up the stairs to see what is happening. Pigeard, 26, attempts to flee, clutching his throat, but is stabbed again in the courtyard. 10.08pm S\u00e9bastien B\u00e9langer, 36, is cornered in an archway close to Boro Bistro and stabbed by the three attackers. 10:08pm 6s\u201322:08 8s Kirsty Boden, 28, a nurse from Australia, is circled by the attackers and stabbed three times as she tends to Pigeard. 10:08pm 29s The first unarmed officers, constables from British Transport police, arrive on the scene. 10.09pm 30s\u201310.10 Ignacio Echeverr\u00eda, 39, is stabbed by Rachid Redouane on Borough High Street, close to Lobos Meat and Tapas restaurant, after swinging his skateboard at the terrorist in an attempt to protect others.

For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/northern-hemispheres-extreme-heatwave-in-2018-impossible-without-climate-change\">could not have occurred without human-induced climate change</a>\u201d. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was <a href=\"https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/resources/angry-summer-report/\">made at least 50 times more likely by global heating</a>, linking it directly to climate change.</p>\n    <p>Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/27/climate-change-human-fingerprint-found-on-global-extreme-weather\">strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves</a> (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.</p>\n    <p>When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Most of the planet\u2019s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. <a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/another-unprecedented-tropical-cyclone-and-flooding-hits-mozambique\">Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique</a> in March and April. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/global-warming-made-hurricane-harvey-deadly-rains-three-times-more-likely-research-shows\">three times more likely by climate change</a>.

Four administrative d\u00e9partements in France \u2013 Vaucluse, Gard, H\u00e9rault and Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne \u2013 were placed on red alert, signalling temperatures of \u201cdangerous intensity\u201d that are more typical of Saudi Arabia. About 4,000 schools were closed in France as head teachers warned they could not guarantee safe conditions, local authorities cancelled many end-of-school-year carnivals, and nursing homes equipped the elderly with hydration sensors. \u201cThis heat wave is exceptional by its intensity and how early it is,\u201d the prime minister, Edouard Philippe, said, defending authorities\u2019 efforts to avoid a repeat of the notorious 2003 heatwave which caused 15,000 premature deaths. \u201cI want to appeal to the sense of responsibility of citizens - there are avoidable deaths in every heatwave,\u201d Philippe said. \u201cMeasures have been taken for the most vulnerable people but given the intensity of the heat wave, it\u2019s the entire population who must be careful today ... both for oneself and for loved ones and neighbours.\u201d The French health minister, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, warned people tempted to plunge into cold water to do so only in designated public bathing areas, adding that four people had drowned since the beginning of the week. A six-year-old child was also in life-threatening condition after being hit by water shooting from an illegally opened fire hydrant in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, French media reported. French families with elderly relatives who were ill or living alone were advised to call or visit them twice a day and take them to cool places, while the state-run rail operator SNCF offered free cancellations or exchanges on long-distance trips. The greater Paris region, Ile de France, had already banned more than half of cars from its roads in an effort to reduce air pollution and the cities of Lyon, Strasbourg and Marseille have also restricted traffic. With temperatures in parts of Spain expected to hit a new June record of 43C, the Spanish meteorological office issued red alerts in parts of Catalonia, Navarre and the Basque country. Hundreds of firefighters in Catalonia continued to battle to bring a large wildfire under control which has so far burned through 6,500 hectares of land and could consume as many as 20,000ha. A 17-year-old Spanish boy died from heatstroke in the early hours of Friday after having convulsions when he jumped into a swimming pool to cool down, while an 80-year-old man died on Thursday after collapsing from what is thought to have been heatstroke in the city of Valladolid. Italy put 16 cities under alerts for high temperatures, and civil security services distributed water to tourists visiting famed sites around Rome under a scorching sun and in Berlin, a police unit turned water cannon usually used against rioters on city trees to cool them down.

      "bodyText": "The wife of the jailed Chinese human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang has described her husband as a \u201ctotally changed man\u201d after she and her son were allowed to see him for the first time since he disappeared nearly four years ago. Wang, 43, was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison in January for \u201csubverting state power\u201d after a closed-door trial. The prominent lawyer, who defended political activists and victims of land seizures, vanished in a sweep aimed at courtroom critics of Communist authorities known as the \u201c709\u201d clampdown because the arrests started on 9 July 2015. Wang was held incommunicado for more than 1,000 days without access to his family or a lawyer prior to his trial and authorities have repeatedly denied requests by his wife, Li Wenzu, to visit him in jail. \u201cHe is a totally changed man \u2026 he was so agitated and anxious that I couldn\u2019t even talk to him just then,\u201d Li told the South China Morning Press. \u201cMy husband\u2019s health has deteriorated during the long incarceration, he had lost so much weight,\u201d Li told AFP. \u201cWhen I asked him what he had for breakfast, he kept scratching his head. But he couldn\u2019t remember,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was really emotional. This was the first time my son and I got a chance to see him after being separated for four years.\u201d The couple\u2019s six-year-old son, Wang Guangwei, was a toddler when his father disappeared. Li saw her husband at the Linyi jail in the eastern province of Shandong, where he was transferred in May after years spent at a detention centre in Tianjin. \u201cI felt like he was not the earlier Wang Quanzhang,\u201d said his sister Wang Quanxiu, who was also at the meeting. \u201cHe was very agitated when he spoke to us. He had made a draft about what to discuss and had to constantly keep looking at his notes to remind himself of what to say,\u201d she said. Wang Quanzhang was the last of more than 200 lawyers and activists swept up in the 2015 crackdown to be tried or released. Li, who has actively protested against her husband\u2019s detention and sentencing, has repeatedly demanded proof of life from the authorities. She was placed under de facto house arrest the day before Wang\u2019s 26 December trial to prevent her from attending. Earlier that month, before Wang\u2019s court date was announced, Li and three supporters shaved their heads and tried to submit a petition to a Beijing court, protesting against his detention. In April last year, she attempted to march 60 miles to the Tianjin detention centre where Wang was previously held. This week, a video was posted on Twitter showing Li shouting over the prison wall asking whether Wang Quanzhang was alive. It was only on Thursday morning that she received a call from Shandong provincial authorities saying she would be allowed a 30-minute visit. \u201cI\u2019ve never really known if he was alive all these years, and finally there was a clear message I can meet him,\u201d Li tweeted Thursday. Authorities had also called Wang Quanxiu on Thursday at about 11 am and told her she could meet her brother at 2pm that day. \u201cI rushed to the Linyi jail as soon as I received the call, but when I got there it was already 5 pm so I missed the chance to see him that day,\u201d Wang Quanxiu said. \u201cWe have been calling the prison authorities all week to no avail, and then suddenly they changed their mind.\u201d The timing of the meeting, which coincides with the G20 summit in Japan, has led to speculation that the Chinese Communist party \u201cmight be offering a compromise\u201d to embellish China\u2019s chequered human rights record, said Chan Yue, an activist from the Human Rights Concern Group in Hong Kong.

Philippe Pigeard, 51, told the Guardian he believed the attack should have been prevented by MI5 and the police, and that British authorities failed by not putting barriers in place to protect people on the bridge from a vehicle attack. His son, Alexandre, 26, was a waiter at Boro Bistro restaurant next to London Bridge on 3 June 2017, when three terrorists carried out the attack. The ringleader, Khuram Butt, had been under investigation by MI5, which failed to spot his plot and the danger he posed. Pigeard, a musician and poet from Paris, said he understood counter-terrorism investigators had a difficult job but believed they should have done better. He said he found their evidence to the inquest into the deaths of eight people during the attack unconvincing and \u201cfrustrating\u201d, because the security services were certain they had not made mistakes. The inquest heard Butt\u2019s brother-in-law rang the police because he was so concerned about his Islamist extremism, but nothing was done and the information was mishandled.

      "body": "<p>Like the other new-town dreams, Essex is the product of middle-class ideas of what the working classes would like, not realising that they too want buildings that look great, in attractive public spaces at the heart of communities that work (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jun/27/the-invention-of-essex-how-a-county-became-a-caricature\" title=\"\">The invention of Essex: how a county became a caricature</a>, 27 June). And a look at the pictures on the opening page shows how dismally these planners failed: square and featureless slabs of concrete, grim open spaces with no obvious sign of involvement of a human brain. Perhaps the plumbing was better, there might even have been a bit more space for families, compared to the slums they left, but not much else showed any improvement.</p> <p>Not that town planners have done any better since: few modern developments have any sign of an appreciation of visual appeal or even basic coordination of style between one building and the next. Here in Camden is perhaps an example of one of the worst set of planners. Building Approval Department would be the best description of their role, with a suitable acronym to confirm how awful they are. The heart of Swiss Cottage is being destroyed as I write, and the end result will be as big an indictment of today\u2019s planners as anywhere in Essex.<br><strong>David Reed</strong><br><em>Swiss Cottage, London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your article presses the usual buttons about the county while hinting at its diversity. We in Colchester in the far north of the county have a tourist pitch that does not mention Essex. We have a high-class museum in a Norman castle which started life as a Roman temple, the centre of Britain\u2019s first capital. We have a Roman wall to prove it, and the only known Roman circus north of N\u00eemes. Our excellent zoo is the sort you would take your Greenpeace-supporting relatives to. Our north Essex beaches range from Clacton \u2013 as Towie as you can get \u2013 to West Mersea with beach huts but no concrete prom.

      "bodyText": "Like the other new-town dreams, Essex is the product of middle-class ideas of what the working classes would like, not realising that they too want buildings that look great, in attractive public spaces at the heart of communities that work (The invention of Essex: how a county became a caricature, 27 June). And a look at the pictures on the opening page shows how dismally these planners failed: square and featureless slabs of concrete, grim open spaces with no obvious sign of involvement of a human brain. Perhaps the plumbing was better, there might even have been a bit more space for families, compared to the slums they left, but not much else showed any improvement. Not that town planners have done any better since: few modern developments have any sign of an appreciation of visual appeal or even basic coordination of style between one building and the next. Here in Camden is perhaps an example of one of the worst set of planners. Building Approval Department would be the best description of their role, with a suitable acronym to confirm how awful they are. The heart of Swiss Cottage is being destroyed as I write, and the end result will be as big an indictment of today\u2019s planners as anywhere in Essex. David Reed Swiss Cottage, London \u2022 Your article presses the usual buttons about the county while hinting at its diversity. We in Colchester in the far north of the county have a tourist pitch that does not mention Essex. We have a high-class museum in a Norman castle which started life as a Roman temple, the centre of Britain\u2019s first capital. We have a Roman wall to prove it, and the only known Roman circus north of N\u00eemes. Our excellent zoo is the sort you would take your Greenpeace-supporting relatives to. Our north Essex beaches range from Clacton \u2013 as Towie as you can get \u2013 to West Mersea with beach huts but no concrete prom. Check the tide before you come, it\u2019s on an island. If that was not enough we have Constable country, although we have to share it with Suffolk.

      "body": "<p>Two years after the devastating fire at Grenfell Tower, bereaved, survivors and residents are growing increasingly frustrated that there has been no response to their demands for a new consumer regulator for social housing. They want the loss of their loved ones to be a catalyst for positive change. Yet we are still awaiting meaningful action from the government as to how it will ensure tenants in social housing are listened to, and how it will genuinely strengthen the regulation of their landlords. Theresa May\u2019s speech at the Chartered Institute of Housing conference (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/27/britain-private-rented-sector-unfair-unsafe\" title=\"\">Opinion</a>, 27 June) spoke of a stronger consumer regulation regime, but we need more than this.</p> <p>If the 9 million social tenants in England are to feel safe in their homes, and assured they\u2019ll receive the standard of service to which they\u2019re entitled, we need a tough new regulator to enforce consumer housing standards. Governments have responded to protect consumers in this way before, creating the Food Standards Agency after a series of high-profile food deaths, and the Financial Conduct Authority following financial scandals. Why should social tenants matter less?

      "bodyText": "Two years after the devastating fire at Grenfell Tower, bereaved, survivors and residents are growing increasingly frustrated that there has been no response to their demands for a new consumer regulator for social housing. They want the loss of their loved ones to be a catalyst for positive change. Yet we are still awaiting meaningful action from the government as to how it will ensure tenants in social housing are listened to, and how it will genuinely strengthen the regulation of their landlords. Theresa May\u2019s speech at the Chartered Institute of Housing conference (Opinion, 27 June) spoke of a stronger consumer regulation regime, but we need more than this. If the 9 million social tenants in England are to feel safe in their homes, and assured they\u2019ll receive the standard of service to which they\u2019re entitled, we need a tough new regulator to enforce consumer housing standards. Governments have responded to protect consumers in this way before, creating the Food Standards Agency after a series of high-profile food deaths, and the Financial Conduct Authority following financial scandals. Why should social tenants matter less? Tenants need to know that their wellbeing, health and safety will be protected, and standards rigorously enforced, by a regulator focused on working for them. We call on the government to show social tenants that they matter and will no longer be ignored. When next steps for social housing are announced later this year, the government must go further than their initial proposals. We expect nothing less than a new consumer regulator.

      "body": "<p>It was not a typical class outing. Ben, Brooke, Advi and Charlie packed their school ties and made the 1,800-mile round trip from their primary school in Glasgow\u2019s East End to the grand halls of the United Nations human rights council.</p> <p>The 10-year-olds were in Geneva this week to chase up what the grownups were doing to tackle poverty in the UK. They had a date with Philip Alston \u2013 the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights who last November visited Avenue End school, which serves one of the poorest parts of Britain, as part of his investigation into the UK.</p> <p>Children there had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/09/its-unfair-un-envoy-meets-children-living-in-poverty-in-scotland\">told him</a> about hunger and the shame of poverty, about not being able to afford trainers, TV or food and about foodbanks. Alston kept them in mind when he drafted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/16/uk-austerity-has-inflicted-great-misery-on-citizens-un-says\">his damning report</a>, which he presented on Friday to hundreds of diplomats from around the world. He told them the UK was facing \u201ca national poverty crisis\u201d.</p> <p>But before he spoke the children had questions and ideas.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you have the meetings when kids aren\u2019t here?\u201d asked Brooke, having noticed the hundreds of smartly dressed adults, but no children, milling around.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d said Alston, momentarily stumped. \u201cWe should have more kids coming here to tell us what they are thinking about. A lot of what governments do makes a lot of difference to your lives.\u201d</p> <p>Alston asked them what people could do to help child poverty. \u201cJust give them someone to talk to,\u201d said Ben. \u201cBe friends with them,\u201d added Advi. They had raised one of the aspects of child poverty missed this week in Geneva, but often felt keenly by children: loneliness.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s great that you have come,\u201d said Alston. \u201cI really appreciate it.\u201d</p> <p>Alston then took them into one of the grand congress chambers where they posed for a photograph in the seats normally reserved for dignitaries.</p> <p>When Alston delivered his report he told a packed UNHRC his belief that economic and social insecurity in the UK was \u201crampant\u201d and that austerity had left the UK \u201ca more fractured and less compassionate society\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe country that had pioneered the modern welfare state after world war two changed course dramatically,. Funding for welfare, for local government services, for children, for education, for youth, for legal aid, for the poor and for policing were slashed.\u201d</p> <p>Alston attacked the chancellor, Philip Hammond, for describing his assessment of UK poverty \u201cnonsense\u201d and cited a senior civil servant at the Department for Work and Pensions who last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/12/universal-credit-delays-a-factor-in-prostitution-government-accepts\">told parliament</a> it was accurate.</p> <p>\u201cFourteen million people living in poverty, more than 1.5 million destitute, record levels of hunger and homelessness, falling life expectancy for some groups, one in three children across the country living in poverty,\u201d Alston said. \u201cThe greatest tragedy is the situation could be completely transformed in a short time.\u201d</p> <p>The UK government hit back, albeit <a href=\"https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G19/150/32/PDF/G1915032.pdf?OpenElement\">in a written statement</a>, attacking \u201cthe inflammatory language and overtly political tone of this report\u201d.</p> <p>We \u201cstrongly refute the claim that the design and delivery of welfare reforms, including universal credit, are deliberately punitive\u201d, it said. \u201cTackling poverty will always be a priority for this government.\u201d</p> <p>However, the government did not repeat its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/22/amber-rudd-to-lodge-complaint-over-un-austerity-report\">previous claim</a> that his report was \u201cbarely believable\u201d and \u201ccompletely inaccurate\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, in a 66-point defence of its changes to welfare, council funding and privatisation, the government said record employment had overwhelmingly benefited the poorest UK households. It said austerity measures were necessary after the 2008 financial crisis and highlighted next year\u2019s planned end to the benefits freeze.

      "bodyText": "It was not a typical class outing. Ben, Brooke, Advi and Charlie packed their school ties and made the 1,800-mile round trip from their primary school in Glasgow\u2019s East End to the grand halls of the United Nations human rights council. The 10-year-olds were in Geneva this week to chase up what the grownups were doing to tackle poverty in the UK. They had a date with Philip Alston \u2013 the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights who last November visited Avenue End school, which serves one of the poorest parts of Britain, as part of his investigation into the UK. Children there had told him about hunger and the shame of poverty, about not being able to afford trainers, TV or food and about foodbanks. Alston kept them in mind when he drafted his damning report, which he presented on Friday to hundreds of diplomats from around the world. He told them the UK was facing \u201ca national poverty crisis\u201d. But before he spoke the children had questions and ideas. \u201cWhy do you have the meetings when kids aren\u2019t here?\u201d asked Brooke, having noticed the hundreds of smartly dressed adults, but no children, milling around. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d said Alston, momentarily stumped. \u201cWe should have more kids coming here to tell us what they are thinking about. A lot of what governments do makes a lot of difference to your lives.\u201d Alston asked them what people could do to help child poverty. \u201cJust give them someone to talk to,\u201d said Ben. \u201cBe friends with them,\u201d added Advi. They had raised one of the aspects of child poverty missed this week in Geneva, but often felt keenly by children: loneliness. \u201cIt\u2019s great that you have come,\u201d said Alston. \u201cI really appreciate it.\u201d Alston then took them into one of the grand congress chambers where they posed for a photograph in the seats normally reserved for dignitaries. When Alston delivered his report he told a packed UNHRC his belief that economic and social insecurity in the UK was \u201crampant\u201d and that austerity had left the UK \u201ca more fractured and less compassionate society\u201d. He said: \u201cThe country that had pioneered the modern welfare state after world war two changed course dramatically,. Funding for welfare, for local government services, for children, for education, for youth, for legal aid, for the poor and for policing were slashed.\u201d Alston attacked the chancellor, Philip Hammond, for describing his assessment of UK poverty \u201cnonsense\u201d and cited a senior civil servant at the Department for Work and Pensions who last week told parliament it was accurate. \u201cFourteen million people living in poverty, more than 1.5 million destitute, record levels of hunger and homelessness, falling life expectancy for some groups, one in three children across the country living in poverty,\u201d Alston said. \u201cThe greatest tragedy is the situation could be completely transformed in a short time.\u201d The UK government hit back, albeit in a written statement, attacking \u201cthe inflammatory language and overtly political tone of this report\u201d. We \u201cstrongly refute the claim that the design and delivery of welfare reforms, including universal credit, are deliberately punitive\u201d, it said. \u201cTackling poverty will always be a priority for this government.\u201d However, the government did not repeat its previous claim that his report was \u201cbarely believable\u201d and \u201ccompletely inaccurate\u201d. Instead, in a 66-point defence of its changes to welfare, council funding and privatisation, the government said record employment had overwhelmingly benefited the poorest UK households. It said austerity measures were necessary after the 2008 financial crisis and highlighted next year\u2019s planned end to the benefits freeze. It said it was fair to limit some benefits to two children and that the \u00a320,000 national benefit cap was supported by 73% of the UK public. The Avenue End children were already on their way back to Glasgow when the government\u2019s response came. But they were unlikely to have been impressed. Asked about ministers\u2019 previous dismissal of Alston\u2019s report, Ben promised they would \u201ckeep pushing\u201d. Brooke said: \u201cThey should listen. We will keep on \u2026 until they do something about it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "From speeches by political figures to anti-war protests and climate marches, Glastonbury has been long known for its roots in activism and a strong political undercurrent. This year, the inspiration for some of the most potent political messaging was one looming theme: the prospect of a Boris Johnson premiership. As the late-night venue Shangri-La prepared to open on Thursday night, the familiar face of the Conservative leadership frontrunner was seen around the site. Alongside the subversive mock-advertisements with anti-capitalist slogans and climate change warnings, a Stanley Donwood print featuring the Uxbridge and South Ruislip MP sat proudly centre stage. \u201cUnwanted: dead or alive \u2013 Boris \u2018the\u2019 Johnson,\u201d the header on the print read. \u201c52 years old, 5\u2019 9\u201d, pale complexion, British-American, bellowing voice, annoying hair \u2026 stupid arse.\u201d \u201cPeople want them and they\u2019re starting to print them out and put them up off their own back,\u201d said Kaye Dunnings, the creative director of Shangri-La. \u201cPeople feel now that they can be openly political and provocative \u2013 and that clear messaging works.\u201d The posters, which were originally made during the 2016 Tory leadership race, are just one of several anti-Johnson statements made by artists and musicians at the festival. As the main stages opened on Friday, Glastonbury\u2019s first headliner Stormzy was set to become the first black British solo artist to top the bill on the Pyramid stage, bringing grime to a mass audience. The last time Stormzy played the festival in 2017, the rapper whose real name is Michael Omari demanded the government was \u201cheld accountable\u201d for the Grenfell fire. His first No 1 song, Vossi Bop, which topped the charts in May, included the lyrics \u201cFuck the government and fuck Boris\u201d and the BBC was expected to broadcast an uncensored live feed of his set on Friday night. As well as the surreal takedowns of the politician who is favourite to become the next prime minister, there was disparaging work with a musical edge. Jonny Banger, a fashion designer who operates under the moniker of Sports Banger, hosts a \u201cMega Rave\u201d on Saturday at the Stonebridge Bar, where 300 anti-Johnson T-shirts will be given away for free. Accompanied by the caption \u201cBumboys, hot totty and piccaninnies: Boris Johnson\u2019s long record of sexist, homophobic and racist comments\u201d, Wright is also selling his anti-Boris T-shirts for \u00a315 online. Banger \u2013 whose bootleg fashion label uses well-known logos such as the Nike swoosh and combines them with others, such as the NHS logo, said: \u201cI\u2019ve never really seen myself as doing political T-shirts. But it got to the point where I was so angry and wanted to use the T-shirts to say something. He\u2019s vile. He can\u2019t answer a straight question. This country is built on class and favour rather than merit, and he\u2019s pushing that narrative again. The T-shirts are born out of frustration.\u201d In what was described by an audience member as a \u201cvery brave\u201d move on Friday, Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative MP for Richmond Park and former London mayoral candidate, appeared on stage at Glastonbury\u2019s Speaker\u2019s Forum. to boos. Members of the audience unveiled a banner reading: \u201cTory policy kills. Don\u2019t greenwash the lives lost to austerity.\u201d Goldsmith, who is supporting the Uxbridge MP in the leadership race, said he would not be going to any anti-Johnson raves. \u201cI can imagine what happens there and I\u2019m not sure I would be the most welcome guest,\u201d he said. As the festival gates opened on Wednesday, attendees were welcomed with new work from the anti-Brexit artists Cold War Steve and Led By Donkeys, who collaborated on a billboard that overlooked the entire festival site. A Johnson tweet from July 2017 \u2013 which read \u201cThere\u2019s no plan for no deal, because we\u2019re going to get a great deal\u201d \u2013 was placed next to Cold War Steve\u2019s signature surreal photoshopped images of politicians and pop culture figures juxtaposed with the EastEnders actor Steve McFadden. For Jane Tapp, a lecturer from Nottingham, Glastonbury has always been about politics, as well as music. \u201cSome people who wouldn\u2019t usually bother about politics might see something here that gets them interested,\u201d she said. Paul Scotting, also a Nottingham-based lecturer, said the reaction to Johnson\u2019s political rise risked trivialising him. \u201cIt\u2019s a really bad situation and he\u2019s dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all do it, but that\u2019s where he got where he is \u2013 by being a joke.\u201d Justine and Mike Duffy, at Glastonbury for the first time with their daughters, were less critical. \u201cThere are a lot of children around and people are here to forget about all of that,\u201d said Justine, a teaching assistant from Manchester.

A report by the anti-captivity charity Freedom for Animals, seen by the Guardian, details wild birds such as owls and falcons being tied to the ground on short leashes for long periods. Government guidance on tethering applies only to owls and vultures. Some of the birds can be seen continually attempting to fly away before being pulled back down by their tether and chewing at their leg straps in footage recorded by animal welfare campaigners at bird of prey zoos. The charity\u2019s campaigns officer, Maddy Taylor, said: \u201cBirds of prey used in falconry and held in zoos are still wild animals. They still have all their natural instincts and needs as those animals in the wild. \u201cThis includes being able to perform natural behaviours, arguably the most fundamental to them being flight. \u201cHistorically, there has been very little scrutiny of this industry and we feel that with the rising awareness around animal captivity, the time has come for this to be taken seriously.\u201d Freedom for Animals is calling for the government to review the industry and ban the \u201cvastly cruel\u201d practice of tethering for all birds of prey. There are about 95 bird of prey zoos in the UK which house a minimum of 4,252 birds from 170 species. These include owls, falcons, vultures, buzzards and eagles. Though birds were housed in aviaries, in three-quarters of all zoos they were also tethered \u2013 often on lawns where the public could view them.

They claimed some birds were tied down for most of the day and night. While most zoos offer some form of flying display, during the investigation birds were flown for an average of 11 minutes, meaning some were tied down for most of the day. Emma Milne, a vet and author, said denying birds flight \u201cand the chance to escape stressful situations and the choices that come with that is unacceptable on welfare grounds\u201d. She added: \u201cSimply put, birds do not belong in cages and this practice should be stopped.\u201d Concerns were also raised by campaigners over \u201cmanning\u201d, the common training practice of depriving birds of food until they respond to humans. \u201cThe practices of tethering and manning are outdated traditions within the bird of prey industry, practices which we believe do not meet modern animal welfare standards,\u201d said Taylor. According to the report, a third of zoos also did not meet size standards for bird cages, with some birds living in such cramped conditions that they could not stretch out their wings. Under government guidance on modern zoo practice, aviary sizes \u201cmust reflect the flying capabilities of the species\u201d and birds should \u201cenjoy relative freedom of movement\u201d. Local authority figures obtained under freedom of information requests by the charity revealed 40% of the zoos visited did not hold a licence and were therefore not subject to inspections from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Of the zoos that did hold a licence under the Zoo Licensing Act 1981, an analysis of Defra inspection reports by the charity revealed several were overdue inspections. Taylor said the lack of regulation meant birds were left vulnerable. \u201cHow then can the law be upheld and more importantly the animals protected?

We have turned the power of our rivers, the expansiveness of our oceans, the wildness of our deserts against parents who are carrying their babies across entire continents, because any choice they had has long run out.</p> <p>With each breaking news alert, I measure the space between me and my sons. It is instinct: if danger presented, how quickly could I reach them? With each report \u2013 children kept in cages, without diapers and sufficient food, children taking care of younger children torn from the breasts of their mothers \u2013 my horror gives way to rage. But rage is animal. It collects like water droplets until it becomes a river, until it breaks the dam.</p>",

During monsoon season, the driest arroyo can become a rushing river in a matter of seconds, sweeping away anything in its path. How is one to reconcile the beauty of this earth, with the weapon that humans have made of it? We have turned the power of our rivers, the expansiveness of our oceans, the wildness of our deserts against parents who are carrying their babies across entire continents, because any choice they had has long run out. With each breaking news alert, I measure the space between me and my sons. It is instinct: if danger presented, how quickly could I reach them? With each report \u2013 children kept in cages, without diapers and sufficient food, children taking care of younger children torn from the breasts of their mothers \u2013 my horror gives way to rage. But rage is animal. It collects like water droplets until it becomes a river, until it breaks the dam.",

Poland\u2019s government tried to copy this but because it lacked a two-thirds majority in parliament it could not rewrite the country\u2019s constitution as Orb\u00e1n has.

      "bodyText": "A group of German rightwing extremists compiled a \u201cdeath list\u201d of leftwing and pro-refugee targets by accessing police records, then stockpiled weapons and ordered body bags and quicklime to kill and dispose of their victims, German media have reported, citing intelligence sources. Germany\u2019s general prosecutor had been investigating Nordkreuz (Northern Cross) since August 2017 on the suspicion the group was preparing a terrorist attack. The 30-odd members of the group reportedly had close links to the police and military, and at least one member was still employed in the special commando unit of the state office of criminal investigations. In the past, Nordkreuz was reported as being part of the \u201cprepper\u201d survivalist movement, whose followers prepare for doomsday scenarios such as the collapse of the prevailing social order. However, a report by RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland, a Hanover-based research agency with links to smaller regional newspapers, suggested the group was actively preparing the ground for a mass attack on political enemies. Members communicated via the encrypted messenger service Telegram, and accessed police computers to collect almost 25,000 names and addresses of local politicians who had played an active part in civic efforts during the refugee crisis in 2015, the report said. Party members from the SPD, the Greens, Die Linke and Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU were reportedly on the list, which focused on local politics in the eastern states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Brandenburg. The group had also allegedly ordered 200 body bags and quicklime, which can be used to speed up the decay of a corpse and cover up its smell. Three members of Nordkreuz were being separately investigated by a prosecutor in Schwerin for illegal possession of more than 10,000 bullets as well as long- and short-range weapons. The group is said to deny having planned the murder of the people on the lists. The report came a few weeks after the murder of a pro-refugee politician by a rightwing extremist, and amid a growing debate about whether Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, the BfV, has underestimated the threat posed by the militant far right. Thursday\u2019s annual BfV report noted a slight fall in the number of offences by extreme right groups registered in 2018, but also a rise in the number of violent crimes committed by these groups. Overall numbers of sympathisers for extremist positions on the far right, the far left and in Islamism had all slightly increased over the last year, the report noted. It made no mention of Nordkreuz, fuelling criticism that the agency had been turning a blind eye to the threat of neo-Nazi terrorism. Earlier this week, the detained far-right extremist Stephan Ernst confessed to murdering the CDU politician Walter L\u00fcbcke. The head of the Kassel regional government was found dead outside his house on 2 June. Two more men were arrested over the case on Thursday, one for selling the weapon allegedly used in the killing, the other on suspicion of setting up the contact between the gun-seller and Ernst. Ernst reportedly admitted being incensed by L\u00fcbcke\u2019s comments at a town hall meeting he had attended in October 2015. At the meeting, held to discuss a new asylum seeker shelter, L\u00fcbcke said: \u201cOne has to stand up for values here. And those who don\u2019t do so can leave this country any time if they don\u2019t like it. That\u2019s the freedom of every German.\u201d",

Boris Johnson told a Conservative leadership hustings that Putin was \u201ctotally wrong\u201d, and said he had failed in his ambition of forging a new relationship with Russia when foreign secretary. \u201cI went to Moscow in defiance of a lot of advice. I tried to build a new friendship and a new partnership and it just isn\u2019t there,\u201d he said in Exeter. \u201cAll this stuff Putin comes up with about \u2018liberalism is over\u2019 is wrong. He is totally wrong. Our values \u2013 freedom, democracy, free speech \u2013 those things are imperishable and they will succeed.\u201d The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, also restated the EU\u2019s commitment to a \u201crules-based order\u201d. Latvia\u2019s defence minister, Artis Pabriks, used an interview with Euronews to call on all western leaders to recognise the threat posed by the Kremlin. He said: \u201cBeing a border country, we have been facing Russian airplanes, Russian ships next to our border, daily. \u201cAs they are coming very close, they have different interferences. Of course, they are also interfering from time to time, as far as political events happening in our country, let\u2019s say support for some political forces, political parties \u2026 \u201cAnd this, what is happening in the Baltics, in Latvia, you can consider as a litmus test for Russian hybrid [inaudible] against many other western nations, as far as the elections in the US or in France, or Brexit, or other places, or elections to the European parliament, because their purpose, in general, is to create larger influence in global world by diminishing [the] power of [the] opponent.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Dozens of cyclists in Edinburgh could be in line for damages after a judge ruled the city\u2019s tram tracks were to blame for two incidents. In a landmark legal ruling, the court of session awarded damages to two people who were thrown off their bikes and injured when their wheels became trapped in 2012 and 2013 respectively. The judge Lady Wolffe ruled the design and materials used for the tracks were to blame and awarded undisclosed damages. Throwing out claims by the council\u2019s lawyers that the cyclists were partly to blame, Wolffe said: \u201cI have no hesitation in rejecting the defenders\u2019 cases of contributory negligence. There was no breach of duty on the part of either pursuer; they bore no responsibility in law for the accidents that befell them.\u201d Edinburgh\u2019s tram tracks are notorious among the city\u2019s cyclists and believed to be far more dangerous than tram lines in other cities, having caused hundreds of injuries. The council said on Friday that cycle safety was of the \u201cutmost importance\u201d. Changes had been made to the tram lines and safety measures added to a tram extension to Newhaven, including a separated cycle lane down Leith Walk, it said. Zhi Min Soh, a Malaysian medical student, was killed in 2017 when she fell into the path of a minibus after her wheels were caught in tracks in central Edinburgh. Cycling campaigners staged a peaceful protest at the spot where she died. Wolffe\u2019s judgment is expected to lead to a surge in similar actions: 39 other cases were put on hold while the two lead cases were tested in court. In the first of the two cases, Elizabeth Fairley, 58, a critical care nurse with the Royal hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, sued Edinburgh Trams Ltd and the city council for \u00a350,000. She said she was thrown into the path of passing cars and sustained injuries to her face and knee when her rear wheel was caught in tracks that had been made slippery by drizzle in Haymarket in October 2013. In the second case, Iain Lowdean, 35, a professional golfer, sued Transport Initiatives Edinburgh, the now dissolved company set up to build the tram routes, and the council for \u00a315,000.

Saracens and Exeter players will also not feature until the official training squad is confirmed at Japan House next Thursday but Jones said he has so far been encouraged by the physical condition of all his players. \u201cIt has been a really positive week, we have worked on our fundamentals of the game, a little bit of physical conditioning and I am really pleased with the attitude of the players,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have all come back from their leave in excellent condition and the best I have seen in the time I have been with England.\u201d Exeter\u2019s Jack Nowell, along with George Kruis and Mako Vunipola, will also attend the camp to continue their rehabilitation. \u201cNext week we will add some players and be looking to improve our physical conditioning, ability to understand how we want to play the game and start to increase the pressure at training,\u201d added Jones. \u201cWe have a couple of players going back to their clubs as we feel it is in their best interests in terms of the World Cup to do that. We will consider their participation in the squad further down the track.\u201d",

Much of this may be reversed in July.</p> <p>None of this changes the big picture, which is that underlying price pressures remain well below the ECB\u2019s near-2% target. With the eurozone economy having slowed again in Q2, and business surveys still soft, we think core inflation will remain close to 1% for the foreseeable future.

Even though wage growth continues to increase at a steady pace, reflecting the improved labour market environment, businesses continue to be reluctant to price through those higher costs to the consumer.<br></p> <p>The inflation outlook therefore remains sluggish. With energy base effects pushing down the outlook for the coming months, headline inflation will continue to face downward pressures. On top of that, businesses have indicated softer expectations for selling prices on the back of economic uncertainty.

      "bodyText": "Global investors are firmly focused on events in Osaka, Japan, where world leaders are gathered for the G20 summit and where the trade is top of the agenda. Key trade talks between President Trump and President Xi are scheduled for Saturday morning and traders and global leaders alike are hoping for a breakthrough. European markets have built on earlier gains and the STOXX 600 is up 0.4% at 383.77. The FTSE 100 is just 0.1% - or 9 points - higher at 7,411. In corporate news, Apple designer Jony Ive announced he was leaving the tech giant after 30 years to set up on his own. We\u2019ve looked at some of his hits and misses over the years, here: A consortium led by the family that controls the Lego toymaking empire agreed to buy the UK\u2019s Merlin Entertainments for \u00a35.9bn. Merlin\u2019s attractions include Legoland, Madame Tussauds waxworks and the London Eye. UK growth was confirmed at 0.5% for the first quarter of 2019, but economists warned a slowdown is likely in the second quarter. And eurozone inflation was stable at 1.2% in June, putting the European Central Bank on course to fulfil Mario Draghi\u2019s pledge to pump more stimulus into the economy. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for commenting and have a great weekend. AM The opening bell has rung and US markets are higher. Dow Jones: +0.3% at 26,615 S&amp;P 500: +0.3% at 2,934 Nasdaq: +0.3% at 7,990 G20 leaders gathered in Osaka have voiced concerns over trade tensions. Reuters reports: The bitter US-China trade war and signs of slowdown in the global economy have overshadowed a two-day Group of 20 summit that kicked off in Osaka, western Japan, on Friday with a session on the world economy and trade. Yasutoshi Nishimura, Japan\u2019s deputy chief cabinet secretary, who was present at the meeting, said the G20 heads discussed ways to address common challenges such as promoting free trade and jump-starting stalled talks on reforming the WTO. \u201cThere are downside risks to the global economy as trade tensions escalate. Against this background, the G20 leaders agreed on the need for the group to drive global growth,\u201d Nishimura told reporters after the session on Friday. But that was as far as they could agree, as US President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d policies and aversion to multilateralism test the solidarity of the G20. Figures this morning confirmed the UK economy grew by 0.5% in the first quarter of 2019, following 0.2% growth in the final three months of 2019. But \u201cpayback\u201d is coming in the second quarter, according to Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the forecasting group, the EY Item Club: The UK economy has clearly suffered a serious slowdown since the first quarter and we suspect GDP could very well contract slightly in the second quarter. There has clearly been payback in the second quarter from the stockpiling that occurred in the first quarter while an additional hit came from car manufacturers bringing forward their summer shutdowns to April (to limit any disruptions should a disruptive Brexit have occurred at the end of March). Consumers have also clearly taken a breather in the second quarter after their first quarter splashing out The Item Club is forecasting that annual growth will slow to 1.3% in 2019, from 1.4% in 2018, before picking up to 1.5% in 2020. That forecast is based on the assumption that the UK leaves the EU on 31 October with a deal. Without a deal, the UK economy grows by just 0.3% in 2020... Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at currency firm Oanda, puts the latest bitcoin moves into context: The wild ride continues in the world of crypto, with bitcoin brushing off what would be a devastating 24 hours for any other asset, tumbling 25% in that time, to rebound more than 10% at the time of writing. I say this because this market moves so rapidly that it\u2019s probably out of date by the time I\u2019ve finished writing this sentence. When it comes to bitcoin, nothing surprises me so predicting whether we\u2019ll end the day back at new highs for the year or in the red is pointless. What is clear is that the Facebook story has re-energised the space in a remarkable way and reminded us of what we were seeing on a daily basis in late 2017. Suddenly $20,000 isn\u2019t looking too far away but as we learned early last year, $3,000 isn\u2019t either. The rollercoaster that is bitcoin\u2019s price graph continues, having climbed to almost $14,000 this week before lurching to just above $10,000 the next day. Bitcoin received a boost from the news that Facebook is launching is own digital currency, Libra, in 2020 but it hasn\u2019t brought an end to volatile trading. President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, has a chat with President Trump during the G20 summit in Osaka: But the biggest smiles were reserved for Turkey\u2019s President, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan: The mood among investors in Europe has picked up, as traders hope that progress will be made in Osaka tomorrow when the leaders of the world\u2019s two largest economies meet to discuss trade. The latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,425 Germany\u2019s DAX: 0.5% at 12,330 France\u2019s CAC: +0.3% at 5,508 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.3% at 21,170 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.3% at 9,175 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 383 Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, agrees the rise in core inflation will not deter Draghi and his colleagues on the ECB\u2019s governing council: The limited breakdown available shows that core inflation (excluding food, energy, alcohol and tobacco) rose from 0.8% in May to 1.1% in June. While Eurostat does not provide any further breakdown of services prices, the French statistical official attributed much of the increase there to higher transport prices, and state-level data suggest that much of the increase in German inflation was due to higher prices of package holidays and airfares, reflecting the larger number of public holidays in June this year. Much of this may be reversed in July. None of this changes the big picture, which is that underlying price pressures remain well below the ECB\u2019s near-2% target. With the eurozone economy having slowed again in Q2, and business surveys still soft, we think core inflation will remain close to 1% for the foreseeable future. The ECB governing council will therefore signal in late-July that further policy easing is on the way. Although the headline rate of eurozone inflation was steady at 1.2%, core inflation - stripping out volatile energy and food prices - rose to 1.1% in June from 0.8% in May. However, economists said the rise in core inflation will not deter Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, who dropped heavy hints last week that ECB policymakers are ready to pump fresh stimulus into the eurozone economy. Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at the Dutch bank ING: Core inflation has been bouncing around on Easter timing effects and the recovery from 0.8 to 1.1% should more realistically reflect the current underlying inflation environment. Even though wage growth continues to increase at a steady pace, reflecting the improved labour market environment, businesses continue to be reluctant to price through those higher costs to the consumer. The inflation outlook therefore remains sluggish. With energy base effects pushing down the outlook for the coming months, headline inflation will continue to face downward pressures. On top of that, businesses have indicated softer expectations for selling prices on the back of economic uncertainty. The improved core inflation figure will therefore be easily brushed aside in the discussions about fresh ECB action: it\u2019s coming. The eurozone\u2019s annual inflation rate was 1.2% in June, unchanged from May, according to the \u201cflash\u201d estimate from statistics agency Eurostat. The main drivers of inflation were food, alcohol and tobacco, energy and services: Much has been made of the impact of Brexit uncertainty on business investment, as firms delay or redirect spending plans until the picture is clearer. Some good news then in the ONS figures, which showed business investment increased by 0.4% in the first quarter of 2019, compared with the fourth quarter of 2018, to \u00a346.9bn. The biggest contributor to growth was investment in \u201cbuildings and structures\u201d, as well as intellectual property. The rise followed four consecutive quarters of declining business investment. It was still down by 1.5% on an annual basis however. A breakdown of the UK growth figures shows there were some revisions in the detail since the first estimate. Growth in the services sector was revised up to 0.4% from 0.3%, while construction output was revised up to 1.4% from 1%. Production on the other hand was revised down in the second estimate, to 1% growth from 1.4% in the first estimate. All in all it left the headline rate of quarterly growth at 0.5% in Q1. The second estimate of UK growth in the first quarter is out and there the headline numbers are unchanged. The economy grew by 0.5% compared with the previous quarter, and by 1.8% year-on-year according to the Office for National Statistics. Here is a summary from Rob Kent-Smith at the ONS: GDP grew solidly and was unrevised in the first quarter of 2019, with manufacturing seeing strong growth due to orders being brought forward ahead of the UK\u2019s original EU departure date. Household saving has been historically low for 18 months, following a marked drop off in non-pension saving in recent years. A consortium led by the family that controls the Lego toymaking empire is to buy Merlin Entertainments for \u00a35.9bn. The FTSE 250 Merlin counts Legoland, Madame Tussauds waxworks and the London Eye among its assets and shares are up 14% this morning after the deal was announced. Read our full story here: Away from Japan, there have been some major developments in the corporate world. One of the most striking headlines this morning is the decision by Sir Jony Ive, the Apple designer behind the iPhone, to leave the company. Once described by Apple\u2019s founder, the late Steve Jobs, as his \u201cspiritual partner\u201d, Ive\u2019s decision to quit and set up his own firm wiped almost $13bn off the market value of the US tech giant in after-hours trading. The 52-year-old Briton told the FT: While I will not be an employee, I will still be very involved \u2013 I hope for many, many years to come. This just seems like a natural and gentle time to make this change. Over in Osaka, the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, struck an upbeat tone after meeting world leaders. The IMF warned earlier this month that the the tit-for-tat tariffs between the US and China would cost $455bn (\u00a3357.5bn) in lost output next year. Trading in Europe has got off to a fairly quiet start as investors pause to weigh up the potential risks and rewards from tomorrow\u2019s meeting between Trump and Xi: FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,408 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.5% at 12,326 France\u2019s CAC: +0.1% at 5,499 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.1% at 21,093 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.2% at 9,129 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.1% at 383 Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, says that any trade war truce struck between the US and China at the G20 is likely to be short-lived: Trump and Xi will meet tomorrow and may agree to hold off imposing new tariffs for the time being. While this would be a positive outcome for China\u2019s economy and markets in the short-run, any gains will probably prove fleeting with a renewed escalation in trade tensions still likely further down the road. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The meeting of G20 leaders is underway in Osaka, Japan, and there is one question on investor minds: will the meeting between President Trump and President Xi break the deadlock on trade between the US and China? Investors across Asia are clearly not convinced, with markets down across the board. The Shanghai composite and Japan\u2019s Nikkei were both down 0.6%. The lack of optimism was partly fuelled by comments by the US President ahead of the crunch talks, due to take place on Saturday morning. Trump suggested China would be keen to do a deal because its economy was \u201cgoing down the tubes\u201d. Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM, captures the mood among investors: This weekend, markets will find out whether their hopes for a restoration in US-China trade talks will become reality, and whether the scope for further deterioration in bilateral relations would be significantly constrained. It remains to be seen whether the public displays of chest-thumping from both sides since May will eventually lead to handshakes and smiles on Saturday. Such a reconciliatory image out of the Trump-Xi meeting is expected to send relief signals coursing through the veins of the markets, potentially boosting global equities and emerging-market assets. Still, the prudent investor would be well aware that the road ahead isn\u2019t all plain sailing, given the tremendous gulf that still remains between both governments, with tit-for-tat tariffs still in place. As long as the prospects of more trade tariffs loom large over the horizon, risk aversion should continue having a major say on market sentiment.

      "body": "<p><strong>I\u2019m a 19-year-old student in my first year at university</strong><strong>. When I</strong><strong> go</strong><strong> back home I have started to have issues with my family, especially my mother. Looking back, my childhood was quite dysfunctional</strong><strong>: I was the product of a drunken one-night stand, yet my parents stayed together for quite a while. Because of this, my mum had an affair with a work colleague and </strong><strong>thanks to all the tension in the house, both my parents became severely depressed and argumentative.</strong></p> <p><strong>The man she was seeing moved in, but he was controlling</strong><strong> and creepy. My mum later told me that he is on the </strong><strong>sex </strong><strong>offenders register. He eventually moved out and my mum had to find a smaller house.</strong></p> <p><strong>She has become very tearful with me lately because she thinks I am cold towards her. I worry about her becoming depressed again (she\u2019s </strong><strong>been to </strong><strong>her GP to ask to be put back on antidepressants), but I feel so hurt that my instinct is to stay away</strong><strong>. I feel like a terrible human being, but I\u2019m sick of being her emotional crutch.</strong></p> <p><strong>I\u2019m contemplating staying at my university town for as long as possible to have some time away from her, but she</strong><strong> said that when I </strong><strong>left </strong><strong>home</strong><strong> she felt lonely and isolated. It feels selfish, but I\u2019d much rather focus on my degree than have to check </strong><strong>on her. I hate how much repressed anger I feel. I\u2019ve turned into such a judg</strong><strong>mental, aloof person, I doubt many people </strong><strong>at college like me. I wish I could put everything behind me, but I </strong><strong>can\u2019t.</strong></p> <p>It is not uncommon for people to leave home for the first time and look back and think, \u201cWhat the hell was that all about?\u201d Some of the actions of the adults around you were/are indefensible and irresponsible, and your anger is justified and valid.</p> <p>What I see is someone who (in your original letter) blames herself for a lot of things: for your parents staying together; for your mum\u2019s affair; for her sex-offender partner leaving; for her moving to a smaller house; for her being depressed. Stop. None of this is your fault, or your responsibility.</p> <p>But I want you to think about the things you <em>have</em> done: you\u2019ve got into a good university; you are doing a course that is challenging you; you are questioning things. You are not selfish.</p> <p>I talked to Avi Shmueli, a psychoanalyst (<a href=\"https://www.bpc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">bpc.org.uk</a>), who thought you were \u201cinsightful and determined to have a better existence\u201d. He thought your belief that your parents had stayed together because of you gave you a feeling of huge power (although probably unconsciously). It took me a while to understand this comment but then it clicked: if you think your existence has caused something as colossal as two people to stay together, you then feel responsibility for it and everything that follows.</p> <p>And, Shmueli continued, \u201cbecause you feel responsible for your mum\u2019s unhappiness but can\u2019t make her happy, you are hugely angry, but don\u2019t know what to do with that anger, other than blocking it\u201d. The problem is that you can\u2019t choose to suppress only the anger: block one emotion, and you block everything. This is why you probably feel \u201caloof\u201d.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m a 19-year-old student in my first year at university. When I go back home I have started to have issues with my family, especially my mother. Looking back, my childhood was quite dysfunctional: I was the product of a drunken one-night stand, yet my parents stayed together for quite a while. Because of this, my mum had an affair with a work colleague and thanks to all the tension in the house, both my parents became severely depressed and argumentative. The man she was seeing moved in, but he was controlling and creepy. My mum later told me that he is on the sex offenders register. He eventually moved out and my mum had to find a smaller house. She has become very tearful with me lately because she thinks I am cold towards her. I worry about her becoming depressed again (she\u2019s been to her GP to ask to be put back on antidepressants), but I feel so hurt that my instinct is to stay away. I feel like a terrible human being, but I\u2019m sick of being her emotional crutch. I\u2019m contemplating staying at my university town for as long as possible to have some time away from her, but she said that when I left home she felt lonely and isolated. It feels selfish, but I\u2019d much rather focus on my degree than have to check on her. I hate how much repressed anger I feel. I\u2019ve turned into such a judgmental, aloof person, I doubt many people at college like me. I wish I could put everything behind me, but I can\u2019t. It is not uncommon for people to leave home for the first time and look back and think, \u201cWhat the hell was that all about?\u201d Some of the actions of the adults around you were/are indefensible and irresponsible, and your anger is justified and valid. What I see is someone who (in your original letter) blames herself for a lot of things: for your parents staying together; for your mum\u2019s affair; for her sex-offender partner leaving; for her moving to a smaller house; for her being depressed. Stop. None of this is your fault, or your responsibility. But I want you to think about the things you have done: you\u2019ve got into a good university; you are doing a course that is challenging you; you are questioning things. You are not selfish. I talked to Avi Shmueli, a psychoanalyst (bpc.org.uk), who thought you were \u201cinsightful and determined to have a better existence\u201d. He thought your belief that your parents had stayed together because of you gave you a feeling of huge power (although probably unconsciously). It took me a while to understand this comment but then it clicked: if you think your existence has caused something as colossal as two people to stay together, you then feel responsibility for it and everything that follows. And, Shmueli continued, \u201cbecause you feel responsible for your mum\u2019s unhappiness but can\u2019t make her happy, you are hugely angry, but don\u2019t know what to do with that anger, other than blocking it\u201d. The problem is that you can\u2019t choose to suppress only the anger: block one emotion, and you block everything. This is why you probably feel \u201caloof\u201d. It\u2019s a protection mechanism. Shmueli wondered what you thought would happen if you told your mother how you felt? He said that you probably feared destroying your relationship, but that, actually, part of you already feels as if you have done that. You haven\u2019t, of course, but you\u2019ve internalised that guilt. \u201cYou also seem to feel that having any sort of life takes it away from your mother.\u201d It doesn\u2019t. Your instinct to be by yourself is not selfish but self-preserving. Listen to it. Your mother has made her choices. You aren\u2019t as powerful as you think: this sounds like an insult, but it\u2019s an attempt to help you look at things in proportion. What you can do now is accept responsibility for your life.

For Johnson, the figure is -33, down from -18. Anthony Wells, YouGov\u2019s head of political research, said: \u201cIf the Conservatives are looking towards Boris Johnson as a magic election winner, the evidence is simply no longer there.\u201d",

Sabri Lamouchi, a 47-year-old Frenchman who last managed Rennes and took Ivory Coast to the 2014 World Cup, has taken over in a quick turnaround designed to minimise disruption, and the Guardian can reveal everything came to a head for O\u2019Neill, in the first week of pre-season training, because of his poor relationship with a significant number of key players, their failure to embrace the former Republic of Ireland manager and, in some cases, a loss of respect and discipline.</p> <p>Some had made it clear behind the scenes that they did not enjoy working with him and that the atmosphere had deteriorated to the point they held little hope of it being a successful season.</p> <p>Tellingly, a number of those had also complained to the club\u2019s hierarchy about his predecessor, Aitor Karanka, and this has been a recurring theme for Forest during 20 years of drift outside the top division: players turning against the manager and, in O\u2019Neill\u2019s case, the people in charge reluctantly concluding that the damage was irreparable.</p> <p>All of which means no happy ending for O\u2019Neill at the club where he was part of the football miracle that saw Brian Clough take an ordinary team from 13th in the old Second Division to promotion, a league championship and back-to-back European Cup wins.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill\u2019s return to the City Ground certainly made a nice story but the reality is that Forest\u2019s owner, the Greek shipping magnate Evangelos Marinakis, is not the sentimental type.

O\u2019Neill subsequently won seven trophies with Celtic, as well as reaching a Uefa Cup final, and was talked about for a long time as the best qualified man to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United.</p> <p>Instead he went to Aston Villa, with sixth-placed finishes in each of his last three seasons, but he then had a poor spell in the managerial wastelands of Sunderland and five years with the Republic of Ireland that divided opinion.</p> <p>Many Forest players were nonplussed by his appointment and more intrigued by the news that it would mean Roy Keane, someone they knew much more about, joining as assistant. Keane announced last weekend he was leaving the club because he wants to restart his own managerial career. His departure has been a big factor in what has subsequently happened, not least because it sharpened the appetite of the people at the top of the club to get an accurate gauge of the mood of the players. That feedback has been overwhelmingly negative and convinced them to act now even though they know it will invite more criticism of a club that has long been accused of employing managers on a revolving-door policy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>O\u2019Neill made it clear before taking the job that he regarded it as unfair to be branded a \u201cdinosaur\u201d and, to give him his due, he experimented with various formations since inheriting the team. Again, though, the style of play has not always been pleasing on the eye.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill has never been convinced by Jo\u00e3o Carvalho, the club\u2019s \u00a313m record signing who was not in the team or in his best form when the manager was appointed. As such, O\u2019Neill used the Portuguese fleetingly when the vast majority of fans believed he should have been an automatic starter. Many of them had never wanted the club to part company with Karanka either and, from day one, O\u2019Neill was targeted on social media.</p> <p>Although this did not sway the decision, Forest have been taken aback that so many of their younger fans, in particular, have been unsparing about one of the club\u2019s \u201cMiracle Men\u201d. Forest were eighth when O\u2019Neill took over but dropped into mid-table after a four-match losing sequence in April. They ended the season with three successive wins to lift them to ninth but O\u2019Neill has not been embraced in the way that might have been anticipated.</p> <p>As for his critics in the dressing room, they grew to dislike his ideas. There have been complaints that his training methods were uninspiring and that, tactically, the squad were unsure about how he wanted them to play. Over the last week, as he led them on a series of punishing runs, attitudes have hardened. Yet the truth is a nucleus of senior players were unconvinced from the start.</p> <p>There have been several examples of the mood not being as it should. In January, Forest signed a midfielder by the rather optimistic name of Pel\u00e9 on loan from Monaco. Yet O\u2019Neill cut that short when the player, nursing an injury, missed an appointment with the club\u2019s doctor. One first-team player was dropped after reporting so late he missed the team coach. Another key performer \u2013 a player who also fell out with Karanka \u2013 was too loose-lipped on holiday and criticised O\u2019Neill so strongly that it ended up on a supporter\u2019s Facebook account and got back to the club.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill\u2019s sympathisers might legitimately question whether Forest\u2019s squad exist in a culture of excuses, pointing out that Karanka\u2019s methods were also questioned by some of the team and that the same happened to another old favourite, Stuart Pearce, and various others during the churn of managers, post-Clough. Yet it is also true that part of O\u2019Neill\u2019s job was to bring the players together and improve the team, albeit with only an 18-month contract. In that regard, Forest have decided it has not worked out.</p> <p>As a player, O\u2019Neill helped an unheralded club become the champions of Europe and described it as \u201clike getting on a train and never getting off\u201d. As their manager he lasted only 19 games and at the age of 67, it cannot be ruled out that this might end his long and, for the most part, distinguished career.</p>",

Unfortunately for the decision-makers at Forest, it is nearly 25 years since O\u2019Neill had that golden period at Leicester City where he transformed a second-tier side into one that secured four top-10 finishes in the Premier League and reached three League Cup finals, winning two. O\u2019Neill subsequently won seven trophies with Celtic, as well as reaching a Uefa Cup final, and was talked about for a long time as the best qualified man to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United. Instead he went to Aston Villa, with sixth-placed finishes in each of his last three seasons, but he then had a poor spell in the managerial wastelands of Sunderland and five years with the Republic of Ireland that divided opinion. Many Forest players were nonplussed by his appointment and more intrigued by the news that it would mean Roy Keane, someone they knew much more about, joining as assistant. Keane announced last weekend he was leaving the club because he wants to restart his own managerial career. His departure has been a big factor in what has subsequently happened, not least because it sharpened the appetite of the people at the top of the club to get an accurate gauge of the mood of the players. That feedback has been overwhelmingly negative and convinced them to act now even though they know it will invite more criticism of a club that has long been accused of employing managers on a revolving-door policy. O\u2019Neill made it clear before taking the job that he regarded it as unfair to be branded a \u201cdinosaur\u201d and, to give him his due, he experimented with various formations since inheriting the team. Again, though, the style of play has not always been pleasing on the eye. O\u2019Neill has never been convinced by Jo\u00e3o Carvalho, the club\u2019s \u00a313m record signing who was not in the team or in his best form when the manager was appointed. As such, O\u2019Neill used the Portuguese fleetingly when the vast majority of fans believed he should have been an automatic starter. Many of them had never wanted the club to part company with Karanka either and, from day one, O\u2019Neill was targeted on social media. Although this did not sway the decision, Forest have been taken aback that so many of their younger fans, in particular, have been unsparing about one of the club\u2019s \u201cMiracle Men\u201d. Forest were eighth when O\u2019Neill took over but dropped into mid-table after a four-match losing sequence in April. They ended the season with three successive wins to lift them to ninth but O\u2019Neill has not been embraced in the way that might have been anticipated. As for his critics in the dressing room, they grew to dislike his ideas. There have been complaints that his training methods were uninspiring and that, tactically, the squad were unsure about how he wanted them to play. Over the last week, as he led them on a series of punishing runs, attitudes have hardened. Yet the truth is a nucleus of senior players were unconvinced from the start. There have been several examples of the mood not being as it should. In January, Forest signed a midfielder by the rather optimistic name of Pel\u00e9 on loan from Monaco. Yet O\u2019Neill cut that short when the player, nursing an injury, missed an appointment with the club\u2019s doctor. One first-team player was dropped after reporting so late he missed the team coach. Another key performer \u2013 a player who also fell out with Karanka \u2013 was too loose-lipped on holiday and criticised O\u2019Neill so strongly that it ended up on a supporter\u2019s Facebook account and got back to the club. O\u2019Neill\u2019s sympathisers might legitimately question whether Forest\u2019s squad exist in a culture of excuses, pointing out that Karanka\u2019s methods were also questioned by some of the team and that the same happened to another old favourite, Stuart Pearce, and various others during the churn of managers, post-Clough. Yet it is also true that part of O\u2019Neill\u2019s job was to bring the players together and improve the team, albeit with only an 18-month contract. In that regard, Forest have decided it has not worked out. As a player, O\u2019Neill helped an unheralded club become the champions of Europe and described it as \u201clike getting on a train and never getting off\u201d. As their manager he lasted only 19 games and at the age of 67, it cannot be ruled out that this might end his long and, for the most part, distinguished career.",

Yang spoke for just 2.4 minutes during the debate, the shortest time of any candidate, while Biden led at 11.5 minutes, and Harris spoke for 10.8 minutes. Biden is the best-known candidate and has consistently led national and state polls. But he has stumbled in recent weeks. Still, with support from black voters and an appeal to disaffected Democrats in the midwest, Biden believes he can rebuild the multiracial coalition that twice elected Barack Obama, under whom he served as vice-president. Sanders, by contrast, has called for a political revolution, championing progressive policies that would effectively remake the US economy.

The weather in June is usually slightly cooler in Europe, building up to highs later in the summer. However, there was also a June heatwave last year, with prolonged high temperatures across much of the northern hemisphere, accompanied by a drought in many areas.</p> \n<h2>Will it carry on for long?</h2> \n<p>In the UK, temperatures have reached the high 20s in Scotland, Wales and south-west England, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/28/girl-drowns-river-uk-weather-forecast-hotter\">and may top 30C</a> in some parts, according to the Met Office. On Saturday, temperatures will rise further in parts of central and eastern England, with 30C to 34C possible. But a cold front will reach the country on Sunday, lowering temperatures again.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a38f0f29-4edd-426f-9e7f-3706fd5cca1e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Hotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/northern-hemispheres-extreme-heatwave-in-2018-impossible-without-climate-change\">could not have occurred without human-induced climate change</a>\u201d. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was <a href=\"https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/resources/angry-summer-report/\">made at least 50 times more likely by global heating</a>, linking it directly to climate change.</p>\n    <p>Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/27/climate-change-human-fingerprint-found-on-global-extreme-weather\">strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves</a> (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.</p>\n    <p>When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Most of the planet\u2019s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. <a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/another-unprecedented-tropical-cyclone-and-flooding-hits-mozambique\">Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique</a> in March and April. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/global-warming-made-hurricane-harvey-deadly-rains-three-times-more-likely-research-shows\">three times more likely by climate change</a>. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage.</p>\n    <p>Global heating does not influence all extreme weather \u2013 natural variability still exists. <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-climate-change-affects-extreme-weather-around-the-world\">Carbon Brief analysed more than 230 studies</a> and found 95% of heatwaves were made more likely or worse by climate change. For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. It is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Why is it so hot?</h2> \n<p>Warm air is rising across Europe from north Africa, bringing high temperatures right across the continent. The UK has remained cooler, partly as a result of being further from the source of the warm air and partly because of the cooling effects of the North Sea, Met Office experts said.</p> \n<h2>Is this heatwave a result of climate breakdown?</h2> \n<p>It is not possible to pin the current heatwave definitively on climate change, because the weather varies so much naturally. Moreover, the likely effects of climate change are not simple. For example, heavy rain and cloudy weather across swathes of northern Europe, including the UK, are likely to become more common as a result of the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causing the jet stream weather system to become fixed in position.</p> \n<p>However, this year\u2019s weather is certainly in line with the predictions scientists have made of rising temperatures, more heatwaves and prolonged droughts interspersed with periods of heavy flooding in some areas.</p> \n<h2>Shouldn\u2019t we be enjoying it?</h2> \n<p>Heatwaves can have pleasant effects, with long sunny days encouraging people into parks and on to beaches, and they certainly bring a smile to the faces of ice-cream sellers.</p> \n<p>However, the body\u2019s ability to regulate its own temperature is crucial; babies are less well able to regulate their temperature and must be kept in well-ventilated conditions. Older people also lose their regulating abilities as they age and can quickly overheat.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e92bc714a75a94cf874f67f03eebc9fb953ccd2c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e92bc714a75a94cf874f67f03eebc9fb953ccd2c/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An emergency worker takes the blood pressure of a woman suffering from the heat in Tours, France.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An emergency worker takes the blood pressure of a woman suffering from the heat in Tours, France.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guillaume Souvant/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the European heatwave of 2003, there were about 70,000 excess deaths attributed to the long hot spell. People with underlying illnesses can also have problems, and even those who are fit and healthy can experience difficulty sleeping and discomfort, so people are advised to stay hydrated and wear loose clothing at night.</p> \n<h2>Any more gloom?</h2> \n<p>There is the impact on farmers. While warm weather at the right time is crucial for many crops during their growing periods, excessively high temperatures can inhibit growth, particularly if they are prolonged. Livestock can also suffer in the heat and need extra care.</p> \n<p>The problems do not stop there: as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2019/jun/26/europe-heatwave-cities-prepare-to-limit-effects-of-record-temperatures\">Germany\u2019s melting roads</a> have shown, Europe\u2019s infrastructure is not built to cope with such extremes, and adapting it is likely to be expensive and take decades.</p> \n<p>Finally, one of the ironies of the climate emergency is that hot weather encourages greater use of air conditioning, which was cited recently by BP as a key factor in raising greenhouse gas emissions last year.</p> \n<p>But as Greenpeace has pointed out, the deaths in Europe are of a relatively small number compared with the \u201cfar bigger disasters already occurring in hotter, poorer countries in the global South\u201d. In poorer countries with less advanced infrastructure, global heating is likely to bring drought and water stress, making agriculture more difficult if not impossible across large areas of land, leading to food shortages and potentially conflict and mass migration.</p>",

Is this heatwave a result of climate breakdown? It is not possible to pin the current heatwave definitively on climate change, because the weather varies so much naturally. Moreover, the likely effects of climate change are not simple. For example, heavy rain and cloudy weather across swathes of northern Europe, including the UK, are likely to become more common as a result of the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causing the jet stream weather system to become fixed in position. However, this year\u2019s weather is certainly in line with the predictions scientists have made of rising temperatures, more heatwaves and prolonged droughts interspersed with periods of heavy flooding in some areas. Shouldn\u2019t we be enjoying it? Heatwaves can have pleasant effects, with long sunny days encouraging people into parks and on to beaches, and they certainly bring a smile to the faces of ice-cream sellers. However, the body\u2019s ability to regulate its own temperature is crucial; babies are less well able to regulate their temperature and must be kept in well-ventilated conditions. Older people also lose their regulating abilities as they age and can quickly overheat. In the European heatwave of 2003, there were about 70,000 excess deaths attributed to the long hot spell. People with underlying illnesses can also have problems, and even those who are fit and healthy can experience difficulty sleeping and discomfort, so people are advised to stay hydrated and wear loose clothing at night. Any more gloom? There is the impact on farmers. While warm weather at the right time is crucial for many crops during their growing periods, excessively high temperatures can inhibit growth, particularly if they are prolonged. Livestock can also suffer in the heat and need extra care. The problems do not stop there: as Germany\u2019s melting roads have shown, Europe\u2019s infrastructure is not built to cope with such extremes, and adapting it is likely to be expensive and take decades. Finally, one of the ironies of the climate emergency is that hot weather encourages greater use of air conditioning, which was cited recently by BP as a key factor in raising greenhouse gas emissions last year. But as Greenpeace has pointed out, the deaths in Europe are of a relatively small number compared with the \u201cfar bigger disasters already occurring in hotter, poorer countries in the global South\u201d. In poorer countries with less advanced infrastructure, global heating is likely to bring drought and water stress, making agriculture more difficult if not impossible across large areas of land, leading to food shortages and potentially conflict and mass migration.",

In the absence of mass protest there is a level of racialised suffering that rarely exceeds the status of white noise in the west. Not only do we know these things happen and have been happening for a long time; we know they don\u2019t happen by accident, and could be prevented if we, as a society, had the will to do so.

      "bodyText": "On the morning of 17 January 2018 a humanitarian group, No More Deaths, released a report showing how, over four years, US border patrol agents had destroyed 3,856 gallons of water that had been left for migrants in the desert. That afternoon, Scott Warren, a No More Deaths volunteer, was arrested for bringing food, water, bedding and clean clothes to two men who had entered the country illegally. He found them in an area where 32 bodies had been recovered in the previous year alone. Charged with conspiracy to transport and harbour migrants, he faced up to 20 years in prison. Earlier this month his trial ended in a hung jury. Put differently, an American jury was asked whether, in effect, it should be illegal for one human being to provide basic sustenance to preserve the lives of other human beings in desperate need \u2013 and it could not quite make up its mind. (The jury was deadlocked, having split 8-4 in Warren\u2019s favour. The state will decide whether to try him again next week.) So when we see a photograph of the lifeless body of 26-year-old Salvadorean \u00d3scar Alberto Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez, clutching his dead 23-month-old daughter, Angie Valeria, face down in the Rio Grande, it is important to decipher exactly what the source of the shock might be. As Warren\u2019s case illustrates, such deaths are not news in the conventional sense, any more than the police shooting black men in the street in the US is \u201cnews\u201d. In the absence of mass protest there is a level of racialised suffering that rarely exceeds the status of white noise in the west. Not only do we know these things happen and have been happening for a long time; we know they don\u2019t happen by accident, and could be prevented if we, as a society, had the will to do so. There is pathos in the suffering, but there is policy behind it too. The tragic image is news because the basic humanity of those who perish has been so routinely denied that the evidence that they are not \u201ccockroaches\u201d, \u201canimals\u201d, \u201caliens\u201d, \u201cillegals\u201d, rats or vermin but actual people feels genuinely novel \u2013 it provides an empathic injection into the morally sclerotic vein of a dehumanised political culture. This was a father and daughter, holding on to each other until the very end: tender, vulnerable, heartbreaking. In a sense this is the problem. If for the stories of their lives to break through in the mainstream they must first be dead, what use is it to them? The fact that they are objects of pity, shame or even anger does not make them any less objects ripe for our projection. Empathy could be the first step to solidarity \u2013 click, share, engage.

In more recent years another march, for greater <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/jun/20/american-family-trans-gender-queer-nonbinary\">transgender</a> rights, has also taken place in June.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe fundraise in the community and we\u2019ve been an alternative space for 27 years,\u201d said Alex Tereshonkova, an organizer of the lesbian march, adding: \u201cI just don\u2019t think there\u2019s a place for Heritage of Pride any more.\u201d</p> \n<p>Undaunted, Heritage of Pride is putting on 25 events, with singer Grace Jones headlining one party and Melissa Etheridge another that she described in a statement as promising \u201ca truly momentous evening of love, pride and community\u201d.</p> \n<p>The official Pride parade always begins with dozens of leather-clad lesbians of all shapes, colors and ages roaring ahead of the glitzy floats on their motorcycles, in the traditional \u201cdykes on bikes\u201d display.

      "bodyText": "One will be a parade with glitter, go-go dancers, corporate floats blasting disco music and hundreds of thousands of people, flanked by cops and barricades. The other will be a protest featuring homemade banners, political chanting, an old-fashioned rally in the park, volunteer security guards (and glitter, though less of it). The fact that both Pride marches will be traveling in opposite directions through New York City on Sunday while marking the same occasion \u2013 the 50th anniversary of the uprising at the Stonewall Inn in 1969 that sparked the modern gay rights movement \u2013 is as much a metaphor for a clash of ideas as it is a logistical fact. This year what will probably be the biggest queer celebration in New York City history will consist of dueling marches \u2013 the gigantic, official annual Pride march with all the celebratory floats, fueled by big business sponsors and a breakaway march designed to be a grassroots protest not only for the cause of civil rights but against the over-corporatization of the main parade. The bigger parade, titled Heritage of Pride Parade, will carouse from uptown to downtown Manhattan and combines its celebration with World Pride, the international LGBTQ event hosted by a different country each year. Organizers expect up to 4 million people to descend on the city for this month\u2019s Pride events, culminating this weekend. The rival, bare bones Reclaim Pride event will stomp the route of the original march for queer rights that evolved out of the rebellion against a police raid on the city\u2019s Stonewall Inn in 1969 \u2013 and will go from that downtown bar, which still operates and was made a national monument by Barack Obama, uptown to Central Park. \u201cThe annual Pride parade has become a bloated, over-policed circuit party, stuffed with 150 corporate floats. This does not represent the \u2018spirit of Stonewall\u2019 on this 50th anniversary year,\u201d a statement from the Reclaim Pride Coalition organizers said. The statement added that the event did not address the urgent continuing needs of the queer community \u201cstill under daily attack by the Trump administration and in countries around the world\u201d. Organizers have called the alternative event the inaugural Queer Liberation March. It intends to shun policing by the New York City police department and instead provide its own security via volunteer marshals. \u201cIt\u2019s a clash of values. What happened at Stonewall in 1969 changed my life and we\u2019re going to take that spirit into this new century. There\u2019ll be no sponsors, no uniformed police, no floats,\u201d said Bill Dobbs, an organizer of the Queer Liberation March. Leaders of Heritage of Pride and the Reclaim Pride Coalition had held talks about changes to the official annual event. But they were unable to agree on a compromise, said Dobbs. The Queer Liberation March plans to hew closer to the model of the annual lesbian march, which traditionally takes place on the last Saturday in June, the day before the official Pride parade. \u201cWhen I look at the dyke march I see an amazing, radiant swath of women, it\u2019s just fantastic,\u201d said Dobbs. The lesbian, or self-described dyke march, has always been a breakaway, unofficial march that differentiated itself from the Pride parade by being a more political, unsponsored hybrid between celebration and demonstration. In more recent years another march, for greater transgender rights, has also taken place in June. \u201cWe fundraise in the community and we\u2019ve been an alternative space for 27 years,\u201d said Alex Tereshonkova, an organizer of the lesbian march, adding: \u201cI just don\u2019t think there\u2019s a place for Heritage of Pride any more.\u201d Undaunted, Heritage of Pride is putting on 25 events, with singer Grace Jones headlining one party and Melissa Etheridge another that she described in a statement as promising \u201ca truly momentous evening of love, pride and community\u201d. The official Pride parade always begins with dozens of leather-clad lesbians of all shapes, colors and ages roaring ahead of the glitzy floats on their motorcycles, in the traditional \u201cdykes on bikes\u201d display. And official Pride parade \u201cgrand marshals\u201d are people or organizations known for campaigning for LGBTQ equality, such as Billie Jean King and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). New York drag queen, performance artist and DJ Lady Bunny said she plans to attend both the official Pride parade and the Reclaim Pride march. She will be on a float at one and speak at the rally at the other. In the mid-80s she started the Wigstock drag queen festival in the city\u2019s Tompkins Square Park as a pointed and \u201cgritty\u201d alternative to what she saw as the already too-conventional annual Pride march in Greenwich Village. \u201cThe parade has become more and more corporate as the years have gone on,\u201d she said, noting ironically that \u201cback in the day most companies wanted nothing to do with us\u201d. Meanwhile Open Secrets, part of the Center for Responsive Politics research group, has accused some companies publicly supporting Pride while also donating via political action committees to members of Congress who oppose the Equality Act, legislation that aims to outlaw discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing and other services.",

Mozart did not cast Cherubino as a boy \u2026 but I think Mozart would have been intensely amused and would smile and have a really good chortle at the idea of Justin singing Cherubino.\u201d Kim, who is making his Covent Garden debut, has played the role previously, something he described as \u201ca very good entry-level experience\u201d for getting to know the character. \u201cIt is a great honour and I\u2019m very humbled by being able to bring this character to life as a man and perhaps show a side of Cherubino which people don\u2019t often get to see \u2026 like the more masculine side which is not necessarily fabricated, it\u2019s actually driven by testosterone.\u201d Cherubino is one of opera\u2019s most famous \u201ctrouser roles\u201d, a young male character played by a woman whose voice could convey youthful exuberance. In recent years there has been a trend towards countertenors being cast in the roles \u2013 a joy for Kim, who remembers auditioning for opera courses about seven years ago and being told he should not have them in his repertoire. \u201cI had many people tell me that my repertoire choices were completely wrong because these roles were not being cast with men. That just because I can sing it, it doesn\u2019t mean I should have it in my repertoire. Those were the exact words given to me. Since then I\u2019ve sung four of them on stage.\u201d Kim, who grew up in Chicago, said performing at Covent Garden was a dream and that opportunities for countertenors had come a long way. \u201cThe possibilities are endless and I\u2019m very lucky to be living in a time when people are willing to see a male singer singing Cherubino.\u201d McVicar\u2019s much-loved The Marriage of Figaro is getting its sixth revival since its premiere at Covent Garden in 2006 with a cast including Christian Gerhaher as Figaro, Jo\u00e9lle Harvey as Susanna, Simon Keenlyside as Count Almaviva and Julia Kleiter as Countess Almaviva, the object of Cherubino\u2019s infatuation.",

At home, she filmed with her teenage son as they came to terms with how single-parent family life was transformed by a year of living with cancer. Victoria documents cancer from a patient\u2019s point of view, exploring what we can and what we can\u2019t control when our bodies fail us. \u201cWe have made cancer our enemy, a dark force to be fought by a relentlessly upbeat attitude,\u201d she says. The Waiting Room is the antidote to what she perceives as the \u201ctyranny of positive thinking. It challenges the cultural myths that surround the disease and puts the language of illness under the microscope. Victoria\u2019s previous short documentary, Missed Call, also made using mobile phones, won a Bafta for best short-form programme in May. She is a writer, artist and director who has been experimenting with the frontiers of documentary and creative technology for the last two decades. She wrote and directed Smart Hearts, Channel 4\u2019s first interactive documentary series in 1999, in which webcams streamed live from the subjects\u2019 homes for over 18 months. She also wrote and directed TEXT ME in 2014, an award winning interactive arts project which created an evolving and living archive in which users are encouraged to collect, curate and share stories from their digital past. The Waiting Room is accompanied by a VR Project that delves even deeper into the experience of living with cancer. Coming up: Crannog Although Alexis has a life-threatening disease, she provides palliative care for animals. Crannog follows Alexis as she tirelessly tries to nurse a neglected sheep back to health. A quiet reflection on kindness in the face of death, the film intimately explores the fragility and strength that comes from dedicating your life to the care of others. Out in July Guardian documentaries screening We return to Bertha Dochouse on 17 July for a series of our films including Q&amp;As with some of the filmmakers. We\u2019ll be showing four films, including a sneak preview of our new documentary, Share, before its launch on the Guardian soon after. Share follows an 18-year-old Instagram influencer as he attempts to reconcile his identity online with his identity in real life by coming out to his parents as gay.",

He told Shortlist in 2013 he was \u201csick of fucking idiots saying I can\u2019t sing\u201d.

NG told Vulture in 2015 he\u2019d reform Oasis for \u201chalf a billion\u201d. He never said half a billion what, though. Smarties? Grains of sand? I have a whip round, and send Noel a tweet. \u201cI know it\u2019s not half a billion, but I\u2019ve got \u00a39.73p here.\u201d No reply.</p> <p><strong>7pm: the big audition <br></strong>I\u2019m ready.

A film about Creation Records\u2019 Alan McGee is being made: Nick Moran, Irvine Welsh and Danny Boyle are behind it, with Ewen Bremner as McGee. They have put out an open casting call for the young Liam, and all you have to do is upload footage of yourself reading the script from ITV\u2019s 1994 doc With Oasis. It\u2019s my time to shiiine. So, how best prepare? I need to think like Liam. Swagger like Liam. Live like Liam. 5.30am: go for a run Who gets up at this time apart from birds and postal workers? Rock stars. \u201cI get up at half five every morning,\u201d Liam told Beats 1 in 2017, \u201celse everyone\u2019s going: \u2018When are Oasis getting back together?\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m doing a fucking press-up here, mate.\u2019\u201d What\u2019s the Gallagher regime? \u201cI run for about an hour. Up hills, down hills. I ain\u2019t got one of them silly watches and I don\u2019t listen to music,\u201d Liam told Radio X. I last 12 minutes before keeling over with heat exhaustion. Shouldn\u2019t have worn that parka. 11am: vocal training Liam told Absolute Radio in 2011 he doesn\u2019t do vocal warm-ups because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to sound like Chris Martin\u201d. He told Shortlist in 2013 he was \u201csick of fucking idiots saying I can\u2019t sing\u201d. In 2017, he tweeted: \u201cTo all you NG fanboys, I can and will sing any song he wrote bigger, better than him, even if I was kicked in the bollox by a wood pigeon.\u201d Liam\u2019s voice is different these days \u2013 more from his diaphragm than his throat \u2013 but it takes a fair bit of vocal power to muster an acerbic enough \u201cnice one\u201d. 3pm: get the band back together In 2018, bookies slashed odds of Oasis re-forming to 3/1 after Liam tweeted: \u201cI forgive you, let\u2019s get the BIG O back together and stop fucking about LG x\u201d. It didn\u2019t happen. In 2018, NG told Radio X he\u2019s rather \u201cgo busking\u201d than re-form Oasis. But everyone\u2019s got a price. NG told Vulture in 2015 he\u2019d reform Oasis for \u201chalf a billion\u201d. He never said half a billion what, though. Smarties? Grains of sand? I have a whip round, and send Noel a tweet. \u201cI know it\u2019s not half a billion, but I\u2019ve got \u00a39.73p here.\u201d No reply. 7pm: the big audition I\u2019m ready. All I have to do is read: \u201cI\u2019m not into slapping anyone around \u2026 But there\u2019s days when I\u2019ve needed a slap \u2026 And there\u2019s days he\u2019s needed a slap \u2026\u201d It\u2019s hardly Shakespeare. It\u2019s not even Shaun Ryder, the WB Yeats of Madchester according to Tony Wilson. Imagine keeping this up for a whole film. I press send and unzip my parka. I\u2019ll let you know if I hear back.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>It seems a bit much for Harry and Meghan to ask the rest of us to stump up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/25/harry-and-meghans-new-home-cost-taxpayer-24m\">\u00a32.4m towards their new home</a> in Windsor. After all, it\u2019s not as if either of them are particularly hard up. Harry has plenty of family money and Meghan must be doing just fine out of royalties from Suits. But if they are having a cashflow crisis and are struggling to live within their means then you\u2019d have imagined that the Bank of Granny and Grandad might have been able to help them out with an interest-free loan. Now I don\u2019t suppose I will miss the 6p or so I will be contributing towards their home improvements \u2013 I feel rather more strongly about the \u00a345 that Chris Grayling has personally cost me with his \u00a33bn waste of public money \u2013 but it just feels cheap. Like those MPs who charged things to their expenses that were nothing to do with their jobs and which they could easily have afforded anyway. But what struck me as much as the money was that the royal couple have had five houses converted into one home. How much space do Harry and Meghan need? When the property supply is limited and there are plenty of young couples who don\u2019t even have a one-bedroom flat, for a family of three to remove five homes from the country\u2019s housing stock at the taxpayer\u2019s expense seems like a bad misjudgment.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>The<strong> </strong>Boris Johnson campaign appears unstoppable with opinion polls of Conservative voters giving him a two-to-one lead over Jeremy Hunt. Yet the closer Johnson gets to No 10, the more tenuous his relationship with the truth appears to get. After wisely being kept away from the media by the carers on his team, Johnson broke cover to appear on Nick Ferrari\u2019s show on LBC radio. He was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/bumbling-boris-johnson-takes-to-airwaves-to-lie-lie-and-lie-again\">asked more than 20 times</a> when the Mills and Boon photo of him and Carrie Symonds looking lovingly into each others\u2019 eyes had been taken and each time he was unable to answer. Nor could he explain how, if the photo had been taken at the weekend, his hair had managed to grow by a couple of inches in two days. An hour later, Johnson moved on to his second car-crash interview of the day, this time with Ross Kempsell on TalkSport. Asked how he chose to relax, he replied that he built <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/mesmerising-boris-johnsons-bizarre-model-buses-claim-raises-eyebrows\">buses out of cardboard boxes</a> and painted them with happy, smiling faces enjoying the ride. It was such an obvious and unnecessary lie. If he\u2019d just said he liked to do a bit of painting, he might have been believed and the question and answer quickly forgotten. Some think this was a deliberate dead cat misdirection strategy, but I think he just couldn\u2019t help himself. The past and the future never were of great importance to him but now he has even lost touch with the present. His narcissistic personality disorder means he is capable of telling people only what they want to hear. And soon he will be running the country. Terrifying.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>There were only about 100 Conservative MPs in the Commons to watch Theresa May take one of her last <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/may-defends-record-of-boris-johnson-and-jeremy-hunt-at-pmqs\">prime minister\u2019s questions</a>. She has become a non-person, with little attention being paid to what she says or does. All eyes in Westminster are on the Tory leadership contest and the divisions within the Labour party. Just after May resigned, her body was contorted as if she was overwhelmed with grief and anger. Now she appears to be more resigned to her fate \u2013 almost demob happy \u2013 and looking forward to watching her successor fail. She has said she hopes to spend her spare time watching more cricket. Assuming she is an England supporter, I would strongly advise her to wait until after the World Cup is over. Since the tournament started, they have gone from favourites for the trophy to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/26/eoin-morgan-ultimate-test-england-cricket-world-cup\">long-shots to make the semi-finals</a>. England don\u2019t appear to have realised that one of the main points of hosting the World Cup is to tailor the pitches to your own advantage, and the last few games in particular have been painful viewing as the team have found brainless new ways to lose games they could have won. It\u2019s all been horribly reminiscent of watching Spurs. Only I had been hoping to have a few months off perpetual sport anxiety. Ah well, the emeritus prime minister and I can always enjoy the Women\u2019s World Cup, as the women are making <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/27/norway-england-womens-world-cup-quarter-final-match-report\">rather a better fist of it</a> than the men. There again, having both May and me fully behind them will probably be the kiss of death for England in the semi-final. That just leaves the Ashes. What could possibly go wrong?</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>Three years ago when the Brexit department was first established, its departmental questions used to guarantee an almost full house in the Commons. Now, though, everyone has come to realise that the Brexit department is essentially the Potemkin department. It has long been sidelined from the Brexit negotiations and serves no useful purpose other than as a distraction. It exists in order to be seen to exist. As a result, almost no one bothers to attend Brexit questions now, so today\u2019s exchanges between the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, and his opposite number, Keir Starmer, went almost unnoticed. Which was a shame as they were particularly revealing. Starmer asked Barclay to correct three misleading statements that Boris Johnson has regularly used to explain his plan to deliver Brexit. Barclay mumbled something noncommittal and sat down. No surprises there. But what was really telling was that he then spontaneously burst out laughing. Just like a guilty child whose subconscious couldn\u2019t quite believe he had got away with it. This was the whole Tory leadership campaign in miniature. Every Tory MP \u2013 well, the saner ones anyway \u2013 knows that Johnson doesn\u2019t have a credible Brexit plan and that we\u2019re <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/27/boris-johnson-refuses-rule-out-forcing-through-no-deal-brexit\">heading for no deal</a> unless he enrages the ERG and does the opposite of what he has promised, but almost no one calls him out. The need to keep the Tories in power outweighs the national interest. It was much the same at the utterly dispiriting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/27/in-bournemouth-boris-buoys-up-his-audience-with-bulldog-spirit\">hustings in Bournemouth</a> in the evening where Johnson was allowed to tell lie after lie unchallenged. What a time to be alive.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>As someone who doesn\u2019t like camping, doesn\u2019t take drugs, doesn\u2019t like staying up late, gets anxious in large crowds and is far happier listening to opera, it probably won\u2019t surprise you to know that I won\u2019t be going to Glastonbury this weekend. I did once go for a day as an experiment and had to beetle off midway through the afternoon as my psyche wasn\u2019t up to the beating it was taking. But fair play to all those more resilient types, including some of my friends, for whom it is one of the highlights of the year. Instead my wife and I, along with our daughter and her husband who are over the US, will be heading to Brighton to see our son and his girlfriend. Hard to believe but it will be the first occasion we have all been together as a family since last December. The longest we have ever been apart. It will be a precious weekend, though I do feel my age. When the kids were young I would sometimes long for the moment when they wouldn\u2019t be around so much and I would get more time for myself.

I am immensely proud of the people they have become and the lives they have made for themselves, and there is a certain relief that they could now cope perfectly well on their own. But I can\u2019t help feeling that I have morphed into an elderly family pet. Something to be patted and indulged from time to time, but basically ignored.

      "bodyText": "Monday It seems a bit much for Harry and Meghan to ask the rest of us to stump up \u00a32.4m towards their new home in Windsor. After all, it\u2019s not as if either of them are particularly hard up. Harry has plenty of family money and Meghan must be doing just fine out of royalties from Suits. But if they are having a cashflow crisis and are struggling to live within their means then you\u2019d have imagined that the Bank of Granny and Grandad might have been able to help them out with an interest-free loan. Now I don\u2019t suppose I will miss the 6p or so I will be contributing towards their home improvements \u2013 I feel rather more strongly about the \u00a345 that Chris Grayling has personally cost me with his \u00a33bn waste of public money \u2013 but it just feels cheap. Like those MPs who charged things to their expenses that were nothing to do with their jobs and which they could easily have afforded anyway. But what struck me as much as the money was that the royal couple have had five houses converted into one home. How much space do Harry and Meghan need? When the property supply is limited and there are plenty of young couples who don\u2019t even have a one-bedroom flat, for a family of three to remove five homes from the country\u2019s housing stock at the taxpayer\u2019s expense seems like a bad misjudgment. Tuesday The Boris Johnson campaign appears unstoppable with opinion polls of Conservative voters giving him a two-to-one lead over Jeremy Hunt. Yet the closer Johnson gets to No 10, the more tenuous his relationship with the truth appears to get. After wisely being kept away from the media by the carers on his team, Johnson broke cover to appear on Nick Ferrari\u2019s show on LBC radio. He was asked more than 20 times when the Mills and Boon photo of him and Carrie Symonds looking lovingly into each others\u2019 eyes had been taken and each time he was unable to answer. Nor could he explain how, if the photo had been taken at the weekend, his hair had managed to grow by a couple of inches in two days. An hour later, Johnson moved on to his second car-crash interview of the day, this time with Ross Kempsell on TalkSport. Asked how he chose to relax, he replied that he built buses out of cardboard boxes and painted them with happy, smiling faces enjoying the ride. It was such an obvious and unnecessary lie. If he\u2019d just said he liked to do a bit of painting, he might have been believed and the question and answer quickly forgotten. Some think this was a deliberate dead cat misdirection strategy, but I think he just couldn\u2019t help himself. The past and the future never were of great importance to him but now he has even lost touch with the present. His narcissistic personality disorder means he is capable of telling people only what they want to hear. And soon he will be running the country. Terrifying. Wednesday There were only about 100 Conservative MPs in the Commons to watch Theresa May take one of her last prime minister\u2019s questions. She has become a non-person, with little attention being paid to what she says or does. All eyes in Westminster are on the Tory leadership contest and the divisions within the Labour party. Just after May resigned, her body was contorted as if she was overwhelmed with grief and anger. Now she appears to be more resigned to her fate \u2013 almost demob happy \u2013 and looking forward to watching her successor fail. She has said she hopes to spend her spare time watching more cricket. Assuming she is an England supporter, I would strongly advise her to wait until after the World Cup is over. Since the tournament started, they have gone from favourites for the trophy to long-shots to make the semi-finals. England don\u2019t appear to have realised that one of the main points of hosting the World Cup is to tailor the pitches to your own advantage, and the last few games in particular have been painful viewing as the team have found brainless new ways to lose games they could have won. It\u2019s all been horribly reminiscent of watching Spurs. Only I had been hoping to have a few months off perpetual sport anxiety. Ah well, the emeritus prime minister and I can always enjoy the Women\u2019s World Cup, as the women are making rather a better fist of it than the men. There again, having both May and me fully behind them will probably be the kiss of death for England in the semi-final. That just leaves the Ashes. What could possibly go wrong? Thursday Three years ago when the Brexit department was first established, its departmental questions used to guarantee an almost full house in the Commons. Now, though, everyone has come to realise that the Brexit department is essentially the Potemkin department. It has long been sidelined from the Brexit negotiations and serves no useful purpose other than as a distraction. It exists in order to be seen to exist. As a result, almost no one bothers to attend Brexit questions now, so today\u2019s exchanges between the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, and his opposite number, Keir Starmer, went almost unnoticed. Which was a shame as they were particularly revealing. Starmer asked Barclay to correct three misleading statements that Boris Johnson has regularly used to explain his plan to deliver Brexit. Barclay mumbled something noncommittal and sat down. No surprises there. But what was really telling was that he then spontaneously burst out laughing. Just like a guilty child whose subconscious couldn\u2019t quite believe he had got away with it. This was the whole Tory leadership campaign in miniature. Every Tory MP \u2013 well, the saner ones anyway \u2013 knows that Johnson doesn\u2019t have a credible Brexit plan and that we\u2019re heading for no deal unless he enrages the ERG and does the opposite of what he has promised, but almost no one calls him out. The need to keep the Tories in power outweighs the national interest. It was much the same at the utterly dispiriting hustings in Bournemouth in the evening where Johnson was allowed to tell lie after lie unchallenged. What a time to be alive. Friday As someone who doesn\u2019t like camping, doesn\u2019t take drugs, doesn\u2019t like staying up late, gets anxious in large crowds and is far happier listening to opera, it probably won\u2019t surprise you to know that I won\u2019t be going to Glastonbury this weekend. I did once go for a day as an experiment and had to beetle off midway through the afternoon as my psyche wasn\u2019t up to the beating it was taking. But fair play to all those more resilient types, including some of my friends, for whom it is one of the highlights of the year.

But after the Pharaohs captain, Ahmed Elmohamady, and Salah were among the players to express their solidarity with Warda following Egypt\u2019s group stage victory over DR Congo, the Egyptian Football Association confirmed on Friday that the 25-year-old, who spent last season on loan to Atromitos from their fellow Greek Super League side PAOK, will now be allowed to return to the squad after their final group stage match against Uganda on Sunday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/27/africa-cup-of-nations-madagascar-burundi-senegal-algeria-kenya-tanzania\">Africa Cup of Nations: Algeria see off Senegal, Kenya edge Tanzania in thriller</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201c[President] Hani Abu Reda praised the spirit of solidarity between the players and their desire to pardon their colleague Amr Warda and to lift the suspension from him and their commitment to any decision issued by the Football Association in this regard,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.efa.com.eg/NewsDetails?k1=P8ZtT+zL+7eaUWwXnyrSnA==\" title=\"\">read a statement</a> on the EFA\u2019s website. \u201cHe decided to reduce the penalty of suspension until the end of the first round of the tournament only. Abu Reda assured the players of his demand and the demand of all of them to continue this solidarity between them and reflected on their performance in the stadium to delight their fans and the people of Egypt.\u201d</p> <p>Warda posted a video on Facebook on Thursday where he apologised to his family, his teammates, to the EFA and to \u201canyone who is upset at me or anyone I have upset\u201d. Yet it is the intervention of Salah \u2013 who helped Liverpool to win a sixth Champions League title this month \u2013 which appears to have swayed their decision to recall him.

Those things are and must remain sacred,\u201d wrote Salah before adding: \u201cI also believe that many who make mistakes can change for the better and shouldn\u2019t be sent straight to the guillotine, which is the easiest way out.

A comment attributed to three players including Aston Villa\u2019s Elmohamady described the leaking of the messages sent by Warda as a \u201cmalicious plot, especially that the player is very committed during the camp\u201d.</p> <p>However the statement was later removed, with the EFA publishing a disclaimer that claimed it had been \u201ca mistake\u201d. \u201cThe Egyptian Football Federation confirms that the players of the national team did not make any press statements, and what was published by some of them on the official website of the union was a mistake.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Liverpool\u2019s Naby Ke\u00efta will miss Guinea\u2019s final group stage match at Afcon after sustaining thigh and shin injuries in their defeat to Nigeria on Wednesday. The news is unlikely to go down well with his club after the midfielder was rushed back from the adductor injury he sustained at the start of May. After Ke\u00efta was initially ruled out of the tournament by J\u00fcrgen Klopp, the Guinea coach, Paul Put, admitted he had put \u201ca lot of pressure\u201d on Liverpool to participate in the tournament.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Amr Warda\u2019s expulsion from Egypt\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations squad for alleged sexual harassment of several women online has been overturned following the intervention of several of his team-mates, including Liverpool\u2019s Mohamed Salah. The midfielder was booted out on Wednesday after a British-Egyptian model shared screenshots showing a series of inappropriate messages apparently sent by Warda via Whatsapp and Instagram. But after the Pharaohs captain, Ahmed Elmohamady, and Salah were among the players to express their solidarity with Warda following Egypt\u2019s group stage victory over DR Congo, the Egyptian Football Association confirmed on Friday that the 25-year-old, who spent last season on loan to Atromitos from their fellow Greek Super League side PAOK, will now be allowed to return to the squad after their final group stage match against Uganda on Sunday. \u201c[President] Hani Abu Reda praised the spirit of solidarity between the players and their desire to pardon their colleague Amr Warda and to lift the suspension from him and their commitment to any decision issued by the Football Association in this regard,\u201d read a statement on the EFA\u2019s website. \u201cHe decided to reduce the penalty of suspension until the end of the first round of the tournament only. Abu Reda assured the players of his demand and the demand of all of them to continue this solidarity between them and reflected on their performance in the stadium to delight their fans and the people of Egypt.\u201d Warda posted a video on Facebook on Thursday where he apologised to his family, his teammates, to the EFA and to \u201canyone who is upset at me or anyone I have upset\u201d. Yet it is the intervention of Salah \u2013 who helped Liverpool to win a sixth Champions League title this month \u2013 which appears to have swayed their decision to recall him. Despite having stated in an interview with Time magazine in April that he hoped to help change attitudes of men in his country and across the Muslim world to \u201ctreat women with more respect\u201d, the forward tweeted his support for Warda after the win over DRC. \u201cWomen must be treated with the utmost respect. \u2018No\u2019 means \u2018no\u2019. Those things are and must remain sacred,\u201d wrote Salah before adding: \u201cI also believe that many who make mistakes can change for the better and shouldn\u2019t be sent straight to the guillotine, which is the easiest way out. We need to believe in second chances\u2026 we need to guide and educate. Shunning is not the answer.\u201d Some Egyptian supporters are now considering boycotting the national team, with a hashtag urging fans to stay away because of Warda\u2019s recall trending on social media on Friday. The EFA later released a statement which quoted Salah as saying his teammate had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d but said that \u201cWarda\u2019s future has to be saved\u201d. A comment attributed to three players including Aston Villa\u2019s Elmohamady described the leaking of the messages sent by Warda as a \u201cmalicious plot, especially that the player is very committed during the camp\u201d. However the statement was later removed, with the EFA publishing a disclaimer that claimed it had been \u201ca mistake\u201d. \u201cThe Egyptian Football Federation confirms that the players of the national team did not make any press statements, and what was published by some of them on the official website of the union was a mistake.\u201d Meanwhile, Liverpool\u2019s Naby Ke\u00efta will miss Guinea\u2019s final group stage match at Afcon after sustaining thigh and shin injuries in their defeat to Nigeria on Wednesday. The news is unlikely to go down well with his club after the midfielder was rushed back from the adductor injury he sustained at the start of May. After Ke\u00efta was initially ruled out of the tournament by J\u00fcrgen Klopp, the Guinea coach, Paul Put, admitted he had put \u201ca lot of pressure\u201d on Liverpool to participate in the tournament.",

When asked by a reporter whether he would challenge Putin over interfering in elections, the US president turned to his counterpart, wagged his finger and said: \u201cDon\u2019t meddle in the election, president.\u201d The pair laughed. May is also meeting the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, at the two-day summit in Japan. It is one of May\u2019s final outings on the world stage, before she hands over the keys to 10 Downing Street to either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt next month.",

The bodies of \u00d3scar Mart\u00ednez, 26, and his 23-month-old daughter, Valeria, have been repatriated to El Salvador, two days after a shocking photograph of the pair lying drowned in the Rio Grande fuelled a fresh outcry over the migration crisis.

Well, despite today\u2019s mood of crisis, pessimism, alarm and antagonism, the semicentennial 2019 edition would probably be pretty upbeat. In the 50 years since we landed on the moon (and since I was born) progress down here on Earth has been stellar. We\u2019ve made remarkable advances in tackling poverty and child mortality, as the world\u2019s economy has grown more than thirtyfold since the giant leap for mankind. When it comes to public health, we\u2019ve either eradicated (smallpox) or driven back (guinea worm, polio, malaria, sleeping sickness) a whole textbook of diseases, and fought back strongly against some of the most deadliest of all, including HIV and cancer. (This week, Sarah Boseley discovered great hope for the battle against cervical cancer). We have more people in work than ever \u2013 and despite current pangs, democracy is still winning as a numbers game, with more people voting in elections in 2019 than at any point in history. And while we\u2019re comparing 2019 with 1969, the festival scene has come a long way since Woodstock, and is now probably greener than ever. Of course there are challenges. There always have been. Humanity has doubled in number since 1969 (when I was born there were 3.528 billion people alive \u2013 check your number here.) We are overusing resources, leading to big environmental and biodiversity crises. Yet since 1969 we have learned to harness energy from sun, moon and wind. (This week, Oliver Milman reported that the US generated more electricity from renewables than from coal for the first time). We are an ageing species \u2013 more than 1 billion of us are over 60. But we are ingenious too, for ever thinking up new ways to face down this challenge. Of course, there\u2019s still Trump, Brexit, Iran, Johnson, Hong Kong, Putin, austerity.

Back then, Macfadyen\u2019s Bruce was trouncing the English at the battle of Bannockburn, a decisive rout in 1314. This film rolls back the action to 1306, after the death of Wallace but with that key clash still in the future; confusingly Macfadyen\u2019s Bruce is 20 years older here, a man in his 50s.</p> <p>The story opens with Bruce slaying rival John Comyn (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/01/jared-harris-chernobyl-the-crown-mad-men-richard\">Jared Harris</a>, who\u2019s not in it nearly enough), an act that makes him an outlaw. After some jerky crosscutting and considerable longueurs, he ends up wounded and in the care of widow Morag (Anna Hutchinson, quite good) and her three children, a family hitherto more allied with the English.</p> <p>Even though this was directed by Australian Richard Gray, features numerous American actors attempting Scottish accents with varying degrees of success and, most scandalous of all, was shot mostly in Montana, this is a thoughtful, well-meaning crack at historical drama. It takes a good hour or so to get going, but then it builds up some watchable spectacle \u2013 although Gray goes way overboard with the moody, fireside lighting, and the rousing orchestral score gets all ceilidh-cutesy for the happy montages. Pandering to Scottish sentimentality over this period in history, it should find its audience locally but is unlikely to reproduce Braveheart\u2019s international success.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOgI7TAA3H4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TOgI7TAA3H4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

      "bodyText": "This sort-of-but-not-quite sequel to Braveheart stars Angus Macfadyen as the titular medieval Scottish king, a role he played in Mel Gibson\u2019s 1995 film about William Wallace. Back then, Macfadyen\u2019s Bruce was trouncing the English at the battle of Bannockburn, a decisive rout in 1314. This film rolls back the action to 1306, after the death of Wallace but with that key clash still in the future; confusingly Macfadyen\u2019s Bruce is 20 years older here, a man in his 50s. The story opens with Bruce slaying rival John Comyn (Jared Harris, who\u2019s not in it nearly enough), an act that makes him an outlaw. After some jerky crosscutting and considerable longueurs, he ends up wounded and in the care of widow Morag (Anna Hutchinson, quite good) and her three children, a family hitherto more allied with the English. Even though this was directed by Australian Richard Gray, features numerous American actors attempting Scottish accents with varying degrees of success and, most scandalous of all, was shot mostly in Montana, this is a thoughtful, well-meaning crack at historical drama. It takes a good hour or so to get going, but then it builds up some watchable spectacle \u2013 although Gray goes way overboard with the moody, fireside lighting, and the rousing orchestral score gets all ceilidh-cutesy for the happy montages. Pandering to Scottish sentimentality over this period in history, it should find its audience locally but is unlikely to reproduce Braveheart\u2019s international success.",

      "body": "<p>When Guy Gunaratne was a teenager he would catch the bus home from school in north-west London, listening out for the chat of his fellow passengers. \u201cLike this one kid who said to his friend, \u2018Come on, you\u2019re moving like molasses.\u2019 That rattled in my head for so long. It\u2019s so <em>inside,</em>\u201d he says. \u201cLondon can be an unkind place to live and grow up in, but I just love the way we spoke, and to make something out of where you\u2019re from, loving the kind of things people usually forget or dismiss, is a thrilling experience.\u201d</p> <p>Gunaratne\u2019s debut novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/13/our-mad-furious-city-guy-gunaratne-review-wiley-skepta\" title=\"\">In Our Mad and Furious City</a>,</em> was longlisted for last year\u2019s Man Booker prize and shortlisted for a string of others before winning the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/01/the-london-book-of-our-lifetime-guy-gunaratne-wins-jhalak-prize\" title=\"\">Jhalak prize</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/16/guy-gunaratne-wins-dylan-thomas-prize-in-our-mad-and-furious-city\" title=\"\">International Dylan Thomas award</a> for writers under 40 last month. The Dylan Thomas jury described it as astounding, provocative and enticing, but not an easy read. \u201cPeople bring their own baggage to my baggage and that\u2019s good,\u201d responds the author, who packed his novel with things people would prefer to dismiss or forget, not least the murder of off-duty soldier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/lee-rigby\" title=\"\">Lee Rigby</a>, who was hacked to death in broad daylight in a south London street in 2013.</p> <p>A lightly fictionalised version of the murder opens the novel, and is all the more shocking for the reaction it provokes on the street. \u201cThe black younger had stopped soldier-boy and struck him down with a cleaver,\u201d we are told. \u201cHe called himself the hand of Allah but to us he looked as if he had just rolled out the same school gates as us. He had the same trainers we wore. Spoke the same road slang we used. The blood was not what shocked us. For us it was his face like a mirror, reflecting our own confused and frightened thoughts.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the novel is written in a pungent first-person patois, which the author calls \u201croad dialect\u201d (while conceding that it\u2019s officially known as Multicultural London English or MLE). But this opening rings out like an omniscient chorus. So how closely does it reflect his own feelings? Gunaratne was in Finland when the news of the murder broke but watched the endlessly repeated film footage. \u201cThe thing that shocked me was one of the killers: the way he expressed himself really did remind me of the kind of people I grew up with. There was a perverse identification which disturbed me to the extent that I knew it was something I needed to navigate for myself.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a ferocious energy in the language of the novel that is reminiscent of James Kelman\u2019s <em>How Late It Was, How Late </em>or even Anthony Burgess\u2019s <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>, and seems always on the point of combusting. It pushes at convention: Gunaratne\u2019s \u201cennet?\u201d, for instance, stands in for the ubiquitous \u201cinnit?\u201d. But its heightened particularity, what Gunaratne calls \u201cinsideness\u201d, seems a million miles from the softly spoken 35-year-old man sitting opposite me, who talks delicately and carefully, unafraid to let silences bloom as he picks his way through his thoughts.</p> <p>He wouldn\u2019t talk like this to his old schoolfriends, he points out. \u201cBut publishing is pretty middle class and I\u2019ve had to accommodate. In London, you learn to code-switch quite well and I\u2019ve always thought of that as a superpower in a way. You\u2019re able to express yourself with different vocabulary in different situations, not through any pretence but because the way you express yourself matters, and your social condition is inherited through your inheritance of dialect.\u201d</p> <p>Gunaratne was born in 1984 into a Sri Lankan family in Neasden, north-west London, where the novel is set. His father had arrived at 16, speaking little English, and worked his way up to a clerical job at the Sri Lankan high commission. His mother started on a supermarket check-out desk before moving to the cash office at Ikea. \u201cI\u2019ve always been quite conflicted about Neasden,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a place you pass through on the way to the Hindu temple and Ikea and it\u2019s cleaved in half by a motorway. Anyone who landed there would only stay for a short while but for some reason my parents stayed on.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>I realised I could write about a chicken shop as if it was a church</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His father would reminisce about long-gone pubs where, in the 1950s and 60s, lines of Irish itinerant workers would wait to be picked up in vans. They are memorialised in the novel in Belfast-born Caroline \u2013 one of two older narrators \u2013 though in the words of one of his central triumvirate of troubled \u201cyoungers\u201d, \u201ceverything just switched hands, like bish-bash-bosh to the next lot. Polish settled this time. Might be Somalis next, or Albanians. Hard-nut lot, ennet. Fucking Turks maybe.\u201d</p> <p>Education was important to his parents, though they couldn\u2019t afford fees, and he was sent to a tough local school while his \u201csuper-smart\u201d older brother won a bursary to a more desirable one outside the area. \u201cI didn\u2019t enjoy it, but no matter how rough that school was I felt I had to make something out of it: you have to make art from the place that you\u2019re from even if it\u2019s not as nourishing as other places,\u201d he says. In the absence of inspiration from his environment he sought it from books, hanging out in Willesden library, scouting for bargains in charity shops, and falling in love with a generation of American Jewish writers \u2013 novelists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/26/collected-stories-isaac-bashevis-singer-review\" title=\"\">Isaac Bashevis Singer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/17/the-five-essential-saul-bellow-novels\" title=\"\">Saul Bellow</a> \u201cwho talked about not mingling\u201d. Being Jewish and from Chicago, Gunaratne discovered, had something in common with being from a Buddhist family in Neasden.</p> <p>Though writing was \u201ca kind of background noise\u201d throughout his childhood \u2013 \u201csomething I was always compulsively doing\u201d \u2013 his family \u201cquite sensibly\u201d didn\u2019t encourage it. He had no role models, so he did what teenagers have always done: rebelled. And his rebellion just happened to coincide with the rise of grime music. \u201cThere was something about grime that was indifferent to pleasing \u2013 it said: \u2018This is just for us\u2019,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was the music we listened to and some of my friends emceed. I didn\u2019t, but Channel U [a short-lived grime and rap satellite TV outlet] was very important to me: it screened music videos that looked like the kind of places I was from.\u201d</p> <p>Part of his rebellion was against the placidity of his parents\u2019 generation, their compliance with being defined by the prejudices of others, which is recalled by the elderly West Indian Nelson in the novel as \u201ca sorta deep-down shame \u2026 when I realise that this Britain here did not love me back, no matter how I feel for it\u201d. If grime offered one form of kickback for Gunaratne, another came from post-colonial literature (one of the boys is called Selvon after Sam Selvon, whose 1956 novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/oct/16/how-the-lonely-londoners-extends-the-novels-language\" title=\"\">The Lonely Londoners</a></em> pioneered the use of \u201ccreolised\u201d English). In particular, he clicked with Derek Walcott\u2019s demand that mango and breadfruit trees should be accorded the same iconical status in English poetry as the elm and the oak. \u201cI realised I could write about a chicken shop as if it was a church, or of playing football on a concrete playground as football reporters write about Barcelona,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The random jobs he landed after leaving school convinced him he wasn\u2019t very good at \u201canything that was likely to bring in an income\u201d, so he signed up for a film and television degree at London\u2019s Brunel University, where he made some short films, then went on to City University to study current affairs journalism. \u201cI had this maniac idea of war reportage,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019d always hear stuff about the civil war in Sri Lanka. My parents would go back there, and we lived there for a year when I was about 10.\u201d</p> <p>He fell in love with a fellow student, Heidi Lindvall, and together they set up a film production company. They went to Sri Lanka a week after the civil war had ended to write a story about suppression of the media. It did well and gave them a calling card for television, so Gunaratne spent most of his 20s travelling around world trouble spots, \u201cinterviewing people who were vulnerable, and just listening and not flinching\u201d. Did it feel dangerous? There were times \u2013 such as negotiating unmapped landmines in Sri Lanka \u2013 when it got \u201ca bit interesting\u201d, he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"728af43cbdee51ceba587e970257b4688db69b70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/728af43cbdee51ceba587e970257b4688db69b70/93_40_2343_2381/984.jpg\" alt=\"Gunaratne with his partner Heidi Lindvall\" width=\"984\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gunaratne with his partner Heidi Lindvall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Maher/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though the couple were based in London, they followed their work around and were living in Berlin by the time Gunaratne finished the manuscript he had been writing every morning for a couple of years. Once he found an agent, things moved very quickly. There was a bidding war, \u201cso we were in the wonderful position of being able to choose\u201d. But he\u2019s taking his sudden success in his stride, saying: \u201cI do almost miss that feeling of naivety, but I\u2019m very aware that someone growing up in Neasden doesn\u2019t usually get to do this.\u201d He now flits between London and Lindvall\u2019s native Sweden where he is working on a second voice-driven novel, though this time with a single voice. Having recently become a father, he says that \u201cany time at my desk feels like a gift. And the good thing is I live in Malm\u00f6: it\u2019s healthy to have that bit of geography between the first book and the second.\u201d</p> <p>But he is also acutely aware of how fragile his privileges are. The chicken shop in <em>In Our Mad and Furious City</em> is called Ray\u2019s Chicken Paradise and is staffed by an Indian assistant known as \u201cfreshie Dave\u201d, as in \u201cFresh off the boat\u201d. \u201cHis sort were the frontline now,\u201d says Pakistan-born Yusuf, the son of an imam in a radicalising mosque. \u201cThese words like \u2018Paki\u2019, which we did our best to pacify at school, had come back sharper and took chunks out of faces like my own and Freshie Dave\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p><em>In Our Mad and Furious City</em> is an inexorable 48-hour sprint towards riot and tragedy, its depiction of social alienation eerily prefiguring the debate about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/08/shamima-begum-confusion-after-reports-newborn-son-may-have-died\" title=\"\">Shamima Begum</a>, the east London schoolgirl who found herself stranded after running away to Syria. Gunaratne responded to the Begum story with a heartfelt plea to \u201cassert our belonging as being grounded in law. Anything less and we abdicate our collective responsibilities as members of civil society.\u201d Like it or not, he <a href=\"https://guygunaratne.com/shamima-begum\" title=\"\">wrote on his website</a>, Shamima Begum is as British as the rest of us. \u201cIt was here, in Britain, that she was radicalised. And it is here that she should face justice. The only way we can begin to understand the pathologies behind those who choose to follow ideologies of hate groups is to bring them home.\u201d</p> <p>The case has provoked concern, on behalf of his parents in London and his baby daughter in Sweden, as well as for himself. \u201cI feel quite deeply alarmed,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people revel in unbelonging because if you\u2019re not wholly one thing or another you become a citizen of now, and as a writer I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anywhere as interesting to be. But I\u2019m concerned that the material conditions of being British are changing, and these things need confronting.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 July 2019 to remove an incorrect reference to Neasden being a borough.</p>",

For us it was his face like a mirror, reflecting our own confused and frightened thoughts.\u201d Most of the novel is written in a pungent first-person patois, which the author calls \u201croad dialect\u201d (while conceding that it\u2019s officially known as Multicultural London English or MLE). But this opening rings out like an omniscient chorus. So how closely does it reflect his own feelings? Gunaratne was in Finland when the news of the murder broke but watched the endlessly repeated film footage. \u201cThe thing that shocked me was one of the killers: the way he expressed himself really did remind me of the kind of people I grew up with. There was a perverse identification which disturbed me to the extent that I knew it was something I needed to navigate for myself.\u201d There\u2019s a ferocious energy in the language of the novel that is reminiscent of James Kelman\u2019s How Late It Was, How Late or even Anthony Burgess\u2019s A Clockwork Orange, and seems always on the point of combusting. It pushes at convention: Gunaratne\u2019s \u201cennet?\u201d, for instance, stands in for the ubiquitous \u201cinnit?\u201d. But its heightened particularity, what Gunaratne calls \u201cinsideness\u201d, seems a million miles from the softly spoken 35-year-old man sitting opposite me, who talks delicately and carefully, unafraid to let silences bloom as he picks his way through his thoughts. He wouldn\u2019t talk like this to his old schoolfriends, he points out. \u201cBut publishing is pretty middle class and I\u2019ve had to accommodate. In London, you learn to code-switch quite well and I\u2019ve always thought of that as a superpower in a way. You\u2019re able to express yourself with different vocabulary in different situations, not through any pretence but because the way you express yourself matters, and your social condition is inherited through your inheritance of dialect.\u201d Gunaratne was born in 1984 into a Sri Lankan family in Neasden, north-west London, where the novel is set. His father had arrived at 16, speaking little English, and worked his way up to a clerical job at the Sri Lankan high commission. His mother started on a supermarket check-out desk before moving to the cash office at Ikea. \u201cI\u2019ve always been quite conflicted about Neasden,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a place you pass through on the way to the Hindu temple and Ikea and it\u2019s cleaved in half by a motorway. Anyone who landed there would only stay for a short while but for some reason my parents stayed on.\u201d His father would reminisce about long-gone pubs where, in the 1950s and 60s, lines of Irish itinerant workers would wait to be picked up in vans. They are memorialised in the novel in Belfast-born Caroline \u2013 one of two older narrators \u2013 though in the words of one of his central triumvirate of troubled \u201cyoungers\u201d, \u201ceverything just switched hands, like bish-bash-bosh to the next lot. Polish settled this time. Might be Somalis next, or Albanians. Hard-nut lot, ennet. Fucking Turks maybe.\u201d Education was important to his parents, though they couldn\u2019t afford fees, and he was sent to a tough local school while his \u201csuper-smart\u201d older brother won a bursary to a more desirable one outside the area. \u201cI didn\u2019t enjoy it, but no matter how rough that school was I felt I had to make something out of it: you have to make art from the place that you\u2019re from even if it\u2019s not as nourishing as other places,\u201d he says. In the absence of inspiration from his environment he sought it from books, hanging out in Willesden library, scouting for bargains in charity shops, and falling in love with a generation of American Jewish writers \u2013 novelists such as Isaac Bashevis Singer and Saul Bellow \u201cwho talked about not mingling\u201d. Being Jewish and from Chicago, Gunaratne discovered, had something in common with being from a Buddhist family in Neasden. Though writing was \u201ca kind of background noise\u201d throughout his childhood \u2013 \u201csomething I was always compulsively doing\u201d \u2013 his family \u201cquite sensibly\u201d didn\u2019t encourage it. He had no role models, so he did what teenagers have always done: rebelled. And his rebellion just happened to coincide with the rise of grime music. \u201cThere was something about grime that was indifferent to pleasing \u2013 it said: \u2018This is just for us\u2019,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was the music we listened to and some of my friends emceed. I didn\u2019t, but Channel U [a short-lived grime and rap satellite TV outlet] was very important to me: it screened music videos that looked like the kind of places I was from.\u201d Part of his rebellion was against the placidity of his parents\u2019 generation, their compliance with being defined by the prejudices of others, which is recalled by the elderly West Indian Nelson in the novel as \u201ca sorta deep-down shame \u2026 when I realise that this Britain here did not love me back, no matter how I feel for it\u201d. If grime offered one form of kickback for Gunaratne, another came from post-colonial literature (one of the boys is called Selvon after Sam Selvon, whose 1956 novel The Lonely Londoners pioneered the use of \u201ccreolised\u201d English). In particular, he clicked with Derek Walcott\u2019s demand that mango and breadfruit trees should be accorded the same iconical status in English poetry as the elm and the oak. \u201cI realised I could write about a chicken shop as if it was a church, or of playing football on a concrete playground as football reporters write about Barcelona,\u201d he says. The random jobs he landed after leaving school convinced him he wasn\u2019t very good at \u201canything that was likely to bring in an income\u201d, so he signed up for a film and television degree at London\u2019s Brunel University, where he made some short films, then went on to City University to study current affairs journalism. \u201cI had this maniac idea of war reportage,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019d always hear stuff about the civil war in Sri Lanka. My parents would go back there, and we lived there for a year when I was about 10.\u201d He fell in love with a fellow student, Heidi Lindvall, and together they set up a film production company. They went to Sri Lanka a week after the civil war had ended to write a story about suppression of the media. It did well and gave them a calling card for television, so Gunaratne spent most of his 20s travelling around world trouble spots, \u201cinterviewing people who were vulnerable, and just listening and not flinching\u201d. Did it feel dangerous? There were times \u2013 such as negotiating unmapped landmines in Sri Lanka \u2013 when it got \u201ca bit interesting\u201d, he says. Though the couple were based in London, they followed their work around and were living in Berlin by the time Gunaratne finished the manuscript he had been writing every morning for a couple of years. Once he found an agent, things moved very quickly. There was a bidding war, \u201cso we were in the wonderful position of being able to choose\u201d. But he\u2019s taking his sudden success in his stride, saying: \u201cI do almost miss that feeling of naivety, but I\u2019m very aware that someone growing up in Neasden doesn\u2019t usually get to do this.\u201d He now flits between London and Lindvall\u2019s native Sweden where he is working on a second voice-driven novel, though this time with a single voice. Having recently become a father, he says that \u201cany time at my desk feels like a gift. And the good thing is I live in Malm\u00f6: it\u2019s healthy to have that bit of geography between the first book and the second.\u201d But he is also acutely aware of how fragile his privileges are. The chicken shop in In Our Mad and Furious City is called Ray\u2019s Chicken Paradise and is staffed by an Indian assistant known as \u201cfreshie Dave\u201d, as in \u201cFresh off the boat\u201d. \u201cHis sort were the frontline now,\u201d says Pakistan-born Yusuf, the son of an imam in a radicalising mosque. \u201cThese words like \u2018Paki\u2019, which we did our best to pacify at school, had come back sharper and took chunks out of faces like my own and Freshie Dave\u2019s.\u201d In Our Mad and Furious City is an inexorable 48-hour sprint towards riot and tragedy, its depiction of social alienation eerily prefiguring the debate about Shamima Begum, the east London schoolgirl who found herself stranded after running away to Syria. Gunaratne responded to the Begum story with a heartfelt plea to \u201cassert our belonging as being grounded in law. Anything less and we abdicate our collective responsibilities as members of civil society.\u201d Like it or not, he wrote on his website, Shamima Begum is as British as the rest of us. \u201cIt was here, in Britain, that she was radicalised. And it is here that she should face justice. The only way we can begin to understand the pathologies behind those who choose to follow ideologies of hate groups is to bring them home.\u201d The case has provoked concern, on behalf of his parents in London and his baby daughter in Sweden, as well as for himself. \u201cI feel quite deeply alarmed,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people revel in unbelonging because if you\u2019re not wholly one thing or another you become a citizen of now, and as a writer I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anywhere as interesting to be. But I\u2019m concerned that the material conditions of being British are changing, and these things need confronting.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 1 July 2019 to remove an incorrect reference to Neasden being a borough.",

However, it said the suspension was only temporary and could be reversed.</p> <p>Teresa Ribera, Spain\u2019s acting minister for the ecological transition, said the new council was making a grave environmental, political and financial error.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the candidates for the mayoralty made a bit of a mistake by thinking that this was an ideological measure rather than one was introduced to be in step with people\u2019s needs and values, and which is in line with European obligations on public health and air quality,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p> <p>During the campaign before May\u2019s local and regional elections, the PP\u2019s candidate for the presidency of the Madrid regional government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/may/31/madrid-set-to-end-clean-air-project-in-rightwing-power-switch\">attacked the scheme</a>, saying congestion was \u201cpart of the life in Madrid\u201d, and that the city\u2019s nightlife \u201cgoes hand in hand with traffic jams\u201d.</p> <p>Ribera pointed out that rolling back the low-emissions zone would result in the council opening itself up to fines from the EU for failing to comply with air quality legislation.</p> <p>\u201cAre they going to divert public money from the Madrid city budget to pay fines for something they\u2019ve done on an ideological whim \u2013 and which goes against people\u2019s health? Something based on the fundamental right to be in a traffic jam at 3am? That\u2019s just silly. I don\u2019t think that anyone in a position of institutional power would be that irresponsible.\u201d</p> <p>The acting minister said she doubted that Madrid Central would be abandoned, not least because public opinion in the capital was behind the scheme.</p> <p>\u201cThe physical, legal, health and scientific arguments are so overwhelming that there\u2019s no way of reversing Manuela Carmena\u2019s initiative and whoever\u2019s running things needs to build on that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI think that the new city council will come to realise that this is not a measure that can be easily reversed. I also think it\u2019ll be widely rejected socially.\u201d</p> <p>According to the environmental group <a href=\"https://www.ecologistasenaccion.org/114930/balance-del-funcionamiento-de-madrid-central/\">Ecologists in Action</a>, Madrid Central has already brought about record reductions in nitrogen dioxide levels in the city centre, <a href=\"https://elpais.com/ccaa/2019/05/07/madrid/1557223660_863583.html\">with pollution from the gas 48% lower in April 2019</a> than during the same month last year. Nitrogen dioxide levels across the city, meanwhile, are down by 16%.</p> <p>The group\u2019s coordinator, Paco Segura, said that scrapping the scheme in <a href=\"https://www.efeverde.com/noticias/contaminacion-del-aire-aumento-madrid/\">a region where contaminated air causes a</a><a href=\"https://www.efeverde.com/noticias/contaminacion-del-aire-aumento-madrid/\">about 3,000 premature deaths a year</a> was \u201cabsolutely immoral\u201d.</p> <p>In the past month, more than 224,000 people have signed <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/ayuntamiento-de-madrid-madrid-central-por-la-continuidad-del-proyecto-no-a-la-reversi%C3%B3n/u/24756863?cs_tk=AmfAWFVnIP7hK3KZGF0AAXicyyvNyQEABF8BvDbw8Ercb5FwBd08zrEkvcg%3D&amp;utm_campaign=b9f743f2c5724599adc4f481ac6a96e6&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=petition_update&amp;utm_term=cs\">a petition calling for Madrid Central to be preserved</a>.</p> <p>Earlier this week, the head of the World Health Organization\u2019s department of public health and environment highlighted the benefits of schemes such as Madrid Central.</p> <p>Dr Mar\u00eda Neira said they brought economic benefits, reduced accidents and helped tackle obesity by encouraging people to be less sedentary.</p> <p>\u201cPolicies for sustainable cities only bring benefits that work in favour of people and not cars,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.lasexta.com/noticias/nacional/oms-rechaza-reversion-madrid-central-todo-que-proteja-salud-puede-tocar_201906265d131f690cf2b86c2b61f5ff.html\">she said</a>. \u201cAnything that protects health shouldn\u2019t be touched; it\u2019s something that should always be improved.\u201d</p> <p>Madrid\u2019s new mayor, the PP\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida, <a href=\"https://elpais.com/ccaa/2019/06/26/madrid/1561531868_637183.html\">has described Madrid Central as a failure and said his team </a><a href=\"https://elpais.com/ccaa/2019/06/26/madrid/1561531868_637183.html\">was working to find alternative ways to ensure \u201csustainable transport\u201d</a>, such as lanes for buses and high-occupancy vehicles.</p> <p>His deputy, Bego\u00f1a Villac\u00eds of the Citizens party, has been more circumspect, saying the decision to stop fining people from 1 July \u201cisn\u2019t a reversal of Madrid Central\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t think it would be a good idea to simply change everything back to how it was,\u201d she told the Spanish newspaper <a href=\"https://www.elmundo.es/madrid/2019/06/17/5d0682ff21efa0bb7a8b4640.html\">El Mundo earlier this </a>month.</p> <p>\u201cNow it\u2019s up and running, we know which bits of it work and which don\u2019t, so we can listen to people and adapt it as needs be.

      "bodyText": "Spain\u2019s acting environment minister has warned Madrid\u2019s new city council that its plans to scrap the Spanish capital\u2019s low-emissions zone risk putting ideology before people\u2019s health and are badly out of step with public opinion. Thousands of people are to march through the city centre on Saturday night to protest against the overturning of the zone, which was brought in last November by the capital\u2019s then mayor, the leftwing Manuela Carmena. Madrid\u2019s new city council \u2013 which is led by the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) and the centre-right Citizens party and backed by the far-right Vox \u2013 announced moves to begin rolling back the Madrid Central zone days after taking office earlier this month. From 1 July, the council will no longer fine people for taking more polluting vehicles into the centre, in effect shutting down the low-emissions zone. However, it said the suspension was only temporary and could be reversed. Teresa Ribera, Spain\u2019s acting minister for the ecological transition, said the new council was making a grave environmental, political and financial error. \u201cSome of the candidates for the mayoralty made a bit of a mistake by thinking that this was an ideological measure rather than one was introduced to be in step with people\u2019s needs and values, and which is in line with European obligations on public health and air quality,\u201d she told the Guardian. During the campaign before May\u2019s local and regional elections, the PP\u2019s candidate for the presidency of the Madrid regional government attacked the scheme, saying congestion was \u201cpart of the life in Madrid\u201d, and that the city\u2019s nightlife \u201cgoes hand in hand with traffic jams\u201d. Ribera pointed out that rolling back the low-emissions zone would result in the council opening itself up to fines from the EU for failing to comply with air quality legislation. \u201cAre they going to divert public money from the Madrid city budget to pay fines for something they\u2019ve done on an ideological whim \u2013 and which goes against people\u2019s health? Something based on the fundamental right to be in a traffic jam at 3am? That\u2019s just silly. I don\u2019t think that anyone in a position of institutional power would be that irresponsible.\u201d The acting minister said she doubted that Madrid Central would be abandoned, not least because public opinion in the capital was behind the scheme. \u201cThe physical, legal, health and scientific arguments are so overwhelming that there\u2019s no way of reversing Manuela Carmena\u2019s initiative and whoever\u2019s running things needs to build on that,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that the new city council will come to realise that this is not a measure that can be easily reversed. I also think it\u2019ll be widely rejected socially.\u201d According to the environmental group Ecologists in Action, Madrid Central has already brought about record reductions in nitrogen dioxide levels in the city centre, with pollution from the gas 48% lower in April 2019 than during the same month last year. Nitrogen dioxide levels across the city, meanwhile, are down by 16%. The group\u2019s coordinator, Paco Segura, said that scrapping the scheme in a region where contaminated air causes aabout 3,000 premature deaths a year was \u201cabsolutely immoral\u201d. In the past month, more than 224,000 people have signed a petition calling for Madrid Central to be preserved. Earlier this week, the head of the World Health Organization\u2019s department of public health and environment highlighted the benefits of schemes such as Madrid Central. Dr Mar\u00eda Neira said they brought economic benefits, reduced accidents and helped tackle obesity by encouraging people to be less sedentary. \u201cPolicies for sustainable cities only bring benefits that work in favour of people and not cars,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything that protects health shouldn\u2019t be touched; it\u2019s something that should always be improved.\u201d Madrid\u2019s new mayor, the PP\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida, has described Madrid Central as a failure and said his team was working to find alternative ways to ensure \u201csustainable transport\u201d, such as lanes for buses and high-occupancy vehicles. His deputy, Bego\u00f1a Villac\u00eds of the Citizens party, has been more circumspect, saying the decision to stop fining people from 1 July \u201cisn\u2019t a reversal of Madrid Central\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it would be a good idea to simply change everything back to how it was,\u201d she told the Spanish newspaper El Mundo earlier this month. \u201cNow it\u2019s up and running, we know which bits of it work and which don\u2019t, so we can listen to people and adapt it as needs be. But I don\u2019t think a total reversal is the option.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When I first heard about the documentary on trans athletes presented by Martina Navratilova on BBC One, I was worried that it would further stoke fears about trans women in sport, and advocate against their participation. Navratilova had previously made scathing comments about trans women in sport, calling their participation \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/20/lgbt-group-drops-martina-navratilova-over-transgender-comments\">insane\u201d and \u201ccheating</a>\u201d, and later suggested that men could start taking female hormones in order to win medals and make money. Those opinions were obviously born of ignorance \u2013 for example, trans people have to wait up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/26/trans-patients-in-england-face-soul-destroying-wait-for-treatment\">two years</a> for an appointment at a gender clinic \u2013 not to mention the fact they trivialise the struggles trans people go through. So I was prepared for the worst.</p> <p>But while I found many of the opinions explored in the documentary problematic, the conclusion Navratilova came to in the end was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/48777660\">an unexpected one</a>. I found problems along the way \u2013 not least her refusal to countenance using \u201ccisgender\u201d to help distinguish between trans and non-trans athletes, which only confused matters, creating a dichotomy between \u201cwomen and girls\u201d and \u201ctrans women\u201d. Cisgender is a descriptive term to indicate people whose gender identity corresponds with the gender and sex they were assigned at birth (the opposite of trans) and it is useful in discussions of this kind. It doesn\u2019t mean that the differences between trans women and cis women are being erased \u2013 rather that both are women in different ways.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/21/trans-issues-britain-iceland-law-intersex-rights\">On trans issues, Iceland has just put Britain to shame | Owl Fisher</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, watching Navratilova gain understanding through the programme was gratifying. Her stance was quite clear from the get-go \u2013 for the majority of the documentary she remained adamant that trans women would always have the upper hand to a certain extent over other women. But through her talks with trans women, Navratilova seemed to gain a deeper understanding of the impact this toxic debate has, and says she has gained a deeper level of empathy.<br><br>In the documentary she realises that competing in sport is about so much more than just the elite levels. For many, sport is simply a form of exercise, socialisation, a chance to participate in something they enjoy. Not allowing trans women to join in with other women is therefore not only cruel, but another way to push trans people out of public life. As Navratilova herself touches upon in the documentary, there are no trans people competing at an elite level of sport such as at the Olympics, and no sign of trans women dominating in women\u2019s sport, despite the fact they have been allowed to compete under certain conditions since 2003. <br></p> <p>The documentary also explores interesting ideas about the rules around competing in sport, and how those are going to need to advance to accommodate more diversity when it comes to gender and sex. Even though <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/caster-semenya-rio-2016-gold-800m-intersex-gender-femininity-doesnt-look-the-way-we-want-a7203506.html\">Caster Semenya</a> is not transgender, her case has raised vital questions about a blanket sex division in sport based on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/06/testosterone-biological-sex-sports-bodies\">testosterone levels alone</a>.

      "bodyText": "When I first heard about the documentary on trans athletes presented by Martina Navratilova on BBC One, I was worried that it would further stoke fears about trans women in sport, and advocate against their participation. Navratilova had previously made scathing comments about trans women in sport, calling their participation \u201cinsane\u201d and \u201ccheating\u201d, and later suggested that men could start taking female hormones in order to win medals and make money. Those opinions were obviously born of ignorance \u2013 for example, trans people have to wait up to two years for an appointment at a gender clinic \u2013 not to mention the fact they trivialise the struggles trans people go through. So I was prepared for the worst. But while I found many of the opinions explored in the documentary problematic, the conclusion Navratilova came to in the end was an unexpected one. I found problems along the way \u2013 not least her refusal to countenance using \u201ccisgender\u201d to help distinguish between trans and non-trans athletes, which only confused matters, creating a dichotomy between \u201cwomen and girls\u201d and \u201ctrans women\u201d. Cisgender is a descriptive term to indicate people whose gender identity corresponds with the gender and sex they were assigned at birth (the opposite of trans) and it is useful in discussions of this kind. It doesn\u2019t mean that the differences between trans women and cis women are being erased \u2013 rather that both are women in different ways. However, watching Navratilova gain understanding through the programme was gratifying. Her stance was quite clear from the get-go \u2013 for the majority of the documentary she remained adamant that trans women would always have the upper hand to a certain extent over other women. But through her talks with trans women, Navratilova seemed to gain a deeper understanding of the impact this toxic debate has, and says she has gained a deeper level of empathy. In the documentary she realises that competing in sport is about so much more than just the elite levels. For many, sport is simply a form of exercise, socialisation, a chance to participate in something they enjoy. Not allowing trans women to join in with other women is therefore not only cruel, but another way to push trans people out of public life. As Navratilova herself touches upon in the documentary, there are no trans people competing at an elite level of sport such as at the Olympics, and no sign of trans women dominating in women\u2019s sport, despite the fact they have been allowed to compete under certain conditions since 2003. The documentary also explores interesting ideas about the rules around competing in sport, and how those are going to need to advance to accommodate more diversity when it comes to gender and sex. Even though Caster Semenya is not transgender, her case has raised vital questions about a blanket sex division in sport based on testosterone levels alone. Sport simply isn\u2019t equipped to deal with the greater nuances of gender and sex that are more prevalent in society. That Navratilova finally came to the conclusion that trans women should be included at all levels of sport is hugely positive. It offers hope that we can focus this debate on understanding based on empathy and a willingness to learn. The answer lies not in hostile arguments, or the demonisation of a minority, but in more research that can lead to better informed regulations that will allow all women to compete in the sports that they love without being dragged through the courts like Semenya. Things are changing, and sport will have to change too. But the most important shifts are those within people. I welcome Navratilova\u2019s change of heart, and hope it is genuine. If she and others aren\u2019t allowed the chance to think again, then positive change in society will be impossible.

But we should all be worried about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/26/widespread-losses-of-pollinating-insects-revealed-across-britain\" title=\"\">our declining bee populations</a>.

People seem to care more about the plight of pandas than everyday creatures such as ants and bees. But that\u2019s a distraction, a magic trick.</p> <p>I worked closely on these with the graphic designer <a href=\"http://www.pleasedonotbend.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Fraser Muggeridge</a> \u2013 it\u2019s a real collaboration. He does all my books and clothing, including my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2019/jan/14/jeremy-deller-brexit-t-shirt\" title=\"\">Fuck Brexit T-shirts</a>, and helped produce these covers. He works more like an artist than a designer. He just gets it.</p> <p>How do you make a political statement while still making art? It\u2019s a huge question, but I don\u2019t worry about defining my work. I came up with some slogans and put them down on paper, that\u2019s all. Art is just one ingredient in the stew \u2013 it can help visualise and clarify a political message, but it can\u2019t change the world on its own. Like music, or humour, it attracts people to a cause; it seduces them.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been really impressed by the way <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion\" title=\"\">Extinction Rebellion</a> has utilised graphics and art so well. It has a strong logo, a consistent message, even a style sheet \u2013 it\u2019s organised. There are a lot of groups in this area, but no one else has branded itself so well. It uses symbols, some of them ancient, that we all understand: bees, skulls, smiley faces. The public is more or less sympathetic to their aims, and that wouldn\u2019t have been the case even five years ago.

It\u2019s generated by a <a href=\"https://littlesun.com/about/\" title=\"\">Little Sun</a> lantern, a portable, solar-powered lamp in the shape of a sunflower that my studio launched in 2012. We wanted to help people living without electricity, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. Every lamp replaces one that uses paraffin or petroleum, and we\u2019ve already distributed 600,000. That\u2019s a lot of unused oil.</p> <p>To create the work, I set a camera to a long exposure, turned off other lights and danced with the lantern. It\u2019s a visual record of my movement.

Data doesn\u2019t deal in feelings or emotions, and we need those to engage people, to encourage them to act. Art and culture can give language to things that are hard to articulate. Data is often rooted in fear, whereas art is positive \u2013 it can inspire us.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always been interested in how we experience nature.

      "bodyText": "I Should Be So Lucky and Fuck You CO2 by Jeremy Deller I heard some young activists chanting, \u201cFuck you, CO2\u201d at the school climate strike on 24 May. It wasn\u2019t the most profane chant I heard that day \u2013 there were a lot about politicians. But it worked well: it was short, strong \u2013 and kids just like swearing, don\u2019t they? So I didn\u2019t come up with this: I nicked it from the air. But by getting it down on paper, I\u2019m giving it more life. I can imagine people putting it in a window at home, like a party-political poster. In 2017, I did something similar with Theresa May\u2019s words in my poster Strong And Stable My Arse [which was posted around London]. Her repetition of the phrase gave it its power. I just took it and turned it into a poster. My other artwork for Guardian Weekend magazine \u2013 I Should Be So Lucky \u2013 was inspired by Kylie Minogue. But we should all be worried about our declining bee populations. We assume the planet will be destroyed by an apocalypse or a big weather event, but actually the death of insects will kill us. People seem to care more about the plight of pandas than everyday creatures such as ants and bees. But that\u2019s a distraction, a magic trick. I worked closely on these with the graphic designer Fraser Muggeridge \u2013 it\u2019s a real collaboration. He does all my books and clothing, including my Fuck Brexit T-shirts, and helped produce these covers. He works more like an artist than a designer. He just gets it. How do you make a political statement while still making art? It\u2019s a huge question, but I don\u2019t worry about defining my work. I came up with some slogans and put them down on paper, that\u2019s all. Art is just one ingredient in the stew \u2013 it can help visualise and clarify a political message, but it can\u2019t change the world on its own. Like music, or humour, it attracts people to a cause; it seduces them. I\u2019ve been really impressed by the way Extinction Rebellion has utilised graphics and art so well. It has a strong logo, a consistent message, even a style sheet \u2013 it\u2019s organised. There are a lot of groups in this area, but no one else has branded itself so well. It uses symbols, some of them ancient, that we all understand: bees, skulls, smiley faces. The public is more or less sympathetic to their aims, and that wouldn\u2019t have been the case even five years ago. Things have moved on. Sunlight Graffiti by Olafur Eliasson My cover is a drawing made from sunlight. It\u2019s generated by a Little Sun lantern, a portable, solar-powered lamp in the shape of a sunflower that my studio launched in 2012. We wanted to help people living without electricity, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. Every lamp replaces one that uses paraffin or petroleum, and we\u2019ve already distributed 600,000. That\u2019s a lot of unused oil. To create the work, I set a camera to a long exposure, turned off other lights and danced with the lantern. It\u2019s a visual record of my movement. This ties in with my show at Tate Modern in London, where Little Sun will be part of the exhibition. As an artist, I\u2019m curious about how we turn data \u2013 hard facts \u2013 about the climate emergency into something tangible. Data doesn\u2019t deal in feelings or emotions, and we need those to engage people, to encourage them to act. Art and culture can give language to things that are hard to articulate. Data is often rooted in fear, whereas art is positive \u2013 it can inspire us. I\u2019ve always been interested in how we experience nature. When I did The Weather Project for Tate Modern in 2003 [Eliasson hung a giant sun in the gallery\u2019s Turbine Hall], we knew far less than we do today about the climate crisis. With Ice Watch last year [when Eliasson placed chunks of ice that had broken away from the Greenland ice sheet around London, including outside Tate Modern], the aim was to put people in direct contact with the effects of rising temperatures. By touching, feeling, even hugging the ice, they had a more emotional response. Extinction Rebellion activists staged a \u201cdie-in\u201d on the same spot in April, to highlight the decline in the bee population. I love that the public is owning these spaces. Artists need to look at themselves, too, not just the topics we address. I\u2019m constantly working on how to make my studio in Berlin greener, to reduce its footprint, to reduce my travel, to review my shipping methods. There\u2019s an assumption that we have to wait for others \u2013 leaders, politicians \u2013 to act, but that\u2019s a mistake: we all have this power. We must unite and become a movement. What response to my Weekend cover do I hope for? That people think about our sun, its power. Can art lead to actual change? Yes \u2013 it participates in the larger political debate. It combines our memories with our expectations of the future. \u2022 Olafur Eliasson: In Real Life is at Tate Modern from 11 July-5 January 2020.

Loosen those waistbands! Schedule tomorrow for living meagrely on rice cakes! For now, my friends, we dine.</p> <p>Hang on, the cheapest burger is \u00a39.50, rising quickly to \u00a311-\u00a314 for something a little grander. And a side of smoked bacon mac\u2019n\u2019cheese is \u00a38 how? Staring into the busy open kitchen at the back of the lower floor, you see a team of busy, uniformed workers, much like in any McDonald\u2019s. No one could doubt their focus. So what begins to head in the direction of our table is puzzling. First a cardboard carton half filled with burned sweet potato fries, then a bowl of what appears to be undressed, cheap penne that, on closer inspection, are sitting in a puddle of thin cheese soup. A single black plastic fork stands upright in the middle of it. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c5a66d3c48dde7c60e07e7d5bc407cdad6e9fed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c5a66d3c48dde7c60e07e7d5bc407cdad6e9fed/0_0_3882_3613/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A side of mac \u2018n\u2019 cheese at Wahlburgers in central London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"931\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Massive Mark-up: an \u00a38 side of smoked bacon mac\u2019n\u2019cheese at Wahlburgers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cCan we have another fork?\u201d I ask, and it instantly feels like one of those impossibly difficult requests.

Kate orders the basic \u201cOur Burger\u201d \u2013 made with a third of a pound of mixed cuts of Scottish beef, lettuce, tomato, onion, American cheese, pickle and Paul\u2019s signature sauce (best not ask). The sauce, I think, is the best part. My Impossible burger is delicious with caramelised onions and sweet tomatoes masking a fake meat patty to the point that it could actually be beef.

Shake Shack, another relatively recent US fancy burger import, has greeters who ebulliently welcome diners to join the queue, but at Wahlburgers you\u2019re shown to a table and assigned a waitress with a sense of formality unbefitting a lurid green, unlovingly furnished, part-burger joint, part-sports bar. Assuming the sport in question is \u201cStalking the Wahlberg family\u201d: screens on every wall play highlights of 10 seasons of Wahlburgers, a reality TV show that follows the high jinks of Mark, Donnie and Paul Wahlberg\u2019s empire. Napkin holders are covered in cute family photos of dinners with Mom, the walls are emblazoned with Mark and Donnie\u2019s movie posters, and the menu is dusted with homespun tributes to Alma\u2019s macaroni \u201cmade from scratch\u201d, Jenn\u2019s chicken salad and Mom\u2019s favourite mayo. The Wahlbergs clearly love each other, and this fact seeps from every surface in an unabashed, touchy-feely, American way that sits curiously with us in Blighty, where it\u2019s only really necessary to emote at family members if someone gets cancer, though even then a firm, stoic handshake should suffice. Still, my first read-though of the Wahlburgers menu made me very, very excited, because it is a laminated bombardment of calorie-drenched potential deliciousness. The \u201cFiesta Burger\u201d with fresh jalape\u00f1os, the \u201cImpossible\u201d veggie burger with chilli-spiced tomatoes, hot sloppy joe sandwiches, house-made chilli with chipotle peppers, cobb salad, tater tots, Thanksgiving turkey burgers with stuffing, items encrusted in panko breadcrumbs and boozy milkshakes with frosted icing. Loosen those waistbands! Schedule tomorrow for living meagrely on rice cakes! For now, my friends, we dine. Hang on, the cheapest burger is \u00a39.50, rising quickly to \u00a311-\u00a314 for something a little grander. And a side of smoked bacon mac\u2019n\u2019cheese is \u00a38 how? Staring into the busy open kitchen at the back of the lower floor, you see a team of busy, uniformed workers, much like in any McDonald\u2019s. No one could doubt their focus. So what begins to head in the direction of our table is puzzling. First a cardboard carton half filled with burned sweet potato fries, then a bowl of what appears to be undressed, cheap penne that, on closer inspection, are sitting in a puddle of thin cheese soup. A single black plastic fork stands upright in the middle of it. \u201cCan we have another fork?\u201d I ask, and it instantly feels like one of those impossibly difficult requests. Service is worse than untrained; it\u2019s that sort of trained where they\u2019ve been drilled in answering seven questions only, and anything off-script or requiring empathy or gumption is best avoided. Kate orders the basic \u201cOur Burger\u201d \u2013 made with a third of a pound of mixed cuts of Scottish beef, lettuce, tomato, onion, American cheese, pickle and Paul\u2019s signature sauce (best not ask). The sauce, I think, is the best part. My Impossible burger is delicious with caramelised onions and sweet tomatoes masking a fake meat patty to the point that it could actually be beef. Kate leaves half her genuine moo option: \u201cIt\u2019s OK, but it\u2019s just not the standard of patty you\u2019d expect for this price.\u201d Here, let\u2019s order a Birthday Cake frapp\u00e9! \u201cVanilla ice-cream, vanilla vodka, cr\u00e8me de cocoa, vanilla frosting, whipped cream, rainbow sprinkles.\u201d In my mind\u2019s eye, this will be like your birthday knickerbocker glory at Wimpy in 1981: enormous, multi-layered, gooey, fluffy and joyful. It arrives, and it\u2019s a long, straight pint glass filled with what looks like vanilla Complan with a few hundreds and thousands on the rim of the glass. It\u2019s thicker than porridge and will not suck up the straw. \u201cAre you enjoying it?\u201d the waitress asks. \u201cNo, it\u2019s literally inedible,\u201d I reply. \u201cCan we maybe have a spoon?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d she says. I have been in the deepest of umbrages with Wahlburgers since my visit. Apparently Mark rises at 2.30am every morning. In that case, good, I\u2019m making progress: he\u2019s definitely feeling those voodoo pins. \u2022 Wahlburgers 8-9 James Street, London WC2, 020-3968 4446. Open all week, 11am-11pm (10.30pm Sun).

They\u2019re augmented here by a host of supporting musicians, such as Cheryl Kingan on sax and Karen Waltuch on viola, who bolster the melody of Every Last Coffee Or Tea, lifting it to a mythic musical space somewhere between Appalachia and New Orleans. There\u2019s something quietly political about their exploded view of the blues: this is music that exists across cultures and borders, something innately human.",

You\u2019re part of an underground network of feminists in Chicago that provide illegal (at the time) abortion services to vulnerable, pregnant people with few options. Despite the risk of imprisonment, and the ways that your personal experiences may not always perfectly align with your activism, you persist.</p> <p>It\u2019s emotionally complicated. It\u2019s politically fraught. It\u2019s a live-action roleplaying game by Jon Cole and Kelley Vanda called <a href=\"https://joncole.itch.io/abortionists-fastaval-2019\">The Abortionists</a>, which requires three players, one facilitator, six hours and a willingness to dig deep into the painful history of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/reproductive-rights\">reproductive rights</a> in the United States.

The proposed legislation was spearheaded by Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, leader of the Law and Justice party, who said it was his goal \u201cto make cases of even very difficult pregnancies, when the child is doomed to die because it is severely deformed, finish with birth, so that the child can be baptised, buried, given a name.\u201d</p> <p>Even in the predominantly Catholic country, this move was a bridge too far. It inspired tens of thousands of citizens to dress in black and take to the streets as well as a strike by women. Days after what was later called the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/23/abortion-poland-mass-protests-against-tightening-of-law\">Black Protest</a>, the proposed bill was voted down, but many pro-choice activists in Poland considered it a wake-up call.</p> <p>As protesters marched in the streets, Jarosz \u2013 along with Thomas Feichtmeir, Michael Hartinger, and Sebastian Merkl \u2013 created <a href=\"https://cyangmou.itch.io/fantastic-fetus\">Fantastic Fetus</a>: a game that asks you to imagine being pregnant in a world where Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s propositions were law.

She describes a particularly impactful playtest of The Choice with a developer who had anti-abortion political leanings, and then took off the headset saying, \u201cCongratulations on doing something important \u2026 maybe I shouldn\u2019t be so sure.\u201d</p> <p>Asking people to think, to empathise, to reconsider what it means to have \u2013 or not have \u2013 an abortion in ways that go beyond political platitudes is a throughline for this wave of games about reproductive rights. In <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Wk_U3iPOhPh0pR3Ax5H3HRKneCaqCRQWIyUBKk8EUM/edit?usp=sharing\">Childfree</a>, a live-action role-playing game created by Axelle Cazeneuve, seven participants act out a decision about whether or not to terminate a pregnancy. This game takes place entirely within the mind of a fictional person whose concerns and conflicts are represented by all of the players collectively.</p> <p>The facilitator takes on the role of the pregnant person, sitting in a spotlight, while three people in the shadows around them represent distinct elements aspects of \u201cself\u201d (their present situation, their dreams, and their needs) and three others represent elements of \u201csociety\u201d (morality, the law, and societal expectations of maternity). The norms involved do not need to resemble any particular society, or any historical one, and can even \u201cbecome science-fiction\u201d if the players choose.</p> <p>After answering three rounds of questions by other players to establish their roles, the six elements of the facilitator\u2019s mind can step into the light to either be invited forward to speak or be refused. At the end of the game, the facilitator weighs all the complicated and personal factors, and announces their decision. It\u2019s an engaging, emotionally complex look at the knot of internal and external forces that surround decisions about termination. It explicitly insists that while continuing a pregnancy is a perfectly valid choice and that people\u2019s experiences vary wildly, ending a pregnancy does not have to be inherently traumatic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56fd07a7fc783f24a177b4c25a41028f0874c70e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56fd07a7fc783f24a177b4c25a41028f0874c70e/208_125_2801_1680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Viewers of The Choice, a VR documentary, hear stories from people who have chosen to have an abortion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Viewers of The Choice, a VR documentary, hear stories from people who have chosen to have an abortion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Cazeneuve, motivation came from her own experience. When she discovered that she was pregnant in early 2011, due to a problem with her IUD, she knew immediately that she wanted an abortion. Although she had never wanted to be a parent, she had always feared that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t have \u2018the strength\u2019 to abort\u201d if she experienced an accidental pregnancy. When confronted with the situation, however, her decision was clear.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I became pregnant, I realised that I, in fact, didn\u2019t have to feel bad about choosing an abortion,\u201d says Cazeneuve. \u201cThat it was a part of a contraceptive process, the last resort, the step you wish you wouldn\u2019t have to take, but is here anyway, just in case all the rest fails.\u201d</p> <p>Despite living in France, where it is relatively easy to get an abortion compared with many other countries, she describes her pregnancy as \u201can eye-opening experience\u201d.</p> <p>She began working on a live-action role-playing game that reflected a variety of experiences around abortion, but pivoted to creating Childfree when she came across two other Larps that weren\u2019t explicitly anti-abortion but used \u201cthe future of the potential child\u201d as narrative motivation. \u201cThis felt deeply wrong to me,\u201d says Cazeneuve. What mattered more, she felt, what needed to be centered and given more weight, was not the \u201cpotential\u201d of an embyro but the life of the human being carrying it. \u201cThis is a humanist issue. Live-action role-playing, as a medium that fosters agency among its players, is a tool we can use to make people more deeply aware of that,\u201d says Cazeneuve. \u201cUnlike theatre, Larp maintains the agency of the subject \u2013 the player playing the pregnant person \u2013 and that was crucial to understand the topic.\u201d</p> <p>For many people making games that address reproductive rights, the goal is not to force players to accept a single perspective or conclusion, but to contend with the numerous tangible, personal experiences of people dealing with unintended pregnancies. Most of all, they ask players to consider the very real human beings trying to make difficult decisions about abortion. These people are often erased by simplistic, judgmental political stances \u2013 or legally prevented from making those decisions altogether.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I aim for is just making people more aware of how we receive and process norms, and how deeply we are affected by them,\u201d says Cazeneuve. \u201cI also aim to show that they always have a choice, even when everything seems to be against them.\u201d</p>",

That history has terrifying relevance in 2019, as numerous states pass laws that put their residents in a reality where abortion is functionally illegal. Based on the real-life work of a 1970s activist group called Jane, it challenges its participants to think about the \u201cinternal landscapes\u201d of its players, and how they deal with the larger political and personal landscape of their world. As Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio work to reverse hard-won reproductive rights with \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d bills and potential 99-year sentences for performing abortions, game designers in the United States \u2013 and around the world \u2013 are creating interactive experiences that challenge the simplistic ways that many people think about abortion, and the blunt, often ignorant cruelty of the laws that politicians have drafted around their constituents\u2019 bodies.

Although she had never wanted to be a parent, she had always feared that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t have \u2018the strength\u2019 to abort\u201d if she experienced an accidental pregnancy. When confronted with the situation, however, her decision was clear. \u201cWhen I became pregnant, I realised that I, in fact, didn\u2019t have to feel bad about choosing an abortion,\u201d says Cazeneuve. \u201cThat it was a part of a contraceptive process, the last resort, the step you wish you wouldn\u2019t have to take, but is here anyway, just in case all the rest fails.\u201d Despite living in France, where it is relatively easy to get an abortion compared with many other countries, she describes her pregnancy as \u201can eye-opening experience\u201d. She began working on a live-action role-playing game that reflected a variety of experiences around abortion, but pivoted to creating Childfree when she came across two other Larps that weren\u2019t explicitly anti-abortion but used \u201cthe future of the potential child\u201d as narrative motivation. \u201cThis felt deeply wrong to me,\u201d says Cazeneuve. What mattered more, she felt, what needed to be centered and given more weight, was not the \u201cpotential\u201d of an embyro but the life of the human being carrying it. \u201cThis is a humanist issue. Live-action role-playing, as a medium that fosters agency among its players, is a tool we can use to make people more deeply aware of that,\u201d says Cazeneuve. \u201cUnlike theatre, Larp maintains the agency of the subject \u2013 the player playing the pregnant person \u2013 and that was crucial to understand the topic.\u201d For many people making games that address reproductive rights, the goal is not to force players to accept a single perspective or conclusion, but to contend with the numerous tangible, personal experiences of people dealing with unintended pregnancies. Most of all, they ask players to consider the very real human beings trying to make difficult decisions about abortion. These people are often erased by simplistic, judgmental political stances \u2013 or legally prevented from making those decisions altogether. \u201cWhat I aim for is just making people more aware of how we receive and process norms, and how deeply we are affected by them,\u201d says Cazeneuve. \u201cI also aim to show that they always have a choice, even when everything seems to be against them.\u201d",

In October 1998, I was 25 and living in Humboldt County, California, doing side jobs while studying at the state university. My safe haven was an 80-acre grove of giant redwoods in Freshwater Creek Forest, a place I\u2019d go for peaceful contemplation.</p> <p>One evening, I noticed some trees had been marked with orange paint. The Pacific Lumber Company had stepped up its operations in the area, devastating old growth forest. Whenever I\u2019d seen trees marked in this way, they disappeared within weeks. Many trees were already occupied by activists \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.juliabutterflyhill.com/\" title=\"\">Julia \u201cButterfly\u201d Hill</a> was part-way through a tree sit that ended up lasting more than two years.</p> <p>I was on a construction job when my friend Roger said: \u201cHey, Nate \u2013 I don\u2019t want to bum you out, but they\u2019re going to cut that grove today.\u201d I wanted to drive over straight away, but decided to wait until after work, in the hope that the loggers would have left for the day.</p> <p>I\u2019d already chosen three trees I particularly wanted to protect. When we arrived that evening, only one was still standing. I later called her Mariah, after the song They Call The Wind Mariah from the musical Paint Your Wagon. She was 12ft in diameter and 200ft high \u2013 even her lowest branches were 80ft from the ground. Luckily, smaller trees had sprouted off her main trunk at the base and I was able to work my way up using those. I used a 10ft length of twine to haul my supplies up after me and kept climbing until I found a growth of branches 130ft up where I was able to make a rudimentary nest \u2013 and that\u2019s where I spent the first night.

They felled a nearby tree, which came close enough for some of its branches to whip through Mariah\u2019s. When I felt chainsaw vibrations, I thought my time was up, but it was all for show \u2013 they were only cutting through the sprout trees at Mariah\u2019s base.</p> <p>Things remained pretty heated during the first couple of months. Sometimes the abuse came from less identifiable sources. Once, someone drove by and fired shots, seemingly in my direction; another time, a visiting friend found her car rolled over a cliff. By then I\u2019d established more permanent living quarters about 160ft up, and was able to take in regular provisions, brought in by local residents.</p> <p>Nature also provided some intimidating episodes. I experienced heavy rain and winds that whipped Mariah back and forth, 20ft in either direction. Eventually, I built a platform 40ft lower down, where things were calmer.

      "bodyText": "The environment minister, Sussan Ley, has added more plants and animals to Australia\u2019s national list of threatened species, including woodlands that had been eligible for protection for years. Ley announced on Friday afternoon that the Nabarlek, found in the Northern Territory, had been added to Australia\u2019s list of critically endangered mammals. Four frogs \u2013 the Baw Baw frog, the white-bellied frog, the yellow-spotted tree frog and the Kuranda tree Frog \u2013 have had their status upgraded from endangered to critically endangered. The minister also confirmed that three woodlands that had been delayed from receiving protection by her predecessors Josh Frydenberg and Melissa Price \u2013 in some cases for years \u2013 would now be listed under national environment laws. Woodlands are protected as a single habitat known as an \u201cecological community\u201d under Australia\u2019s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Guardian Australia revealed last year that two woodlands, one in Tasmania and the other found in both NSW and Queensland, had been delayed after farmer groups, Tasmania\u2019s deputy premier and a Tasmanian federal senator lobbied Frydenberg. The government then used a review of the impact of environment law on the agriculture industry as a reason to continue to delay their listing. The long-awaited report from that review was published on Thursday. On Friday, Ley listed Tasmania\u2019s forests and woodlands dominated by black gum or brookers gum as critically endangered, and NSW and Queensland\u2019s poplar box grassy woodland on alluvial plains as endangered. She also said the Tuart woodlands and forests of the Swan Coastal Plain in Western Australia, which had been delayed from receiving protection by Price, were now listed as critically endangered. Humane Society International, which had nominated all of the woodlands for protection, welcomed the decision and said Ley was \u201cbucking the trend set by her predecessors\u201d by acting promptly on recommendations made by the independent threatened species scientific committee. The organisation said it had been frustrated that protection had been \u201cneedlessly delayed\u201d by the two former ministers \u201cwho used a legal loophole to defer the listings on multiple occasions\u201d. \u201cRecognition of the threat status of these habitats has been a long time coming. It\u2019s very regrettable that for two of the woodlands it should have been provided years ago, and that since then impacts have continued unabated while landholder opportunities have gone begging,\u201d HSI\u2019s head of programs, Evan Quartermain, said. \u201cThat said, it\u2019s extremely refreshing to have a minister willing to accept the science and get on with the job of protecting these special places and supporting the communities where they occur. Minister Ley\u2019s decisive action will be of great benefit to our threatened wildlife.\u201d In total, the government added 34 species and three ecological communities to Australia\u2019s protected list on Friday. A further nine species had their listing status either upgraded or downgraded. The full list of changes can be found here .",

The daughter of two visual artists, her breakthrough came in 2018 when her single Mooo!, an absurdist, meme-ready novelty track in which she imagines being a cow, went viral.

New works, none longer than 15 minutes and almost all specially commissioned, are performed across a long weekend by some of the UK\u2019s finest new-music groups. This time, the composers represented range from kora player Sona Jobarteh and performer-producer Forest Swords to pianist Rolf Hind and baritone Roderick Williams. Admission to all events is free, although tickets should be obtained in advance. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/festivals-series/new-music-biennial-0\">Southbank Centre, SE1, Friday 5 to 7; various venues, Hull 12 to 14 July</a></em></p> <h2>Cheltenham music festival</h2> <p>It is the 75th Cheltenham music festival, and although it is no longer one of the most important new-music showcases in Britain, it pays lip service to its former status. For this year at least, trumpeter Alison Balsom is the artistic director, and among the scattering of premieres are new works by Judith Weir (Fri) and Anna Clyne (11 Jul), plus a trumpet concerto composed for Balsom by the 91-year-old Thea Musgrave (6 Jul). <br><em><a href=\"https://www.cheltenhamfestivals.com/music/\">Various venues, Friday 5 to 14 July</a></em></p> <h2>The Marriage of Figaro</h2> <p>What seems, at first sight, a routine return for David McVicar\u2019s 2006 production is much more intriguing on closer inspection. For not only does the revival mark Christian Gerhaher\u2019s debut in the role of Figaro, but the part of the teenage Cherubino, which Mozart scored for a mezzo-soprano, being taken by a countertenor, Kangmin Justin Kim. It is a strange piece of casting, which seems to strip a layer from the opera\u2019s ambiguity; how it works remains to be seen. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/productions/the-marriage-of-figaro-by-david-mcvicar\">Royal Opera House, WC2, Saturday 29 June to 21 July</a></em></p> <p><em>AC</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best ... exhibitions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ea1f7cffc1e7136ae5c65fcbc61d52b69731b0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ea1f7cffc1e7136ae5c65fcbc61d52b69731b0c/0_41_5956_3574/1000.jpg\" alt=\"F\u00e9lix Vallotton\u2019s The Visit (La Visite), 1899.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">F\u00e9lix Vallotton\u2019s The Visit (La Visite), 1899.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Royal Academy of Arts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Cut and Paste: 400 Years of Collage</h2> <p>Collage as a modernist art technique was invented by Picasso and Braque when they stuck newspaper clippings on to their cubist paintings. But long before that, women were pasting images together on fans and screens. This exhibition tells the whole radical story, from the Renaissance to punk and beyond. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationalgalleries.org/exhibition/cut-and-paste-400-years-collage\">Scottish National Gallery of Art, Edinburgh, Saturday 29 June to 27 October</a></em></p> <h2>F\u00e9lix Vallotton</h2> <p>This artist of enigmatic love scenes and eerily beautiful sunsets has a claim to be France\u2019s Edvard Munch. They both created pared-down prints and paintings that distil dark, fin-de-si\u00e8cle moods. Vallotton is, however, a lot more colourful than Munch. His mixture of Japanese abstraction and modern observation may be summer magic. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/felix-vallotton\">Royal Academy of Arts, W1, Sunday 30 June to 29 September</a></em></p> <h2>David Smith</h2> <p>This great US sculptor started out as a splenetic anti-war satirist; his early works in the 1930s reveal a suffering mind. Smith went on to achieve the same leap in three dimensions as his contemporary Jackson Pollock in two: into the wild west of abstract art. He created a freewheeling visual language, and his heavy metal art has caused vibrations ever since, from 60s minimalism to Richard Serra\u2019s walls of steel. <br><em><a href=\"https://ysp.org.uk/exhibitions/david-smith\">Yorkshire Sculpture Park, nr Wakefield, to 5 January</a></em></p> <h2>Yorkshire Sculpture International</h2> <p>This new festival uses the popularity of Yorkshire folk Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore to advertise the county as a global centre for modern sculpture. There are exhibitions across hill and dale (see David Smith, left) and a passion for embedding art in stuff. Wakefield\u2019s Hepworth gallery is showing artists including Wolfgang Laib, Jimmie Durham and Tau Lewis who keep faith with materials, however unexpected those may be. <br><em><a href=\"https://yorkshire-sculpture.org/\">Various venues, Wakefield &amp; Leeds, to 29 September</a></em></p> <h2>Ed Ruscha</h2> <p>Known for his paintings of gas stations and the LA Strip, Ed Ruscha\u2019s vision seems utterly contemporary. Yet he is a connoisseur of art history. He recently showed with the Romantic landscape artist Thomas Cole and here responds to works by a much less well-known predecessor, Louis Michel Eilshemius. Ruscha seems to be trying to locate himself in the history of US art as an eccentric, maverick and evasive dreamer. <br><em><a href=\"https://gagosian.com/artists/ed-ruscha/\">Gagosian, Davies Street, W1, to 2 August</a></em></p> <p><em>JJ</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best ... theatre shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a83bcdf0cc30389e5ac363b3723300febfb3dd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a83bcdf0cc30389e5ac363b3723300febfb3dd8/0_24_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Noises Off.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frayn attraction\u2026 Noises Off.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Persson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The End of History\u2026</h2> <p>Playwright Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany are the duo behind that little-known show Harry Potter &amp; the Cursed Child. Despite said smash, they are innovative, indie theatre-makers at heart. Their latest collaboration tracks a fraught family reunion; a clash of heads, politics and ideals that stars top thesps Lesley Sharp and David Morrissey. <br><em><a href=\"https://royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/theendofhistory/\">Royal Court: Jerwood Theatre Downstairs, SW1, to 10 August</a></em></p> <h2>Peter Gynt</h2> <p>David Hare stages his 19th play at the National and it\u2019s a romcom. (Not really!) Hare has adapted one of Henrik Ibsen\u2019s most surreal works: James McArdle will play Peter Gynt, a man who steals a bride from a wedding then embarks on an epic journey, over mountains and across deserts. Jonathan Kent directs. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/peter-gynt\">National Theatre: Olivier, SE1, to 8 October</a></em></p> <h2>Life of Pi</h2> <p>Director Max Webster is such a pro at creating exuberantly entertaining children\u2019s theatre (see: The Lorax at London\u2019s Old Vic). So there are high hopes for his production of Yann Martel\u2019s Life of Pi, which Lolita Chakrabarti has adapted for the stage. The play is a coming-of-age tale about a young boy stranded on a boat at sea, with only animals \u2013 including a hungry tiger \u2013 for company. Expect fresh storytelling and spellbinding puppetry. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.sheffieldtheatres.co.uk/events/life-of-pi\">Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, to 20 July</a></em></p> <h2>Noises Off</h2> <p>Is this the funniest farce ever? Yes. Yes it is. Michael Frayn\u2019s classic returns to the Lyric, after it premiered here in 1982. It is a gem of a comedy set backstage at the theatre, where everything is on the verge of a gloriously catastrophic meltdown. Jeremy Herrin directs a cast led by Meera Syal. This truly is comedy gold, and a heartfelt love letter to the mad chaos that is a life spent working in theatre. <br><em><a href=\"https://lyric.co.uk/shows/noises-off/\">Lyric Hammersmith, W6, to 27 July</a></em></p> <h2>Measure for Measure</h2> <p>Artistic director Gregory Doran directs one of the Bard\u2019s most chilling plays. It is set in a Vienna, a city on the verge of moral collapse. When the Duke abdicates, icy cruelty takes hold. A young nun, Isabella, is told she can save her brother \u2013 but only in return for sex. Who can she turn to for help and will anyone believer her story? Lucy Phelps plays Isabella and Sandy Grierson the corrupt Angelo. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.rsc.org.uk/measure-for-measure/the-plot\">Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, to 29 August; touring to 4 April</a></em></p> <p><em>MG</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best ... dance shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bdfdeeb0092e8c14f599037f3afd10c00c2d513\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bdfdeeb0092e8c14f599037f3afd10c00c2d513/0_39_5328_3198/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sara Baras.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spain at Sadler\u2019s\u2026 Sara Baras.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Invisible Cities</h2> <p>It is the USP of Manchester international festival to create works that do not fit into ordinary categories.

Admission to all events is free, although tickets should be obtained in advance. Southbank Centre, SE1, Friday 5 to 7; various venues, Hull 12 to 14 July Cheltenham music festival It is the 75th Cheltenham music festival, and although it is no longer one of the most important new-music showcases in Britain, it pays lip service to its former status. For this year at least, trumpeter Alison Balsom is the artistic director, and among the scattering of premieres are new works by Judith Weir (Fri) and Anna Clyne (11 Jul), plus a trumpet concerto composed for Balsom by the 91-year-old Thea Musgrave (6 Jul). Various venues, Friday 5 to 14 July The Marriage of Figaro What seems, at first sight, a routine return for David McVicar\u2019s 2006 production is much more intriguing on closer inspection. For not only does the revival mark Christian Gerhaher\u2019s debut in the role of Figaro, but the part of the teenage Cherubino, which Mozart scored for a mezzo-soprano, being taken by a countertenor, Kangmin Justin Kim. It is a strange piece of casting, which seems to strip a layer from the opera\u2019s ambiguity; how it works remains to be seen. Royal Opera House, WC2, Saturday 29 June to 21 July AC Five of the best ... exhibitions Cut and Paste: 400 Years of Collage Collage as a modernist art technique was invented by Picasso and Braque when they stuck newspaper clippings on to their cubist paintings. But long before that, women were pasting images together on fans and screens. This exhibition tells the whole radical story, from the Renaissance to punk and beyond. Scottish National Gallery of Art, Edinburgh, Saturday 29 June to 27 October F\u00e9lix Vallotton This artist of enigmatic love scenes and eerily beautiful sunsets has a claim to be France\u2019s Edvard Munch. They both created pared-down prints and paintings that distil dark, fin-de-si\u00e8cle moods. Vallotton is, however, a lot more colourful than Munch. His mixture of Japanese abstraction and modern observation may be summer magic. Royal Academy of Arts, W1, Sunday 30 June to 29 September David Smith This great US sculptor started out as a splenetic anti-war satirist; his early works in the 1930s reveal a suffering mind. Smith went on to achieve the same leap in three dimensions as his contemporary Jackson Pollock in two: into the wild west of abstract art. He created a freewheeling visual language, and his heavy metal art has caused vibrations ever since, from 60s minimalism to Richard Serra\u2019s walls of steel. Yorkshire Sculpture Park, nr Wakefield, to 5 January Yorkshire Sculpture International This new festival uses the popularity of Yorkshire folk Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore to advertise the county as a global centre for modern sculpture. There are exhibitions across hill and dale (see David Smith, left) and a passion for embedding art in stuff. Wakefield\u2019s Hepworth gallery is showing artists including Wolfgang Laib, Jimmie Durham and Tau Lewis who keep faith with materials, however unexpected those may be. Various venues, Wakefield &amp; Leeds, to 29 September Ed Ruscha Known for his paintings of gas stations and the LA Strip, Ed Ruscha\u2019s vision seems utterly contemporary. Yet he is a connoisseur of art history. He recently showed with the Romantic landscape artist Thomas Cole and here responds to works by a much less well-known predecessor, Louis Michel Eilshemius. Ruscha seems to be trying to locate himself in the history of US art as an eccentric, maverick and evasive dreamer. Gagosian, Davies Street, W1, to 2 August JJ Five of the best ... theatre shows The End of History\u2026 Playwright Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany are the duo behind that little-known show Harry Potter &amp; the Cursed Child. Despite said smash, they are innovative, indie theatre-makers at heart. Their latest collaboration tracks a fraught family reunion; a clash of heads, politics and ideals that stars top thesps Lesley Sharp and David Morrissey. Royal Court: Jerwood Theatre Downstairs, SW1, to 10 August Peter Gynt David Hare stages his 19th play at the National and it\u2019s a romcom. (Not really!) Hare has adapted one of Henrik Ibsen\u2019s most surreal works: James McArdle will play Peter Gynt, a man who steals a bride from a wedding then embarks on an epic journey, over mountains and across deserts. Jonathan Kent directs. National Theatre: Olivier, SE1, to 8 October Life of Pi Director Max Webster is such a pro at creating exuberantly entertaining children\u2019s theatre (see: The Lorax at London\u2019s Old Vic). So there are high hopes for his production of Yann Martel\u2019s Life of Pi, which Lolita Chakrabarti has adapted for the stage. The play is a coming-of-age tale about a young boy stranded on a boat at sea, with only animals \u2013 including a hungry tiger \u2013 for company. Expect fresh storytelling and spellbinding puppetry. Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, to 20 July Noises Off Is this the funniest farce ever? Yes. Yes it is. Michael Frayn\u2019s classic returns to the Lyric, after it premiered here in 1982. It is a gem of a comedy set backstage at the theatre, where everything is on the verge of a gloriously catastrophic meltdown. Jeremy Herrin directs a cast led by Meera Syal. This truly is comedy gold, and a heartfelt love letter to the mad chaos that is a life spent working in theatre. Lyric Hammersmith, W6, to 27 July Measure for Measure Artistic director Gregory Doran directs one of the Bard\u2019s most chilling plays. It is set in a Vienna, a city on the verge of moral collapse. When the Duke abdicates, icy cruelty takes hold. A young nun, Isabella, is told she can save her brother \u2013 but only in return for sex. Who can she turn to for help and will anyone believer her story? Lucy Phelps plays Isabella and Sandy Grierson the corrupt Angelo. Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, to 29 August; touring to 4 April MG Three of the best ... dance shows Invisible Cities It is the USP of Manchester international festival to create works that do not fit into ordinary categories. This one is an immersive mesh of dance, theatre and digital projections, based on the story of Marco Polo meeting the Kublai Khan, with collaborating creatives including Rambert, choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui and 59 Productions. Mayfield, Manchester, Thursday 4 to 14 July Sara Baras This year\u2019s flamenco festival kicks off with Sara Baras, a gossip-mag-worthy star in Spain, who boasts blistering technique and great stage presence. This show, Sombras, celebrates the 20th anniversary of her company and focuses on the farruca footwork usually performed by men. Sadler\u2019s Wells, EC1, Tuesday 2 to 7 July Alphabus Reggie \u201cRegg Roc\u201d Gray \u2013 Brooklyn\u2019s originator of the streetdance style flexing \u2013 pairs dancers from NYC with local poets to tackle stories from marginalised voices in what should be a thought-provoking blend of spoken word and dance.

      "body": "<p>German singer Kim Petras has been dropping songs steadily all year, piercing the attention economy with addictively crafted bubblegum pop. Seven of those tracks appear on her new project, Clarity, and while none have yet found mainstream notoriety, they echo the Top 40 of the early 2000s: the shimmery retro bop Sweet Spot, bass-heavy Meet the Parents and the deliciously tragic emo-pop of All I Do is Cry. Having studied at the schools of Britney and Christina, Petras sounds like a superstar from a parallel universe. But like collaborator Charli XCX, she experiments at the periphery of mainstream pop, eluding household-name status.</p> <p>Clarity\u2019s high-gloss sound comes from the producer behind it: Lukasz Gottwald, AKA Dr Luke, whom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/14/singer-kesha-sues-producer-dr-luke-sexual-battery\">Kesha accused </a>of rape and abusive behaviour in 2014. (Gottwald has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/14/dr-luke-denies-kesha-claim-raped-katy-perry\">denied </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/14/dr-luke-denies-kesha-claim-raped-katy-perry\">the claims</a> and has filed a lawsuit against Kesha for breach of contract and defamation.) For some, the project will always be tainted by association.

      "bodyText": "German singer Kim Petras has been dropping songs steadily all year, piercing the attention economy with addictively crafted bubblegum pop. Seven of those tracks appear on her new project, Clarity, and while none have yet found mainstream notoriety, they echo the Top 40 of the early 2000s: the shimmery retro bop Sweet Spot, bass-heavy Meet the Parents and the deliciously tragic emo-pop of All I Do is Cry. Having studied at the schools of Britney and Christina, Petras sounds like a superstar from a parallel universe. But like collaborator Charli XCX, she experiments at the periphery of mainstream pop, eluding household-name status. Clarity\u2019s high-gloss sound comes from the producer behind it: Lukasz Gottwald, AKA Dr Luke, whom Kesha accused of rape and abusive behaviour in 2014. (Gottwald has denied the claims and has filed a lawsuit against Kesha for breach of contract and defamation.) For some, the project will always be tainted by association. But the appeal of these songs lies in Petras\u2019 blithe confidence, with pool-party hooks about self-love that resonate particularly with her LGBTQ fanbase. While unafraid to be vulnerable, her pounding rhythms and messages of resilience are what give heart to songs like Blow It All (\u201cTonight, we live like we\u2019re not gonna die\u201d). Pop music today is arguably more political than ever, but the very best pop songs offer either campy escapism or strengthening mantras. Petras clearly knows this. Her carefree hooks glisten like suits of armour.",

The US have only lost once in their last 42 games and it happened to be in a January friendly against France, in France. But then again, the No 1-ranked USA\u2019s 20 goals for and one against is easily the most convincing record in the tournament so far.</p> <p>It ought to be a close one, so here are the factors that may determine who wins USA v France:</p> <h2><strong>The set piece battle</strong></h2> <p>\u201cWe take set pieces very seriously,\u201d Megan Rapinoe said in France before the USA\u2019s first game of the tournament. \u201cThose are moments you can practice, you can set things up, you can potentially catch the other team off guard, go quickly or if you\u2019e got tricky plays. We have a lot of specialists in all the different areas of set plays.\u201d</p> <p>Although the Americans are traditionally been strong on set pieces, such scenarios haven\u2019t been the deciding factor for the Americans yet. France, meanwhile, have scored five of their goals in this tournament from set plays.</p> <p>Samantha Mewis, standing at almost 6ft tall, is the tallest outfield player the US have ever had. Wendie Renard, the French center back, has at least two inches on her and is the tallest player in this World Cup. If there\u2019s a play the US will have to watch on corner kicks, it is surely Renard.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s great in the air and a really well-rounded player,\u201d Mewis said Wednesday. \u201cWe all have so much respect for her and I think our setup on set pieces will remain the same \u2013 we just have to make sure were doing our jobs and executing because she\u2019s definitely dangerous.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45686a8013dcb6c32f7b282d034644d031d4156e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45686a8013dcb6c32f7b282d034644d031d4156e/0_209_3804_2282/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wendie Renard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The size of French center back Wendie Renard, the tallest player in this World Cup, is cause for concern in the American camp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Catherine Steenkeste/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The winger who flies</strong></h2> <p>France and the US are similar teams in a lot of ways. They are potent in the attack, a little less potent in defense and, heck, they even wear he same colors. But one of the areas on the field that are the most similar are the wings \u2013 that\u2019s where both teams generate much of their goals, and that may be where Friday\u2019s clash is determined.</p> <p>On the French side, they\u2019ve got players like Kadidiatou Diani, Delphine Cascarino and Eugenie Le Sommer that can work the channel and punish back lines. Add in a fullback like Amel Marjri bombing forward, and the American defense will have their hands full.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not as if the American wingers can\u2019t give as good as they get. Tobin Heath and Megan Rapinoe are known less for their acceleration than they are for their craftiness and creativity, and they almost always seem to find the way to unlock defenses. Add in the overlapping runs and speed of fullbacks Kelley O\u2019Hara and Crystal Dunn, and it\u2019s easy to see why most of the USA\u2019s chances start on the wings.</p> <p>Notably, the USA\u2019s wingers struggled a bit against Spain, and the Americans had to resort to two penalty kicks bailing them out. Rapinoe joked afterward: \u201cI don\u2019t think I had a great game. The right back did a great job.

      "bodyText": "Sexual violence is on the increase both inside and outside of wartime contexts and women remain the primary victims, warns new research. In their report, researchers from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (Acled) analysed data gathered from 400 recorded sexual violence events that occurred between January 2018 and June 2019. They found an overall increase in reported events where the offender directly targeted women and girls; in only 5% of cases were the victims male. At 140, the total number of reported events nearly doubled in the first three months of 2019 compared with the same period in 2018. The report\u2019s authors said this was \u201clargely due to an upward trend in violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which consistently registers high levels of reported sexual violence\u201d. Dr Roudabeh Kishi, director of research at Acled, said: \u201cIt is important to remember that sexual violence in or outside of conflict remains a pressing issue for victims, regardless of gender or age.\u201d Identifying that the primary perpetrators of public, political sexual attacks were regional political militias followed by state forces, Acled compared statistics for 2018 and 2019 in order to identify high-risk regions where women are more vulnerable to attack. In 2018, the Democratic Republic of the Congo topped the list followed by South Sudan, Burundi, India and Sudan. By 2019, the list had changed, with India rising to second place behind the DRC. South Sudan and Burundi followed, with Mozambique and Zimbabwe in equal fifth position. In both years, researchers found that events were often accompanied by lethal attacks, especially during armed conflict. Breaking down the data into regions, Acled found that the largest proportion of reported events were committed by political militias, anonymous or unidentified armed groups in Africa and south Asia. In the Middle East, south-east Asia, eastern and south-eastern Europe and the Balkans, events were carried out by state forces. In the same time period, more than 100 government-perpetrated sexual violence events were recorded, which accounted for more than a quarter of all incidents that occurred or were most common in India, the DRC, Myanmar, South Sudan, Burundi, and Sudan. There are no comprehensive statistics for the number of women and men subjected to sexual violence during conflict, but the figures are believed to be in the thousands. According to Acled, women are frequently targeted during political violence, which makes up only one-third of all events involving violence targeting women and extends beyond sexual violence, where they say that levels of organised violence are high. However, even where they identified that organised violence was not the primary objective, women often still face high levels of targeting outside of conventional conflict: for example, attempts by a state to enforce order through repression, or a mob targeting a woman accused of indecency. Such instances have arisen in Burundi and Pakistan, which provide indicative case studies. \u201cOn the heels of commemorating the international day for the elimination of sexual violence in conflict, we need the support of states to hold perpetrators accountable,\u201d said Kishi. \u201cIt is damning to find that some states are among the primary perpetrators of such violence themselves. Impunity plays a troubling role in the continuation of such violence.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When Kim Jong-un inherited control of North Korea at the end of 2011, becoming the \u201cGreat Successor\u201d to his father, Kim Jong-il, there was widespread scepticism that the pudgy, basketball-loving 27-year-old was up to the task of running the world\u2019s most totalitarian state. It was a state that had survived the collapse of the Soviet Union, the death of its lionised founder, a famine, and the transformation of China, its last remaining benefactor. But many predicted that the Kim family\u2019s luck had finally run out. \u201cNorth Korea as we know it is over,\u201d a former Korea adviser to President George W Bush declared. I, too, could not fathom how this dynasty could accomplish the unprecedented transition to a third generation. Since my first trip to Pyongyang in 2005 and North Korea\u2019s first nuclear test the following year, I had seen its decrepit economy crumble further and its international isolation deepen. I had talked to escapees from North Korea about the profound deprivations of life inside the country and witnessed their visceral hatred for the Kim regime.</p> <p>I had watched as the regime fast-tracked the preparations for the succession, squeezing into two years what it had spent 25 years doing when preparing the populace for the transition from Kim Il-sung to Kim Jong-il. It was in 2009 that North Koreans first began hearing about the \u201cLeader Comrade\u201d Kim Jong-un. They were told he had \u201cPaektu blood\u201drunning through his veins, a reference to the mountain in the north of the country that supposedly conferred divine status on the family. The regime\u2019s propagandists didn\u2019t go as far as they had with his father \u2013 they said a bright star appeared in the sky the night Kim Jong-il was supposedly born on Mount Paektu \u2013 but they did make up some fanciful stories. They said that Kim Jong-un could fire a gun and hit a lightbulb 100 metres away at age three, that by the time he was eight, he could not only drive a truck but he could drive it at 80 miles an hour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2a80d4aa48e679fed4878b018d8837ba393d5168\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a80d4aa48e679fed4878b018d8837ba393d5168/0_0_2500_2700/926.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Jong-un as a boy with his father, front left, and other family members.\" width=\"926\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Jong-un as a boy with his father, front left, and other family members.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/EPN/Photoshot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Surely the military top brass and party officials who had supported his grandfather and then his father would not tolerate this young upstart? Surely the North Korean people, many of whom had now seen smuggled South Korean soap operas and Chinese action films and knew that the outside world was a much better place, would not stomach him? Yet when I returned to North Korea in 2014, , my first trip since Kim Jong-un had taken over, I found that the Great Successor was not just surviving but thriving. Pyongyang had a new Potemkin facade. There were high-rise buildings going up, a German beer hall and cafes selling cappuccinos with little bear faces in the foam. There was a sense of aspiration and an air of leisure that I\u2019d never felt before. This section of the showcase capital, home to those most loyal to the regime, was now sometimes called \u201cPyonghattan\u201d.</p> <p>Beyond the facades, things were still broken. The ordinary housing areas were very run-down, and even these fancy new buildings didn\u2019t have enough power to pump the water or run the lifts. The most sought-after apartments are on the low floors because no one wants to carry their shopping up 20 flights of stairs. But it was clear that Kim Jong-un was trying to make sure that the 1%, those who keep the regime in power, had reason to be loyal.</p> <p>Contrary to the popular perception of a cartoonish amateur, Kim Jong-un has proved to be calculating and ruthless. I wanted to find out everything there was to know about this man. I wanted to know how he sleeps at night given the brutal things he has done in power. To find out, I sought out anyone who had ever met him. I interviewed the Japanese chef who moved to North Korea to make sushi for the ruling family. Kim Jong-un had an isolated, lonely childhood, so from the age of six, he latched on to the eccentric sushi master. They would listen to Whitney Houston on the chef\u2019s Walkman, fly kites and go fishing together. Kim Jong-un would grab the rod out of the chef\u2019s hand and claim the credit for catching the fish.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>At eight, he was presented with a little general\u2019s uniform and announced as his father\u2019s heir. Real generals saluted him</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I found his aunt and uncle who had been his guardians when he went to school in Switzerland at the age of 12. They posed as his parents there. They described to me a teenager who was obsessed with planes and engines, and then with basketball, sleeping with his ball and playing every day after school. At his eighth birthday party, they told me, he was presented with a little general\u2019s uniform and it was announced he would be his father\u2019s heir. Real generals saluted him, top party officials bowed to him.</p> <p>While the rest of the country lived in abject poverty, Kim Jong-un lived in palatial compounds filled with Sony televisions, pinball machines and grand pianos. The kitchens brimmed with French pastries, smoked salmon and pat\u00e9, mangos and melons. The Kim children wore clothes made especially for them with British fabric that arrived by the Samsonite suitcase load. They brushed their teeth with imported Colgate.</p> <p>While famine ravaged his home country, the teenage Kim Jong-un went to basketball games in Paris, swam in the Mediterranean and skied in the Swiss Alps. All the while, his mother, North Korea\u2019s de facto first lady and a woman who had high ambitions for her children, made sure her sons would have all the training they needed to take over the family business \u2013 and to edge out Kim Jong-il\u2019s oldest son, by a different mother, Kim Jong-nam. After they returned from Switzerland, she sent them to North Korea\u2019s premier military academy, one named after their grandfather, so they could stake a claim to leading this \u201cmilitary first\u201d regime. And thanks to her hard work and his natural aptitude, Kim Jong-un rose to the top and was unveiled in 2009 as his father\u2019s successor.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The same people who assisted him could also challenge him. So once they had served their purpose, he got rid of them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite the caricature of him as madman, Kim Jong-un has approached his task with surprising savvy. He has operated in a textbook way for a dictator who is hellbent on staying in power. To treat him as a joke is to underestimate the threat that he poses both to the outside world and also, on a daily basis, to the 25 million people of North Korea. By allowing senior officials to use their positions to enrich themselves, he has created a class of kleptocrats who have a vested interest in his regime. Military officials run construction projects, taking a cut from the Chinese investors. Managers of defunct factories rent space to entrepreneurs seeking to produce everything from canned fish to methamphetamine. Officials sent abroad to manage North Korean labourers for the regime line their pockets on the side.</p> <p>He has made sure that their children, the millennials of Pyonghattan, enjoy some of the trappings of wealth that they might have if they lived in Beijing or Seoul. They take selfies with their smartphones, swing their Gucci purses, watch Disney cartoons in the gym as they work out. Many of the treadmills bear little red plaques stating that they were supplied by the respected and beloved comrade Kim Jong-un, just to make sure they don\u2019t forget to whom they owe this lifestyle. But it\u2019s not enough to create loyalty. He has also made sure to instil fear into these elites. </p> <p>When he took over the family business in 2011, he had the advice of senior officials who had supported his father and grandfather. This North Korean brains trust helped him navigate his first years in power. There was the head of the military, the powerful propaganda chief, and his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, who was focused on the economy and relations in China. But the same people who could assist him could also potentially build their own powerbases and challenge him. So once they had served their purpose, he got rid of them. The head of the army disappeared. The propaganda chief, too. But Uncle Jang didn\u2019t just vanish. He was publicly hauled out of a Communist party meeting and denounced in state media as \u201cdespicable human scum\u201d. A few days later, he was executed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/11/kim-jong-nam-half-brother-north-korea-leader-was-cia-informant\">Kim Jong-nam, half-brother of North Korean leader, 'was a CIA informant'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kim Jong-un was sending a message: don\u2019t even think about crossing me. He reinforced this message in spectacular fashion in 2017, when he had his half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, very painfully and publicly killed with a chemical weapon in Kuala Lumpur airport. During the course of reporting this book, I uncovered another reason why Kim Jong-un may have wanted his half-brother dead. Kim Jong-nam had become an informant for the CIA. He would meet his handlers in various parts of south-east Asia and provide them with information about the regime. Although he had no relationship with his half-brother, Kim Jong-nam still had contacts with senior figures in the regime and could have provided valuable information to the Americans.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Dissenters must be willing to risk not just their own lives but those of three generations of their families, too</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As for the general population, he has continued the system of all-encompassing surveillance and repression. As many as 120,000 people are held in political prison camps in the mountains, where they must work in mines or do other hard labour for very little food. It is a vast gulag. Anyone who questions Kim Jong-un\u2019s leadership or, say, why he is spending so much on the nuclear programme when North Koreans still struggle to get enough food can find themselves consigned there for years. And Kim Jong-un doesn\u2019t just throw the so-called perpetrators into these camps, but three generations of their families. A dissenter must be willing to risk not just their own life to criticise the regime, but the lives of their parents and their spouse and children, too. For this reason, there are no dissidents in North Korea. There\u2019s no equivalent of Liu Xiaobo, the Chinese human rights activist and Nobel laureate who died in prison. There\u2019s no North Korean <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/dec/11/my-day-in-the-life-of-aleksandr-solzhenitsyn-gulag-centenary\" title=\"\">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</a>, documenting life in the gulags. There\u2019s not even graffiti. Punishment is so severe that, as one woman who\u2019d made it out told me, you can\u2019t try to change the system, you can only try to escape it. That is why, after studying Kim Jong-un these past four years, I concluded that he\u2019s not likely to disappear soon. He has proved to be surprisingly strategic: he has nuclear weapons and has allowed a more market-based economy to grow. His grandfather lived to the age of 82. His father made it to 70. Kim Jong-un is now 35.

      "bodyText": "When Kim Jong-un inherited control of North Korea at the end of 2011, becoming the \u201cGreat Successor\u201d to his father, Kim Jong-il, there was widespread scepticism that the pudgy, basketball-loving 27-year-old was up to the task of running the world\u2019s most totalitarian state. It was a state that had survived the collapse of the Soviet Union, the death of its lionised founder, a famine, and the transformation of China, its last remaining benefactor. But many predicted that the Kim family\u2019s luck had finally run out. \u201cNorth Korea as we know it is over,\u201d a former Korea adviser to President George W Bush declared. I, too, could not fathom how this dynasty could accomplish the unprecedented transition to a third generation. Since my first trip to Pyongyang in 2005 and North Korea\u2019s first nuclear test the following year, I had seen its decrepit economy crumble further and its international isolation deepen. I had talked to escapees from North Korea about the profound deprivations of life inside the country and witnessed their visceral hatred for the Kim regime. I had watched as the regime fast-tracked the preparations for the succession, squeezing into two years what it had spent 25 years doing when preparing the populace for the transition from Kim Il-sung to Kim Jong-il. It was in 2009 that North Koreans first began hearing about the \u201cLeader Comrade\u201d Kim Jong-un. They were told he had \u201cPaektu blood\u201drunning through his veins, a reference to the mountain in the north of the country that supposedly conferred divine status on the family. The regime\u2019s propagandists didn\u2019t go as far as they had with his father \u2013 they said a bright star appeared in the sky the night Kim Jong-il was supposedly born on Mount Paektu \u2013 but they did make up some fanciful stories. They said that Kim Jong-un could fire a gun and hit a lightbulb 100 metres away at age three, that by the time he was eight, he could not only drive a truck but he could drive it at 80 miles an hour. Surely the military top brass and party officials who had supported his grandfather and then his father would not tolerate this young upstart? Surely the North Korean people, many of whom had now seen smuggled South Korean soap operas and Chinese action films and knew that the outside world was a much better place, would not stomach him? Yet when I returned to North Korea in 2014, , my first trip since Kim Jong-un had taken over, I found that the Great Successor was not just surviving but thriving. Pyongyang had a new Potemkin facade. There were high-rise buildings going up, a German beer hall and cafes selling cappuccinos with little bear faces in the foam. There was a sense of aspiration and an air of leisure that I\u2019d never felt before. This section of the showcase capital, home to those most loyal to the regime, was now sometimes called \u201cPyonghattan\u201d. Beyond the facades, things were still broken. The ordinary housing areas were very run-down, and even these fancy new buildings didn\u2019t have enough power to pump the water or run the lifts. The most sought-after apartments are on the low floors because no one wants to carry their shopping up 20 flights of stairs. But it was clear that Kim Jong-un was trying to make sure that the 1%, those who keep the regime in power, had reason to be loyal. Contrary to the popular perception of a cartoonish amateur, Kim Jong-un has proved to be calculating and ruthless. I wanted to find out everything there was to know about this man. I wanted to know how he sleeps at night given the brutal things he has done in power. To find out, I sought out anyone who had ever met him. I interviewed the Japanese chef who moved to North Korea to make sushi for the ruling family. Kim Jong-un had an isolated, lonely childhood, so from the age of six, he latched on to the eccentric sushi master. They would listen to Whitney Houston on the chef\u2019s Walkman, fly kites and go fishing together. Kim Jong-un would grab the rod out of the chef\u2019s hand and claim the credit for catching the fish. I found his aunt and uncle who had been his guardians when he went to school in Switzerland at the age of 12. They posed as his parents there. They described to me a teenager who was obsessed with planes and engines, and then with basketball, sleeping with his ball and playing every day after school. At his eighth birthday party, they told me, he was presented with a little general\u2019s uniform and it was announced he would be his father\u2019s heir. Real generals saluted him, top party officials bowed to him. While the rest of the country lived in abject poverty, Kim Jong-un lived in palatial compounds filled with Sony televisions, pinball machines and grand pianos. The kitchens brimmed with French pastries, smoked salmon and pat\u00e9, mangos and melons. The Kim children wore clothes made especially for them with British fabric that arrived by the Samsonite suitcase load. They brushed their teeth with imported Colgate. While famine ravaged his home country, the teenage Kim Jong-un went to basketball games in Paris, swam in the Mediterranean and skied in the Swiss Alps. All the while, his mother, North Korea\u2019s de facto first lady and a woman who had high ambitions for her children, made sure her sons would have all the training they needed to take over the family business \u2013 and to edge out Kim Jong-il\u2019s oldest son, by a different mother, Kim Jong-nam. After they returned from Switzerland, she sent them to North Korea\u2019s premier military academy, one named after their grandfather, so they could stake a claim to leading this \u201cmilitary first\u201d regime. And thanks to her hard work and his natural aptitude, Kim Jong-un rose to the top and was unveiled in 2009 as his father\u2019s successor. Despite the caricature of him as madman, Kim Jong-un has approached his task with surprising savvy. He has operated in a textbook way for a dictator who is hellbent on staying in power. To treat him as a joke is to underestimate the threat that he poses both to the outside world and also, on a daily basis, to the 25 million people of North Korea. By allowing senior officials to use their positions to enrich themselves, he has created a class of kleptocrats who have a vested interest in his regime. Military officials run construction projects, taking a cut from the Chinese investors. Managers of defunct factories rent space to entrepreneurs seeking to produce everything from canned fish to methamphetamine. Officials sent abroad to manage North Korean labourers for the regime line their pockets on the side. He has made sure that their children, the millennials of Pyonghattan, enjoy some of the trappings of wealth that they might have if they lived in Beijing or Seoul. They take selfies with their smartphones, swing their Gucci purses, watch Disney cartoons in the gym as they work out. Many of the treadmills bear little red plaques stating that they were supplied by the respected and beloved comrade Kim Jong-un, just to make sure they don\u2019t forget to whom they owe this lifestyle. But it\u2019s not enough to create loyalty. He has also made sure to instil fear into these elites. When he took over the family business in 2011, he had the advice of senior officials who had supported his father and grandfather. This North Korean brains trust helped him navigate his first years in power. There was the head of the military, the powerful propaganda chief, and his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, who was focused on the economy and relations in China. But the same people who could assist him could also potentially build their own powerbases and challenge him. So once they had served their purpose, he got rid of them. The head of the army disappeared. The propaganda chief, too. But Uncle Jang didn\u2019t just vanish. He was publicly hauled out of a Communist party meeting and denounced in state media as \u201cdespicable human scum\u201d. A few days later, he was executed. Kim Jong-un was sending a message: don\u2019t even think about crossing me. He reinforced this message in spectacular fashion in 2017, when he had his half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, very painfully and publicly killed with a chemical weapon in Kuala Lumpur airport. During the course of reporting this book, I uncovered another reason why Kim Jong-un may have wanted his half-brother dead. Kim Jong-nam had become an informant for the CIA. He would meet his handlers in various parts of south-east Asia and provide them with information about the regime. Although he had no relationship with his half-brother, Kim Jong-nam still had contacts with senior figures in the regime and could have provided valuable information to the Americans. As for the general population, he has continued the system of all-encompassing surveillance and repression. As many as 120,000 people are held in political prison camps in the mountains, where they must work in mines or do other hard labour for very little food. It is a vast gulag. Anyone who questions Kim Jong-un\u2019s leadership or, say, why he is spending so much on the nuclear programme when North Koreans still struggle to get enough food can find themselves consigned there for years. And Kim Jong-un doesn\u2019t just throw the so-called perpetrators into these camps, but three generations of their families. A dissenter must be willing to risk not just their own life to criticise the regime, but the lives of their parents and their spouse and children, too. For this reason, there are no dissidents in North Korea. There\u2019s no equivalent of Liu Xiaobo, the Chinese human rights activist and Nobel laureate who died in prison. There\u2019s no North Korean Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, documenting life in the gulags. There\u2019s not even graffiti. Punishment is so severe that, as one woman who\u2019d made it out told me, you can\u2019t try to change the system, you can only try to escape it. That is why, after studying Kim Jong-un these past four years, I concluded that he\u2019s not likely to disappear soon. He has proved to be surprisingly strategic: he has nuclear weapons and has allowed a more market-based economy to grow. His grandfather lived to the age of 82. His father made it to 70. Kim Jong-un is now 35. There is no end in sight for the people of North Korea. \u2022 The Great Successor: The Secret Rise and Rule of Kim Jong Un by Anna Fifield is published by John Murray (RRP \u00a314.99) To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Now that they\u2019ve compiled \u201ca permanent history of everything a user has searched for, every website they have visited, activity from any other app, site or device that uses Google services, and a record of their physical movements\u201d, we can now limit our immersion within their perpetual panopticon within three-month frames. What liberty! One supposes that the new benevolence results from Google having gobbled all they need to know of us, already. No one, of course, remembers volunteering for this \u201cvoluntary\u201d surveillance. We should be glad. Glad that now the election is over and Clive Palmer has the government he wanted, he\u2019ll no longer be harvesting Facebook user data from the digital backdoors of funny downloadable games. Glad that the exposure of the viral, insistent and thoroughly fake online accusations that Labor planned a \u201cdeath tax\u201d, the Liberals\u2019 next digital campaign will be obliged to summon the creativity for a new lie. Glad that the former senator who may get a million Facebook hits for hate-filled rants, wasn\u2019t re-elected. These aren\u2019t compensations. There is no relief to be found in reading a recent Buzzfeed piece about a 14 year old female YouTube sensation, whose white supremacist stand up has gone viral \u2013 not when she\u2019s symptomatic of new, young extremists, not atypical. I\u2019m not cheered by the fake branded wedding videos pushing products without disclaimers, the erosion of news consumption standards or the development of \u201cdeep fake\u201d technology that can wreck and spin the controlled articulation of Speaker Nancy Pelosi into a slurring drunk. This last is already already being used to graft the faces of the unwilling and unconsenting onto porn. Destroy the machines. I hate what they\u2019re doing to me. I just came back from a holiday in which at one point I discovered myself framing so many photos of Instragrammable sunsets that it occurred to me I could have saved myself the airfare and just watched some kind of Google Image slideshow of every place I went instead. Indeed, since camera phone technology, so many photos of so many things have been taken from so many angles, there is no longer a need for any of us to go anywhere to see anything. Don\u2019t believe me? Hit an Instagram geolocation tag and gasp as a portfolio of its every centrimetre appears and your sense of discovery dies, your surprise extinguished, and all wonder lost. Or maybe not all wonder. Each morning I wake and check my phone with an acrid curiosity at which hate may dominate the screen: gendered? Racist? Personal? To the suburban great-grandmother who hit my Facebook page with claims that LGBTQIA+ Australians from \u201cthat dance scene\u201d were conspiring to form firing squads, hello. Studies have found teenagers today now do less drugs and have less sex and are increasingly unhappy. Let\u2019s congratulate the mobile phones for achieving a greater sadness than that of the heroin generations. Because these hand-held hate fountains are apparently more addictive, and, also, inextricable. We can try to ban them. We can try to teach kids \u2013 and ourselves \u2013 how to read them, cynically and powerfully, deploying the full force of critical literacy training for which we invented \u201ceducation\u201d in the first place. But, most of all, we must muster a distrust, and learn to hate them. If we don\u2019t, I fear, the sadness and the rage that they impart \u2026 is just beginning.

      "bodyText": "Facebook and Google are likely to face a strong push for new regulators in Australia to oversee news and advertising on their platforms following the completion of the competition regulator\u2019s inquiry into the tech giants. In December 2017, then-treasurer Scott Morrison directed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to look at the impact that search engines, social media platforms and other online aggregation sites were having on competition in media and advertising. The impact has been massive on advertising for publishers in Australia alone. In its preliminary report on the Digital Platforms Inquiry, the ACCC estimated that for every $100 spent on digital advertising in Australia, $47 goes to Google, $21 goes to Facebook and $32 goes to all other websites. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is believed to have sent its final report to government on Friday ahead of an expected public release sometime later this year. It is expected that many of the recommendations of the interim report will be included in the final report, but the ACCC would not comment about the report before its public release. The biggest recommendation in the interim report is for a regulatory authority to monitor the advertising business for companies such as Google and Facebook to ensure the companies are not engaged in anti-competitive behaviour over how ads rank, particularly for businesses in direct competition with their own products. The other main recommendation was for the same regulator to also oversee how the sites rank news content on their sites, and how users are directed to media sites from those platforms. The ACCC also strongly recommended boosting Australia\u2019s Privacy Act and privacy principles, with increased requirements on getting user consent before collecting personal information, as well as the ability for users to erase their personal information from a site. Facebook and Google in particular aren\u2019t happy with the proposed changes. While neither was commenting before the final report\u2019s release, in response to the interim report, the tech giants told the ACCC earlier this year that the proposed changes could harm news reporting in Australia. \u201cTheir effect would be to protect selected news publishers from competition while sacrificing benefits enjoyed by millions of Australian users and advertisers \u2014 all without evidence that anyone has misused market power,\u201d Facebook said. \u201cPeople, not regulators, should decide what they see in their News Feeds. The purpose of News Feed is to connect people to their friends and family and to content they care about, not to deliver specific levels of traffic to third-party sites.\u201d Facebook argued it had been transparent over changes to its algorithm used to determine what people see on their news feeds through a blog it had set up on the feed. Google agreed that the proposed regulator could potentially benefit incumbent news providers at the expense of consumers. \u201cThe preliminary recommendations to impose regulatory oversight of ranking based on feedback from news publishers could result in Google\u2019s algorithms being modified to better serve incumbent news suppliers\u2019 interests to the detriment of the interests of smaller publishers and consumers,\u201d Google said. Facebook argued, in contrast with much of the recent reporting about how Facebook users\u2019 data had been used, that its services were \u201cdesigned to protect the privacy of our users\u201d. Google argued the ACCC already had sufficient powers to investigate anti-competitive behaviour and had not identified any instances of Google favouring its own products over competitors. News publishers are likely to pressure the government to act on the recommendations, once released. In response to the interim report, News Corp said a regulator would be \u201can important step to countering the market power exercised by digital platforms \u2026 and addressing the lack of transparency of algorithms.\u201d News Corp said Google and Facebook had too much power in news referral. \u201cThis substantial market power underpins the harms perpetuated by digital platforms against publishers such as News Corp Australia.\u201d In its submission, Guardian Australia supported introduction of the regulatory authority to oversee news ranking and advertising on the digital platforms. On the other hand, Nine \u2013 the new owner of the publisher formerly known as Fairfax \u2013 said a new regulatory body would stall any meaningful immediate action, and the ACCC should be responsible for overseeing digital platforms. One immediate issue for Australian publishers is the liability they face for comments posted on their Facebook pages. Unfortunately, the report\u2019s timing means the ACCC did not have time to consider the implications of the federal court ruling that news publishers are liable for defamatory Facebook comments.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>20. Oasis of the Zombies (1981)</strong></h2> <p>The zombie genre has long had a vehemently offensive \u201cNazi\u201d subsection and this is a perfect example. Members of Rommel\u2019s Afrika Corps are still alive in the desert as zombies, guarding a cache of Nazi gold. So at least they are preoccupied with something other than their own selfish flesh-hunger.</p> <h2><strong>19. Zombieland (2009)</strong></h2> <p>This zombie comedy stars Jesse Eisenberg as the nervy, obsessive-compulsive survivor of a zombieocalypse, who goes on the road with Woody Harrelson.</p> <h2><strong>18. Burial Ground (1981)</strong></h2> <p>AKA Le Notti Del Terrore, or The Nights of Terror, and a ripe example of Italian grindhouse zombie-ism. A professor accidentally triggers an ancient curse, causing those buried at sea to rise from the waves and attack the wealthy folk thereabouts.</p> <h2><strong>17. </strong><strong>V/H/S (2012)</strong></h2> <p>Tape 56 is the overarching \u201cframing narrative\u201d that stitches together the found-footage short stories in this portmanteau movie. Some criminals watch a series of mysterious videotapes they find on a TV, before which sits the corpse of an old man. But this man is a zombie.</p> <h2><strong>16. Cemetery Man (1984)</strong></h2> <p>Not much liked in its day, this zombie horror-comedy from <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0811714/\" title=\"\">Michele Soavi</a> (an apprentice of Dario Argento) now has a cult following, not least among Rupert Everett superfans. Their idol plays a cemetery caretaker whose corpses are stirring.</p> <h2><strong>15. Night of the Creeps (1986)</strong></h2> <p>Another gruesome, yucksome mashup, with hints of sci-fi alien invasion, slasher horror and animal house antics to go with the zombie-ism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1fd27a9b3fecfbd811dcd16e84166db2884c5df9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fd27a9b3fecfbd811dcd16e84166db2884c5df9/95_0_2811_1687/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ParaNorman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ParaNorman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>14. ParaNorman (2012)</strong></h2> <p>Zombie animations for kids are rare but this one has a weird sort of charm. A kid called Norman tries to save his community from attack by 16th-century zombies.</p> <h2><strong>13. White Zombie (1932)</strong></h2> <p>Here is a ripe example of Hollywood\u2019s love of sensational creepiness before the Hays Code was enforced \u2013 it is the first-ever zombie feature film, starring Bela Lugosi as a Haitian voodoo chieftain who commands a horde of \u2013 gulp! \u2013 zombies.</p> <h2><strong>12. Shock Waves (1977)</strong></h2> <p>Otherwise known as Almost Human, this is another in the fiercely tasteless \u201cNazi\u201d subgenre with no less a star than Peter Cushing playing the fugitive SS commandant secretly training a battalion of zombies.</p> <h2><strong>11. Re-Animator (1985)</strong></h2> <p>There could be some scholarly debate among zombieologists as to whether this counts as a zombie film, or if it is more neo-Frankenstein. An adaptation of an HP Lovecraft novelette series about a scientist who, deplorably, revives dead bodies into a zombie state.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84bbd49c7f6f17394f0baa46871ff14e7ba6b340\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84bbd49c7f6f17394f0baa46871ff14e7ba6b340/0_82_2745_1647/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Braindead.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Braindead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/POLYGRAM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>10. Endzeit (2018)</strong></h2> <p>Carolina Hellsg\u00e5rd directs this instant cult film, adapted by Olivia Vieweg from her graphic novel \u2013 and hailed as the first feminist zombie film; one that also satirises Europe\u2019s migrant paranoia. Two young women travel across a post-zombie-apocalyptic Germany in which most of humanity has been wiped out. In one city, Weimar, zombies are slaughtered. In another, Jena, the hunt is on for a cure \u2013 and that is where the women are going.</p> <h2><strong>9. The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988)</strong></h2> <p>This is the zombie film that has the distinction of being based on an (allegedly) true story, outlined in a b<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31490.The_Serpent_and_the_Rainbow\" title=\"\">ook of the same name by the historian Wade Davis</a>.

People suspected of zombie bites are treated unsentimentally, to say the least. <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/far-flung-correspondents/one-of-the-most-disgusting-horror-films-ever-made\" title=\"\">Roger Ebert </a><a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/far-flung-correspondents/one-of-the-most-disgusting-horror-films-ever-made\" title=\"\">hailed Braindead as one of the most disgusting horror films ever made</a>, and also one of the funniest; it contains the deathless exchange: \u201cYour mother ate my dog!\u201d \u201cNot all of it.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>7. 28 Days Later (2002)</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/21/danny-boyle-they-should-get-robert-pattinson-to-be-the-next-james-bond\" title=\"\">Danny Boyle</a> made pioneering use of lightweight digital cameras and shot early in the morning in London to get shots of an apparently deserted capital about to be overrun by zombies. It was in the spirit of British postapocalyptic fantasies such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jan/08/how-we-made-threads\" title=\"\">Threads</a> and Survivors: animal rights activists have released chimps infected with a dangerous \u201crage\u201d virus that passes to humans. This was the movie that gave zombie-ism a boost in the 21st century.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a4a3881a50eeb9d6f020aa7fbdab98dc41dd1c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a4a3881a50eeb9d6f020aa7fbdab98dc41dd1c3/0_26_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One Cut of the Dead .\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One Cut of the Dead .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Third Window Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>6. One Cut of the Dead (2019)</strong></h2> <p>This modern classic from Japan gives us something that can only be called meta-zombies. It is a self-deconstructing zombies-on-screen nightmare that has been compared to Michael Frayn\u2019s stage comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/dec/14/noises-off-review\" title=\"\">Noises Off</a>. A low-budget zombie horror shoot is invaded \u2013 to the jaded director\u2019s ecstasy \u2013 by a shambling horde of real zombies. But is that really what\u2019s going on?</p> <h2><strong>5. Shaun of the Dead (2004)</strong></h2> <p>Two years after Boyle\u2019s zombie achievement, Edgar Wright created <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/18/shaun-dead-comedy\" title=\"\">his masterly tribute to the genre \u2013</a> a story of zombies in London\u2019s leafy Crouch End neighbourhood, which jolted the corpse-like Brit industry back into life and also reawakened interest in the great master George A Romero. The film contains the classic description of the zombie\u2019s perpetual air of morose, malign resentment: \u201cLike a drunk who has lost a bet.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f0f146f27be67e608f0bff50816f94651a5d9772\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0f146f27be67e608f0bff50816f94651a5d9772/0_56_2881_1729/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Nighy in Shaun of the Dead.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Nighy in Shaun of the Dead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar Picture Library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>4. Zombi 2 (1979)</strong></h2> <p>Lucio Fulci\u2019s modern zombie classic is queasily horrible and was to become <a href=\"https://lwlies.com/articles/zombi-2-shark-fight-scene-lucio-fulci/\" title=\"\">notorious in the UK as a \u201cvideo nasty\u201d shocker</a>. It is \u201cZombi 2\u201d in the sense that it was intended as Fulci\u2019s own sequel-style homage to Dawn of the Dead: a woman journeys to a remote Caribbean island on the trail of her missing scientist father. A voodoo curse means that dead bodies roam freely, attacking the living.</p> <h2><strong>3. I Walked With a Zombie (1943)</strong></h2> <p>This is one of the great zombie classics, and a creepy spin on Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s Jane Eyre. It features a nurse who travels to a Caribbean island to attend to a plantation owner, and encounters voodoo rituals and reanimated corpses. It is a fable satirising colonial guilt, the inheritance of slavery and paranoid fear of \u201cthe other\u201d \u2013 an almost poetic zombie adventure.</p> <h2><strong>2.

      "bodyText": "20. Oasis of the Zombies (1981) The zombie genre has long had a vehemently offensive \u201cNazi\u201d subsection and this is a perfect example. Members of Rommel\u2019s Afrika Corps are still alive in the desert as zombies, guarding a cache of Nazi gold. So at least they are preoccupied with something other than their own selfish flesh-hunger. 19. Zombieland (2009) This zombie comedy stars Jesse Eisenberg as the nervy, obsessive-compulsive survivor of a zombieocalypse, who goes on the road with Woody Harrelson. 18. Burial Ground (1981) AKA Le Notti Del Terrore, or The Nights of Terror, and a ripe example of Italian grindhouse zombie-ism. A professor accidentally triggers an ancient curse, causing those buried at sea to rise from the waves and attack the wealthy folk thereabouts. 17. V/H/S (2012) Tape 56 is the overarching \u201cframing narrative\u201d that stitches together the found-footage short stories in this portmanteau movie. Some criminals watch a series of mysterious videotapes they find on a TV, before which sits the corpse of an old man. But this man is a zombie. 16. Cemetery Man (1984) Not much liked in its day, this zombie horror-comedy from Michele Soavi (an apprentice of Dario Argento) now has a cult following, not least among Rupert Everett superfans. Their idol plays a cemetery caretaker whose corpses are stirring. 15. Night of the Creeps (1986) Another gruesome, yucksome mashup, with hints of sci-fi alien invasion, slasher horror and animal house antics to go with the zombie-ism. 14. ParaNorman (2012) Zombie animations for kids are rare but this one has a weird sort of charm. A kid called Norman tries to save his community from attack by 16th-century zombies. 13. White Zombie (1932) Here is a ripe example of Hollywood\u2019s love of sensational creepiness before the Hays Code was enforced \u2013 it is the first-ever zombie feature film, starring Bela Lugosi as a Haitian voodoo chieftain who commands a horde of \u2013 gulp! \u2013 zombies. 12. Shock Waves (1977) Otherwise known as Almost Human, this is another in the fiercely tasteless \u201cNazi\u201d subgenre with no less a star than Peter Cushing playing the fugitive SS commandant secretly training a battalion of zombies. 11. Re-Animator (1985) There could be some scholarly debate among zombieologists as to whether this counts as a zombie film, or if it is more neo-Frankenstein. An adaptation of an HP Lovecraft novelette series about a scientist who, deplorably, revives dead bodies into a zombie state. 10. Endzeit (2018) Carolina Hellsg\u00e5rd directs this instant cult film, adapted by Olivia Vieweg from her graphic novel \u2013 and hailed as the first feminist zombie film; one that also satirises Europe\u2019s migrant paranoia. Two young women travel across a post-zombie-apocalyptic Germany in which most of humanity has been wiped out. In one city, Weimar, zombies are slaughtered. In another, Jena, the hunt is on for a cure \u2013 and that is where the women are going. 9. The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988) This is the zombie film that has the distinction of being based on an (allegedly) true story, outlined in a book of the same name by the historian Wade Davis. He recounted his experiences investigating the case of Clairvius Narcisse, a man in Haiti said to have been turned into a zombie by a voodoo potion containing paralysing puffer-fish venom. 8. Braindead (1992) Before his work on Tolkien and the first world war, Peter Jackson created this much-loved and splattery zombie comedy classic about a zombie outbreak triggered by a rat bite. People suspected of zombie bites are treated unsentimentally, to say the least. Roger Ebert hailed Braindead as one of the most disgusting horror films ever made, and also one of the funniest; it contains the deathless exchange: \u201cYour mother ate my dog!\u201d \u201cNot all of it.\u201d 7. 28 Days Later (2002) Danny Boyle made pioneering use of lightweight digital cameras and shot early in the morning in London to get shots of an apparently deserted capital about to be overrun by zombies. It was in the spirit of British postapocalyptic fantasies such as Threads and Survivors: animal rights activists have released chimps infected with a dangerous \u201crage\u201d virus that passes to humans. This was the movie that gave zombie-ism a boost in the 21st century. 6. One Cut of the Dead (2019) This modern classic from Japan gives us something that can only be called meta-zombies. It is a self-deconstructing zombies-on-screen nightmare that has been compared to Michael Frayn\u2019s stage comedy Noises Off. A low-budget zombie horror shoot is invaded \u2013 to the jaded director\u2019s ecstasy \u2013 by a shambling horde of real zombies. But is that really what\u2019s going on? 5. Shaun of the Dead (2004) Two years after Boyle\u2019s zombie achievement, Edgar Wright created his masterly tribute to the genre \u2013 a story of zombies in London\u2019s leafy Crouch End neighbourhood, which jolted the corpse-like Brit industry back into life and also reawakened interest in the great master George A Romero. The film contains the classic description of the zombie\u2019s perpetual air of morose, malign resentment: \u201cLike a drunk who has lost a bet.\u201d 4. Zombi 2 (1979) Lucio Fulci\u2019s modern zombie classic is queasily horrible and was to become notorious in the UK as a \u201cvideo nasty\u201d shocker. It is \u201cZombi 2\u201d in the sense that it was intended as Fulci\u2019s own sequel-style homage to Dawn of the Dead: a woman journeys to a remote Caribbean island on the trail of her missing scientist father. A voodoo curse means that dead bodies roam freely, attacking the living. 3. I Walked With a Zombie (1943) This is one of the great zombie classics, and a creepy spin on Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s Jane Eyre. It features a nurse who travels to a Caribbean island to attend to a plantation owner, and encounters voodoo rituals and reanimated corpses. It is a fable satirising colonial guilt, the inheritance of slavery and paranoid fear of \u201cthe other\u201d \u2013 an almost poetic zombie adventure. 2. Dawn of the Dead (1978) A zombie classic that fuses the US and Italian traditions of pulp-delirium and shock. It is co-written by George A Romero, the man who virtually invented the zombie movie, and the Italian horror genius Dario Argento. After a horrific and mysterious ecological catastrophe, corpses are reanimated as zombies, and the key scenes take place at a shopping mall, as zombie-ism satirically portrays the spiritual undeadness of American consumerism. 1. Night of the Living Dead (1968) One year before Apollo 11 made its triumphant moon landing \u2013 for some the greatest moment in US and world history \u2013 Romero created this paranoid and subversive movie, enunciating heretical scepticism about the space adventure. A virus is brought back from outer space, which revives corpses as shambling, murderously malign ghouls who want to eat the living. This Swiftian satire attacked racism, conformism, consumerism and fear of the future: our horror at the idea of our own mortality, our own obsolescence, the realisation that we all must die and that we are just dead men and women walking.",

      "body": "<p>It is hardly the first time the question of what exactly the viewer is supposed to be getting out of a programme has presented itself, but with Psychopath With Piers Morgan (ITV), it does feel slightly more pressing than usual. There are very few possible answers, after all, that would seem to justify the existence of an hour of airtime being given to a remorseless 25-year-old murderer (who killed his sister 12 years ago when he was 13 and she was four) to seemingly rehearse gambits for the parole board when he becomes eligible for release in eight years\u2019 time.</p> <p>Morgan had secured an interview with Paris Bennett, who, in 2007, persuaded the babysitter to go home early and then beat, choked and stabbed his little sister Ella to death. It was a well thought-out plan and it went off without a hitch.</p> <p>\u201cFor years,\u201d he explains to Morgan, \u201cthere was this hot, flaming ball of wrath in the pit of my stomach directed at my mother. And one of the reasons why I chose to kill my sister and not someone else is because I knew that, by doing that, I could hurt my mother in the worst possible way \u2026 I found a way to take away both her children in one fell swoop.\u201d</p> <p>Once we are beyond proving Bennett\u2019s utter affectlessness to ourselves \u2013 and it is mesmerising, that absent look in the eyes, the unhurried pause he takes after each question before rolling out an answer in perfectly measured paragraphs, the bare bones of human interaction uninformed by any urge to please, soften or ingratiate \u2013 it is difficult to justify watching on. As with the recent Netflix documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/24/conversations-with-killer-ted-bundy-tapes-review\" title=\"\">Conversations With a Killer</a>: The Ted Bundy Tapes, it simply fed base appetites and added to the wretched mystique that somehow continues to attend terrible crimes and criminals without adding any benefit by way of insight or analysis.</p> <p>We know there are monsters out there.

      "bodyText": "It is hardly the first time the question of what exactly the viewer is supposed to be getting out of a programme has presented itself, but with Psychopath With Piers Morgan (ITV), it does feel slightly more pressing than usual. There are very few possible answers, after all, that would seem to justify the existence of an hour of airtime being given to a remorseless 25-year-old murderer (who killed his sister 12 years ago when he was 13 and she was four) to seemingly rehearse gambits for the parole board when he becomes eligible for release in eight years\u2019 time. Morgan had secured an interview with Paris Bennett, who, in 2007, persuaded the babysitter to go home early and then beat, choked and stabbed his little sister Ella to death. It was a well thought-out plan and it went off without a hitch. \u201cFor years,\u201d he explains to Morgan, \u201cthere was this hot, flaming ball of wrath in the pit of my stomach directed at my mother. And one of the reasons why I chose to kill my sister and not someone else is because I knew that, by doing that, I could hurt my mother in the worst possible way \u2026 I found a way to take away both her children in one fell swoop.\u201d Once we are beyond proving Bennett\u2019s utter affectlessness to ourselves \u2013 and it is mesmerising, that absent look in the eyes, the unhurried pause he takes after each question before rolling out an answer in perfectly measured paragraphs, the bare bones of human interaction uninformed by any urge to please, soften or ingratiate \u2013 it is difficult to justify watching on. As with the recent Netflix documentary Conversations With a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes, it simply fed base appetites and added to the wretched mystique that somehow continues to attend terrible crimes and criminals without adding any benefit by way of insight or analysis. We know there are monsters out there. We have always known. They are the wolves in the woods, the 13th guest at the christening, the blood on the counterpane in fairy stories and folk tales. They are elemental and we only need to know they exist. We do not need to know them individually. Like Morgan\u2019s previous outings, Confessions of a Serial Killer With Piers Morgan and Killer Women With Piers Morgan, the programme evidently exists in large part to showcase the talents \u2013 to stretch the word to the very limits of its natural elasticity \u2013 and feed the ego of Morgan. Bennett, he slaveringly assures us at the top of the hour, is considered so dangerous: \u201cThey\u2019ve insisted I interview him behind toughened glass!\u201d So it is maybe to prove the great, dangling cojones of Morgan, too, for all those who were not convinced of their size and weight by his courageous stand against the feminisation of culture after a picture of Daniel Craig carrying his infant son in a baby sling like a giant nancy boy (I paraphrase Morgan\u2019s take on the situation, but not by much) appeared in the papers. If there is a story here, it is that of Bennett\u2019s astute, dignified mother who, although unsentimental and clear-eyed about what he has done, what he is and what danger he will pose to her when he gets out, has forgiven him. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to stop loving my children,\u201d she says. Bennett\u2019s mother\u2019s name is Charity. \u201cDo you think you know what love is?\u201d Morgan asks Paris at one point. \u201cI can\u2019t just point to something and say: \u2018That\u2019s it\u2019,\u201d he replies.

Delusional nostalgia | Moira Donegan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In contrast to the virulent white nationalism accepted by the Republican party, Democrats have fashioned themselves as the party willing to diversify the beneficiaries of America\u2019s imperialist and capitalist spoils. But this objective has failed black Americans, who are disproportionately loyal to the Democratic party yet suffer most when Democrats make policy with<strong> </strong>racists and a wealthy minority. Despite the common narrative that the party has had black votes in the bag since the peak of the civil rights era in the mid-1960s, there is a more complicated history with clear implications for the 2020 presidential election.</p> <p>While the likes of Eastland were thwarting civil rights legislation, black Americans primarily in the south risked their lives in a bitter struggle for \u201cradical\u201d ideas like voting rights and equal access to jobs, social services, and quality education. In response to this activism, Democratic president Lyndon B Johnson signed civil rights legislation in 1964 and 1965 that <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/exit-left/476190/\">effectively aligned</a> black voters with the party.</p> <p>Further north, however, there was growing discontent among black communities who saw the other side of the integration battle, where de facto segregation replaced state-sanctioned policies and urban ghettos birthed new economic and social problems. It was in this social hotbed that Malcolm X, the fierce counterpart to the civil rights movement\u2019s Martin Luther King Jr, captured the ears of the most disillusioned black Americans in a critique of the white liberal establishment eerily reflective of the current political moment.</p> <p>Three months before Johnson signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act into law, Malcolm X cautioned audiences in Cleveland and Detroit about politicians such as Johnson, who aligned themselves with segregationist Dixiecrats while deftly collecting black votes. In what has become known as the <a href=\"http://www.edchange.org/multicultural/speeches/malcolm_x_ballot.html\">Ballot or the Bullet</a><a href=\"http://www.edchange.org/multicultural/speeches/malcolm_x_ballot.html\"> speech</a>, Malcolm X told the crowd:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Lyndon B Johnson\u2019s best friend is the one who is \u2026 heading the forces that are filibustering civil rights legislation. You tell me how in the hell is he going to be Johnson\u2019s best friend? How can Johnson be his friend and your friend too?</em></p> </blockquote> <p>While voters nevertheless elected Johnson that year, black voter turnout declined for a decade thereafter, only reaching 1964 levels with the election of Barack Obama more than 40 years later. At the same time, black Americans\u2019 material conditions have deteriorated: they face growing wealth disparities, a revived caste system under mass incarceration and various forms of<strong> </strong>segregation, and homeownership rates that remain unchanged since the late 1960s.

      "bodyText": "Last week, Joe Biden promised Wall Street profiteers that he could reach \u201cconsensus\u201d with conservatives. He offered proof of this skill by recalling his cordiality with racist senators, among them the late senator James Eastland, a Mississippi plantation owner who referred to black people as an inferior race. But Biden represents another problem that goes beyond his personal affinity for political miscalculations: he epitomizes the failures of white liberalism. In contrast to the virulent white nationalism accepted by the Republican party, Democrats have fashioned themselves as the party willing to diversify the beneficiaries of America\u2019s imperialist and capitalist spoils. But this objective has failed black Americans, who are disproportionately loyal to the Democratic party yet suffer most when Democrats make policy with racists and a wealthy minority. Despite the common narrative that the party has had black votes in the bag since the peak of the civil rights era in the mid-1960s, there is a more complicated history with clear implications for the 2020 presidential election. While the likes of Eastland were thwarting civil rights legislation, black Americans primarily in the south risked their lives in a bitter struggle for \u201cradical\u201d ideas like voting rights and equal access to jobs, social services, and quality education. In response to this activism, Democratic president Lyndon B Johnson signed civil rights legislation in 1964 and 1965 that effectively aligned black voters with the party. Further north, however, there was growing discontent among black communities who saw the other side of the integration battle, where de facto segregation replaced state-sanctioned policies and urban ghettos birthed new economic and social problems. It was in this social hotbed that Malcolm X, the fierce counterpart to the civil rights movement\u2019s Martin Luther King Jr, captured the ears of the most disillusioned black Americans in a critique of the white liberal establishment eerily reflective of the current political moment. Three months before Johnson signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act into law, Malcolm X cautioned audiences in Cleveland and Detroit about politicians such as Johnson, who aligned themselves with segregationist Dixiecrats while deftly collecting black votes. In what has become known as the Ballot or the Bullet speech, Malcolm X told the crowd: Lyndon B Johnson\u2019s best friend is the one who is \u2026 heading the forces that are filibustering civil rights legislation. You tell me how in the hell is he going to be Johnson\u2019s best friend? How can Johnson be his friend and your friend too? While voters nevertheless elected Johnson that year, black voter turnout declined for a decade thereafter, only reaching 1964 levels with the election of Barack Obama more than 40 years later. At the same time, black Americans\u2019 material conditions have deteriorated: they face growing wealth disparities, a revived caste system under mass incarceration and various forms of segregation, and homeownership rates that remain unchanged since the late 1960s. This state of affairs is due to bipartisan neoliberal policies, including harsh and discriminatory prison sentencing, militarized police enforcement, the banking deregulation that led to the 2008 financial crisis, the privatization of public services and corporate tax breaks. Liberals who emerged during this period, such as Bill Clinton and Joe Biden, have been heralded as particularly popular among black Americans. But Clinton garnered the lowest black turnout of the past 30 years in his 1996 presidential run. Today, pundits are basing their theories of Biden\u2019s popularity on polling numbers that are practically worthless at this early juncture. Black people cannot afford to forget how the party\u2019s establishment has stood in the way of advancing genuine equality, from Johnson\u2019s own relationship with the segregationist Eastland and his tenure as a lawmaker who opposed every civil rights measure he could vote on, to Clinton \u2013 who dog-whistled conservatives about being tough on crime, ending welfare and busting unions, while increasing welfare for corporations. Nor can we afford to forget how we have fought back. Johnson\u2019s collaboration with racists was challenged by black leaders like Malcolm X, and black people across the country pushed back against the Biden-led, Clinton-passed crime bill, which the NAACP called \u201cdraconian\u201d and inspired the unprecedented Million Man March in protest. We are told establishment Democrats have amassed universal popularity among black people, despite the party\u2019s perpetual failures and consistent black disillusionment. For those who actually want an equitable society that transforms the lives of the poor and working class, let\u2019s make 2020 an election year when we reject the failed legacy of white liberalism.

      "bodyText": "Bronwyn Taylor, the New South Wales mental health minister, personally lobbied the state Office of Environment and Heritage to drop an investigation into alleged illegal native grassland clearing on a property she owns with her husband. The call was revealed in documents tabled in the NSW upper house on Friday that were requested by the state opposition following a Guardian Australia investigation. Bronwyn Taylor is the sister-in-law of the federal energy minister Angus Taylor. The documents tabled state that in August 2018, the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH) received a report of \u201cpotential unlawful clearing of native grasslands\u201d on a property in Nimmitabel, in the NSW Monaro region, that is owned by Fairross Pty Ltd. Fairross is owned by Bronwyn Taylor and her husband, Duncan Taylor. The documents state that Duncan Taylor called the OEH on 13 September 2018 and identified himself as the property owner. On the same day, Bronwyn Taylor made a separate call to OEH in which she \u201cadvised OEH that she was a member of the state parliament but was calling as the landowner\u201d. \u201cMinister Taylor stated that they had done a self-assessment of the grassland and the area in question was not comprised of over 50% native ground cover, meaning that an offence had not been committed,\u201d the document says. Under NSW law, landholders can clear grassland without approval if it comprises less than 50% native species. The paper, which was written as a response to a question without notice, says OEH concluded their investigation on 2 October 2018 and found no evidence that the clearing was in contravention of the Local Land Services Act. \u201cOEH found that the landholder had undertaken their own assessment which indicated to them that the grassland was comprised of less than 50 per cent native species,\u201d it says. Bronwyn Taylor said on Friday that OEH had investigated a complaint in 2018 and \u201cfollowing a review of photographic evidence, determined that Fairross had met all of the requirements set out by Local Land Services\u201d. \u201cAs the landholder, I spoke to the OEH officer who was handling the complaint. I disclosed that I was a member of parliament and that I was calling in my capacity as a landholder,\u201d she said. \u201cI asked OEH to fully investigate the complaint. \u201cOEH determined that the complaint was vexatious and that there were no grounds on which to proceed with any further action.\u201d But NSW Labor\u2019s acting leader, Penny Sharpe, said the phone call was not appropriate. \u201cIt is not acceptable for a government MP to call a government office, identify themselves as an MP in the government, and then seek to influence an active investigation into their own conduct,\u201d she said. \u201cMinister Taylor must immediately explain her conduct.\u201d The NSW OEH said it could not comment on the details of an investigation. Guardian Australia revealed last week that Angus Taylor met senior federal environment officials and Josh Frydenberg\u2019s office in 2017 to discuss the government\u2019s designation of critically endangered grasslands. At the time of the meeting, federal and state investigations were under way into alleged illegal clearing of Monaro grasslands on another property the Taylors hold an interest in near Delegate in NSW. That property is owned by Jam Land Pty Ltd. Angus Taylor\u2019s brother Richard is the director of Jam Land, Angus Taylor himself holds an interest via his family investment company Gufee, and his brother Duncan and sister-in-law Bronwyn also hold an interest via Fairross. Bronwyn Taylor was questioned in the NSW parliament last week about whether she sought to influence the state government\u2019s submissions about the federal decision to upgrade the listing of the grasslands to \u201ccritically endangered\u201d in 2016. The question was ruled out of order because it related to Taylor\u2019s personal actions and not her ministerial responsibilities, so she did not answer.",

When American forces left, the Hmong and their families were still in danger.</p> <p>Thao, then 17, couldn\u2019t go back. He had been armed with an American weapon as a child and had already survived two confrontations with communist soldiers who aimed their guns at him, but resisted pulling the trigger.

This means fewer slots for today\u2019s Hmong equivalents \u2013 including Iraqis who aided the US military and Kurds who aided American troops fighting Islamic State in Syria.</p> <p>As the Trump administration attempts to dismantle the program, Wausau is a microcosm of the challenges and opportunities that come from the long policy welcoming refugees as new Americans.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/foreign-born-hmong-united-states#4\">The US resettled about 90%</a><strong> </strong>of the Hmong made refugees by the war, mostly in California, Minnesota and Wisconsin.

When he arrived on 9 April 1976, he spoke almost no English. He quickly learned to not look around when he walked in town because at every stop light he was greeted by a middle finger \u2013 the beginning of a string of racist experiences that continues today.</p> <p>In general, people have been kind and supportive over the decades, Thao said. He remembers fondly the church that resettled him bringing clothes from the Salvation Army and the people who he made friends with in school in the few short months he was there.</p> <p>But once the subject of racism is broached, story after story pours out. There was the first few years, when he was constantly harassed on the streets. There was a job where he was called a \u201cyellow [N-word]\u201d every day until he quit.</p> <p>When he hunts, he only uses a bow and arrows to avoid projecting aggression by using a gun. He still gets shouted at by men armed with guns and bows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00d68a2fbc35142999bf2bb0e0c432b66031ddd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00d68a2fbc35142999bf2bb0e0c432b66031ddd4/0_0_2400_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Moua, left, eats with his son Andy Moua Jr., 4, and his brother Gregg Moua at the Wausau World Market in Wausau.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Moua, left, eats with his son, Andy Moua Jr, four, and his brother, Gregg Moua, at the Wausau World Market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Gruber/The  Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is also the time, about 30 years ago, when he was fishing with his two sons who were about seven or eight and a white man drove his boat in circles around theirs, causing it to rock and threatening it to tip over.

And he said the day-to-day racism dropped significantly as the Hmong population grew.</p> <p>Today it\u2019s the more subtle forms of racism young Hmong in Wausau see as a top concern, such as getting more Hmong in leadership roles in business and politics, and having them be respected when they get there.</p> <p>City council member Mary Thao, who is related to Nou Vang Thao, said she gets requests every day from people trying to hire Hmong workers, but never in leadership roles. \u201cWe\u2019re being sought out for being laborers in production and doing manual, hard work for cheap labor,\u201d Mary Thao said.</p> <p>Mary Thao, 41, was elected to city council in April 2018, replacing a woman who decided not to run for re-election after an email she sent to Mary Thao comparing a Hmong peace march to a Ku Klux Klan rally was made public.</p> <p>Mary Thao said <a href=\"https://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/news/2018/11/15/wausau-council-member-mary-thao-not-attend-closed-sessions/1998590002/\">she experiences discrimination because she is the only non-white board member.</a> \u201cI\u2019m not a puppet that you can just say, \u2018Oh yeah we got a Hmong woman on the council or on the board and you know we embrace diversity and this is great for us,\u2019 and then completely dismiss her,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c1d23790dc986b047bf4d3af2168894a34cee51a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1d23790dc986b047bf4d3af2168894a34cee51a/0_0_2400_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Victoria Chang, center, cuts lemon grass with the help of her nieces and nephews at the Phou Bia Oriental Market located in the Wausau World Market\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victoria Chang, center, cuts lemon grass with the help of her nieces and nephews at the Phou Bia Oriental Market located in the Wausau World Market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Gruber/The  Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While young Hmong such as Thao fight to improve representation, they are also confronting generational gaps between their culture\u2019s traditions and their lives in the US.</p> <p>From young professionals to teenagers at local high school, American-born Hmong shared concerns that the sacrifices made by Hmong elders have faded in the background, destined to be lost as fewer and fewer youth learn Hmong.</p> <p>Lada Xiong-Vang, 36, has been fighting to improve professional outcomes for Hmong in Wausau at the Central Wisconsin Hmong Professionals (CWHP), which hosts networking events and skill-building classes, while also representing Hmong professionals in community forums. Thao is also an adviser there.</p> <p>Xiong-Vang said in the past five years, she has felt acutely her own distance from the culture.</p> <p>After spending much of her youth rebelling against Hmong traditions, she said she has only a loose grasp on the language and on how to properly prepare food.

      "bodyText": "The harrowing journey Nou Vang Thao took to freedom was nearly over when a boat captain gave Thao and his cousin three options: take their chances swimming to Thailand through the hazardous Mekong River, take the boat back to Laos or give him all the money they had. It was 1975 and Laos was no longer safe for Thao and his fellow members of the Hmong ethnic minority. \u201cI almost got killed before I got freedom,\u201d Thao explained from his home in Wausau, Wisconsin \u2013 nearly 8,000 miles away and 44 years after he made his escape. The CIA armed a clandestine army of more than 40,000 in Laos, mostly Hmong, to fight communists in south-east Asia during the Vietnam war, in which the US dropped 2 million bombs on Laos \u2013 the most heavily bombed country per capita in history. When American forces left, the Hmong and their families were still in danger. Thao, then 17, couldn\u2019t go back. He had been armed with an American weapon as a child and had already survived two confrontations with communist soldiers who aimed their guns at him, but resisted pulling the trigger. So on that boat, nearing freedom in Thailand, Thao pulled out the last bits of money he had secreted away in his shoe \u2013 emptying his pockets for a future he couldn\u2019t imagine. It was the US that plucked him out of a refugee camp in Thailand and resettled him in Wausau, Wisconsin, a small city nestled between tracts of midwest farmland that was one of the whitest cities in the country when he first arrived. Thao and 299,000 other Hmong are able to call the US home because of the refugee resettlement program, which is facing an unprecedented attack by Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Trump has shrunk the refugee program to the smallest resettlement numbers in decades \u2013 22,000 people are expected to be resettled at the end of the fiscal year in September, 74% down from the 84,995 refugees resettled in 2016. This means fewer slots for today\u2019s Hmong equivalents \u2013 including Iraqis who aided the US military and Kurds who aided American troops fighting Islamic State in Syria. As the Trump administration attempts to dismantle the program, Wausau is a microcosm of the challenges and opportunities that come from the long policy welcoming refugees as new Americans. The US resettled about 90% of the Hmong made refugees by the war, mostly in California, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Wausau is 9.1% Hmong, according to the 2010 US census \u2013 the highest percentage of any city in Wisconsin. The rest of the city is 83.7% white and a mix of other races. There are Hmong-owned supermarkets that sell freshly made tofu and steamed rice cakes and restaurants that serve pork rice noodle soup and egg rolls. Hmong people own and work in businesses including factories, hotels and home-care centers across the 134,000-person metropolitan area. They teach at schools, hold elected office and run churches. While the direct economic impact of Hmong has not been calculated, they are part of a wave of Asian immigrants that have boosted Wisconsin\u2019s slow population growth and fed its economy. In Wisconsin, the Asian-born population, which includes immigrants who are not refugees, contributed $88.6m in taxes to the federal, state and local government in 2014, according to a report by New American Economy, a coalition of business leaders. Thao was one of the first Hmong to arrive in Wausau. When he arrived on 9 April 1976, he spoke almost no English. He quickly learned to not look around when he walked in town because at every stop light he was greeted by a middle finger \u2013 the beginning of a string of racist experiences that continues today. In general, people have been kind and supportive over the decades, Thao said. He remembers fondly the church that resettled him bringing clothes from the Salvation Army and the people who he made friends with in school in the few short months he was there. But once the subject of racism is broached, story after story pours out. There was the first few years, when he was constantly harassed on the streets. There was a job where he was called a \u201cyellow [N-word]\u201d every day until he quit. When he hunts, he only uses a bow and arrows to avoid projecting aggression by using a gun. He still gets shouted at by men armed with guns and bows. There is also the time, about 30 years ago, when he was fishing with his two sons who were about seven or eight and a white man drove his boat in circles around theirs, causing it to rock and threatening it to tip over. When he went to report the incident on the dock, the boat driver\u2019s friend was there to hang up the phone every time he made the call, while holding a knife. \u201cIt\u2019s only one bad person, it\u2019s not a community,\u201d Thao explained. And he said the day-to-day racism dropped significantly as the Hmong population grew. Today it\u2019s the more subtle forms of racism young Hmong in Wausau see as a top concern, such as getting more Hmong in leadership roles in business and politics, and having them be respected when they get there. City council member Mary Thao, who is related to Nou Vang Thao, said she gets requests every day from people trying to hire Hmong workers, but never in leadership roles. \u201cWe\u2019re being sought out for being laborers in production and doing manual, hard work for cheap labor,\u201d Mary Thao said. Mary Thao, 41, was elected to city council in April 2018, replacing a woman who decided not to run for re-election after an email she sent to Mary Thao comparing a Hmong peace march to a Ku Klux Klan rally was made public. Mary Thao said she experiences discrimination because she is the only non-white board member. \u201cI\u2019m not a puppet that you can just say, \u2018Oh yeah we got a Hmong woman on the council or on the board and you know we embrace diversity and this is great for us,\u2019 and then completely dismiss her,\u201d she said. While young Hmong such as Thao fight to improve representation, they are also confronting generational gaps between their culture\u2019s traditions and their lives in the US. From young professionals to teenagers at local high school, American-born Hmong shared concerns that the sacrifices made by Hmong elders have faded in the background, destined to be lost as fewer and fewer youth learn Hmong. Lada Xiong-Vang, 36, has been fighting to improve professional outcomes for Hmong in Wausau at the Central Wisconsin Hmong Professionals (CWHP), which hosts networking events and skill-building classes, while also representing Hmong professionals in community forums. Thao is also an adviser there. Xiong-Vang said in the past five years, she has felt acutely her own distance from the culture. After spending much of her youth rebelling against Hmong traditions, she said she has only a loose grasp on the language and on how to properly prepare food. She worries lately about how this affects her young children, who are five and three. Xiong-Vang\u2019s parents met in a refugee camp in Thailand and she was raised in a traditional Hmong household. Her dad was a teenager when he crossed the jungle to the Mekong River during the monsoon season, fashioning shoes out of tires for the journey and communicating with a band of other travelers using only bird sounds to evade the communists. Her mother was younger and remembers less of the journey, but traveled with a group of soldiers in marginally less dangerous conditions. \u201cI believe that there\u2019s a lot of value and richness in knowing your history and being able to share that and being grateful for that as to why your life is the way it is and to push you to work harder,\u201d Xiong-Vang said. Speaking in the history classroom of a local high school, Hmong teenagers in Wausau said they felt pressure from their parents and older relatives to maintain traditions that seemed outdated to them while also rebelling against the idea that they had to marry in their ethnic group or fulfill traditional gender roles. Pa\u2019Nyiag Lee, 16, and Alexander Cha, 17, said they found it difficult at times to figure out where they actually fit in. Their older, Hmong-speaking relatives would accuse them of being of whitewashed, and so would their peers who had better language skills. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel that I belonged in any place,\u201d Lee said. Cha recalled that when he was a child, elders would criticize him for being chubby in Hmong. He was able to understand a couple of words, but when he asked what they were saying, he said, they responded in Hmong: \u201cDon\u2019t you know you are Hmong.\u201d As Hmong grapple with how to preserve their culture, an unlikely ally has persisted for decades in Wausau. Jim Harris was a principal at Weston elementary school in the 1970s when he first learned about the Hmong.

If someone pops their head round the door to offer you a cuppa in the morning, they can\u2019t secretly despise you, right? Maybe people who come from picture-perfect homes and archetypal nuclear families don\u2019t have this joy. Maybe they are spoiled. But for me, there is a special type of bonding in someone saying, \u201cOf course there is room at the inn.\u201d Of course, I return the favour \u2013 but not before pointing out the radiator that makes a super-weird noise in the night.",

      "body": "<p>In May, for the second time this year, more than 1.5 million young people in more than 125 countries walked out of schools, colleges and universities in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2019/may/24/student-climate-strikes-around-the-world\" title=\"\">the biggest day of global climate action ever</a><strong>. </strong>Young people have protested en masse before \u2013 millions marched against the Iraq war in 2003 \u2013 but this child-led uprising is happening with unprecedented momentum on a global scale.</p> <p>The urgency of their protests reflects the very narrow window of opportunity left to make positive change. We are already living outside the climate parameters that first gave rise to humans, and the world\u2019s leading climate scientists agree that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\" title=\"\">we have only 12 years</a> to limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5\u00b0C. Still, most governments are not doing enough to stay within these limits as set out by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\" title=\"\">United Nation\u2019s 2015 Paris agreement</a>.</p> <p>The complexities of the climate crisis have become highly politicised, but young people are able to cut through the noise. As Jamie Clarke, executive director of <a href=\"https://climateoutreach.org/\" title=\"\">Climate Outreach</a>, explains: \u201cClimate change is the most politically divisive issue in America, more so than gun control and abortion. But young people have the social freedom to say it like it is.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ukycc.com/\" title=\"\">UK Youth Climate Coalition</a>\u2019s Jake Woodier believes that climate strikes are reconfiguring the political sphere. \u201cChildren who historically don\u2019t have a voice in politics are really thrusting their opinions into the public domain,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are seeing thousands of incredibly intelligent and articulate children who are grasping the severity of the climate crisis better than adults in power.\u201d Here, seven young people who are doing just that, explain where their passion comes from.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018</strong><strong>It\u2019s frustrating that we have Trump, a climate denier, heading our government\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Dylan D\u2019Haeze, 16, Washington state, US</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f9d6b9ea1259c6e8213e8d03abfff0cf7a8ea44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f9d6b9ea1259c6e8213e8d03abfff0cf7a8ea44/0_1021_3648_3903/935.jpg\" alt=\"Young climate activist Dylan D\u2019Haeze, 16, photographed in Washington state, US, sitting on a rock, holding a camera\" width=\"935\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dylan D\u2019Haeze: \u2018Film-making empowers me.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Kehoe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This autumn, Dylan releases the fourth environmental documentary in his award-winning series, Kids Can Save The Planet. \u201cFilm-making empowers me because I can visually show problems and solutions in a way that is much easier to comprehend,\u201d says Dylan, who directs, narrates and films his documentaries. With the next US election just 17 months away, his latest film, about voting and civic engagement, is a timely call to action for a new generation. \u201cIf you elect people the world really needs into office, then the world will change.\u201d</p> <p>According to Dylan, the main hurdle is trying to convince the government and big corporations that climate change is a serious problem. \u201cMost of them just want to make quick bucks instead of thinking what the world is going to look like for the next generation,\u201d he says. What does he think of Trump? \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that we have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/26/trump-national-climate-assessment-dont-believe\" title=\"\">a climate denier</a> heading our government \u2013 that is two steps backwards from where we need to be right now.\u201d</p> <p>It was ocean pollution that first struck him when he travelled through California three years ago: \u201cThe plastic debris we saw on beaches really scared me, and my mum suggested that instead of being afraid, I could do something about it,\u201d says Dylan, who is home-schooled by his parents, Dawn and Kevin, both film-makers. \u201cAt first I felt helpless, but then I started discovering solutions that were actually really simple, like carrying bamboo cutlery and taking beeswax wrap to the deli to avoid clingfilm,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Dylan and Dawn are now planning the ultimate home-schooling road trip in the run-up to the 2020 election. For six months, they will drive an electric car from their home on Orcas Island off the west coast, across America to Washington DC, filming as they go. High-profile mentors, including actor and environmentalist <a href=\"https://begleyliving.com/\" title=\"\">Ed Begley Jr</a>, musician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/moby\" title=\"\">Moby</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cowspiracy.com/about\" title=\"\">Cowspiracy</a>\u2019s Kip Andersen will join Dylan along the way. He will interview leaders spearheading green initiatives, youth activists from the nationwide <a href=\"https://www.sunrisemovement.org\" title=\"\">Sunrise Movement</a> and pioneers developing renewable energy. </p> <p>As he travels, he will present his latest film in high schools and colleges, and speak in city halls and state capitals, asking people to make, on camera, a commitment to positive change. \u201cIt will be really powerful,\u201d Dawn says. \u201cYoung people have to be engaged \u2013 there\u2019s no other option.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://kidscansavetheplanet.com/\" title=\"\">kidscansavetheplanet.com</a></em></p> <h2><strong>\u2018</strong><strong>Our weather is not normal.

It\u2019s a huge problem for farmers, and mudslides wash away houses, leaving poor families without homes.\u201d Eighteen months ago, Cape Town experienced its most severe drought in a century. Residents\u2019 water consumption was limited to 50 litres a day and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/feb/03/day-zero-how-cape-town-running-out-water\" title=\"\">city was </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/feb/03/day-zero-how-cape-town-running-out-water\" title=\"\">just weeks away from \u201cday zero\u201d</a>, when taps would run dry. \u201cFor me, that was a big sign that we need to change our ways and stand up for nature \u2013 because our government wants to profit from the environment, instead of implementing policies that protect it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In January, Yola began volunteering with the <a href=\"http://earthchildproject.org/changing-the-script-for-climate-change/\" title=\"\">Earthchild Project</a>, which integrates environmental education into classrooms and communities. \u201cOur mission is to monitor our school\u2019s food, water and electricity usage, and encourage other learners to reduce their consumption.\u201d The school\u2019s organic vegetable garden helps feed pupils, and a worm farm transforms food waste into compost, so the children learn how to conserve resources. \u201cEvery school should make environmental education part of their curriculum. Climate change is a foreign topic to my family \u2013 without this club I would be in the dark,\u201d says Yola, who takes inspiration from the Zulu word \u201cubuntu\u201d, meaning \u201cI am, because you are.\u201d</p> <p>In March, Yola spoke in front of 2,000 young people in Cape Town, and she presents talks at neighbouring schools. \u201cI want to show the world that we, as black youth from Cape Town\u2019s under-resourced communities and townships, do care about the climate \u2013 because we are the ones that get affected the most.\u201d Her plea to the South African government is to take urgent action. \u201cWe will not accept a life of fear and devastation. The crisis is now.

Three years ago, they learned about the UN\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2015/09/what-is-sustainable-development/\" title=\"\">17 Global Goals for Sustainable Development</a> while being home-schooled. Shocked by the impact that plastic pollution has on marine wildlife, they decided to do something about it. They founded their child-led campaign, <a href=\"http://kidsagainstplastic.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Kids Against Plastic</a>, and in April 2018 they presented their first <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxtlqHjxvo&amp;t=26s\" title=\"\">TEDx talk</a>.</p> <p>\u201cKids can have a really powerful voice when they find something they are passionate about \u2013 but the key is to be educated about it in the first place,\u201d argues Amy, who wishes the school curriculum focused more on environmental issues.</p> <p>Plastic pollution is tangible and ubiquitous, but it\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg. The girls explain that to make every one-litre single-use plastic bottle of water, one-sixth of its capacity of oil is used. \u201cThe wasteful production of single-use plastics is so interconnected with the consumption of fossil fuels and global warming, and learning about these problems really opened our eyes,\u201d Amy says.</p> <p>\u201cA youth movement in Bali called <a href=\"http://www.byebyeplasticbags.org/\" title=\"\">Bye Bye Plastic Bags</a>, set up by two girls our age, really captured our imagination back in 2016,\u201d recalls Ella, who now reports on environmental issues for <a href=\"https://live.firstnews.co.uk/fyi/sky-kids-fyi/\" title=\"\">FYI</a>, a weekly news programme on Sky Kids. \u201cI always wanted to be an environmental TV presenter, so it\u2019s great to think others might be inspired by the features they watch on the show.\u201d </p> <p>As two of 250 British <a href=\"https://www.iwill.org.uk/iwill-ambassadors/#meet-the-ambassadors\" title=\"\">#iwill ambassadors</a> for youth social action, the sisters recently met the environment secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove\" title=\"\">Michael Gove</a>: \u201cHe seemed interested in what kids like us are doing, but politicians always have so many things on their plates, so it can be hard to get them involved,\u201d Amy says. \u201cWe are lucky that our MP, <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/vernon-coaker/360\" title=\"\">Vernon Coaker</a>, and Gedling borough council have helped us to push change in our local area by installing water fountains and insisting that all vendors at council events adhere to the plastic clever policy (for instance, by using a returnable cup deposit scheme). Often, councillors and politicians are surprised to hear two schoolgirls stand up and talk to them \u2013 young voices get their attention and that has a powerful impact.\u201d</p> <p>Last December, the education secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/damian-hinds\" title=\"\">Damian Hinds</a>, urged schools to become single-use plastic-free by 2022, something the Meek sisters are excited about. But they still have concerns over the government\u2019s 25-year environment plan. \u201cWe worry that there\u2019s no sense of urgency. By 2042, we\u2019ll be middle-aged \u2013 it\u2019s frustrating and scary,\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://kidsagainstplastic.co.uk/\" title=\"\">kidsagainstplastic.co.uk</a></em></p> <h2><strong>\u2018Living near the bush, there\u2019s a real risk of our houses burning down.

      "bodyText": "In May, for the second time this year, more than 1.5 million young people in more than 125 countries walked out of schools, colleges and universities in the biggest day of global climate action ever. Young people have protested en masse before \u2013 millions marched against the Iraq war in 2003 \u2013 but this child-led uprising is happening with unprecedented momentum on a global scale. The urgency of their protests reflects the very narrow window of opportunity left to make positive change. We are already living outside the climate parameters that first gave rise to humans, and the world\u2019s leading climate scientists agree that we have only 12 years to limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5\u00b0C. Still, most governments are not doing enough to stay within these limits as set out by the United Nation\u2019s 2015 Paris agreement. The complexities of the climate crisis have become highly politicised, but young people are able to cut through the noise. As Jamie Clarke, executive director of Climate Outreach, explains: \u201cClimate change is the most politically divisive issue in America, more so than gun control and abortion. But young people have the social freedom to say it like it is.\u201d UK Youth Climate Coalition\u2019s Jake Woodier believes that climate strikes are reconfiguring the political sphere. \u201cChildren who historically don\u2019t have a voice in politics are really thrusting their opinions into the public domain,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are seeing thousands of incredibly intelligent and articulate children who are grasping the severity of the climate crisis better than adults in power.\u201d Here, seven young people who are doing just that, explain where their passion comes from. \u2018It\u2019s frustrating that we have Trump, a climate denier, heading our government\u2019 Dylan D\u2019Haeze, 16, Washington state, US This autumn, Dylan releases the fourth environmental documentary in his award-winning series, Kids Can Save The Planet. \u201cFilm-making empowers me because I can visually show problems and solutions in a way that is much easier to comprehend,\u201d says Dylan, who directs, narrates and films his documentaries. With the next US election just 17 months away, his latest film, about voting and civic engagement, is a timely call to action for a new generation. \u201cIf you elect people the world really needs into office, then the world will change.\u201d According to Dylan, the main hurdle is trying to convince the government and big corporations that climate change is a serious problem. \u201cMost of them just want to make quick bucks instead of thinking what the world is going to look like for the next generation,\u201d he says. What does he think of Trump? \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that we have a climate denier heading our government \u2013 that is two steps backwards from where we need to be right now.\u201d It was ocean pollution that first struck him when he travelled through California three years ago: \u201cThe plastic debris we saw on beaches really scared me, and my mum suggested that instead of being afraid, I could do something about it,\u201d says Dylan, who is home-schooled by his parents, Dawn and Kevin, both film-makers. \u201cAt first I felt helpless, but then I started discovering solutions that were actually really simple, like carrying bamboo cutlery and taking beeswax wrap to the deli to avoid clingfilm,\u201d he says. Dylan and Dawn are now planning the ultimate home-schooling road trip in the run-up to the 2020 election. For six months, they will drive an electric car from their home on Orcas Island off the west coast, across America to Washington DC, filming as they go. High-profile mentors, including actor and environmentalist Ed Begley Jr, musician Moby and Cowspiracy\u2019s Kip Andersen will join Dylan along the way. He will interview leaders spearheading green initiatives, youth activists from the nationwide Sunrise Movement and pioneers developing renewable energy. As he travels, he will present his latest film in high schools and colleges, and speak in city halls and state capitals, asking people to make, on camera, a commitment to positive change. \u201cIt will be really powerful,\u201d Dawn says. \u201cYoung people have to be engaged \u2013 there\u2019s no other option.\u201d kidscansavetheplanet.com \u2018Our weather is not normal. Mudslides are washing away our homes\u2019 Yola Mgogwana, 11, Cape Town, South Africa \u201cI see the effects of climate change every single day,\u201d says Yola, from her home in Khayelitsha, one of Cape Town\u2019s impoverished townships. \u201cOur weather is not normal \u2013 one day it is hot, the next day it\u2019s raining heavily. It\u2019s a huge problem for farmers, and mudslides wash away houses, leaving poor families without homes.\u201d Eighteen months ago, Cape Town experienced its most severe drought in a century. Residents\u2019 water consumption was limited to 50 litres a day and the city was just weeks away from \u201cday zero\u201d, when taps would run dry. \u201cFor me, that was a big sign that we need to change our ways and stand up for nature \u2013 because our government wants to profit from the environment, instead of implementing policies that protect it,\u201d she says. In January, Yola began volunteering with the Earthchild Project, which integrates environmental education into classrooms and communities. \u201cOur mission is to monitor our school\u2019s food, water and electricity usage, and encourage other learners to reduce their consumption.\u201d The school\u2019s organic vegetable garden helps feed pupils, and a worm farm transforms food waste into compost, so the children learn how to conserve resources. \u201cEvery school should make environmental education part of their curriculum. Climate change is a foreign topic to my family \u2013 without this club I would be in the dark,\u201d says Yola, who takes inspiration from the Zulu word \u201cubuntu\u201d, meaning \u201cI am, because you are.\u201d In March, Yola spoke in front of 2,000 young people in Cape Town, and she presents talks at neighbouring schools. \u201cI want to show the world that we, as black youth from Cape Town\u2019s under-resourced communities and townships, do care about the climate \u2013 because we are the ones that get affected the most.\u201d Her plea to the South African government is to take urgent action. \u201cWe will not accept a life of fear and devastation. The crisis is now. People are dying.\u201d earthchildproject.org \u2018Michael Gove seemed interested, but politicians have so many things on their plate\u2019 Amy, 15, and Ella Meek, 13, Nottinghamshire, UK Sisters Amy and Ella are on a mission to encourage people, businesses and schools to adopt a \u201cplastic clever\u201d approach to reducing single-use plastics. Three years ago, they learned about the UN\u2019s 17 Global Goals for Sustainable Development while being home-schooled. Shocked by the impact that plastic pollution has on marine wildlife, they decided to do something about it. They founded their child-led campaign, Kids Against Plastic, and in April 2018 they presented their first TEDx talk. \u201cKids can have a really powerful voice when they find something they are passionate about \u2013 but the key is to be educated about it in the first place,\u201d argues Amy, who wishes the school curriculum focused more on environmental issues. Plastic pollution is tangible and ubiquitous, but it\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg. The girls explain that to make every one-litre single-use plastic bottle of water, one-sixth of its capacity of oil is used. \u201cThe wasteful production of single-use plastics is so interconnected with the consumption of fossil fuels and global warming, and learning about these problems really opened our eyes,\u201d Amy says. \u201cA youth movement in Bali called Bye Bye Plastic Bags, set up by two girls our age, really captured our imagination back in 2016,\u201d recalls Ella, who now reports on environmental issues for FYI, a weekly news programme on Sky Kids. \u201cI always wanted to be an environmental TV presenter, so it\u2019s great to think others might be inspired by the features they watch on the show.\u201d As two of 250 British #iwill ambassadors for youth social action, the sisters recently met the environment secretary, Michael Gove: \u201cHe seemed interested in what kids like us are doing, but politicians always have so many things on their plates, so it can be hard to get them involved,\u201d Amy says. \u201cWe are lucky that our MP, Vernon Coaker, and Gedling borough council have helped us to push change in our local area by installing water fountains and insisting that all vendors at council events adhere to the plastic clever policy (for instance, by using a returnable cup deposit scheme). Often, councillors and politicians are surprised to hear two schoolgirls stand up and talk to them \u2013 young voices get their attention and that has a powerful impact.\u201d Last December, the education secretary, Damian Hinds, urged schools to become single-use plastic-free by 2022, something the Meek sisters are excited about. But they still have concerns over the government\u2019s 25-year environment plan. \u201cWe worry that there\u2019s no sense of urgency. By 2042, we\u2019ll be middle-aged \u2013 it\u2019s frustrating and scary,\u201d kidsagainstplastic.co.uk \u2018Living near the bush, there\u2019s a real risk of our houses burning down. It\u2019s scary\u2019 Harriet O\u2019Shea Carre and Milou Albrecht, both 14, Castlemaine, Victoria, Australia Bush fires are Milou and Harriet\u2019s biggest worry. The teenagers experienced 46C (115F) days last summer, and January 2019 was the hottest month recorded in Australia, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. \u201cThe fire danger is really high. There\u2019s a real risk of our houses burning down because we live right near the bush. It could be deadly. It\u2019s really scary,\u201d Harriet says. \u201cAll we want is a safe climate; we don\u2019t want money or power, and we haven\u2019t got any ulterior motive. We simply want our futures. How can you tell someone that they don\u2019t have the right to live on and appreciate this planet, and be safe?\u201d Milou and Harriet started the Australian school climate strike in November 2018, together with their friend Callum Bridgefoot, 11. \u201cSeeing Greta Thunberg leading school strikes in Sweden was really powerful \u2013 that\u2019s what inspired us. Twenty of us started striking for climate action outside our MP\u2019s office and it quickly escalated,\u201d Milou explains. Weekly strikes now take place in more than 65 towns and cities across Australia, involving tens of thousands of young people, demanding 100% renewable energy by 2030 and no new coal, oil or gas projects. In February, seven other young activists joined Harriet and Milou in Canberra to present their demands to Bill Shorten MP, then leader of the opposition Labor party. \u201cMeeting us face-to-face was a clear sign he is taking us seriously,\u201d Harriet says. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t had an adequate response \u2013 we want to see a real plan for change in policy.\u201d \u201cAll the scientists agree that we\u2019re right about climate change, so it\u2019s difficult for people to find fault in what we are doing,\u201d Milou says. In response to trolling comments on social media telling them to stay in school, Harriet and Milou insist that striking at the weekend would lack impact. \u201cThe people leading our country don\u2019t want to listen to us \u2013 they want to shut us down,\u201d Harriet says. \u201cWe can use our civil disobedience to capture the government\u2019s attention. If they want us back in school, politicians need to start acting.\u201d Milou says their families are behind them: \u201cThey are supportive of what we do because they love us \u2013 they would rather have us alive and uneducated than dead and educated.\u201d schoolstrike4climate.com \u2018If you are 2C above normal, you feel very ill. So imagine how the planet will feel\u2019 Lilly Platt, 11, Zeist, the Netherlands As Lilly walks to and from school, she litter-picks, often collecting up to 400 pieces of rubbish. She started four years ago, shortly after she and her family moved to the Netherlands from London. She was learning to count in Dutch with her grandfather and as they walked, they counted 91 pieces of litter within just 15 minutes. \u201cMy grandpa told me how plastic on the ground eventually makes its way to the ocean,\u201d she says, \u201cso I decided I had to do something about it. We picked it all up and took a photo to post on social media.\u201d After that first pick-up, Lilly started researching plastic pollution and was horrified to read about the oceans\u2019 \u201cmicroplastic soup\u201d. \u201cPlastic pollution just shows that we consume too much,\u201d Lilly says. \u201cWe all need to feel responsible. Think about how much CO2 we have produced since the Industrial Revolution. Just think how many animals have been killed for needless reasons and how many trees have been chopped down for nothing but greed.\u201d She believes that all schools need to educate students about the climate crisis, and that politicians need to pay attention to scientists and strikers. She has been striking outside the town hall in Zeist since September 2018. \u201cListen, think and open your eyes and see what you have been doing to the world,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat happens to your body if you are 2C above your normal temperature? You feel very ill, so imagine how the planet will feel. We want world leaders, including Trump, to stay aligned with the Paris agreement, reduce carbon emissions and keep within 1.5C of global warming. Polluters must pay.\u201d Follow @LillysPlasticPickup on Facebook.

Some churchmen physically guide clients on the first leg of their journey \u2013 as with the pastor who led Antonio to the border \u2013 but most simply link up coyotes and potential clients. Evangelical leaders were more frequently involved in migration than Catholic priests, Sim\u00f3n found. As night fell in a small highland town 70 miles from the Mexican border, a few dozen people sang pop-inspired Christian music in a simple, single-room Evangelical church. In an office next door, drinking a Pepsi and catching up on his accounts, was Pedro, who recruits customers for a coyote. \u201cPastors can act as a bridge between people who want to migrate and people who can take them,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey know the community.\u201d At this church, three of the pastor\u2019s brothers are well-known coyotes, according to Pedro and members of the congregation. For each customer he recruits, the pastor makes $250; he earns another $150 for praying with a group before they set out. After the service, Manuel, 19, a member of the congregation, said that the pastor had previously helped his brother travel to the US, where he now works on construction sites in North Carolina. \u201cI know a lot of people who have traveled with this pastor. I would go, but I don\u2019t have any money,\u201d said Manuel. \u201cBut pastors typically know how to get you north.\u201d While around half of Guatemala\u2019s population is Catholic, in the last 25 years Pentacostal churches have grown increasingly important, and the country now has proportionately one of the largest Evangelical populations in Latin America. The movement first gained traction after the country\u2019s first Evangelical leader, Efra\u00edn R\u00edos Montt \u2013 an army general and part-time lay preacher \u2013 seized power in a 1982 coup. The US-backed dictator gave weekly televised sermons \u2013 even as the military murdered, raped and disappeared thousands of indigenous Guatemalans in the country\u2019s 36-year civil war. Catholic priests were often targeted in retaliation for their perceived sympathies with leftwing Liberation Theology. Some ordinary Guatemalans turned to Protestant churches in the hope of protection. Even after a peace deal signed in 1996, violence, corruption, racism and poverty have persisted. The Guatemalan state remains absent from many rural areas, and Evangelicalism has mushroomed as Pentecostal churches step in to provide public services, said Kevin Lewis O\u2019Neill, a professor at the University of Toronto who studies Christianity in Guatemala. \u201cHistorically, there\u2019s no reason to trust any institutions in Guatemala \u2013 other than the church. Evangelical churches in particular have been able to maintain trust by supporting these places with little state presence which live in the shadow of the war,\u201d he explains. Pentecostal churches are omnipresent in the mostly indigenous regions where most of the country\u2019s migrants are from. Those churches cater not only to religious faith but also to baser motives: worshippers are told they will achieve health and wealth in exchange for regular tithes, and congregants typically pay 10% of their income to the church. \u201cEvery Evangelical church is a moment of entrepreneurialism. You only need 10 families and you\u2019re breaking even, if you take tithing seriously,\u201d said O\u2019Neill. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to create a job out of nothing. It is also why there is so much competition in Guatemala \u2013 and why there are so many churches.\u201d On top of tithes, pastors and priests can also make hundreds of dollars for each migrant they recruit, and further bonuses for praying with each group. Successful migrants will sometimes also send small remittances. In return, churchmen can recommend trustworthy coyotes who will safely help migrants through at least the first stage of their long journey north. In a dusty, drought-plagued town in the Huehuetenango department, Victor was recently working on a new second floor at the home of his brother, an evangelical pastor. The freshly-painted house stood out from the neighbouring homes made of wood and corrugated metal, and gave testament to his good fortunes. \u201c[My brother] works as a middleman for people who want to go north,\u201d Victor said. \u201cHe knows who the smugglers are because he sent his two children to the USA.\u201d Coyotes sometimes use Christian messaging in their advertising, said Sim\u00f3n. One card handed out by a smuggler features a quotation from the book of Psalms \u2013 \u201cThe steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and He delighteth in his way\u201d \u2013 emblazoned over a picture of a bus. Underneath, a caption reads: \u201cIf you need to travel to the United States have \u201cFAITH,\u201d trust in God and in the trip. We take: older people, minors, fathers and mothers with children.\u201d And potential migrants sometimes turn to their pastors for advice when they are seeking a guide north. One recent evening a young woman called Dina, logged onto Facebook and messaged an evangelical pastor she knew. \u201cI want to go to the US,\u201d she wrote. He replied instantly: \u201cI have contacts with some coyotes because when people leave for their trip I go to pray for them. I can recommend you to one and help you with prayer. \u201cCome by on Tuesday to discuss.\u201d Names have been changed",

Clean-cut Olive (Emma Stone) lies her way to addictive popularity when she crafts false gossip that she\u2019s lost her virginity. Her nemesis, busybody and Jesus freak Marianne (Amanda Bynes) sparks up, and all goes awry.

You sense early on that short-term cash and male ego-boosts will only go so far in the unstable post-GFC environment, but Mike\u2019s path into, and then out of, that lucrative underworld is sleekly entertaining \u2013 and obliquely political \u2013 till the end.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/27/whats-with-all-the-sooky-disappointing-men-on-tv-right-now\">What's with all the wimpy, disappointing men on TV right now?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Honourable mentions:</strong> Monty Python\u2019s The Meaning of Life, Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (films, 1 July), The Town (film, 15 July), You\u2019ve Got Mail (film, 15 July), Workin\u2019 Moms season 2 (25 July), Orange is the New Black season 7 (26 July)</p> <h2><strong>Stan<br>Queen of the Desert</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Werner Herzog (US, 2015) \u2013 out now</strong></em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IVaqOfRVS8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7IVaqOfRVS8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>A political melodrama that foretells the hubris of whiskey-fuelled colonialist men carving up the Near East for themselves. This biopic of Gertrude Bell (Nicole Kidman) paints the traveller, writer, archaeologist, explorer and cartographer as a proto-feminist in the sand-swept desert of Tehran, as she falls in love with British diplomat Henry Cadogan (James Franco) and as the first world war hastens the Ottoman Empire\u2019s downfall. It\u2019s rare to see a woman as a Herzogian protagonist, but Gertrude Bell fits the bill in other ways \u2013 she\u2019s brazenly individual, an outsider and nonconformist, who insists on her own idealism and freedom until the end. It\u2019s an odd, and oddly rewarding, film.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions:</strong> The Loudest Voice season 1 (weekly from 1 July), Younger season 5 (out now), The Circuit seasons 1 and 2 (15 July)</p> <h2><strong>Foxtel Now<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_19pRsZRiz4\">AI Artificial Intelligence</a></strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg (US, 2001) \u2013 1 July</strong></em></p> <p>Critics were divided at first by this wild creation, scripted by Stanley Kubrick (the cold misanthrope), and shot and completed by Steven Spielberg (master of the schlocky Hollywood family film). But the two auteurs\u2019 sensibilities balance perfectly in this Pinocchio-like tale of a robotic boy, David (Haley Joel Osment), programmed to love and destined to be rejected by his human mother (Frances O\u2019Connor), who is grieving another son. After an icy wave of climate change hits Earth, David is trapped beneath the risen, frozen ocean, and seems fated to yearn for his mother eternally. But a strange form of perverse redemption awaits \u2013 depending on your interpretation.

      "bodyText": "Netflix Easy A Will Gluck (US, 2010) \u2013 1 July One of the finest teen films of the past decade, Easy A is as satirical as Mean Girls, as zingingly scripted as The Edge of Seventeen, and as easily entertaining as any early Cameron Crowe movie. Clean-cut Olive (Emma Stone) lies her way to addictive popularity when she crafts false gossip that she\u2019s lost her virginity. Her nemesis, busybody and Jesus freak Marianne (Amanda Bynes) sparks up, and all goes awry. Easy A holds up as a sex comedy of unusually feminist credentials. Magic Mike Steven Soderbergh (US, 2012) \u2013 28 July Steven Soderbergh\u2019s brawny, glossy take on American working-class anti-heroes clawing their way to their big, aspirations in a society that barely works any more. Channing Tatum stars as Mike, a jobbing everyman in the gig economy who defects to the weird (and not-so-sexy-after-all) world of male stripping in Florida. You sense early on that short-term cash and male ego-boosts will only go so far in the unstable post-GFC environment, but Mike\u2019s path into, and then out of, that lucrative underworld is sleekly entertaining \u2013 and obliquely political \u2013 till the end. Honourable mentions: Monty Python\u2019s The Meaning of Life, Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (films, 1 July), The Town (film, 15 July), You\u2019ve Got Mail (film, 15 July), Workin\u2019 Moms season 2 (25 July), Orange is the New Black season 7 (26 July) Stan Queen of the Desert Werner Herzog (US, 2015) \u2013 out now A political melodrama that foretells the hubris of whiskey-fuelled colonialist men carving up the Near East for themselves. This biopic of Gertrude Bell (Nicole Kidman) paints the traveller, writer, archaeologist, explorer and cartographer as a proto-feminist in the sand-swept desert of Tehran, as she falls in love with British diplomat Henry Cadogan (James Franco) and as the first world war hastens the Ottoman Empire\u2019s downfall. It\u2019s rare to see a woman as a Herzogian protagonist, but Gertrude Bell fits the bill in other ways \u2013 she\u2019s brazenly individual, an outsider and nonconformist, who insists on her own idealism and freedom until the end. It\u2019s an odd, and oddly rewarding, film. Honourable mentions: The Loudest Voice season 1 (weekly from 1 July), Younger season 5 (out now), The Circuit seasons 1 and 2 (15 July) Foxtel Now AI Artificial Intelligence Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg (US, 2001) \u2013 1 July Critics were divided at first by this wild creation, scripted by Stanley Kubrick (the cold misanthrope), and shot and completed by Steven Spielberg (master of the schlocky Hollywood family film). But the two auteurs\u2019 sensibilities balance perfectly in this Pinocchio-like tale of a robotic boy, David (Haley Joel Osment), programmed to love and destined to be rejected by his human mother (Frances O\u2019Connor), who is grieving another son. After an icy wave of climate change hits Earth, David is trapped beneath the risen, frozen ocean, and seems fated to yearn for his mother eternally. But a strange form of perverse redemption awaits \u2013 depending on your interpretation. A science fiction classic of great sadness and beauty. ET The Extra-Terrestrial Steven Spielberg (US, 1982) \u2013 5 July Here\u2019s what big-budget productions of popular cinema can look like: gentle, imaginative tales that blend science fiction with innocent family adventure. Spielberg\u2019s vision of a sweet-natured alien who befriends a suburban boy isn\u2019t just a 20th-century American myth, nor can it be dismissed as a nostalgia piece. It\u2019s a film that still captivates with its sense of awe of the unknown. The Insider Michael Mann (US, 1999) \u2013 8 July Corporate conspiracies, lies and intrigue form the winding plotlines of this paranoid crime film \u2013 in which a 60 Minutes producer (Al Pacino) approaches a former executive of a tobacco company (Russell Crowe) for help translating technical documents, and the duo find themselves in a vortex of industry secrets, marred confidentiality agreements and death threats. But the real story, as in so many Michael Mann films, is of obsession, thorny male psychology and alienation, playing out in lonely, urban, concrete environments. Solaris Steven Soderbergh (US, 2002) \u2013 18 July An unhappy psychiatrist Chris Kelvin (George Clooney in emotional lockdown) is sent to a privately run spaceship to speak to its mutinous staff and rescue the mission. Is the film \u2013 which reimagines Stanis\u0142aw Lem\u2019s novel and Andrei Tarkovsky\u2019s film (now gender-flipped for the stage) \u2013 an interstellar ghost story, a fatal romance and/or a perversely tragic science fiction?

The Truman Show Peter Weir (US, 1998) \u2013 29 July Scripted by New Zealander Andrew Niccol, this is the film that predicted an age of reality TV, where the culture of Kardashianism would stretch way beyond that mad family, and where everyday life itself would be commodified, packaged, edited and screened. Peter Weir\u2019s sometimes satirical, sometimes fantastical drama \u2013 in which the life of a regular American man, Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), is secretly purchased and broadcast by a TV producer (Ed Harris) was less futuristic and more prescient than many realised at the time.

      "body": "<p>As the second round of Democratic presidential debates approached, one of the major questions on the minds of voters and political commentators was whether the candidates would focus on trying to differentiate themselves from each other, as was done the previous night, or whether they would focus on critiquing Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>Senator Kamala Harris chose to do both, and she did so effectively, in what turned out to be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/27/second-democratic-debate-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\">breakout performance of the evening</a>.</p> \n<p>Very early in the debate, when asked how the candidates planned to pay for their various proposals, Harris put the question back on the moderators. \u201cWhere was that question when the Republicans and Donald Trump passed a tax bill that benefits the top 1% and the biggest corporations in this country?\u201d</p> \n<p>At another point, as the candidates seemed to be squabbling and talking over one another, Harris brought it to an end by stating: \u201cAmerica does not want to witness a food fight \u2013 they want to know how we\u2019re going to put food on the table.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/28/five-takeaways-second-democratic-presidential-debate\">Five takeaways from the second Democratic presidential debate</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But without a doubt, the debate\u2019s most memorable moment was an exchange between Harris and the former vice-president Joe Biden on race. First, Harris shared how \u201churtful\u201d she found Biden\u2019s warm remarks last week about working with the segregationist senator James Eastland. Then she proceeded to challenge Biden\u2019s well-documented opposition to bussing \u2013 a policy of the 1960s and 70s designed to integrate schools still segregated more than 20 years after the historic Brown v Board of Education decision.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day, and that little girl was me,\u201d Harris said.</p> \n<p>The moment was powerful not only because of the imagery of the seasoned politician coming face-to-face with the adult version of a little girl directly affected by his policy positions. It was also powerful because of the brief debate which followed over the role of the federal government in intervening when states fail to protect civil rights. In that exchange, Biden demonstrated not only his age but his political inclinations by defending local authority over federal remedies such as bussing.</p> \n<p>In doing so, Biden was essentially echoing the \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d arguments of the avowed segregationists whom he was accused of praising just one week earlier.</p> \n<p>Harris was not the only one to challenge Biden, which was to be expected given Biden\u2019s status as the clear frontrunner at this stage of the campaign. Representative Eric Swalwell reminded Biden of his own words from 32 years earlier as he challenged the former vice-president to \u201cpass the torch\u201d to younger generations. Senator Bernie Sanders criticized Biden for his 2002 vote in favor of the Iraq war, and Senator Michael Bennet undermined Biden\u2019s 2012 example of his negotiation skills by raising the point that Biden helped Republicans to extend the controversial Bush tax cuts.</p> \n<p>Biden had some self-inflicted wounds as well. On two occasions as the moderators asked direct yes or no questions to the candidates, Biden\u2019s responses were confusing. One such question was on whether the candidates would decriminalize immigrants who crossed the US border, and the moderator Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz-Balart was forced to ask the question not once, not twice, but three times before getting an answer from Biden.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6e702e3d-1b8d-45b8-be0a-244dbdeaa6c8\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Michael Bennet, Colorado senator</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Bennet raised his national profile earlier this year when the senator, typically known for his congeniality, delivered a fiery speech on the Senate floor, accusing Republican senator Ted Cruz of shedding 'crocodile tears' over the government shutdown.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Joe Biden, former vice president</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Biden unsuccessfully ran for the nomination in 1988 and 2008, and his campaign is likely to be dogged by controversy after&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/04/joe-biden-allegations-physical-behavior-women\">allegations from several women</a>&nbsp;they were left feeling uncomfortable by their physical interactions with him.

      "bodyText": "As the second round of Democratic presidential debates approached, one of the major questions on the minds of voters and political commentators was whether the candidates would focus on trying to differentiate themselves from each other, as was done the previous night, or whether they would focus on critiquing Donald Trump. Senator Kamala Harris chose to do both, and she did so effectively, in what turned out to be the breakout performance of the evening. Very early in the debate, when asked how the candidates planned to pay for their various proposals, Harris put the question back on the moderators. \u201cWhere was that question when the Republicans and Donald Trump passed a tax bill that benefits the top 1% and the biggest corporations in this country?\u201d At another point, as the candidates seemed to be squabbling and talking over one another, Harris brought it to an end by stating: \u201cAmerica does not want to witness a food fight \u2013 they want to know how we\u2019re going to put food on the table.\u201d But without a doubt, the debate\u2019s most memorable moment was an exchange between Harris and the former vice-president Joe Biden on race. First, Harris shared how \u201churtful\u201d she found Biden\u2019s warm remarks last week about working with the segregationist senator James Eastland. Then she proceeded to challenge Biden\u2019s well-documented opposition to bussing \u2013 a policy of the 1960s and 70s designed to integrate schools still segregated more than 20 years after the historic Brown v Board of Education decision. \u201cThere was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day, and that little girl was me,\u201d Harris said. The moment was powerful not only because of the imagery of the seasoned politician coming face-to-face with the adult version of a little girl directly affected by his policy positions. It was also powerful because of the brief debate which followed over the role of the federal government in intervening when states fail to protect civil rights. In that exchange, Biden demonstrated not only his age but his political inclinations by defending local authority over federal remedies such as bussing. In doing so, Biden was essentially echoing the \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d arguments of the avowed segregationists whom he was accused of praising just one week earlier. Harris was not the only one to challenge Biden, which was to be expected given Biden\u2019s status as the clear frontrunner at this stage of the campaign. Representative Eric Swalwell reminded Biden of his own words from 32 years earlier as he challenged the former vice-president to \u201cpass the torch\u201d to younger generations. Senator Bernie Sanders criticized Biden for his 2002 vote in favor of the Iraq war, and Senator Michael Bennet undermined Biden\u2019s 2012 example of his negotiation skills by raising the point that Biden helped Republicans to extend the controversial Bush tax cuts. Biden had some self-inflicted wounds as well. On two occasions as the moderators asked direct yes or no questions to the candidates, Biden\u2019s responses were confusing. One such question was on whether the candidates would decriminalize immigrants who crossed the US border, and the moderator Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz-Balart was forced to ask the question not once, not twice, but three times before getting an answer from Biden. His response \u2013 that immigrants who had not committed any other crimes \u201cshould not be the focus of deportation\u201d \u2013 never truly answered the question, as Biden left open the possibility that although such immigrants might not be the focus of deportation, they could still be thrown out of the country. Sanders, who among those on the stage Thursday night was trailing only Biden in most polling data, was well situated to take advantage of Biden\u2019s missteps. However, Sanders often seemed to give the same answer regardless of the question. From healthcare to climate change, Sanders provided his trademark responses about the need to take on Wall Street, the insurance companies and billionaires. In fact, in his closing remarks he reminded the audience that \u201cnothing will ever change\u201d unless we have the guts to take on big business. It is not likely that Sanders lost ground during the debate, but neither did he do much to strengthen his case. Given the recent surge of Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is largely assumed to be picking off some of Sanders\u2019 support, this means that his performance was unsuccessful. Meanwhile, South Bend\u2019s mayor, Pete Buttigieg, had a steady night as he gave clear and thoughtful answers to most questions. When asked a tough question regarding the recent shooting of a black man by a member of Buttigieg\u2019s police force, Buttigieg admitted that he had failed to get the job done in his response. It could have been one of the more memorable moments from the debate, but the moment was lost when Swalwell asked the question that is on the mind of many black residents in the city of South Bend: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you fire the police chief?\u201d Buttigieg did not have a persuasive answer, and what had been a moment of sincerity became a painful reminder that too often those who have the power to address the ills of structural racism simply fail to use all of the tools at their disposal. It was that question to Buttigieg which led to the exchange between Harris and Biden, as Harris reminded the moderators that as the only black person on the stage she certainly had something to say. And what she went on to say could very well change the direction of the campaign. Cliff Albright is the cofounder of the Black Voters Matter Fund",

Nor was it elevated. But it was reliably entertaining, far more so than Wednesday\u2019s debate (on which our broken clock of a president had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1144056731653169152\">an accurate take</a>). And it did provide useful insight into the differences among the candidates and how the race might unfold.</p> \n<p>The two most obvious observations are: Joe Biden performed miserably, while Kamala Harris was in excellent form.</p> \n<p>The standout moment of the night was a jaw-dropping exchange between Harris and Biden on segregation and busing. Harris told Biden that she had been hurt by his nostalgic recollections of relationships with racist senators. She pointed out that he <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/04/joe-bidens-record-on-racial-integration-is-indefensible\">fought against busing in the 1970s</a>, an issue that was deeply personal for her, as she had been bused as a child. She spoke movingly about the pain caused by Biden\u2019s stances.</p> \n<p>It was an opportunity for Biden to show some thoughtfulness and contrition over one of the ugliest parts of his political history. He did not take that opportunity. Instead, he accused Harris of smearing him: \u201cIt\u2019s a mischaracterization of my position. I did not praise racists.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Biden has indeed praised racists \u2013 he <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/03/everybodys-chum\">gave a glowing eulogy</a> at the funeral of infamous segregationist Strom Thurmond. Biden then had the audacity to frame his opposition to busing as a \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d issue; he had not opposed busing, he said, merely the federal government\u2019s attempt to force racial integration.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6e702e3d-1b8d-45b8-be0a-244dbdeaa6c8\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Michael Bennet, Colorado senator</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Bennet raised his national profile earlier this year when the senator, typically known for his congeniality, delivered a fiery speech on the Senate floor, accusing Republican senator Ted Cruz of shedding 'crocodile tears' over the government shutdown.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Joe Biden, former vice president</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Biden unsuccessfully ran for the nomination in 1988 and 2008, and his campaign is likely to be dogged by controversy after&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/04/joe-biden-allegations-physical-behavior-women\">allegations from several women</a>&nbsp;they were left feeling uncomfortable by their physical interactions with him.

      "bodyText": "The Democratic presidential field is currently so crowded with candidates that it is difficult for televised debates to be anything but a frenzied spectacle. Thursday night\u2019s debate in Miami wasn\u2019t exactly substantive. Nor was it elevated. But it was reliably entertaining, far more so than Wednesday\u2019s debate (on which our broken clock of a president had an accurate take). And it did provide useful insight into the differences among the candidates and how the race might unfold. The two most obvious observations are: Joe Biden performed miserably, while Kamala Harris was in excellent form. The standout moment of the night was a jaw-dropping exchange between Harris and Biden on segregation and busing. Harris told Biden that she had been hurt by his nostalgic recollections of relationships with racist senators. She pointed out that he fought against busing in the 1970s, an issue that was deeply personal for her, as she had been bused as a child. She spoke movingly about the pain caused by Biden\u2019s stances. It was an opportunity for Biden to show some thoughtfulness and contrition over one of the ugliest parts of his political history. He did not take that opportunity. Instead, he accused Harris of smearing him: \u201cIt\u2019s a mischaracterization of my position. I did not praise racists.\u201d But Biden has indeed praised racists \u2013 he gave a glowing eulogy at the funeral of infamous segregationist Strom Thurmond. Biden then had the audacity to frame his opposition to busing as a \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d issue; he had not opposed busing, he said, merely the federal government\u2019s attempt to force racial integration. Harris forcefully rejected this spin, noting that the whole point of federal action on civil rights is to override the inaction of racist local governments. But she could have gone further. Biden was simply lying about his history. He had actually said that \u201cbusing is a bankrupt concept\u201d, and recently-revealed documents show he actively sought the support of segregationists on the issue. It\u2019s not surprising that Biden declined to apologize to or even empathize with Harris. As a general rule, Biden does not apologize, even for egregious remarks. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry for anything I have ever done,\u201d he has said. He also declined on Thursday to clarify or reframe his recent remark that \u201cnothing would fundamentally change\u201d for the wealthy if he became president. He reaffirmed that he is offering a backward-looking politics that wishes to \u201crestore the backbone of America\u201d, making the absurd claim that Donald Trump is the \u201conly president in our history\u201d who has \u201cequated racists and white supremacists with ordinary and decent people\u201d and \u201cengaged and embraced dictators\u201d. (Has he ever read a book on American history?) It\u2019s still not actually clear whether this tendency will hurt him. In a way, it\u2019s all part of the \u201cBiden brand\u201d, and older voters may not be repulsed in the way that younger and more progressive factions in the Democratic party are. Yet even those most blas\u00e9 about Biden\u2019s tendency to make appalling remarks (and then double down on them) will be disappointed by his debate performance.

She was the only candidate other than Sanders himself to advocate eliminating the private insurance industry, and condemned the influence of the rich and powerful more aggressively than almost any other candidate. Harris\u2019 economic populism may be difficult to swallow given her history, but it\u2019s clear that she intends to compete for the supporters of Sanders and Warren. Bernie Sanders was his usual self, thunderously denouncing America\u2019s grotesque inequality. His performance was neither outstanding nor disappointing.

      "body": "<p>It was the second and last night of Democratic presidential debates in Miami, and sparks were flying. Here are the five big takeaways:</p> \n<h2>1. Joe Biden takes incoming fire</h2> \n<p>It was the big question: how would the former vice-president and current <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html\">comfortable frontrunner</a> fare once he finally got in front of the cameras flanked by rivals, some decades his junior?</p> \n<p>Until Thursday night, Biden had kept public exposure to a minimum. But there was nowhere to hide under those brutal TV lights, and at the end of two hours Biden came off stage looking decidedly more worn than when he entered it.</p> \n<p>He began sure-footedly. His opening words were \u201cDonald Trump\u201d \u2013 a pointed reminder that Biden\u2019s main claim to the nomination is his conviction that he is the candidate to unseat the US president. \u201cDonald Trump thinks Wall Street built America. Ordinary working-people Americans built America,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>But then it started slipping. That carefully arranged mannequin of dependable Joe, the politician who gets the job done, the friend and deputy to Obama, started sliding.</p> \n<p>Biden came across as diffident, tentatively raising a finger when he wanted to speak \u2013 a manner that had even the NBC News hosts baffled. He spoke most passionately about what he had done in the past, rather than what he dreamed of doing in the future.</p> \n<p>Asked to state the one big reform he would push in his first term as president, he replied: \u201cThe first thing I would do is defeat Donald Trump.\u201d</p> \n<p>An older guy who doesn\u2019t get the question, let alone answer it. At worst, Biden started to look the one thing that he must avoid to retain his frontrunner status: like a man watching the world spin beyond his control.</p> \n<h2>2. Kamala Harris seizes the day</h2> \n<p>If Biden looked rattled, he had Kamala Harris to thank. From the start of the debate , she had the feel of a politician who had fire in her belly and wind in her sails.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s been a while coming. Harris has struggled to articulate her vision, and has been criticized for her record as California\u2019s former top prosecutor.</p> \n<p>But on Thursday she turned that around, transforming her law enforcement credentials from a vulnerability into a weapon. \u201cAmerica does not want to witness a food fight; it wants to know how to put food on the table,\u201d she admonished the other nine candidates on stage like naughty children as they squabbled.</p> \n<p>Then came the one-liner that will probably go down in the annals alongside \u201cSenator, you\u2019re no Jack Kennedy\u201d.</p> \n<p>Harris already had Biden against the ropes over his recent statements about the \u201ccivility\u201d of having worked productively in the US Senate with notorious <a href=\"file://localhost/-%09https/::www.theguardian.com:us-news:2019:jun:19:joe-biden-segregationist-senators-criticism\">racial segregationists</a>. They got things done together, Biden had argued, including in opposing federal bussing of children to desegregate schools.</p> \n<p>\u201cI do not believe you are a racist,\u201d Harris opened while addressing the former vice-president. You knew from the chill that crossed Biden\u2019s face that history was in the making.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s personal, it was hurtful, to hear you talk about the reputations of two US senators who built their careers on segregation,\u201d she continued. Biden stiffened.</p> \n<p>And then the killer lines: \u201cThere was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate their public school and she was bussed to school every day. That little girl was me.\u201d</p> \n<p>We\u2019ll have to wait to learn whether the exchange was the beginning of the end for Joe Biden\u2019s presidential hopes. But we already know that this is the beginning of the beginning for Kamala Harris.</p> \n<h2>3. The great generational divide</h2> \n<p>There are exactly 40 years separating the youngest candidate on stage \u2013 Pete Buttigieg, 37, and Bernie Sanders, 77. And it showed.</p> \n<p>Much as they tried to project their experience and strength, Biden and Sanders found it difficult to hold the line. Eric Swalwell, a congressman from California, 38, broke the taboo subject by announcing it was time to \u201cpass the torch\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m still holding on to that torch\u201d, Biden replied.</p> \n<p>Buttigieg alluded to the generational issue more subtly \u2013 as Buttigieg tends to do, asking viewers to \u201chelp me deliver that new generation to Washington before it\u2019s too late\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6e702e3d-1b8d-45b8-be0a-244dbdeaa6c8\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Michael Bennet, Colorado senator</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Bennet raised his national profile earlier this year when the senator, typically known for his congeniality, delivered a fiery speech on the Senate floor, accusing Republican senator Ted Cruz of shedding 'crocodile tears' over the government shutdown.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Joe Biden, former vice president</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Biden unsuccessfully ran for the nomination in 1988 and 2008, and his campaign is likely to be dogged by controversy after&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/04/joe-biden-allegations-physical-behavior-women\">allegations from several women</a>&nbsp;they were left feeling uncomfortable by their physical interactions with him.

With a progressive track record but a chorus of critics in New York, can this Democrat overcome his late start and win the chance to take on Trump?</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Cory Booker, New Jersey senator</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Booker first made a name as the hands-on mayor of Newark. Known for his focus on criminal justice reform and impassioned speeches on immigration, he has though been criticized for ties to Wall Street.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Pete Buttigieg, South Bend mayor</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Buttigieg wants to be the first openly gay millennial president. A Harvard graduate and Rhodes scholar, he became the youngest mayor of a mid-size US city at the age of 29. As a Navy Reserve lieutenant he deployed to Afghanistan.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Juli\u00e1n Castro, former housing and urban development secretary</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Castro casts himself as an antidote to Trump and the adminstration's hardline immigration policies. The grandson of a Mexican immigrant and raised by single mother, the 44-year-old Democrat is one of the most prominent Latinos in Democratic politics.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>John Delaney, former Maryland congressman</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has delivered his message of pragmatism to voters in all 99 of Iowa\u2019s counties since he officially kicked off the race in July 2017. The multimillionaire banking entrepreneur wants to build a big-tent party that appeals to independents and moderate Republicans.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Tulsi Gabbard, Hawaii congresswoman</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>An Iraq war veteran who has vowed to run a campaign focused on issues of 'war and peace'. Gabbard made history as the first Samoan American and the first Hindu elected to Congress. But progressives are wary of her past conservative views on on social issues.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Kirsten Gillibrand, New York senator</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Years before the #MeToo movement, the New York senator was leading efforts in Congress to combat sexual assault in the military and on college campuses. The former corporate lawyer has embraced a slate of economic ideas supported by the party\u2019s progressive wing.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Mike Gravel, former senator of Alaska</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>At 88, Gravel will be the oldest candidate to be run for the nomination. However, according to his campaign, the staunch non-interventionist is not running to win, but to challenge Democratic orthodoxy on foreign policy. Will this little-known quixotic figure succeed?</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Kamala Harris, California senator</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Harris is one of Trump\u2019s fiercest critics, and has built a national reputation grilling administration officials during their confirmation hearings. A former state attorney general and the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, Harris believes she has the unique profile to take on Trump.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>John Hickenlooper, former Governor of Colorado</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Before he served two terms as governor of Colorado, the 67-year-old Democrat worked as a geologist for a petroleum company. After a lay off, he switched careers and opened a successful brewpub in Denver that helped to revitalize the city\u2019s downtown.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Jay Inslee, Governor of Washington</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Inslee is running as the \u201conly candidate who will make defeating climate change our nation\u2019s number one priority\u201d.

      "bodyText": "It was the second and last night of Democratic presidential debates in Miami, and sparks were flying. Here are the five big takeaways: 1. Joe Biden takes incoming fire It was the big question: how would the former vice-president and current comfortable frontrunner fare once he finally got in front of the cameras flanked by rivals, some decades his junior? Until Thursday night, Biden had kept public exposure to a minimum. But there was nowhere to hide under those brutal TV lights, and at the end of two hours Biden came off stage looking decidedly more worn than when he entered it. He began sure-footedly. His opening words were \u201cDonald Trump\u201d \u2013 a pointed reminder that Biden\u2019s main claim to the nomination is his conviction that he is the candidate to unseat the US president. \u201cDonald Trump thinks Wall Street built America. Ordinary working-people Americans built America,\u201d he said. But then it started slipping. That carefully arranged mannequin of dependable Joe, the politician who gets the job done, the friend and deputy to Obama, started sliding. Biden came across as diffident, tentatively raising a finger when he wanted to speak \u2013 a manner that had even the NBC News hosts baffled. He spoke most passionately about what he had done in the past, rather than what he dreamed of doing in the future. Asked to state the one big reform he would push in his first term as president, he replied: \u201cThe first thing I would do is defeat Donald Trump.\u201d An older guy who doesn\u2019t get the question, let alone answer it. At worst, Biden started to look the one thing that he must avoid to retain his frontrunner status: like a man watching the world spin beyond his control. 2. Kamala Harris seizes the day If Biden looked rattled, he had Kamala Harris to thank. From the start of the debate , she had the feel of a politician who had fire in her belly and wind in her sails. It\u2019s been a while coming. Harris has struggled to articulate her vision, and has been criticized for her record as California\u2019s former top prosecutor. But on Thursday she turned that around, transforming her law enforcement credentials from a vulnerability into a weapon. \u201cAmerica does not want to witness a food fight; it wants to know how to put food on the table,\u201d she admonished the other nine candidates on stage like naughty children as they squabbled. Then came the one-liner that will probably go down in the annals alongside \u201cSenator, you\u2019re no Jack Kennedy\u201d. Harris already had Biden against the ropes over his recent statements about the \u201ccivility\u201d of having worked productively in the US Senate with notorious racial segregationists. They got things done together, Biden had argued, including in opposing federal bussing of children to desegregate schools. \u201cI do not believe you are a racist,\u201d Harris opened while addressing the former vice-president. You knew from the chill that crossed Biden\u2019s face that history was in the making. \u201cIt\u2019s personal, it was hurtful, to hear you talk about the reputations of two US senators who built their careers on segregation,\u201d she continued. Biden stiffened. And then the killer lines: \u201cThere was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate their public school and she was bussed to school every day. That little girl was me.\u201d We\u2019ll have to wait to learn whether the exchange was the beginning of the end for Joe Biden\u2019s presidential hopes. But we already know that this is the beginning of the beginning for Kamala Harris. 3. The great generational divide There are exactly 40 years separating the youngest candidate on stage \u2013 Pete Buttigieg, 37, and Bernie Sanders, 77. And it showed. Much as they tried to project their experience and strength, Biden and Sanders found it difficult to hold the line. Eric Swalwell, a congressman from California, 38, broke the taboo subject by announcing it was time to \u201cpass the torch\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m still holding on to that torch\u201d, Biden replied. Buttigieg alluded to the generational issue more subtly \u2013 as Buttigieg tends to do, asking viewers to \u201chelp me deliver that new generation to Washington before it\u2019s too late\u201d. 4. A good night for \u2026 Kamala Harris, obviously. Pete Buttigieg. The mayor of South Bend, Indiana was challenged over his handling of the recent fatal shooting in his town of a black man by a white policeman who had his body camera turned off. He weathered the storm. Buttigieg admitted that South Bend\u2019s police force remains disproportionally white \u201cbecause I couldn\u2019t get it done\u201d. He added: \u201cI am determined to bring about a day when a white person and a black person driving a vehicle feels the exact same thing when they see a policeman \u2013 a feeling of safety not fear.\u201d Gun violence as a debating issue. Swalwell said he would ban and then buy back every assault weapon in America; Buttigieg, leaning on his status as the only war veteran on stage, said that guns were \u201ctearing us apart\u201d; Harris promised to take executive action to ban the importation of assault rifles. 5. A bad night for \u2026 Joe Biden, obviously. Bernie Sanders, who looked as though he were stuck in the same old groove. And the also-rans. There have been plenty of moments over these past two nights when nobody seemed to be able to remember why certain individuals were even on stage. Were they gatecrashers? That thought came forcefully on Thursday night with the two jokers in the pack \u2013 Andrew Yang, a former tech entrepreneur, and Marianne Williamson, a bestselling author of self-help healing books (typical title: 21 Spiritual Lessons for Surrendering Your Weight Forever). What was Williamson doing talking about love being the way to defeat Trump?",

      "body": "<h2>Top story: \u2018Treated like disposable labour\u2019</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray here with Friday\u2019s plat du journalism.</p> \n<p>Workers\u2019 rights have failed to keep pace with the dismantling of the nine-to-five working week as Britain\u2019s gig economy has more than doubled in size over three years to account for 4.7 million workers, the TUC has warned, in a study conducted with the University of Hertfordshire. \u201cHuge numbers are being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/28/gig-economy-in-britain-doubles-accounting-for-47-million-workers\">forced to take on casual and insecure platform work</a> \u2013 often on top of other jobs,\u201d said Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress. \u201cBut as we\u2019ve seen with Uber too often these workers are denied their rights and are treated like disposable labour.\u201d</p> \n<p>Overall employment in the UK has reached a record 32.75 million following a boom in job creation since the 2008 financial crisis. But economists believe employment is also increasingly precarious, putting pressure on living standards. Poverty while in work has increased, alongside the use of food banks, and average wages after inflation remain below the level recorded before the 2008 crash. The government promised to boost workers\u2019 rights after a landmark review of the gig economy but Brexit has left that process stalled, and unions and Labour say the measures do not go far enough.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Democratic debate vol. 2 \u2013 </strong>An exchange on race <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/27/second-democratic-debate-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\">rattled frontrunner Joe Biden</a> as 10 more Democratic presidential candidates clashed in Miami on Thursday night. Biden squared up against the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders but they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/27/who-won-second-democratic-debate\">overshadowed by strong performances from other candidates</a>. California senator Kamala Harris <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/28/democratic-debate-kamala-harris-leads-changing-of-guard\">raised questions over Biden\u2019s approach to racial issues</a> after he made a remark recently on the campaign trail speaking fondly of his relationship with segregationist senators.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bb112266-ec9b-411c-a6ed-ea68ccc20b51\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S6-UC8yr0Aw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThat is a mischaracterisation of my position across the board. I did not praise racists,\u201d Biden responded. Sanders called Donald Trump a \u201cpathological liar\u201d who conned American workers and said the best way to beat Trump was to \u201cexpose him for the fraud that he is\u201d. It was also a big night for Pete Buttigieg, who has soared from near-anonymity to the top of the Democratic field but has faced sharp criticism for his handling as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, of a fatal shooting of a black man by a white police officer.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>G20 under way \u2013 </strong>Theresa May is expected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/28/may-to-press-putin-over-novichok-attack-in-face-to-face-meeting\">press Vladimir Putin over the novichok attack in Salisbury</a>, and the Russian agents suspected of carrying it out, when she meets with him today. Vladimir Putin has said in an FT interview that western liberalism is \u201cobsolete \u2026 It has come into conflict with the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population\u201d. The European council president Donald Tusk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/27/putin-skripal-attack-should-not-affect-uk-russia-relations\">hit back sharply this morning</a>: \u201cWhoever claims that liberal democracy is obsolete, also claims that freedoms are obsolete, that the rule of law is obsolete and that human rights are obsolete. What I find really obsolete are: authoritarianism, personality cults, the rule of oligarchs. Even if sometimes they may seem effective.\u201d Donald Trump and Xi Jinping have been urged to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/28/g20-world-leaders-urge-trump-and-xi-to-reach-a-trade-deal-or-risk-global-economy\">reach a trade deal for the sake of the global economy</a> as world leaders gather in Japan.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Windrush warnings were ignored \u2013 </strong>The Home Office failed in its legal duty to counter racial discrimination when it implemented its anti-immigration hostile environment programme, a draft investigation into the causes of the Windrush scandal has reportedly found. \u201cThis appears particularly reckless considering the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/27/home-office-windrush-report-damns-hostile-environment-policy\">significant warnings that the department was given</a> about their potential consequences,\u201d says the draft report, seen by Channel 4 News. As a result of Theresa May\u2019s hostile environment policy, thousands of people who had lived legally in the UK for decades found themselves wrongly classified as illegal immigrants.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Shock over Alabama case \u2013</strong> A woman who was shot in the stomach while pregnant, killing the foetus, has been charged with its manslaughter. Police in Alabama say the charge is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/27/alabama-pregnant-woman-shot-manslaughter-charge-marshae-jones\">justified because Marshae Jones, 27, started the fight</a> with the shooter, who remains free. Alabama is one of 38 states with foetal homicide laws that recognise a foetus as a potential victim. It is also a \u201cstand-your-ground\u201d state where people can use physical force to defend themselves if their reason is \u201cjustifiable\u201d. The Alabama governor, Kay Ivey, signed a bill in May banning abortion in almost every circumstance \u2013 including rape and incest. Jones\u2019s case has raised alarm among pro-choice groups, who say it is shocking evidence of how the abortion laws are being used against pregnant women.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Dutch auction of chaos\u2019 \u2013 </strong>The announcement of the new Tory leader is still three weeks away. Just leaving that there \u2026 in Brexit developments Boris Johnson has refused to categorically rule out suspending parliament in order to let Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/27/boris-johnson-refuses-rule-out-forcing-through-no-deal-brexit\">crash out of the EU without a deal</a>. On the hustings in Bournemouth, Johnson\u2019s rival, Jeremy Hunt, pledged to resign as prime minister if he did not manage to \u201cdeliver Brexit and deliver it very quickly\u201d. Simon Jenkins writes this morning that Johnson\u2019s hard Brexit is \u201cbased on a legal fantasy, that under World Trade Organisation rules you can have an agreement without a deal. Hunt, meanwhile, feels obliged to repeat May\u2019s \u2018no deal is better than a bad deal\u2019 mantra. This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/28/no-deal-brexit-boris-johnson-jeremy-hunt\">Dutch auction of chaos is cheered on by Tory party members</a> \u2026 Every indication now is that May\u2019s withdrawal deal is the only conceivable way of achieving a 31 October Brexit.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Gambling with lives\u2019 \u2013 </strong>The parents of Jack Ritchie, a gambling addict who killed himself aged 24, have launched a legal bid to hold the government liable. Charles and Liz Ritchie want the inquest into his death to take into account article 2 of the European convention on human rights \u2013 the right to life. It would consider <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/28/gambling-addicts-parents-launch-action-to-hold-government-liable-for-his-death\">whether the government failed to protect Jack from risk</a>. \u201cOver many years they failed to regulate gambling, educate the public about the health risks or make adequate treatment resources available to people who suffer harm,\u201d said Charles and Liz Ritchie, who founded the charity Gambling With Lives after Jack\u2019s death. The Sheffield coroner, Christopher Dorries, is due to hear arguments from the Ritchies\u2019 lawyers today. The Gambling Commission and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, which oversees gambling policy, are opposing the move.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>I\u2019ve a new idea, Tim \u2013 </strong>Jony Ive, the British designer of the iMac, iPod, iPhone and Apple Watch, is to leave Apple after 30 years to set up his own creative company. \u201cThis just seems like a natural and gentle time to make this change,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Treated like disposable labour\u2019 Hello, Warren Murray here with Friday\u2019s plat du journalism. Workers\u2019 rights have failed to keep pace with the dismantling of the nine-to-five working week as Britain\u2019s gig economy has more than doubled in size over three years to account for 4.7 million workers, the TUC has warned, in a study conducted with the University of Hertfordshire. \u201cHuge numbers are being forced to take on casual and insecure platform work \u2013 often on top of other jobs,\u201d said Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress. \u201cBut as we\u2019ve seen with Uber too often these workers are denied their rights and are treated like disposable labour.\u201d Overall employment in the UK has reached a record 32.75 million following a boom in job creation since the 2008 financial crisis. But economists believe employment is also increasingly precarious, putting pressure on living standards. Poverty while in work has increased, alongside the use of food banks, and average wages after inflation remain below the level recorded before the 2008 crash. The government promised to boost workers\u2019 rights after a landmark review of the gig economy but Brexit has left that process stalled, and unions and Labour say the measures do not go far enough. * * * Democratic debate vol. 2 \u2013 An exchange on race rattled frontrunner Joe Biden as 10 more Democratic presidential candidates clashed in Miami on Thursday night. Biden squared up against the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders but they were overshadowed by strong performances from other candidates. California senator Kamala Harris raised questions over Biden\u2019s approach to racial issues after he made a remark recently on the campaign trail speaking fondly of his relationship with segregationist senators. \u201cThat is a mischaracterisation of my position across the board. I did not praise racists,\u201d Biden responded. Sanders called Donald Trump a \u201cpathological liar\u201d who conned American workers and said the best way to beat Trump was to \u201cexpose him for the fraud that he is\u201d. It was also a big night for Pete Buttigieg, who has soared from near-anonymity to the top of the Democratic field but has faced sharp criticism for his handling as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, of a fatal shooting of a black man by a white police officer. * * * G20 under way \u2013 Theresa May is expected to press Vladimir Putin over the novichok attack in Salisbury, and the Russian agents suspected of carrying it out, when she meets with him today. Vladimir Putin has said in an FT interview that western liberalism is \u201cobsolete \u2026 It has come into conflict with the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population\u201d. The European council president Donald Tusk hit back sharply this morning: \u201cWhoever claims that liberal democracy is obsolete, also claims that freedoms are obsolete, that the rule of law is obsolete and that human rights are obsolete. What I find really obsolete are: authoritarianism, personality cults, the rule of oligarchs. Even if sometimes they may seem effective.\u201d Donald Trump and Xi Jinping have been urged to reach a trade deal for the sake of the global economy as world leaders gather in Japan. * * * Windrush warnings were ignored \u2013 The Home Office failed in its legal duty to counter racial discrimination when it implemented its anti-immigration hostile environment programme, a draft investigation into the causes of the Windrush scandal has reportedly found. \u201cThis appears particularly reckless considering the significant warnings that the department was given about their potential consequences,\u201d says the draft report, seen by Channel 4 News. As a result of Theresa May\u2019s hostile environment policy, thousands of people who had lived legally in the UK for decades found themselves wrongly classified as illegal immigrants. * * * Shock over Alabama case \u2013 A woman who was shot in the stomach while pregnant, killing the foetus, has been charged with its manslaughter. Police in Alabama say the charge is justified because Marshae Jones, 27, started the fight with the shooter, who remains free. Alabama is one of 38 states with foetal homicide laws that recognise a foetus as a potential victim. It is also a \u201cstand-your-ground\u201d state where people can use physical force to defend themselves if their reason is \u201cjustifiable\u201d. The Alabama governor, Kay Ivey, signed a bill in May banning abortion in almost every circumstance \u2013 including rape and incest. Jones\u2019s case has raised alarm among pro-choice groups, who say it is shocking evidence of how the abortion laws are being used against pregnant women. * * * \u2018Dutch auction of chaos\u2019 \u2013 The announcement of the new Tory leader is still three weeks away. Just leaving that there \u2026 in Brexit developments Boris Johnson has refused to categorically rule out suspending parliament in order to let Britain crash out of the EU without a deal. On the hustings in Bournemouth, Johnson\u2019s rival, Jeremy Hunt, pledged to resign as prime minister if he did not manage to \u201cdeliver Brexit and deliver it very quickly\u201d. Simon Jenkins writes this morning that Johnson\u2019s hard Brexit is \u201cbased on a legal fantasy, that under World Trade Organisation rules you can have an agreement without a deal. Hunt, meanwhile, feels obliged to repeat May\u2019s \u2018no deal is better than a bad deal\u2019 mantra. This Dutch auction of chaos is cheered on by Tory party members \u2026 Every indication now is that May\u2019s withdrawal deal is the only conceivable way of achieving a 31 October Brexit.\u201d * * * \u2018Gambling with lives\u2019 \u2013 The parents of Jack Ritchie, a gambling addict who killed himself aged 24, have launched a legal bid to hold the government liable. Charles and Liz Ritchie want the inquest into his death to take into account article 2 of the European convention on human rights \u2013 the right to life. It would consider whether the government failed to protect Jack from risk. \u201cOver many years they failed to regulate gambling, educate the public about the health risks or make adequate treatment resources available to people who suffer harm,\u201d said Charles and Liz Ritchie, who founded the charity Gambling With Lives after Jack\u2019s death. The Sheffield coroner, Christopher Dorries, is due to hear arguments from the Ritchies\u2019 lawyers today. The Gambling Commission and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, which oversees gambling policy, are opposing the move. * * * I\u2019ve a new idea, Tim \u2013 Jony Ive, the British designer of the iMac, iPod, iPhone and Apple Watch, is to leave Apple after 30 years to set up his own creative company. \u201cThis just seems like a natural and gentle time to make this change,\u201d he said. Ive worked on the original Apple PowerBook 140, released in 1991, while still employed at UK design firm Tangerine. His first true hit with Apple was the 1998 iMac with its translucent \u201cBondi blue\u201d casing. Starting in 2012, he took over design of Apple\u2019s software, which resulted in a total overhaul of the iPhone\u2019s operating system, iOS. He was also involved in designing Apple\u2019s new headquarters, Apple Park, the $5bn futuristic \u201cspaceship\u201d that opened in 2017. Today in Focus podcast: Did the Saudis get away with Khashoggi? A UN report on the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi has said there is credible evidence linking the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to the crime. Nick Hopkins and Stephanie Kirchgaessner discuss the killing and the fallout in Saudi Arabia and among its allies.

By then, Hoxha had led a Stalinist dictatorship in the country for four decades, turning Albania into one of the most isolated and repressive states in the world.</p> <p>During the communist period, the whole area around Hoxha\u2019s house in Albania\u2019s capital city, Tirana, was sealed off by police and secret agents.

The former headquarters of the Sigurimi, Hoxha\u2019s feared secret police, is now a museum where visitors can marvel at the all-pervasive nature of surveillance and informants during the communist period. Exhibits include a training manual showing officers how to insert tiny listening devices into walls, picture frames and even the soles of people\u2019s shoes.</p> <p>Hoxha had approximately 168,000 concrete bunkers built during an eight-year period, after getting the idea from a visit to North Korea. The largest, on the outskirts of Tirana, is spread over five below-ground floors, sealed with multiple six-inch-thick concrete doors and containing a decontamination room, living quarters for Hoxha and his close circle and a large hall where sessions of parliament could be held underground. Two years ago, it was opened to the public as a history museum.</p> <p>Most striking are the plans to transform a vast concrete pyramid in the very centre of Tirana, next to the prime minister\u2019s office. Constructed in the late 1980s as a museum to the deceased dictator, the pyramid fell into disrepair after the collapse of communism and was used variously as a nightclub, an informal shopping centre and Nato headquarters during the 1999 campaign in neighbouring Kosovo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"78d9b619685a535f503ef33467598c9b3530babe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78d9b619685a535f503ef33467598c9b3530babe/0_0_3957_2375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Enver Hoxha memorial museum memorial in tirana ironically called the pyramid 1997\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Pyramid of Tirana, once a memorial museum to Enver Hoxha, is to be redeveloped to mirror the city\u2019s transformation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Network Photographers/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThat building represents our transition,\u201d said Erion Veliaj, Tirana\u2019s energetic mayor, who has launched a project to transform the city centre by 2030. \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphorical display of what we\u2019ve gone through. If, instead of the pyramid, you said Albania, it is that story. The paranoia and so-called glory of communist ambitions, the brutal transition to casino capitalism, and then this renaissance.

      "bodyText": "The interiors of Enver Hoxha\u2019s cavernous three-story villa are mostly just as they were when Albania\u2019s communist leader died in 1985. By then, Hoxha had led a Stalinist dictatorship in the country for four decades, turning Albania into one of the most isolated and repressive states in the world. During the communist period, the whole area around Hoxha\u2019s house in Albania\u2019s capital city, Tirana, was sealed off by police and secret agents. Known as the Blloku, the district functioned as a kind of wall-less Kremlin in the heart of Tirana, reserved for the party elite and their families. Now, the Blloku is Tirana\u2019s most happening neighbourhood, full of bars, nightclubs and restaurants. Amid them all is the ghostly presence of Hoxha\u2019s house, untouched, shuttered and closed to the public. Modern-day Albania is now looking to join the European Union, and after many years during which people preferred to forget than to dredge up the past, Albanians are now coming to terms with the legacy of the Hoxha-era repressions and surveillance state. Attention is turning to how the dictator\u2019s house might be opened to the public. Inside, the walls are adorned with socialist realist art, while multiple living rooms are equipped with chunky Albanian-made television sets, on which Hoxha and his wife would on occasion watch video footage of the torture and interrogation of those accused of being political opponents. The multiple doors to Hoxha\u2019s bedroom have soundproof cushioned cladding, while in the basement there is a swimming pool and an escape door leading to a tunnel, through which the paranoid Hoxha could flee to an underground bunker in case of attack. Albania\u2019s current prime minister, Edi Rama, said he has been thinking for some time about the \u201cbig dilemma\u201d of what to do with the house, fearing it would be equally inappropriate either to keep it in its current state, as a sort of shrine, or to completely destroy it. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to find a good solution where the past is still there but you are serving the future,\u201d he said in a recent interview with the Guardian. Other buildings symbolising the Hoxha regime have already been repurposed for public use. The former headquarters of the Sigurimi, Hoxha\u2019s feared secret police, is now a museum where visitors can marvel at the all-pervasive nature of surveillance and informants during the communist period. Exhibits include a training manual showing officers how to insert tiny listening devices into walls, picture frames and even the soles of people\u2019s shoes. Hoxha had approximately 168,000 concrete bunkers built during an eight-year period, after getting the idea from a visit to North Korea. The largest, on the outskirts of Tirana, is spread over five below-ground floors, sealed with multiple six-inch-thick concrete doors and containing a decontamination room, living quarters for Hoxha and his close circle and a large hall where sessions of parliament could be held underground. Two years ago, it was opened to the public as a history museum. Most striking are the plans to transform a vast concrete pyramid in the very centre of Tirana, next to the prime minister\u2019s office. Constructed in the late 1980s as a museum to the deceased dictator, the pyramid fell into disrepair after the collapse of communism and was used variously as a nightclub, an informal shopping centre and Nato headquarters during the 1999 campaign in neighbouring Kosovo. \u201cThat building represents our transition,\u201d said Erion Veliaj, Tirana\u2019s energetic mayor, who has launched a project to transform the city centre by 2030. \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphorical display of what we\u2019ve gone through. If, instead of the pyramid, you said Albania, it is that story. The paranoia and so-called glory of communist ambitions, the brutal transition to casino capitalism, and then this renaissance. So now it\u2019s time for the pyramid to match the renaissance of the city.\u201d The Dutch architectural firm MVRDV has unveiled plans for a total overhaul of the pyramid, keeping the original structure but finishing it in white, and turning the inside into an IT learning centre for schoolchildren. Veliaj said he expected the project to be finished by the end of summer. The mayor said he had specified that the design should allow for people to climb up the outsides of the pyramid, as this was the pyramid\u2019s association for a whole generation of Tirana\u2019s youth in the years after communism fell. \u201cI remember our butts would catch fire sliding down. We all used to have the same corduroy pants and you could see them losing their corduroy ribbing,\u201d he recalled. Hoxha rarely travelled, and spent much of his last decade chain-smoking at his villa in the Blloku. He shared it with his wife, who is still alive and now aged 98, and his three adult children, whose bedrooms were decked out with escapist motifs of horses and palm trees. He had most of his close associates from the early years shot, and also had thousands of real and imagined political enemies among the rest of the population executed, imprisoned or exiled to closed-off settlements from which they were forbidden to leave. As part of the effort to create a homogenous population, beards and long hair were banned, with a barber stationed at the airport ready to cut the hair of anyone among the rare groups of foreign visitors, usually Marxist-Leninist groups, who arrived inappropriately coiffed. One of the most noticeable features of his house is the predominance of books, with thousands of tomes arranged on sets of shelves in many of the rooms. Hoxha was a voracious reader, and checked the Paris publishing catalogues each year to order batches of books on everything from Marxist history to the sexual mores of ancient civilisations. This was in stark contrast to the population, who were banned from reading most 20th-century literature. Rama, who was an art student in the 1980s, remembered that one exception was Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman, which had been mistakenly classified as an agriculture book and passed by the censor. \u201cI remember there were five copies in the faculty of agriculture and you can\u2019t believe how much they were circulating,\u201d he said. Rama said the house had a \u201cwow factor\u201d which would be important to keep when it is finally opened to the public. \u201cIf you erase everything completely it would not be good. It\u2019s important to have his ghost inside. My point is that it should be Enver Hoxha\u2019s house, but inside all the things the guy would hate should happen.\u201d This could include modern art classes and exhibitions, literature talks and foreign policy discussions, said Rama, all things Hoxha would have despised.

Their viral clash on bussing as a means of achieving racial balance in schools hammered home not only how out of step Biden is with the Democratic left\u2019s evolving stance on identity issues but also his age \u2013 since Harris was a schoolchild when Biden was cutting deals with former segregationists.</p> \n<p>Harris\u2019s victory may be pyrrhic, however, since bussing is an unpopular subject with a long history of widening divisions between Democrats.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Geoffrey Kabaservice is the director of political studies at the Niskanen Center in Washington DC as well as the author of Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>Doug Pagitt: Harris won the room</strong></h2> \n<p>Three candidates clearly had the energy in the room tonight: Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris. While the other candidates had their moments, there was no doubt that the applause and focused interest in the room was behind those three.</p> \n<p>As someone who organizes religious people to vote for Democratic candidates, I found it interesting to hear the enthusiastic and prolonged applause for Pete Buttigieg when he said that the Christian faith calls us to care for kids and not put them in cages and he called out the hypocrisy of the Trump administration. It seemed like an indicator that there is interest and enthusiasm for Democratic candidates who talk about faith.</p> \n<p>Of all the candidates, Biden issued the most forceful denunciations of Trump, and the crowd ate it up. But by the end of the debate it became clear how much passion there is for Harris.

His vague and non-committal description of the country he would build as president seemed to accomplish little aside from reifying the message he gave rich donors at a recent fundraiser: \u201cNothing would fundamentally change.\u201d Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist Malaika Jabali: No one really won In a Democratic debate that was obnoxious, contentious, and spent the first 30 minutes largely setting up socialism and progressive policies \u2013 like free healthcare, free education, and taxing the wealthy \u2013 as impracticable and not the popular positions that they are, no one really won. Nevertheless, within these confines Kamala Harris succeeded. She was assertive but composed, she forcefully addressed racism, and she pushed Biden on his anti-bussing record. Her prosecutorial record will be scrutinized as the race draws on, but tonight she has much to celebrate. Malaika Jabali is a public policy attorney, writer, and activist whose writing has appeared in Essence, Jacobin, the Intercept, Glamour and elsewhere Geoffrey Kabaservice: Biden was out of step with his own party Kamala Harris was the standout in tonight\u2019s debate, bringing a force, focus, and fire that had been missing since her campaign rollout. Her gains came directly at Joe Biden\u2019s expense and punctured the image he\u2019d cultivated of an above-the-fray front runner. Their viral clash on bussing as a means of achieving racial balance in schools hammered home not only how out of step Biden is with the Democratic left\u2019s evolving stance on identity issues but also his age \u2013 since Harris was a schoolchild when Biden was cutting deals with former segregationists. Harris\u2019s victory may be pyrrhic, however, since bussing is an unpopular subject with a long history of widening divisions between Democrats. Geoffrey Kabaservice is the director of political studies at the Niskanen Center in Washington DC as well as the author of Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party Doug Pagitt: Harris won the room Three candidates clearly had the energy in the room tonight: Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris. While the other candidates had their moments, there was no doubt that the applause and focused interest in the room was behind those three. As someone who organizes religious people to vote for Democratic candidates, I found it interesting to hear the enthusiastic and prolonged applause for Pete Buttigieg when he said that the Christian faith calls us to care for kids and not put them in cages and he called out the hypocrisy of the Trump administration. It seemed like an indicator that there is interest and enthusiasm for Democratic candidates who talk about faith. Of all the candidates, Biden issued the most forceful denunciations of Trump, and the crowd ate it up. But by the end of the debate it became clear how much passion there is for Harris. I\u2019m not sure how it came across on television, but to those of us inside the room she projected powerful charisma and confidence.

If successful, Biden would become the oldest person to be elected president in US history.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Bill de Blasio, New York mayor</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Now in his second term as mayor of New York City, De Blasio is a hometown foe of Donald Trump's running on the message that there's plenty of money in the country but it's in the wrong hands. With a progressive track record but a chorus of critics in New York, can this Democrat overcome his late start and win the chance to take on Trump?</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Cory Booker, New Jersey senator</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Booker first made a name as the hands-on mayor of Newark. Known for his focus on criminal justice reform and impassioned speeches on immigration, he has though been criticized for ties to Wall Street.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Pete Buttigieg, South Bend mayor</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Buttigieg wants to be the first openly gay millennial president. A Harvard graduate and Rhodes scholar, he became the youngest mayor of a mid-size US city at the age of 29. As a Navy Reserve lieutenant he deployed to Afghanistan.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Juli\u00e1n Castro, former housing and urban development secretary</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Castro casts himself as an antidote to Trump and the adminstration's hardline immigration policies. The grandson of a Mexican immigrant and raised by single mother, the 44-year-old Democrat is one of the most prominent Latinos in Democratic politics.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>John Delaney, former Maryland congressman</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has delivered his message of pragmatism to voters in all 99 of Iowa\u2019s counties since he officially kicked off the race in July 2017. The multimillionaire banking entrepreneur wants to build a big-tent party that appeals to independents and moderate Republicans.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Tulsi Gabbard, Hawaii congresswoman</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>An Iraq war veteran who has vowed to run a campaign focused on issues of 'war and peace'. Gabbard made history as the first Samoan American and the first Hindu elected to Congress. But progressives are wary of her past conservative views on on social issues.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Kirsten Gillibrand, New York senator</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Years before the #MeToo movement, the New York senator was leading efforts in Congress to combat sexual assault in the military and on college campuses. The former corporate lawyer has embraced a slate of economic ideas supported by the party\u2019s progressive wing.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Mike Gravel, former senator of Alaska</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>At 88, Gravel will be the oldest candidate to be run for the nomination. However, according to his campaign, the staunch non-interventionist is not running to win, but to challenge Democratic orthodoxy on foreign policy. Will this little-known quixotic figure succeed?</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Kamala Harris, California senator</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Harris is one of Trump\u2019s fiercest critics, and has built a national reputation grilling administration officials during their confirmation hearings. A former state attorney general and the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, Harris believes she has the unique profile to take on Trump.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>John Hickenlooper, former Governor of Colorado</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Before he served two terms as governor of Colorado, the 67-year-old Democrat worked as a geologist for a petroleum company. After a lay off, he switched careers and opened a successful brewpub in Denver that helped to revitalize the city\u2019s downtown.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Jay Inslee, Governor of Washington</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Inslee is running as the \u201conly candidate who will make defeating climate change our nation\u2019s number one priority\u201d. As the country experiences more powerful hurricanes, scorching wildfires and submerged coastlines, polls show public concern is growing.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota senator</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>On Election Night 2018, Klobuchar coasted to a third term as senator in a state Trump almost won. Next morning she was on every short list of potential presidential candidates. Supporters say her success with rural voters makes her a formidable candidate in the Rust Belt, while her calm demeanour provides a clear contrast with Trump.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Wayne Messam, mayor of Miramar, Florida</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Facing long odds, Messam, the son of Jamaican immigrants to the US and a former receiver for the Florida State Seminoles football team, is tossing his hat in the ring anyway. The 44-year-old businessman became Miramar\u2019s first black mayor when he was elected in 2015.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Seth Moulton, Massachusetts congressman</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Harvard educated Marine veteran arrived in Congress with a bang, after unseating a nine-term Democratic incumbent in a Massachusetts primary in 2014. Moulton has continued to make waves by calling for 'generational change' in Democratic leadership and supported an effort to block Nancy Pelosi from becoming House Speaker in 2018.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Beto O'Rourke, former Texas congressman</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A one-time guitarist for an El Paso punk band called Foss, O\u2019Rourke had kept a relatively low profile as a three-term congressman with little name recognition. He rose to national prominence during the 2018 midterms, when his bid to unseat Senator Ted Cruz&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/04/beto-orourke-texas-senate-ted-cruz-election\">garnered unprecedented grassroots support and a historic fundraising haul</a>.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Tim Ryan, Ohio congressman</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Elected to Congress in 2003 at just 29, Ryan represents the blue-collar voters Democrats hope to win back in 2020. He won national attention when he challenged Nancy Pelosi for Democratic leadership in 2016. He has continued to push for a generational change in leadership.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Bernie Sanders, Vermont senator</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Sanders turned a long-shot, anti-establishment bid for the presidency into a \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d that energized the party\u2019s progressive base. His political career began nearly 40 years ago, but it wasn\u2019t until his 2016 run that Sanders became a national figure as a new generation of Democrats \u2013 and 2020 contenders \u2013 embraced his populist economic policies.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Eric Swalwell, California congressman</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Raised in Iowa and California, the 38-year-old Democrat would be among the youngest candidates in the race. Swalwell serves on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigating Russian collusion, a position that has earned him frequent appearances on cable news shows.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Her sharp criticism of Wall Street and big corporations has made Warren a favorite among progressive activists, and she will campaign on a message of a rigged economic system and income inequality.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Marianne Williamson, author</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is not the spiritual guru and a new age author\u2019s first foray into politics: in 2014, she mounted an unsuccessful congressional bid in California. Her entry adds some star-power to the race that may attract more celebrities.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Andrew Yang, businessman</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A former tech executive and entrepreneur running the longest of long shot campaigns centered on the perils of automation.

There\u2019ll also be performances from Anne-Marie, Hozier and Lewis Capaldi; BBC Four has Johnny Marr and country-pop star Carrie Underwood. \u2022 From 7.30pm, the focus will be on female pop: Janet Jackson\u2019s Pyramid stage performance, plus Sigrid and Lizzo lower down the bill, and Florence-alike Freya Ridings popping in for an acoustic performance. Neneh Cherry\u2019s set will be shown on BBC Four from 8pm, along with the Park stage\u2019s secret set which is \u201ca much loved British band\u201d. \u2022 Then it\u2019s blokey indie rock: the Courteeners tee up Liam Gallagher on BBC Four from 9pm, with BBC Two ceding to the Killers\u2019 headlining the Pyramid stage at 9.45pm, also aired on Radio 2. Afterwards there\u2019ll be party fare from Mark Ronson, Hot Chip and a report from the reliably debauched Block9 area. Sunday \u2022 On 5 Live from 11am, Laura Whitmore has the potentially brilliant job of talking to people around the festival site, as the edibles wear off and time dissolves. \u2022 The Beeb allows its coverage to make a rare foray on to BBC One from 6pm, thanks to Kylie \u2013 see her hits-packed set from earlier in the afternoon, along with highlights from Miley Cyrus. The awesome Jamaican reggae star Koffee will do an acoustic number on this show too \u2013 a possibly star-making turn. \u2022 There\u2019s two chances to see the startlingly talented teen gothpop star Billie Eilish, on BBC Four and BBC Two from 9pm. The latter show will feature the Cure\u2019s headline set \u2013 also aired on 6 Music \u2013 and highlights from Rex Orange County and the Streets, but be sure to catch a short film about Langa Methodist Church Choir, a stirring 40-strong Cape Town ensemble personally invited by the Eavises after they met during a charity project. \u2022 BBC Four\u2019s coverage ends the weekend on a real high. It wisely kicks off at 7pm with everyone\u2019s favourite debonair dilf, Jeff Goldblum, as he appears with his swing band the Mildred Snitzer Orchestra. Mavis Staples is still breathing righteous social fury at the age of 79; Kamasi Washington\u2019s cosmic jazz might have got a bit stately of late, but is still a big sumptuous experience; Janelle Mon\u00e1e matches the stage charisma of her hero Prince; Vampire Weekend hit the Pyramid with their best album to date; and Christine and the Queens\u2019 live show is an incredible blend of contemporary dance, pop and self-help seminar \u2013 all of it worth dipping out of the Cure for.",

He told me about his experiences of flight and refuge, focusing on what he saw and heard while held in indefinite detention here in the UK. \u201cYou\u2019ve no voice when you\u2019re inside there,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But Jean Paul does have a voice. He has a degree in modern languages from the University of Strasbourg and a masters from Soas University of London, and has taught for many years in London schools, with a special focus on inspiring children from ethnic minorities. It takes only a few moments in his company to understand that he has a gift for communicating gentleness, energy and enthusiasm. He is skilled at helping others to find their voice.</p> <p>So, I asked him, why did he want me, or anyone else, to tell his story? Wouldn\u2019t it be more powerful coming directly from him? His response was that he needed someone else to hear, a person outside the immediate experience, to acknowledge and record what happened to him and to those whose sufferings he saw and shared. He wanted me to be his witness, not because his narrative required verification, but because of the fact of hearing itself; because it signifies that in a world that so often seeks to deny and disbelieve such accounts, his story has been absorbed by a listening heart.</p> <p>We talked together for hours and, as I noted down what he told me, fearful of making mistakes, I became a partner in testament to the ongoing reality of cruelty and suffering. This is an obligation to which I am deeply committed \u2013 my own parents were both refugees from Nazism at the age of 16.</p> <p>Researching the fate of my family taught me the importance of being a vigilant witness against evil and heartlessness, and of standing up for human solidarity, beyond all seeming borders of nationality and creed.</p> <p>As I listened and recorded, I became a companion in defiance against the silence in which vicious regimes try to bury the knowledge of the crimes they have committed against the dead, and disavow the living trauma of those who manage to survive them.</p> <p>Jean Paul needs me \u2013 us \u2013 to be allies.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>He fled on foot with his family from the brutality of the regime in his country. During their long and exhausting trek, which lasted for 30 days, he saw many people worn out from hunger, weariness and grief. Noticing an abandoned child who no longer had the strength to walk, Jean Paul carried him on his back until he became aware that the child\u2019s body was lifeless.</p> <p>After three months in exile, Jean Paul and his family were told that it was safe to return to their homeland. They took the boat back across the river to their native country, but as the crowded ferry approached the landing beach, all the young men were separated for questioning, to assess whether they might have been part of the militia fighting against government forces. Anyone suspected of belonging to such rebel groups was removed and \u201celiminated\u201d without a trace. The militia in turn opened fire on the passengers, many of whom were killed.</p> <p>\u201cIt was chaos; people took revenge, lots were shot,\u201d Jean Paul recalled.</p> <p>Four hundred people perished in the massacre. Jean Paul, his brother and their two cousins were taken away and detained for several days. He and his brother were subsequently released, but their cousins were not with them. They simply disappeared, together with many hundreds of young people.</p> <p>\u201cHe was with me on the boat. After we landed, I never saw him again.\u201d</p> <p>Jean Paul began to work with the families of the victims, many of whom had likewise vanished; no graves were ever found.</p> <p>Relatives were concerned that those responsible for the killings would never be brought to justice. A collective was formed to gather together evidence of these atrocities; many of the survivors were afraid to come forward and testify, fearing that the regime would take revenge. Nevertheless, with the assistance of human rights organisations in the UK and France, enough material was assembled to force a trial at a criminal court in the summer of 2005. The judge ruled that the state was indeed responsible, but no specific individuals were deemed accountable, and the perpetrators remained unnamed. The result was that no one was brought to justice.</p> <p>During the course of their investigations, Jean Paul and his colleagues uncovered numerous crimes. Realising that they knew too much to be safe in a land in which tyranny and corruption were incomparably more powerful than the law, he and his close family fled to France. There, life was better. Jean Paul studied, obtaining his first degree in modern languages from the University of Strasbourg. Yet, perhaps inevitably, he always felt like an outsider. Later, Jean Paul was invited to read for an MA at Soas University of London, so moved his family to Britain and was eventually given a visa that described him as a \u201chighly skilled migrant\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Jean Paul settled down in London, working for five years at a school in Islington, supporting children from ethnic minorities and assisting in the modern languages department. He also served as a volunteer in several homelessness projects through his church and began to assemble and publish his writings.</p> <p>But it always remained his long-term intention \u201cto go back home and work for my country\u201d. He was even offered a university post there, but it was made patently clear to him he was not wanted in his home country, and that it would not be safe to return. When his father died, neither Jean Paul nor any of his brothers and sisters were able to attend the funeral. In 2015, Jean Paul therefore decided to apply for asylum in the UK.</p> <p>He prepared the necessary documentation with great care, including the latest United Nations information concerning his country, a report commissioned from a Stanford University professor known internationally for his research on the country, a further dossier by an expert in the UK, and an 11-page letter explaining his personal history and the circumstances underlying his application.</p> <p>During his appointment with the Home Office, the official who interviewed him kept interrupting him. It quickly became apparent that she had read none of the documents Jean Paul had submitted. Matters proceeded in this desultory fashion until, eventually, the woman instructed him to wait. After two hours she returned and informed Jean Paul that he was going to be detained forthwith, \u201cfor a few days, while the case is examined\u201d.</p> <p>This attitude epitomises the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\" title=\"\">environment of intentional hostility</a>, the culture of disbelief, that those at the top are held to be encouraging. There is a time and a place for scepticism. But the persistent discrediting of the meticulously assembled and carefully corroborated evidence of another person\u2019s suffering is a form of cruelty. It undermines the humanity of the victims and also of those who practise such policies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4a51e42a9905fa9865c5f9ad6916f28de80f7022\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a51e42a9905fa9865c5f9ad6916f28de80f7022/0_0_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre in west London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre in west London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Ockenden/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jean Paul was taken to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/14/the-lawyer-who-takes-the-cases-no-one-wants\" title=\"\">detention centre</a> at Harmondsworth. \u201cAt first it looks beautiful,\u201d he said, \u201cfrom the outside. There\u2019s no barbed wire. But once inside, you go through a first and then a second set of security doors. You\u2019re locked in; you can\u2019t open them from the inside. It\u2019s really a prison. There\u2019s nothing to do in there.\u201d It was very frightening. \u201cThere are some there, too, who\u2019ve just completed sentences for serious crimes. When they\u2019re released, they\u2019re handed over to immigration \u2013 together with people who are simply seeking asylum.\u201d</p> <p>Jean Paul\u2019s smartphone was taken from him and replaced with a primitive device that allowed no access to the internet. For the first two days he was simply bewildered. Then he began to contact his friends. Staff at the school where he worked soon started to ask where he was and what had happened to him.</p> <p>His church wondered why he was missing: \u201cWhere is Jean Paul?\u201d they wanted to know. They were baffled and confused: \u201cNo one could believe what had happened, that such a thing could occur here, in a country like Britain.\u201d His friends had never even heard that such a place as Harmondsworth existed. They prepared an application for bail.</p> <p>Injured physically and mentally by his own experiences, Jean Paul was nevertheless more concerned with the sufferings of others. What about all the people who had no one on the outside to support them, who knew no one who could set in motion inquiries about why they had been taken away and where they were now being held? Who was there to help them?</p> <p>\u201cI saw a man sobbing,\u201d he told me. \u201cHe told me he\u2019d been in the UK for three years and held in detention for six months: \u2018When I was brought here my girlfriend was pregnant. Meanwhile, she\u2019s given birth. I haven\u2019t ever seen our baby.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAnother man tried to kill himself twice during the two weeks I was being held. He did it out of despair. I heard he\u2019d been inside for over a year. He didn\u2019t know when he was going to be released or how to move his case forward. He\u2019d had no update. He didn\u2019t understand what it was that the authorities were waiting for. The first time, I don\u2019t know exactly what he did. They found him hanging from the bunk bed \u2013 he must have used the sheet or something similar and tied it round his neck. He was taken to hospital. A day later he was back.</p> <p>\u201cThe second time, another guy from the same country was moved into his room. The new guy was on blood pressure medication; when he got a chance, he took all his new companion\u2019s medicine to try to kill himself. The toilets weren\u2019t private; there was only a curtain and you could see people\u2019s feet. Someone saw that he was in there for a long time. They opened the curtains. On the floor were all the pill packs, empty. They called the medical staff; they took him to hospital, for the second time in two weeks. They soon brought him back. He had no one outside to help him. I never heard that anyone had come to visit him.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Jean Paul explained that the Home Office periodically required inmates to sign a standard letter agreeing to their continued detention on the basis that they could not be released because they had insufficient connections and support in London. The Home Office understood this as authorising them to keep the signatories in detention indefinitely.</p> <p>\u201cI saw everyone in front of me sign. But they didn\u2019t understand the contents of the letter. \u2018Have you read it?\u2019 I asked one man. \u2018No, I can\u2019t read English,\u2019 he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhen my own turn came, I tried to read the letter first. \u2018Why can\u2019t you just sign?\u2019 the lady insisted. I went out for 15 minutes and read the document. I came back and told her I wasn\u2019t signing. \u2018You have to,\u2019 she said. \u2018It\u2019s just our routine.\u2019 \u2018No, I don\u2019t,\u2019 I replied. I\u2019d been living in London for 10 years; I refused to sign. I asked the lady what had happened to my file. The administration isn\u2019t fit for purpose.</p> <p>\u201cOne man told me how he\u2019d been in and out of detention for two years. For the last couple of months inside, he\u2019d heard nothing about his case. \u2018I\u2019m going back to my home country,\u2019 he said. He\u2019d had enough; he was giving up. They wear people down until they lose hope and agree to be deported.\u201d</p> <p>Jean Paul was allocated a duty solicitor and a different official was sent from the Home Office to interview him. He again gave his statement. The Home Office official explained that his application had been refused. \u201cThey make a decision, then you have the right to appeal,\u201d Jean Paul explained. He prepared the appeal himself: \u201cIf you can\u2019t write out your case for yourself, your solicitor can\u2019t do anything, as he or she has at least 50 other people to deal with.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Jean Paul became ill; the removal centre was so dusty and dirty that he began to cough. \u201cThey pay people \u00a31 an hour to clean,\u201d he said \u2013 less than a tenth of the London living wage. One day, he coughed up blood. This really frightened him, so he reported to the doctor who came to Harmondsworth twice a week. He was taken to the infirmary, where he was kept in isolation, suspected of having tuberculosis. He had to wear a mask and was not allowed out. After three days, he had still been given no medicine, not even paracetamol; he was simply left to sit all day in the sick bay, waiting. But conditions were better in there; he had a room with a toilet and a small TV. Eventually, he was asked to do a spittle test, which came back inconclusive. A second, and finally a third test, proved negative.</p> <p>Still, Jean Paul had to attend his appeal hearing in a mask. When the judge asked him why he was wearing such an item, he explained that he was suspected of having TB.</p> <p>The judge, who was perceptive and well intentioned, observed that this was a \u201cvery complicated case which couldn\u2019t be decided in a day\u201d. Jean Paul recalled: \u201cShe looked at me and said: \u2018I don\u2019t see any reason why this person is here. This complex case has been mismanaged. Go home and I\u2019ll write to you.\u2019\u201d She promised to contact him within three months and ordered his immediate release. She added that a copy of his book would be required for his future hearing, as well as an expert report on his native country.</p> <p>It took Jean Paul two further days to secure his release. In the meantime, he was brought back to the medical centre. \u201cAll that time nothing happened,\u201d he said. He called his solicitor, who merely said: \u201cOh, are you still there?\u201d The medical staff had no idea what was supposed to happen next. Security staff claimed that they had received no notification about him being released. He had no choice but to stay a further night in detention while he tried to trace for himself who it was who was supposed to be responsible for organising his release.</p> <p>\u201cI was in detention for just two weeks and it had an impact on my mental health,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat about those who were in there for six months?\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office informed Jean Paul that he was henceforth not allowed to work. Unable to earn any money for himself, Jean Paul was dependent on his friends, who proved unstinting in their support. They made good on their offer to provide him accommodation for free. They looked after him with care and devotion, and raised the money to appoint him a good solicitor.</p> <p>But the anticipated letter never arrived. \u201cThey\u2019d discovered their mistake,\u201d Jean Paul commented. Eventually the solicitor called the Home Office, only to be informed that they had no record of him ever being in detention. \u201cThey erased everything, to obliterate their error,\u201d Jean Paul said. \u201cThat upset me more than anything else. I was the victim of a bureaucratic system where no one cares; where the decision is made beforehand and no one can be bothered.\u201d</p> <p>After three months, Jean Paul was given a date to attend an appeal tribunal. Once again, he carefully prepared the latest and most updated reports about his home country. He included letters of reference from his former employers at the school, from the priest of the church where he volunteered, as well as from a friend working at the Foreign Office. He included a copy of his book and his other writings, as the judge at Harmondsworth had advised.</p> <p>On the day itself, he came accompanied by his British girlfriend, his friend from the Foreign Office and his priest, who brought his wife and his guide dog with him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f5c58cfee8bf1640495390ab31f7fc3eb72ed806\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5c58cfee8bf1640495390ab31f7fc3eb72ed806/0_0_3589_2153/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a UK immigration enforcement van\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When they\u2019re released, they\u2019re handed over to immigration \u2013 together with people who\u2019re simply seeking asylum.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heloise/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It proved to be a theatre of the absurd. The court appointed an interpreter, even though Jean Paul spoke and wrote excellent English and held two degrees in modern languages. The Home Office solicitor had neither read, nor even possessed copies of, any of the new documents. The judge deferred the proceedings for 30 minutes and provided her with the materials. She then proceeded to ask ridiculous questions, based on an outdated 2007 report, when Jean Paul had provided the most recent 2015 findings. \u201cThe Home Office hadn\u2019t even updated its information online,\u201d Jean Paul said.</p> <p>She asked Jean Paul questions about his native country\u2019s rating, which should have been well-known to the Home Office; it ranked among the highest ever assigned for persecution, lawlessness and violence. She declared in conclusion: \u201cSince a previous trial had been held, justice surely had no doubt been done.\u201d Jean Paul was left in tears.</p> <p>The judge brought the proceedings to a close with the pronouncement that she was not going to make her decision on the spot. She would make it known within the following two weeks.</p> <p>In her letter, which followed soon afterwards, she gave Jean Paul leave to remain in the UK until 2020, noting that this had been granted on the basis of \u201cthe evidence provided\u201d, with the added observations that \u201cone had only to type the referent\u2019s name into Google to see that he would be arrested at once if he returned to his native country\u201d, and that, \u201cif he ever went back, even for a visit, he\u2019d certainly have to change it.\u201d</p> <p>The tribunal determined that the case would be kept anonymous, purportedly on account of its sensitivity. \u201cBut was this the genuine reason?\u201d wondered Jean Paul. \u201cOr was it not rather that the Home Office was trying to cover up its confusion and erase the traces of the mess it had made?\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>I asked Jean Paul if he thought the system<strong> </strong>was cruel, callous, careless or just plain chaotic. \u201cThe problem with the Home Office,\u201d he said, \u201cis that you never see the same person twice. The next man or woman doesn\u2019t know your case; there\u2019s no real follow-up. The system is overloaded.\u201d The staff themselves, he acknowledged, were as varied as anywhere else: some were unfeeling, some couldn\u2019t care, some were genuinely kind.</p> <p>Had he pursued the reasons why his papers went missing? No, he had not. He had started a new job in Whitechapel; he had become engaged and hoped to be married the following summer. \u201cMy life has moved on since then,\u201d he said. Looking back was evidently too painful, and, at this juncture, pointless. It had taken six months to return to normal life. But his experiences had left him with nightmares. \u201cAnd I had friends on the outside to help me,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of the people in there had nobody, not a soul to speak on their behalf.\u201d</p> <p>In the UK, people don\u2019t disappear in massacres or acts of terror committed by the government or by militias that everyone knows are implicated but no one has the power and authority to indict. That is why Britain and similar democracies are not places from which persecuted people generally long to escape. Their longstanding humanitarian tradition, their reputation for tolerance, and the widespread rule of law make them islands of refuge from state-sponsored murder and mass violence. People don\u2019t vanish into hidden mass graves.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/05/five-myths-about-the-refugee-crisis\">Five myths about the refugee crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there are other ways of disappearing: when you\u2019ve got no voice; when, even if you have, those around you don\u2019t, or won\u2019t, find the time to listen; when they lack the will to hear you in their conscience, or the compassion to care about you in their hearts.</p> <p>You don\u2019t go missing \u2013 only your files do, and your presence in the thoughts of those who ought to care, and the record of the experiences that hurt you, and that drove others to despair.</p> <p><em>This piece appears in Refugee Tales Vol III, edited by David Herd and Anna Pincus, which is published on 4 July by Comma Press and <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/refugee-tales-volume-iii-9781912697113.html\" title=\"\">available at guardianbookshop.com</a>.

      "bodyText": "I looked online and immediately found the title of Jean Paul\u2019s book (Jean Paul is not his real name). It was exactly as the judge who eventually granted him asylum had noted: anyone who wanted to check Jean Paul\u2019s political record in his native country had only to Google his name. The book is a study of democracy and its failings in Africa. Jean Paul has also published scholarly papers on the nature of language. I met Jean Paul for the first time at the British Library, an institution devoted to the preservation of words, voices, testimony and knowledge. He told me about his experiences of flight and refuge, focusing on what he saw and heard while held in indefinite detention here in the UK. \u201cYou\u2019ve no voice when you\u2019re inside there,\u201d he said. But Jean Paul does have a voice. He has a degree in modern languages from the University of Strasbourg and a masters from Soas University of London, and has taught for many years in London schools, with a special focus on inspiring children from ethnic minorities. It takes only a few moments in his company to understand that he has a gift for communicating gentleness, energy and enthusiasm. He is skilled at helping others to find their voice. So, I asked him, why did he want me, or anyone else, to tell his story? Wouldn\u2019t it be more powerful coming directly from him? His response was that he needed someone else to hear, a person outside the immediate experience, to acknowledge and record what happened to him and to those whose sufferings he saw and shared. He wanted me to be his witness, not because his narrative required verification, but because of the fact of hearing itself; because it signifies that in a world that so often seeks to deny and disbelieve such accounts, his story has been absorbed by a listening heart. We talked together for hours and, as I noted down what he told me, fearful of making mistakes, I became a partner in testament to the ongoing reality of cruelty and suffering. This is an obligation to which I am deeply committed \u2013 my own parents were both refugees from Nazism at the age of 16. Researching the fate of my family taught me the importance of being a vigilant witness against evil and heartlessness, and of standing up for human solidarity, beyond all seeming borders of nationality and creed. As I listened and recorded, I became a companion in defiance against the silence in which vicious regimes try to bury the knowledge of the crimes they have committed against the dead, and disavow the living trauma of those who manage to survive them. Jean Paul needs me \u2013 us \u2013 to be allies. * * * He fled on foot with his family from the brutality of the regime in his country. During their long and exhausting trek, which lasted for 30 days, he saw many people worn out from hunger, weariness and grief. Noticing an abandoned child who no longer had the strength to walk, Jean Paul carried him on his back until he became aware that the child\u2019s body was lifeless. After three months in exile, Jean Paul and his family were told that it was safe to return to their homeland. They took the boat back across the river to their native country, but as the crowded ferry approached the landing beach, all the young men were separated for questioning, to assess whether they might have been part of the militia fighting against government forces. Anyone suspected of belonging to such rebel groups was removed and \u201celiminated\u201d without a trace. The militia in turn opened fire on the passengers, many of whom were killed. \u201cIt was chaos; people took revenge, lots were shot,\u201d Jean Paul recalled. Four hundred people perished in the massacre. Jean Paul, his brother and their two cousins were taken away and detained for several days. He and his brother were subsequently released, but their cousins were not with them. They simply disappeared, together with many hundreds of young people. \u201cHe was with me on the boat. After we landed, I never saw him again.\u201d Jean Paul began to work with the families of the victims, many of whom had likewise vanished; no graves were ever found. Relatives were concerned that those responsible for the killings would never be brought to justice. A collective was formed to gather together evidence of these atrocities; many of the survivors were afraid to come forward and testify, fearing that the regime would take revenge. Nevertheless, with the assistance of human rights organisations in the UK and France, enough material was assembled to force a trial at a criminal court in the summer of 2005.

Jean Paul studied, obtaining his first degree in modern languages from the University of Strasbourg. Yet, perhaps inevitably, he always felt like an outsider. Later, Jean Paul was invited to read for an MA at Soas University of London, so moved his family to Britain and was eventually given a visa that described him as a \u201chighly skilled migrant\u201d. * * * Jean Paul settled down in London, working for five years at a school in Islington, supporting children from ethnic minorities and assisting in the modern languages department. He also served as a volunteer in several homelessness projects through his church and began to assemble and publish his writings. But it always remained his long-term intention \u201cto go back home and work for my country\u201d. He was even offered a university post there, but it was made patently clear to him he was not wanted in his home country, and that it would not be safe to return. When his father died, neither Jean Paul nor any of his brothers and sisters were able to attend the funeral. In 2015, Jean Paul therefore decided to apply for asylum in the UK. He prepared the necessary documentation with great care, including the latest United Nations information concerning his country, a report commissioned from a Stanford University professor known internationally for his research on the country, a further dossier by an expert in the UK, and an 11-page letter explaining his personal history and the circumstances underlying his application. During his appointment with the Home Office, the official who interviewed him kept interrupting him. It quickly became apparent that she had read none of the documents Jean Paul had submitted. Matters proceeded in this desultory fashion until, eventually, the woman instructed him to wait. After two hours she returned and informed Jean Paul that he was going to be detained forthwith, \u201cfor a few days, while the case is examined\u201d. This attitude epitomises the environment of intentional hostility, the culture of disbelief, that those at the top are held to be encouraging. There is a time and a place for scepticism. But the persistent discrediting of the meticulously assembled and carefully corroborated evidence of another person\u2019s suffering is a form of cruelty. It undermines the humanity of the victims and also of those who practise such policies. Jean Paul was taken to the detention centre at Harmondsworth. \u201cAt first it looks beautiful,\u201d he said, \u201cfrom the outside. There\u2019s no barbed wire. But once inside, you go through a first and then a second set of security doors. You\u2019re locked in; you can\u2019t open them from the inside. It\u2019s really a prison. There\u2019s nothing to do in there.\u201d It was very frightening. \u201cThere are some there, too, who\u2019ve just completed sentences for serious crimes. When they\u2019re released, they\u2019re handed over to immigration \u2013 together with people who are simply seeking asylum.\u201d Jean Paul\u2019s smartphone was taken from him and replaced with a primitive device that allowed no access to the internet. For the first two days he was simply bewildered. Then he began to contact his friends. Staff at the school where he worked soon started to ask where he was and what had happened to him. His church wondered why he was missing: \u201cWhere is Jean Paul?\u201d they wanted to know. They were baffled and confused: \u201cNo one could believe what had happened, that such a thing could occur here, in a country like Britain.\u201d His friends had never even heard that such a place as Harmondsworth existed. They prepared an application for bail. Injured physically and mentally by his own experiences, Jean Paul was nevertheless more concerned with the sufferings of others. What about all the people who had no one on the outside to support them, who knew no one who could set in motion inquiries about why they had been taken away and where they were now being held? Who was there to help them? \u201cI saw a man sobbing,\u201d he told me. \u201cHe told me he\u2019d been in the UK for three years and held in detention for six months: \u2018When I was brought here my girlfriend was pregnant. Meanwhile, she\u2019s given birth. I haven\u2019t ever seen our baby.\u2019 \u201cAnother man tried to kill himself twice during the two weeks I was being held. He did it out of despair. I heard he\u2019d been inside for over a year. He didn\u2019t know when he was going to be released or how to move his case forward. He\u2019d had no update. He didn\u2019t understand what it was that the authorities were waiting for. The first time, I don\u2019t know exactly what he did. They found him hanging from the bunk bed \u2013 he must have used the sheet or something similar and tied it round his neck. He was taken to hospital. A day later he was back. \u201cThe second time, another guy from the same country was moved into his room. The new guy was on blood pressure medication; when he got a chance, he took all his new companion\u2019s medicine to try to kill himself. The toilets weren\u2019t private; there was only a curtain and you could see people\u2019s feet. Someone saw that he was in there for a long time. They opened the curtains. On the floor were all the pill packs, empty. They called the medical staff; they took him to hospital, for the second time in two weeks. They soon brought him back. He had no one outside to help him. I never heard that anyone had come to visit him.\u201d * * * Jean Paul explained that the Home Office periodically required inmates to sign a standard letter agreeing to their continued detention on the basis that they could not be released because they had insufficient connections and support in London. The Home Office understood this as authorising them to keep the signatories in detention indefinitely. \u201cI saw everyone in front of me sign. But they didn\u2019t understand the contents of the letter. \u2018Have you read it?\u2019 I asked one man. \u2018No, I can\u2019t read English,\u2019 he said. \u201cWhen my own turn came, I tried to read the letter first. \u2018Why can\u2019t you just sign?\u2019 the lady insisted. I went out for 15 minutes and read the document. I came back and told her I wasn\u2019t signing. \u2018You have to,\u2019 she said. \u2018It\u2019s just our routine.\u2019 \u2018No, I don\u2019t,\u2019 I replied. I\u2019d been living in London for 10 years; I refused to sign. I asked the lady what had happened to my file. The administration isn\u2019t fit for purpose. \u201cOne man told me how he\u2019d been in and out of detention for two years. For the last couple of months inside, he\u2019d heard nothing about his case. \u2018I\u2019m going back to my home country,\u2019 he said. He\u2019d had enough; he was giving up. They wear people down until they lose hope and agree to be deported.\u201d Jean Paul was allocated a duty solicitor and a different official was sent from the Home Office to interview him. He again gave his statement. The Home Office official explained that his application had been refused. \u201cThey make a decision, then you have the right to appeal,\u201d Jean Paul explained. He prepared the appeal himself: \u201cIf you can\u2019t write out your case for yourself, your solicitor can\u2019t do anything, as he or she has at least 50 other people to deal with.\u201d Meanwhile, Jean Paul became ill; the removal centre was so dusty and dirty that he began to cough. \u201cThey pay people \u00a31 an hour to clean,\u201d he said \u2013 less than a tenth of the London living wage. One day, he coughed up blood. This really frightened him, so he reported to the doctor who came to Harmondsworth twice a week. He was taken to the infirmary, where he was kept in isolation, suspected of having tuberculosis. He had to wear a mask and was not allowed out. After three days, he had still been given no medicine, not even paracetamol; he was simply left to sit all day in the sick bay, waiting. But conditions were better in there; he had a room with a toilet and a small TV. Eventually, he was asked to do a spittle test, which came back inconclusive. A second, and finally a third test, proved negative. Still, Jean Paul had to attend his appeal hearing in a mask. When the judge asked him why he was wearing such an item, he explained that he was suspected of having TB. The judge, who was perceptive and well intentioned, observed that this was a \u201cvery complicated case which couldn\u2019t be decided in a day\u201d. Jean Paul recalled: \u201cShe looked at me and said: \u2018I don\u2019t see any reason why this person is here. This complex case has been mismanaged. Go home and I\u2019ll write to you.\u2019\u201d She promised to contact him within three months and ordered his immediate release. She added that a copy of his book would be required for his future hearing, as well as an expert report on his native country. It took Jean Paul two further days to secure his release. In the meantime, he was brought back to the medical centre. \u201cAll that time nothing happened,\u201d he said. He called his solicitor, who merely said: \u201cOh, are you still there?\u201d The medical staff had no idea what was supposed to happen next. Security staff claimed that they had received no notification about him being released. He had no choice but to stay a further night in detention while he tried to trace for himself who it was who was supposed to be responsible for organising his release. \u201cI was in detention for just two weeks and it had an impact on my mental health,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat about those who were in there for six months?\u201d The Home Office informed Jean Paul that he was henceforth not allowed to work. Unable to earn any money for himself, Jean Paul was dependent on his friends, who proved unstinting in their support. They made good on their offer to provide him accommodation for free. They looked after him with care and devotion, and raised the money to appoint him a good solicitor. But the anticipated letter never arrived. \u201cThey\u2019d discovered their mistake,\u201d Jean Paul commented. Eventually the solicitor called the Home Office, only to be informed that they had no record of him ever being in detention. \u201cThey erased everything, to obliterate their error,\u201d Jean Paul said. \u201cThat upset me more than anything else. I was the victim of a bureaucratic system where no one cares; where the decision is made beforehand and no one can be bothered.\u201d After three months, Jean Paul was given a date to attend an appeal tribunal. Once again, he carefully prepared the latest and most updated reports about his home country. He included letters of reference from his former employers at the school, from the priest of the church where he volunteered, as well as from a friend working at the Foreign Office. He included a copy of his book and his other writings, as the judge at Harmondsworth had advised. On the day itself, he came accompanied by his British girlfriend, his friend from the Foreign Office and his priest, who brought his wife and his guide dog with him. It proved to be a theatre of the absurd. The court appointed an interpreter, even though Jean Paul spoke and wrote excellent English and held two degrees in modern languages. The Home Office solicitor had neither read, nor even possessed copies of, any of the new documents. The judge deferred the proceedings for 30 minutes and provided her with the materials. She then proceeded to ask ridiculous questions, based on an outdated 2007 report, when Jean Paul had provided the most recent 2015 findings. \u201cThe Home Office hadn\u2019t even updated its information online,\u201d Jean Paul said. She asked Jean Paul questions about his native country\u2019s rating, which should have been well-known to the Home Office; it ranked among the highest ever assigned for persecution, lawlessness and violence. She declared in conclusion: \u201cSince a previous trial had been held, justice surely had no doubt been done.\u201d Jean Paul was left in tears. The judge brought the proceedings to a close with the pronouncement that she was not going to make her decision on the spot. She would make it known within the following two weeks. In her letter, which followed soon afterwards, she gave Jean Paul leave to remain in the UK until 2020, noting that this had been granted on the basis of \u201cthe evidence provided\u201d, with the added observations that \u201cone had only to type the referent\u2019s name into Google to see that he would be arrested at once if he returned to his native country\u201d, and that, \u201cif he ever went back, even for a visit, he\u2019d certainly have to change it.\u201d The tribunal determined that the case would be kept anonymous, purportedly on account of its sensitivity. \u201cBut was this the genuine reason?\u201d wondered Jean Paul. \u201cOr was it not rather that the Home Office was trying to cover up its confusion and erase the traces of the mess it had made?\u201d * * * I asked Jean Paul if he thought the system was cruel, callous, careless or just plain chaotic. \u201cThe problem with the Home Office,\u201d he said, \u201cis that you never see the same person twice. The next man or woman doesn\u2019t know your case; there\u2019s no real follow-up. The system is overloaded.\u201d The staff themselves, he acknowledged, were as varied as anywhere else: some were unfeeling, some couldn\u2019t care, some were genuinely kind. Had he pursued the reasons why his papers went missing? No, he had not. He had started a new job in Whitechapel; he had become engaged and hoped to be married the following summer. \u201cMy life has moved on since then,\u201d he said. Looking back was evidently too painful, and, at this juncture, pointless. It had taken six months to return to normal life. But his experiences had left him with nightmares. \u201cAnd I had friends on the outside to help me,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of the people in there had nobody, not a soul to speak on their behalf.\u201d In the UK, people don\u2019t disappear in massacres or acts of terror committed by the government or by militias that everyone knows are implicated but no one has the power and authority to indict. That is why Britain and similar democracies are not places from which persecuted people generally long to escape. Their longstanding humanitarian tradition, their reputation for tolerance, and the widespread rule of law make them islands of refuge from state-sponsored murder and mass violence. People don\u2019t vanish into hidden mass graves. But there are other ways of disappearing: when you\u2019ve got no voice; when, even if you have, those around you don\u2019t, or won\u2019t, find the time to listen; when they lack the will to hear you in their conscience, or the compassion to care about you in their hearts. You don\u2019t go missing \u2013 only your files do, and your presence in the thoughts of those who ought to care, and the record of the experiences that hurt you, and that drove others to despair.

      "bodyText": "The parents of a gambling addict who took his own life have launched a legal bid to hold the government liable for his death, potentially opening the floodgates to multiple compensation claims citing lax regulation by the state. Charles and Liz Ritchie, who founded the Gambling With Lives charity after their son Jack killed himself aged 24, want the inquest into his death to consider article 2 of the European convention on human rights \u2013 the right to life. Article 2 inquests are held in cases where the state has failed to protect the deceased person from risk. Charles and Liz Ritchie told the Guardian: \u201cThe government has been well aware that gambling exposes people to the risk of addiction and consequent suicide, but has failed to take effective action to regulate the industrialised electronic gambling that can cause such severe addiction. \u201cOver many years they failed to regulate gambling, educate the public about the health risks or make adequate treatment resources available to people who suffer harm. \u201cThey have allowed the industry far too much influence and control to keep the health risks hidden and failed to demand sufficient funding to pay for treatment.\u201d The Sheffield coroner, Christopher Dorries, will hear arguments from lawyers acting for the Ritchies on Friday, before issuing a verdict that could have significant implications. Although the Ritchies are not seeking financial compensation if they are successful, a landmark ruling in their favour could trigger financial claims from relatives of other people who took their own lives after suffering a gambling addiction. The industry regulator the Gambling Commission and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, which oversees gambling policy, are opposing the attempt. The legal team arguing the Ritchies\u2019 case are understood to be confident that if article 2 is engaged during the inquest, the coroner will find that the government failed to treat gambling as a risky activity akin to smoking and drinking alcohol. The Ritchies are understood to be hopeful this would force the government to tighten gambling regulation to avoid future claims. Changes could include prominent health warnings attached to gambling products such as fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), one of the products that Jack Ritchie was addicted to. The maximum stake on FOBTs was slashed to \u00a32 from \u00a3100 earlier this year, following a long-running campaign, after the government acknowledged they were a \u201csocial blight\u201d. A Gambling Commission spokesman said: \u201cJack Ritchie\u2019s death was a tragedy and our thoughts continue to be with his family and friends. \u201cAny suicide connected with gambling harm is one too many and we are absolutely committed to working with the industry and our partners to protect consumers.

The song\u2019s queer overtones \u2013 with unmissable lyrics like \u201cI like women and men\u201d and a video that hints at a kiss between Grande and another woman \u2013 cemented Grande\u2019s place at the center of this new wave of bisexual chic.</p> <p>But they simultaneously illuminate questions of bisexual erasure and what it really means to claim, or deflect, bisexual identity. Both songs fueled speculation about Grande\u2019s potential bisexual leanings, leading some fans to wonder if either served as a covert coming-out.</p> <p>Grande neither confirmed nor denied the rumors and spoke out against labeling her sexuality. \u201cI haven\u2019t before and still don\u2019t need to now, which is OK,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/1112866753518825473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1112866753518825473&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffpost.com%2Fentry%2Fariana-grande-sexuality-no-label-bisexual_n_5ca35f33e4b0a453fb763184\">she tweeted</a>.</p> <p>Grande is right. Neither she nor any vaguely bisexual celebrity should have to define their sexuality to appease fans and defuse rumors. Sexual identity and orientation is deeply personal. And queer or not, Grande doesn\u2019t owe anyone an explanation of where she lands on the <a href=\"https://kinseyinstitute.org/research/publications/kinsey-scale.php\">Kinsey scale</a>. Even if she is queer-identifying, or even just experimenting, she doesn\u2019t have to define or defend her sex life, because bisexuals don\u2019t have to \u201cpick a side\u201d or disclose the extent of their attraction to any given gender in order to be valid.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH4Y1ZUUx2g\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LH4Y1ZUUx2g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Though I currently identify as bisexual, the way I express and understand this identity is constantly evolving, something many of my previous romantic partners and even queer friends fail to grasp. My bisexuality isn\u2019t predicated on who I choose to date, and I reject the notion that my attraction to any gender should be quantified as \u201c50-50\u201d, or exists on one side of a queer/straight binary.</p> <p>The dissection of Grande\u2019s queer visuals further fetishizes bisexual women, and also erases the existence of bisexual men, who typically aren\u2019t allowed the same public space to experiment with their sexuality. The media coverage following <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/07/entertainment/aaron-carter-bisexual/index.html\">\u201ctroubled singer\u201d</a> Aaron Carter coming out as bisexual carried a starkly different tone than the rumors that followed Grande. Reports of Carter\u2019s subsequent struggles with eating disorders, drugs, and a stint in rehab painted a picture of a confused young man, playing into the stereotype that bisexuality indicates a fragile mental state. Carter later said his heartfelt coming out tweets were <a href=\"https://people.com/music/aaron-carter-bisexuality-confession-misconstrued/\">\u201cmisconstrued\u201d</a>, and they may have been. It\u2019s also possible that the stigma that followed his announcement <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/people/2018/3/27/did-stigma-force-aaron-carter-back-closet\">pushed him back in the closet</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to tell if the more recent adoption of bisexual aesthetics and iconography centering on sexual fluidity and woman-loving women isn\u2019t part of a pattern of <a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/was-that-queerbaiting\">queerbaiting</a>, a marketing tactic that aims to attract queer fans by hinting at queer romance or identity without ever depicting it explicitly. When queerness is co-opted and performed as an aesthetic, it perpetuates the idea that bisexuality is a temporary phase or performance. Performative bisexuality isn\u2019t representation, and it isn\u2019t queer.</p> <p>Although this particular moment in bisexual pop culture history offers a prime opportunity for a queer-forward rebrand, LeJeune said the decision for Skirt Club to march in World Pride comes from her own desire for community and solidarity with other bisexual women. Whether or not they explicitly identify as bisexual or just think the idea of kissing other women sounds fun (because it is!) isn\u2019t the point. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we march and feel free and say, \u2018Yes, we enjoy sex with men and women\u2019? I think there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. It\u2019s a proud moment,\u201d LeJeune said.</p> <p>For bisexual fans and audiences craving idols and icons to claim as our own, and that make us feel seen, the rise of bisexual imagery and aesthetics in pop culture can feel like a long-awaited acknowledgement of our unique and varied experiences. Bisexual erasure pervades media and pop culture \u2013 as well as both queer and non-queer communities \u2013 and seeing any shred of representation, let alone a \u201cbisexual anthem\u201d from a big-name celebrity, can feel deeply validating to a population whose identities are commonly delegitimized, questioned, and stigmatized.</p> <p>It\u2019s time that bisexuality, and bisexuals, had a \u201cmoment\u201d to be seen and celebrated on a culture-wide scale by high-profile figures who aren\u2019t afraid to let us claim them as our own. Bisexuality itself is endlessly complex, but possibly even more significantly, being bisexual is <em>fun</em>. In #TwentyBiTeen, it may be chic to be bi, or be bi for the aesthetic. Bisexuality has always been hot, because bisexuals are hot, and we deserve to be seen.</p>",

We are \u2013 and it\u2019s about time. 2019 has been called the year of the bisexual, or as queer Twitter coined it, #TwentyBiTeen \u2013 a fitting descriptor for an extraordinarily bisexual time in pop culture. We are living in an era of bisexual chic \u2013 a mainstream embrace of girls who kiss girls under bisexual lighting and wear pastel suits. From a virtual kiss between Bella Hadid and computer-generated influencer Lil Miquela in a Calvin Klein ad, to St Vincent and Dua Lipa\u2019s undeniably sapphic duet at the 2019 Grammys, followed by Ariana Grande\u2019s overtly bisexual hits and accompanying music videos (for Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I\u2019m Bored and Monopoly), the visibility of girl-on-girl culture is peaking. The term \u201cbisexual chic\u201d came to the forefront in the 1990s and early 2000s, with movies such as Basic Instinct and Cruel Intentions that made bisexuality look like an edgy, dangerous, cool-girl identity that signified uninhibited sexuality and sexual availability. As comedian Margaret Cho, who is bisexual, told Out back in 2014: \u201cEver since Basic Instinct, for women it\u2019s become dipped in chic.\u201d The likes of Angelina Jolie, Drew Barrymore and Megan Fox made bisexuality look sexy and cool, because they were sexy and cool, and this misguided perception later inspired trends of bisexual performance for shock value, like the kiss between Britney Spears and Madonna at the 2003 VMAs and Katy Perry\u2019s hit single I Kissed A Girl. Bisexual chic took on a faddish, attention-seeking connotation that still influences public perceptions of bisexual identity, bisexual media representation, and fuels performative bisexuality. When Grande released Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I\u2019m Bored earlier this year, fans called it a \u201cbisexual anthem\u201d, and called her more recent single Monopoly a \u201cbisexual bop\u201d. The song\u2019s queer overtones \u2013 with unmissable lyrics like \u201cI like women and men\u201d and a video that hints at a kiss between Grande and another woman \u2013 cemented Grande\u2019s place at the center of this new wave of bisexual chic. But they simultaneously illuminate questions of bisexual erasure and what it really means to claim, or deflect, bisexual identity. Both songs fueled speculation about Grande\u2019s potential bisexual leanings, leading some fans to wonder if either served as a covert coming-out. Grande neither confirmed nor denied the rumors and spoke out against labeling her sexuality. \u201cI haven\u2019t before and still don\u2019t need to now, which is OK,\u201d she tweeted. Grande is right. Neither she nor any vaguely bisexual celebrity should have to define their sexuality to appease fans and defuse rumors. Sexual identity and orientation is deeply personal. And queer or not, Grande doesn\u2019t owe anyone an explanation of where she lands on the Kinsey scale. Even if she is queer-identifying, or even just experimenting, she doesn\u2019t have to define or defend her sex life, because bisexuals don\u2019t have to \u201cpick a side\u201d or disclose the extent of their attraction to any given gender in order to be valid. Though I currently identify as bisexual, the way I express and understand this identity is constantly evolving, something many of my previous romantic partners and even queer friends fail to grasp. My bisexuality isn\u2019t predicated on who I choose to date, and I reject the notion that my attraction to any gender should be quantified as \u201c50-50\u201d, or exists on one side of a queer/straight binary. The dissection of Grande\u2019s queer visuals further fetishizes bisexual women, and also erases the existence of bisexual men, who typically aren\u2019t allowed the same public space to experiment with their sexuality. The media coverage following \u201ctroubled singer\u201d Aaron Carter coming out as bisexual carried a starkly different tone than the rumors that followed Grande. Reports of Carter\u2019s subsequent struggles with eating disorders, drugs, and a stint in rehab painted a picture of a confused young man, playing into the stereotype that bisexuality indicates a fragile mental state. Carter later said his heartfelt coming out tweets were \u201cmisconstrued\u201d, and they may have been. It\u2019s also possible that the stigma that followed his announcement pushed him back in the closet. It\u2019s difficult to tell if the more recent adoption of bisexual aesthetics and iconography centering on sexual fluidity and woman-loving women isn\u2019t part of a pattern of queerbaiting, a marketing tactic that aims to attract queer fans by hinting at queer romance or identity without ever depicting it explicitly. When queerness is co-opted and performed as an aesthetic, it perpetuates the idea that bisexuality is a temporary phase or performance. Performative bisexuality isn\u2019t representation, and it isn\u2019t queer. Although this particular moment in bisexual pop culture history offers a prime opportunity for a queer-forward rebrand, LeJeune said the decision for Skirt Club to march in World Pride comes from her own desire for community and solidarity with other bisexual women. Whether or not they explicitly identify as bisexual or just think the idea of kissing other women sounds fun (because it is!) isn\u2019t the point. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we march and feel free and say, \u2018Yes, we enjoy sex with men and women\u2019? I think there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. It\u2019s a proud moment,\u201d LeJeune said. For bisexual fans and audiences craving idols and icons to claim as our own, and that make us feel seen, the rise of bisexual imagery and aesthetics in pop culture can feel like a long-awaited acknowledgement of our unique and varied experiences. Bisexual erasure pervades media and pop culture \u2013 as well as both queer and non-queer communities \u2013 and seeing any shred of representation, let alone a \u201cbisexual anthem\u201d from a big-name celebrity, can feel deeply validating to a population whose identities are commonly delegitimized, questioned, and stigmatized. It\u2019s time that bisexuality, and bisexuals, had a \u201cmoment\u201d to be seen and celebrated on a culture-wide scale by high-profile figures who aren\u2019t afraid to let us claim them as our own. Bisexuality itself is endlessly complex, but possibly even more significantly, being bisexual is fun. In #TwentyBiTeen, it may be chic to be bi, or be bi for the aesthetic. Bisexuality has always been hot, because bisexuals are hot, and we deserve to be seen.",

Nineteenth-century imperialists and traders exploited and bullied, redrawing its borders with the Raj. British armies invaded and occupied and, in the 1920s, helped to elevate Reza Shah to the peacock throne. The ensuing era of autocratic rule sowed the seeds of the anti-western 1979 Islamic revolution. At Persepolis, graffiti left by Victorian army officers still defaces its pillars.</p> <p>The US has since supplanted Britain as tormentor-in-chief, but <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/opinion/sunday/irans-first-great-satan-was-england.html\" title=\"\">Iranians have long memories</a>.

You do not know how they sully everything they touch.\u201d</p> <p>Given this bitter legacy, and its other regional blunderings, it might be assumed Britain would fight shy of further intervention. Not a bit of it. This week the US slapped unprecedented sanctions on Iran\u2019s senior leaders, suggesting diplomacy is at an end. Yet as Washington\u2019s war drums beat ever louder, a familiar sucking noise can be heard above the din.

      "bodyText": "The imperial city of Persepolis, ruined capital of Persia\u2019s kings, rises from the desert north-east of Shiraz like a rebuke to invaders, ancient and modern. Its marble columns, many still standing, were erected about 500BC when inhabitants of the British Isles were capering around in animal skins and it was Greeks who posed the biggest military threat. Donald Trump\u2019s America was a bad idea whose time had not yet come. Britain\u2019s recent history with Iran is, for the most part, shaming. Nineteenth-century imperialists and traders exploited and bullied, redrawing its borders with the Raj. British armies invaded and occupied and, in the 1920s, helped to elevate Reza Shah to the peacock throne. The ensuing era of autocratic rule sowed the seeds of the anti-western 1979 Islamic revolution. At Persepolis, graffiti left by Victorian army officers still defaces its pillars. The US has since supplanted Britain as tormentor-in-chief, but Iranians have long memories. Many would agree with Mohammad Mosaddegh who, before the 1953 Anglo-American coup that ousted him as prime minister, told the US envoy Averell Harriman: \u201cYou do not know how crafty they [the British] are. You do not know how evil they are. You do not know how they sully everything they touch.\u201d Given this bitter legacy, and its other regional blunderings, it might be assumed Britain would fight shy of further intervention. Not a bit of it. This week the US slapped unprecedented sanctions on Iran\u2019s senior leaders, suggesting diplomacy is at an end. Yet as Washington\u2019s war drums beat ever louder, a familiar sucking noise can be heard above the din. It is the sound of Britain being inexorably drawn \u2013 again \u2013 into an avoidable, calamitous Middle East war. What is truly astonishing is not that Trump and headbanger hawks such as John Bolton and Mike Pompeo are gunning for Tehran \u2013 they have been spoiling for a fight ever since they wrecked the 2015 international nuclear agreement. Nor should we be shocked at the daily escalations, provocations, insults and punishments inflicted on Iran. That\u2019s par for the course when Washington turns bellicose. What should really chill the blood of British citizens is the way their own government \u2013 and the two men who want to be the next prime minister \u2013 are creating a situation, largely undiscussed and undebated, in which Britain will have no choice but to support a Trump attack on Iran, and worse, will have little hope of avoiding direct military involvement. This senseless, heedless drift into another ill-conceived, unjustifiable and illegal conflict must surely stir alarming memories in the most complacent Tory heart. Do none of these people recall a similar made-in-America catastrophe in Iraq in 2003? Don\u2019t the Chilcot report\u2019s damning findings \u2013 that Tony Blair failed to explore all peaceful options and deliberately exaggerated the threat \u2013 ring urgent bells now? The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, supposedly the sensible Tory choice, is clinging uncomfortably to the White House bandwagon. Hunt knows full well American and Israeli claims that Iran is building a nuclear weapon are hyperbolic and disingenuous. But, he says, Britain under his leadership would \u201cstand by the United States\u201d and consider military intervention in Iran \u201con a case-by-case basis\u201d. Hunt has also made clear he accepts unproven US intelligence blaming Iran for recent attacks \u2013 indeed, he disowned a British general who questioned it. And he agrees with Trump that Iran\u2019s ill-defined \u201cdestabilising activity\u201d constitutes a casus belli. Hunt may not want war. But a British military buildup is under way on his watch, including deployments of special forces, marines, Royal Navy ships out of Bahrain and, potentially, RAF F-35 fighter jets based in Cyprus. Trump has already demanded armed patrols to protect oil tankers in the Gulf. Just where does Hunt imagine all this will lead, if and when the US starts shooting? Boris Johnson has said less about Iran, hoping perhaps not to remind people of his mishandling, when foreign secretary, of the Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe case. Yet his likely attitude to an outbreak of hostilities is no mystery. Johnson is an unabashed Trump-world groupie. He already has the president\u2019s personal backing. And his Brexit strategy, such as it is, depends on swiftly cutting a comprehensive US trade deal. If Trump turns to Britain when faced with Iranian retaliation \u2013 which would certainly have happened last week if planned US air strikes had gone ahead \u2013 arch-sycophant Johnson, like company-man Hunt, can be expected to fall tamely, even enthusiastically, into line. Will parliament or the public be consulted in a timely fashion? Not a hope! It\u2019s true the US takes ever less notice of what British leaders say \u2013 reflecting a wider problem of declining national influence. But Trump still needs moral ballast. The prospect of Britain sleepwalking into a new American war has been greatly increased by Tory-propagated delusions about the country\u2019s global status and supposed ability to \u201cpunch above its weight\u201d. Their bluff may soon be called. But it won\u2019t be Tory blaggers who pay the price. The Conservatives\u2019 Brexit obsession has also distracted attention and blurred judgment. When the foreign office minister Andrew Murrison visited Tehran this week, his tough reception should not have come as a surprise. In their talks, Seyed Abbas Araghchi, deputy foreign minister, displayed an embarrassingly accurate grasp of where post-imperial, post-Europe Britain was going wrong. \u201cIt appears that the British government\u2019s entanglement with the predicament of Brexit has prevented it from having a correct understanding of the global realities,\u201d Araghchi said acidly. Its collusion with \u201cAmerica\u2019s bully-style measures\u201d would only further harm the UK\u2019s standing. The Iranians are right. Across the Middle East, Britain is too often seen as in league with despots and murderers while its subservience to harmful American policies erodes its reputation. In Yemen, Britain is closely identified with a Trump-backed, Saudi-led war that has caused immeasurable suffering \u2013 and to what end, save further unlawful weapons sales? When it comes to Palestine, Trump\u2019s risibly biased \u201cpeace plan\u201d is destroying the international consensus favouring a viable Palestinian state \u2013 a consensus consistently supported by Britain. In Syria, commendable British humanitarian aid efforts are sabotaged by US indifference, while in Egypt a dictator receives Trump\u2019s blessing even as he scandalises universal human rights law. If Trump\u2019s hawks get their war, Britain risks being sucked in on the side of an aggressive superpower whose words and deeds are increasingly inimical to this country\u2019s interests and values. There\u2019s an old debt to be paid, and it\u2019s high time Britain finally did the right thing by Iran. That requires unhesitating, active opposition to the threat the Trump regime poses to Iranians, the wider region \u2013 and to us. \u2022 Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump and Xi Jinping have been urged to reach a trade deal or risk setting the global economy on a downward path as world leaders gathered in Japan for the G20 summit. Russian president Vladimir Putin, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and European president Jean-Claude Juncker heaped pressure on the two superpowers on Friday to settle their differences when they meet on the sidelines of the Osaka summit on Saturday. But financial markets fell across Asia on Friday amid growing fears that the talks will fail to break the logjam and see the US president carry out his threat of additional tariffs on Chinese goods. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.3%, with weakness in Chinese equities weighing on the broader region. The Shanghai composite was down nearly 1% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei stock index was 0.55% lower. Trump has adopted a belligerent position ahead of the meeting, saying that China was desperate to reach a deal because its economy was \u201cgoing down the tubes\u201d. Xi hit back on Friday by saying that some developed countries were taking protectionist measures that are leading to trade conflicts and economic blockade - calling them the biggest risk of the increase in instability in the global economy. \u201cAll this is destroying the global trade order,\u201d he told leaders of the so-called Brics nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) in Osaka. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, urged G20 leaders to work together to defuse trade and political tensions, describing them as threats to global economic growth and stability. Abe, eager to avoid Japan\u2019s first G20 summit descending into rancour, said \u201cfree and open\u201d economies were critical to peace and prosperity, adding that no one would benefit from retaliatory moves over trade. Trump has also threatened Japan over what he calls its unfair advantage on trade. Abe, who hosted the US president on a lavish state visit last month, began the summit by handing him a document outlining Japanese carmakers\u2019 recent investments in the US. Trump said before his bilateral with Abe on Friday morning: \u201cI appreciate the fact that you\u2019re sending many automobile companies into Michigan, and Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and North Carolina \u2013 a lot of our states. I see they\u2019re building all over the United States, a lot of the great Japanese car companies \u2026 and other Japanese companies also. \u201cBut in particular, the car companies have been terrific.

We\u2019ll be discussing military. And we\u2019ll be discussing the purchase of a lot of military equipment by Japan, and we appreciate that.\u201d Putin echoed Xi\u2019s concerns at the same meeting, saying in a thinly veiled attack on the US that attempts to weaken the role of the World Trade Organisation \u2013 as Trump has suggested he wants to do \u2013 were \u201ccounter-productive\u201d. The current situation in the global economy was worrying, he added, as global trade was feeling the effect of \u201cprotectionism [and] politically motivated restrictions\u201d. Ahead of talks with Modi, Trump softened his warnings about tariffs on India and said \u201cwe\u2019re going to have some very big things to announce \u2026 with India in terms of trade\u201d. But that did not stop Modi joining the chorus of warnings about \u201cone-sided decisions\u201d that jeopardised the balanced development of the global economy for all countries. Juncker said the trade relations between China and the US were \u201cdifficult\u201d and were causing a slowdown of the global economy. Michael McCarthy of CMC markets in Sydney said that there was nevertheless some optimism that there would be a step forward in the trade negotiations, which broke down in May at the last minute.

Why should voters trust you, Joe Biden?</p> \n  <p>Biden says Bush abused the power given to him. He says once in government (with Barack Obama), he was responsible for getting more than 100,000 combat troops out of Iraq. He touts his experience negotiating with foreign leaders.</p> \n  <p><strong>This is a tactic Biden has deployed again and again tonight: pivoting to his place in Obama\u2019s (popular) government, and pointing out his negotiating experience, both with Republicans and foreign leaders. But is that what voters want? Is bipartisanship not dead now?</strong></p> \n  <p>As an aside, Biden keeps stumbling over his lines a bit, he\u2019s not hugely convincing here. Bernie Sanders hops in to say a difference with him and Biden is that he led the opposition to the war.</p> \n  <p>There\u2019s a brief discussion on guns. Eric Swalwell, who is running primarily on the gun control issue, promotes a buy back program. Buttigieg is asked about gun control, with reference to his military experience. He says some of the weapons he trained on have no place on the streets.</p> \n  <p>Biden bemoans that he\u2019s not had enough time. He is the only person who has got the Brady bill passed. He\u2019s the only one in an administration that brought in gun control measures.</p> \n  <p>Biden also says we need smart guns \u2013 guns should have biometric sensors.</p> \n  <p>Earlier, Chuck Todd asked for one word answers.

Good start from Harris.</p> \n  <p>Just before that, <strong>Pete Buttigieg became the first of the night to speak Spanish!</strong> He doesn\u2019t go all in like Beto O\u2019Rourke, but it was definitely Spanish.</p> \n  <p>Buttigieg is asked why he doesn\u2019t support free college, like Bernie Sanders. He says he wants free college for lower income families.

He discusses how he will make healthcare and education more affordable. Guthrie presses Sanders on whether the middle class will face tax rises, and he answers <strong>yes: taxes will go up for the middle class</strong>. But healthcare will be cheaper.</p> \n  <p>Biden is asked about his own plan. <strong>He immediately attacks Donald Trump</strong> \u2013 just like he did in his campaign announcement. Biden has noticeably been running against Trump, rather than his fellow Democrats. Maybe we\u2019ll see more of this from him through tonight. Then, like Sanders, just launches into a sweeping stump speech about a whole host of topics. Guthrie doesn\u2019t ask a follow up question.</p> \n  <p><strong>Kamala Harris</strong> is next. Guthrie asks: Do you think Democrats have a responsibility to explain how they will pay for progressive proposals on healthcare and college tuition fees?</p> \n  <p>Harris says no one asked Trump how people would pay for the tax cuts he gave to the wealthy. A nice line, and she gets a big cheer from the crowd.

It starts at 9pm ET, and runs for two hours.</p> \n  <p><strong>In terms of the format: </strong>\u201cBrevity will be the name of the game,\u201d according to NBC. \u201cCandidates will have 60 seconds to answer questions and 30 seconds to respond to follow-ups. And there will be no opening statements, though candidates will have a chance to deliver closing remarks.\u201d The two hours will be split into five segments.</p> \n  <p>Before last night, most analysts anticipated this would leave each candidate with about 8-10 minutes of speaking time. It didn\u2019t.

He\u2019s flanked by Bernie Sanders, who in most polls is second (with Elizabeth Warren closing in third), and Pete Buttigieg. California senator Kamala Harris, who completes what is arguably a \u201cbig four\u201d of candidates taking part tonight, is next to Sanders.</p> \n  <p><strong>This is how they\u2019ll line up</strong>, from left-to-right:</p> \n  <p>Marianne Williamson, self-help author;</p> \n  <p>John Hickenlooper, former governor of Colorado;</p> \n  <p>Andrew Yang, tech entrepreneur;</p> \n  <p>Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana;</p> \n  <p>Joe Biden, former vice-president;</p> \n  <p>Bernie Sanders, Vermont senator;</p> \n  <p>Kamala Harris, California senator;</p> \n  <p>Kirsten Gillibrand, New York senator;</p> \n  <p>Michael Bennet, Colorado senator;</p> \n  <p>Eric Swalwell, congressman from California.</p> \n  <p>Each candidate will be standing at a podium, in front of a rather crude rendering of the White House.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12f5a12119b978bb674c67289009a11eb2a9c28a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12f5a12119b978bb674c67289009a11eb2a9c28a/0_89_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The debate stage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The debate stage.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d1560448f082364d7cf2b84\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/enjoli-liston\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-28T00:56:23.632Z\">1.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Three Democratic candidates \u2013 Beto O\u2019Rourke, Cory Booker and Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2013 broke into Spanish during last night\u2019s debate, with some mixed results. </p> \n  <p>Comedians on US late night shows compared O\u2019Rourke to an \u201cembarrassing dad at a Mexican restaurant\u201d while Booker\u2019s wide-eyed reaction to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Spanish became an instant meme.

Those rules were incremental, compared to what scientists say is required, and they have are being rolled back by the Trump administration. His administration also helped lead the development of the international Paris agreement to stem emissions. </p> \n  <p>Sanders says he introduced the most comprehensive climate change bill, a carbon tax and dividend plan in 2013. He also secured energy efficiency spending in the Obama-era stimulus package. In the 2016 election cycle, he emphasized the escalating climate crisis. </p> \n  <p>Sanders\u2019 support has been central to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/11/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ed-markey\">Green New Deal</a>, a blueprint popular among progressives that was not mentioned a first round of debates last night.

He gave an impassioned response to the news of a father and daughter who had drowned at the border \u2013 \u201cIt should piss us all off,\u201d Castro said \u2013 and shopped his proposal to decriminalizing entering the United States without prior authorization, instead making it a civil offense.</p> \n  <p>As for <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong>, Ed writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>She was strong on healthcare, shooting up her hand over Medicare for All, the policy that would introduce a national health system and eradicate private health insurance, and denouncing gun violence which she described as a \u201cnational health emergency\u201d claiming the lives of seven children in America every day.</p> \n   <p>But it was a sign of how brutal the format was, with 10 ambitious people all gasping for air on a cramped stage, that even she faded a little as the evening went on. She didn\u2019t get a word in on several key issues, including immigration.</p> \n   <p>Those of her supporters who were hoping for a dramatic Warren bounce after tonight will probably be disappointed. But so too will those who wanted to see her fall.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"682ea851b12cf81b7b7647a02432298b2ce2fdff\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/682ea851b12cf81b7b7647a02432298b2ce2fdff/0_0_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The gang share a joke.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The gang share a joke.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d1529618f082364d7cf2ab9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-27T21:00:29.906Z\">10.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Welcome to live coverage of the DNC presidential primary debates</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here we go again!

The biggest loser was <strong>NBC\u2019s sound department</strong>, who <a href=\"https://people.com/politics/democratic-debate-microphone-audio-problem/\">managed to hot mic themselves</a> and led to Chuck Todd having to cut to an ad break about 30 minutes early.</p> \n  <p>This evening, it\u2019s the turn of the out and out frontrunner: <strong>Joe Biden</strong>. The former vice-president has been top of the polls since before he even announced his campaign, and this will be the first chance the wider public has had to check him out. But with great polling position comes great responsibility. Biden has the most to lose, and here he will be forced to actually engage with his Democratic rivals, who may confront him over things like his past positions on <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/05/05/joe-biden-busing-problem-226791\">school bussing</a>, and his <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/25/joe-biden-2020-democrats-1380317\">working with segregationists</a> in the Senate.</p> \n  <p>Among those up against Biden are <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong>, who has consistently been second in the polls, the up-and-coming <strong>Pete Buttigieg</strong>, and <strong>Kamala Harris</strong>, who is still seeking for a breakout moment.</p> \n  <p>The other six hopefuls are: New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand; Colorado senator Michael Bennet; former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper; California congressman Eric Swalwell; entrepreneur Andrew Yang and author Marianne Williamson.</p> \n  <p>Join us for all the build-up, and then live news and analysis when the debate kicks off at 9pm.</p> \n </div> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from me, thanks for reading. It was great debate for Kamala Harris, a bad debate for Joe Biden, and I doubt anyone else on stage will come away thinking they either nailed it, or flunked it. The polls conducted after these two debates will be very interesting reading. If the last two nights don\u2019t boost Cory Booker and Harris, in particular, then it\u2019s hard to see what will. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s news story on the debate: If Google searches are anything to go by, then Kamala Harris had a great night. She\u2019s the most searched Democratic candidate in at least 40 states after her performance. Pete Buttigieg has had an uptick as well, and for some reason Michigan is now fascinated by Marianne Williamson. The New York Times has this transcript of Kamala Harris\u2019 direct address to Joe Biden. Harris: And I\u2019m going to now direct this at Vice President Biden. I do not believe you are a racist. And I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground, but I also believe \u2014 and it is personal, and it was actually very hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputation and career on the segregation of race in this country. And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing. And you know, there was a little girl in California who was a part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me. So I will tell you that, on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats. We have to take it seriously. We have to act swiftly. As attorney general of California, I was very proud to put in place a requirement that all my special agents wear body cameras and keep those cameras on. Some pics from tonight The time difference between how much the candidates is remarkable. Joe Biden spoke longest, for 11.5 minutes, and I personally can\u2019t remember him saying anything of note. Kamala Harris spoke for 10.8 minutes, and Andrew Yang got just 2.4 minutes. That\u2019s an even bigger disparity than last night, when Cory Booker spoke for 10.9 minutes, and the person who spoke least got five. Some snap takes from Twitter: \u2022Kamala Harris was the star. She went after Biden passionately and \u2013 as you\u2019d expect from a former prosecutor \u2013 precisely. Her criticism of Biden\u2019s track record on race was by far and away the best bit of the night. When she slated Biden\u2019s past opposition to busing, then said she knew an African-American girl who benefited from being bused to a better school before adding: \u201cAnd that little girl was me,\u201d she created the moment of the debates \u2013 and maybe even the moment of the primaries so far. \u2022Biden was subdued, and the lingering memory will likely be Harris\u2019 taking down of his record. He didn\u2019t have many applause lines, he didn\u2019t really manage to talk about his vision for the country. The former vice-president got stuck in a rut of touting a) the fact he was vice-president to Obama, and b) he can negotiate with opponents. The problem is that Republicans and Democrats are so entrenched now, some believe that those days of negotiation are gone. \u2022Pete Buttigieg did ok, but was ultimately outshone by Harris. The South Bend mayor has been the star of the early part of the primary race so far, but he might have hoped for more of a breakout moment infront of this new crowd. Meanwhile Bernie Sanders stuck to his script, passionately and loudly. His large core of supporters will have loved it, but will he have convinced viewers? Williamson: I\u2019m going to harness love for political purposes. That will beat Trump. Bennet: I\u2019m going to harness the power of America, and reunite it. Hickenlooper: As Colorado governor, I brought in progressive policies. Socialism is bad, and will relect Trump. Gillibrand: women in America are on fire, but our rights are under attack. I will take on the fights no one else will. Now is not the time to be afraid of first. Yang: the right candidate to beat Trump will have a vision of a trickle-up economy. I am that candidate, I can build a broad coalition. Harris: this election is about you. Your hopes, your dreams, your fears. I will lead with dignity, honesty. Go to my website. Buttigieg: politics isn\u2019t theoretical for me. I\u2019m in a marriage that exists by a single vote on the Supreme Court, I fought in Iraq. Sanders: these are good people, but nothing changes. Wages are stagnant, people have debt. I am angry. We need to take on Wall Street and other big industries. Biden: it\u2019s important to restore the soul of this nation. The president has ripped it out. If we unite America, there\u2019s not a single thing we can\u2019t do. Iraq, guns, and foreign relations Biden\u2019s record comes back to haunt him again, as viewers are reminded that he voted for the Iraq war. Why should voters trust you, Joe Biden? Biden says Bush abused the power given to him. He says once in government (with Barack Obama), he was responsible for getting more than 100,000 combat troops out of Iraq. He touts his experience negotiating with foreign leaders. This is a tactic Biden has deployed again and again tonight: pivoting to his place in Obama\u2019s (popular) government, and pointing out his negotiating experience, both with Republicans and foreign leaders. But is that what voters want? Is bipartisanship not dead now? As an aside, Biden keeps stumbling over his lines a bit, he\u2019s not hugely convincing here. Bernie Sanders hops in to say a difference with him and Biden is that he led the opposition to the war. There\u2019s a brief discussion on guns. Eric Swalwell, who is running primarily on the gun control issue, promotes a buy back program. Buttigieg is asked about gun control, with reference to his military experience. He says some of the weapons he trained on have no place on the streets. Biden bemoans that he\u2019s not had enough time. He is the only person who has got the Brady bill passed. He\u2019s the only one in an administration that brought in gun control measures. Biden also says we need smart guns \u2013 guns should have biometric sensors. Earlier, Chuck Todd asked for one word answers. Again. Which country would the candidates want to reset the US relationship first? Buttigieg had a good joke: \u201cWe have no idea which of our important allies he will have pissed off by then.\u201d He was talking about Trump, presumably. Twitter has been reacting to Kamala Harris\u2019s criticisms of Joe Biden\u2019s record on race, and his response. Is this the end of talk of the Biden-Harris \u2018dream ticket\u2019? Some (brief) thoughts so far 1.The Harris-taking-on-Biden moment is the biggest thing to come out of either debate so far. It\u2019s looking like that will be what everyone is discussing tomorrow. Harris has been struggling in the polls, and n needed a break out moment here. She got it. 2.Like last night, not much time has been devoted to the climate crisis. But, encouragingly, every candidate said tackling the issue. 3.There\u2019s just too many people on stage. To qualify for the debate, Democrats only needed 1% in three polls. It feels like some of the candidates are wasting both their time and ours \u2013 we\u2019d learn a lot more if people could talk for more than 60 seconds at a time. Chuck Todd does his one-word answer thing. It didn\u2019t work last night, and it doesn\u2019t work tonight, but it\u2019s quite revealing, and promising, that almost all of the candidates mention the climate crisis. Todd: Obama wanted to address healthcare and climate change. Ultimately he could only do one. You might only get one shot, what\u2019s your number one issue? Swalwell: ending gun violence Bennet: climate change Gillibrand: passing a family bill of rights that includes pre-K Harris: working families tax cut, Daca, guns Sanders: let me do my stump speech, but also, a political revolution Biden: you\u2019re underestimating what Barack Obama did. He was strong on climate change. But the first thing I\u2019d make sure we do is defeat Trump Buttigieg: fix our broken political system Yang: Universal Basic Income, which would help with climate change Hickenlooper: collaborative approach on climate change Williamson: call the prime minister of New Zealand and ask for her advice on climate change. A Supreme Court/abortion rights question. If Roe v Wade makes it to the Supreme Court and is struck down, what would Bernie Sanders do about that as president? Sanders defends a woman\u2019s right to choose. He says he\u2019d never nominate any justice who wouldn\u2019t defend Roe v Wade. He completely ignores the question. Last night this issue prompted a big(ish) moment for Amy Klobuchar, when she confronted Jay Inslee and said there were three women on stage who had fought pretty hard for women\u2019s rights. That feels a long time ago right now. A question on the climate crisis... ...after almost an hour-and-a-half. Buttigieg says as mayor of South Bend he has had to deal with this. He says rural America, \u201cwith the right kind of soil management\u201d and other things, can be part of the solution. Not the most inspiring response. Hickenlooper, who hasn\u2019t had much time at all, says he is a scientist. He also says socialism won\u2019t fix the problem. (Another Sanders dig. The attacks on the Vermont senator have been an interesting subthread.) Biden is asked if he can tackle climate crisis without the support of congress. He says he and Obama \u2013 linking himself to the former president again \u2013 built the largest wind-farm in the US. He\u2019d rejoin the Paris climate accord, and \u201cup the ante\u201d in the accord. Biden says we need someone who knows how to corral the world to get things done. Biden playing up his government experience there. The Guardian\u2019s Vivian Ho in Oakland writes that Harris thrives on being \u201cthe adult in the room\u201d in debates, which seems to be her MO so far tonight Senator Kamala Harris\u2019s supporters have been waiting for her to take the stage in the debates since she announced her candidacy. She may have stalled in the polls, consistently lagging behind former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders, but anyone who has followed her career knows that she shines brightest when the pressure\u2019s on and she can step into the role of the only adult in room. After all, her Senate judiciary committee hearings have become almost a spectator sport. Video footage of her flustering attorney general William Barr with a career prosecutor\u2019s mastery has notched millions of views. Her questioning of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh led to memes of her skeptical face circulating around social media. No doubt, voters tonight are now picturing the kind of damage she could do on a debate stage with President Trump. It\u2019s the biggest moment of the debate so far, and Kamala Harris is at the center of it. This comes after Buttigieg is asked about his city of South Bend, where a white police officer recently shot a black man. (The officer\u2019s body camera was off. South Bend has very few black police officers.) Buttigieg says he can\u2019t go into detail on how it happened due to an investigation. But systemic racism is the problem, Buttigieg says. As president he will work to tackle that. Others strive to talk about policing. Enter Harris. \u201cAs the only African-American on stage, I would like to speak,\u201d Harris says. Big cheers from the crowd. She turns to Biden. \u201cI do not believe you are a racist,\u201d Harris says. But she says it was personal and hurtful to hear Biden talk about his relationship with segregationist Republicans \u2013 which he did recently. Harris then criticizes Biden\u2019s historic opposition to busing minority students to better school district. She says when he opposed busing, she knew a little black girl who was being bused to a better school. \u201cAnd that little girl was me,\u201d Harris says. Ahead of the debate, these were the two issues Biden would not have wanted brought up. Well, they have been raised \u2013 and both of them by Harris, who is really standing out here. The Guardian\u2019s environment reporter Emily Holden has been pointing out the lack of discussion on climate change so far We\u2019re halfway through the debate, and Joe Biden has faded into the background. It\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing for him \u2013 he had more to lose than the others, given his lead in the polls and the fact he is already well known \u2013 but I wonder if he is looking just a little bit uninspiring compare to some of the younger candidates: Harris in particular. Lester Hold poses a question about China. China steals our property, and manipulate their currency. How would the candidates combat them? China is an important topic but it isn\u2019t emotive like immigration, and doesn\u2019t make for exciting answers. Bennet says Russia is a greater threat, because of their election interference. But re China, he would involve the rest of the world to solve the problem. Bennet gets loud and angry as he talks about Trump\u2019s actions on the border. He\u2019s passionate and interesting on this point, but maybe one problem is he\u2019s yet another old white guy? Yang also criticizes Russia. The political newcomer pulls an old political trick \u2013 he mentions a farmer he met in Iowa, who was unhappy with taxes. Buttigieg says China is using technology \u201cfor the perfection of dictatorship\u201d. Buttigieg talks up his mid-west background. Trump\u2019s tariffs are hurting factory workers and farmers, he says. He talks about China investing in technology. America needs to invest in itself, Buttigieg says. It seems California congressman Eric Swalwell\u2019s early attack on Joe Biden may have piqued the interest of audiences at home Here\u2019s a clip of that Swalwell moment The candidates are being asked what they would do on day one of their presidency to deal with the issue of immigration. This is the topic that prompted what was really the only spat last night: between Julian Castro and Beto O\u2019Rourke. The problem is that in broad terms, the candidates largely are on the same page. They would get rid of detention centers. Kamala Harris says people should put themselves in the shoes of a mother who felt forced to pay a coyote to take her child to America. It\u2019s quite emotive, and the crowd like it. Marianne Williamson tries desperately to chip in. She\u2019s really getting nothing here. Oh, wait, she does get a chance to speak. Williamson says one aspect of immigration that no one else has addressed is a need to address US policy in central America. People brought that up last night, but Williamson is right, no one has talked about it here so far. Pete Buttigieg turns the discussion to religion. He criticizes Republicans, who in Buttigieg\u2019s eyes are hypocrites for claiming to be the party of god, but allowing children to be locked in cages. Buttigieg is a practicing Christian, and presumably is keen for voters to know that. Joe Biden says he would send billions of dollars to central America immediately, which would help with \u2018the root cause\u2019 of why people are fleeing the region for the US. He and Obama did that, he says. That\u2019s a tactic we expected from Biden: tying himself to Obama\u2019s presidency. The former vice-president is coming through unscathed here so far. Some people were expecting a bloodbath. Elizabeth Warren had her moment on the debates stage last night, but it appears she can\u2019t resist joining in tonight too Here\u2019s some analysis from The Boston Globe on who spoke the most in the first 30 minutes of tonight\u2019s debate, which shows Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden taking the largest share Some thoughts so far: It\u2019s been rowdier than last night, with several candidates talking over each other. The attacks on Biden haven\u2019t really emerged yet. Harris has had the best line, when she played the adult in the room by pleading for calm. Sanders has come under fire, a bit unexpectedly, from some of his rivals. Buttigieg has been quiet. The candidates are asked to raise their hands if they support giving healthcare to undocumented immigrants. Every hand goes up. Buttigieg, who we\u2019ve not heard much from at all so far, is asked why. Undocumented immigrants pay taxes and are parts of our society, he says. He mentions that his father came here as an immigrant (from Malta). Biden, after asking for the question to be repeated, agrees. You can\u2019t let people who are sick go uncovered. He expands on his healthcare plan, which is to expand Obamacare. Biden talks, a little unconvincingly, it must be said, about how he would go after healthcare companies and big pharma. Here\u2019s a clip of that moment Kamala Harris stepped in to try and calm squabbling candidates, earning her a round of applause Bernie Sanders is very consistent, isn\u2019t he. He\u2019s asked about Medicare for All, again, and he sets off: hands waving, voice bellowing. The moderators ask him about how much it would cost. He doesn\u2019t answer. First question of the night for Marianne Williamson, thirty minutes in. Oh dear. It\u2019s a question about healthcare. Williamson says everyone\u2019s plans are nice, but if you think you can beat Donald Trump by saying we have all those plans, you\u2019re wrong, Williamson reckons. I must confess, this is the first time I\u2019ve heard Williamson speak. She\u2019s got one of those 1930s Hollywood accents. We\u2019re still on healthcare. Michael Bennet criticizes Sanders\u2019 plan. Bennet attacked Sanders earlier as well. Did he not get the memo? We thought everyone was going to go after Biden. So far, that has not transpired. The candidates are asked if they would support Medicare for All, to the extent of abolishing private healthcare. Last night, when the Democrats were asked the same question, Elizabeth Warren was the only one to raise her hand. Tonight, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris both raise their hands. That\u2019s two moments \u2013 her sick burn and now putting herself to the left on healthcare \u2013 where Harris has managed to stand out from the rest so far. Eric Swalwell is the first of the night to attack Joe Biden. Presumably it\u2019s a prepared line. He says he remembers being a child when a Democratic candidate came to California and talked about the need to \u201cPass the torch\u201d to young people. That man was Joe Biden, Swalwell says. And yes, we need to: \u201cPass the torch.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m still holding onto that torch,\u201d Biden says. If he was hoping for a laugh, it doesn\u2019t come. Biden then runs through his plans for improving education for young people. The moderators tries to move the discussion on, there\u2019s some squabbling among the candidates, and Kamala Harris comes in with a line of her own. Americans don\u2019t want to watch a foodfight, she says. They want to know how they will be able to \u201cput food on the table\u201d. It gets a big cheer. Good start from Harris. Just before that, Pete Buttigieg became the first of the night to speak Spanish! He doesn\u2019t go all in like Beto O\u2019Rourke, but it was definitely Spanish. Buttigieg is asked why he doesn\u2019t support free college, like Bernie Sanders. He says he wants free college for lower income families. But it doesn\u2019t make sense for working class families to subsidize the children of billionaires. And Andrew Yang gets his first question of the night. He\u2019s asked how he would pay for Universal Basic Income, his proposal which would give everyone over 18 $1,000 a month. Yang attacks Amazon, and other companies who don\u2019t pay much tax. Being harder on them would raise funds for UBI, he says. And we\u2019re off. The first question goes to Bernie Sanders. Savannah Guthrie talks about some of his ambitious proposals, and asks Sanders if he will raise taxes on the middle class. If so, Guthrie asks, how he will sell that to Americans? Sanders launches into his classic stump speech. He says it is a \u201ctime for change\u201d. He discusses how he will make healthcare and education more affordable. Guthrie presses Sanders on whether the middle class will face tax rises, and he answers yes: taxes will go up for the middle class. But healthcare will be cheaper. Biden is asked about his own plan. He immediately attacks Donald Trump \u2013 just like he did in his campaign announcement. Biden has noticeably been running against Trump, rather than his fellow Democrats. Maybe we\u2019ll see more of this from him through tonight. Then, like Sanders, just launches into a sweeping stump speech about a whole host of topics. Guthrie doesn\u2019t ask a follow up question. Kamala Harris is next. Guthrie asks: Do you think Democrats have a responsibility to explain how they will pay for progressive proposals on healthcare and college tuition fees? Harris says no one asked Trump how people would pay for the tax cuts he gave to the wealthy. A nice line, and she gets a big cheer from the crowd. Harris then touts her own tax plan to cut taxes on the middle class Here\u2019s a little guide, for those who\u2019ve just joined us. The format for these two debates is, in theory, simple. The debate will be shown live on NBC, on its affiliated news channels, MSNBC and Telemundo, and streamed online at nbcnews.com. It starts at 9pm ET, and runs for two hours. In terms of the format: \u201cBrevity will be the name of the game,\u201d according to NBC. \u201cCandidates will have 60 seconds to answer questions and 30 seconds to respond to follow-ups. And there will be no opening statements, though candidates will have a chance to deliver closing remarks.\u201d The two hours will be split into five segments. Before last night, most analysts anticipated this would leave each candidate with about 8-10 minutes of speaking time. It didn\u2019t. On Wednesday Cory Booker spoke for 10.9 minutes, while Washington governor Jay Inslee only got five. The candidates\u2019 positions on stage are determined by their average polling performance. That means Joe Biden, way out ahead of the rest, is plonked in the middle. He\u2019s flanked by Bernie Sanders, who in most polls is second (with Elizabeth Warren closing in third), and Pete Buttigieg. California senator Kamala Harris, who completes what is arguably a \u201cbig four\u201d of candidates taking part tonight, is next to Sanders. This is how they\u2019ll line up, from left-to-right: Marianne Williamson, self-help author; John Hickenlooper, former governor of Colorado; Andrew Yang, tech entrepreneur; Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana; Joe Biden, former vice-president; Bernie Sanders, Vermont senator; Kamala Harris, California senator; Kirsten Gillibrand, New York senator; Michael Bennet, Colorado senator; Eric Swalwell, congressman from California. Each candidate will be standing at a podium, in front of a rather crude rendering of the White House. Three Democratic candidates \u2013 Beto O\u2019Rourke, Cory Booker and Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2013 broke into Spanish during last night\u2019s debate, with some mixed results. Comedians on US late night shows compared O\u2019Rourke to an \u201cembarrassing dad at a Mexican restaurant\u201d while Booker\u2019s wide-eyed reaction to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Spanish became an instant meme. Castro\u2019s vow to say \u201cAdi\u00f3s\u2019 to Donald Trump\u201d in 2020 was also an instant hit online. New York mayor Bill De Blasio, who also appeared on stage last night, appeared to be playing catch up today in Miami. Let\u2019s just say it didn\u2019t go so well. As the Miami Herald put it, the candidate didn\u2019t endear himself to south Florida\u2019s Hispanic diaspora when he \u201cblurted a quote from one of the most hated historical figures in Miami: \u2018Hasta la victoria, siempre.\u2019\u201d He has since apologized. Will candidates break into Spanish tonight? Candidate John Delaney has been putting himself about in the \u2018spin room\u2019. He suggested that last night\u2019s clash over health care could be defining for the Democrats in this election. \u201cA couple of weeks ago I was in San Francisco and I said Medicare for All was a bad idea and I was booed and I was told to leave he race,\u201d Delaney told me. \u201cAnd now last night there weren\u2019t as many hands going up for that proposal as I would\u2019ve thought. \u201cI bet a month ago a lot more hands would have gone up for getting rid of private insurance. So I just think we\u2019ve already changed the debate and health care is the most important issue. If we can win the health care debate we\u2019re going to be a really good position in this primary.\u201d Delaney said Elizabeth Warren has \u201coutsourced\u201d her plan to Bernie Sanders. \u201cShe may have a lot of plans but she doesn\u2019t have a plan for the most important issue facing the American people.\u201d As for Joe Biden, he added, \u201che doesn\u2019t have a plan to actually make sure every American has health care\u201d. The crowd are streaming in: You might notice (we will all definitely notice) that there\u2019s a 40-year age range between the candidates on stage tonight. At 77, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is the oldest candidate to make it to the TV debates. The millennial mayor of South Bend, Pete Buttigieg, is the youngest candidate running, at 37. Buttigieg is the one with brown hair who looks younger. Some last-minute tweets from the candidates: Bernie Sanders\u2019 team are holding a pre-debate Q and A: ...Joe Biden has battered out around a dozen tweets outlining his stance on pretty much everything: ...Pete Buttigieg has bought a drone: ... and Kamala Harris is retweeting well wishes from Mamas4Kamala. Public service announcement: I just had a quick flick around the channels and it seems debate coverage is currently competing for attention with a mini-golf competition on ABC. When the debate starts, at 9pm, ABC will be airing \u2018Family Food Fight\u2019. Fox has \u2018Spin the Wheel\u2019 in the 9pm slot, where: \u201cContestants face a colossal, spinning 40-foot wheel\u201d. Word is coming in that Joe Biden will not be coming to the spin room after the debate. Maybe it\u2019s not a huge issue, but every candidate attended last night, and all tonight\u2019s crew are expected to make an appearance. A note on the spin room: it\u2019s a slightly obnoxious name for an area in the press filing area, which is across from where the debates take place. After the candidates get off stage they come and stand in the spin room and are mobbed by journalists. (Some more than others \u2013 late last night I saw Jay Inslee essentially wandering about on his own.) Your hosts for the evening are: Lester Holt, anchor of \u201cNBC Nightly News with Lester Holt\u201d and \u201cDateline NBC.\u201d Savannah Guthrie, co-anchor of \u201cTODAY\u201d and NBC News chief legal analyst. Chuck Todd, moderator of \u201cMeet the Press with Chuck Todd\u201d and NBC News political director. Rachel Maddow, host of \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show\u201d on MSNBC. Jose D\u00edaz-Balart, anchor of \u201cNoticias Telemundo\u201d and \u201cNBC Nightly News Saturday.\u201d Holt will moderate the first hour alongside Guthrie and Diaz-Balart. After an hour those three will make themselves scarce, and Holt will be joined by Todd and Maddow for the second hour. It was when Todd and Maddow took over that the sound shenanigans started yesterday. Check this out: The first Democratic presidential debate on Wednesday night spent around seven minutes on a discussion around climate change, exceeding the total time spent on the crisis during all of the 2016 general election debates. But the candidates mostly reiterated their campaign talking points and policy proposals, rather than challenging their opponents or conveying the full scope of the problem. The climate questions did not come until the second half of the debate, when NBC Moderator Chuck Todd asked several contenders how they would address the dangerous effects of rising temperatures. Rachel Maddow asked Washington governor Jay Inslee if his extensive plan could \u201csave Miami\u201d, the coastal Florida city watching as oceans creep inward, increasing inland real estate costs and exacerbating flooding. Current science shows that even a significant global effort to stall rising temperatures would not prevent the huge disruptions beginning in Miami and other shoreline communities. \u201cTo my surprise, I\u2019m the only candidate who has made the commitment to make this the top priority,\u201d Inslee said in his concluding comments. \u201cWe can save ourselves. We can save our children. We can save our grandchildren. We can save literally the life on this planet. This is our moment.\u201d The bar for entry to this pair of debates was set relatively low, which has contributed to the throng. To qualify, candidates only needed to achieve 1% in three national polls, or receive more than 65,000 individual donations. Of the 20 candidates, the DNC then mixed them at random \u2013 but with the stipulation that five of the top 10 candidates appear on each night. It\u2019s different from Republican 2016 strategy, when the weakest candidates held their own debates before the main event. The \u201ckid\u2019s table\u201d was largely ignored, and roundly mocked. Last night 15.3m people watched the debates across NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo, and a further 9m online, according to Nielsen. That\u2019s more than watched America\u2019s Got Talent a night earlier! Tonight there are more high profile candidates, so it looks like another good night for NBC. In terms of what we can expect our ten Democrats to discuss, the DNC has promised questions about the climate crisis, which were conspicuously absent from the presidential debates in 2016. Many of the candidates have said they support the ambitious Green New Deal, but some of the more centrist types \u2013 including Biden \u2013 are holding off. Also expect quizzing on healthcare, a real point of differentiation where some contenders support Medicare for All, some are only up for improving Obamacare, and others are somewhere in the middle. Last night immigration emerged as a key topic \u2013 Julian Castro memorably criticizing Beto O\u2019Rourke for the latter\u2019s stance \u2013 and we\u2019ll likely hear more on that, and perhaps on Russia, China and Iran. (For varying reasons.) The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling earlier that the commerce department was not within its rights to add a citizenship question to the 2020 US Census under its proposed rationale \u2013 and declining to address gerrymandering in two states \u2013 could prompt another line of quizzing. The DNC has been at pains to promote this as a more serious debate than we have seen from Republicans in recent times, which won\u2019t be difficult, and expect other big topics such as college fees, student loans and impeachment. The frontrunners in tonight\u2019s Democratic presidential debate \u2013 Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders \u2013 both lay claim to early efforts to avert the climate crisis. But Sanders is thought by many advocates to be more sincere in his promises to prioritize the challenge. Biden was among the first to introduce climate legislation in the Senate, and as vice president under Barack Obama, his administration began multiple efforts to limit heat-trapping pollution from cars and power plants. Those rules were incremental, compared to what scientists say is required, and they have are being rolled back by the Trump administration. His administration also helped lead the development of the international Paris agreement to stem emissions. Sanders says he introduced the most comprehensive climate change bill, a carbon tax and dividend plan in 2013. He also secured energy efficiency spending in the Obama-era stimulus package. In the 2016 election cycle, he emphasized the escalating climate crisis. Sanders\u2019 support has been central to the Green New Deal, a blueprint popular among progressives that was not mentioned a first round of debates last night. He has called climate change the \u201cexistential crisis of our time,\u201d yet he hasn\u2019t published all of his climate proposals in one place, as several other candidates have done. Biden has come under criticism for his adviser\u2019s suggestions he would take a moderate approach to the climate crisis and allow the continued use of natural gas. Yet he wants to reach net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 and he endorses the concept of a Green New Deal. The format for these debates is, in theory, simple. \u201cBrevity will be the name of the game,\u201d according to NBC News, which is overseeing this (the debates are being shown live on NBC, on its affiliated news channels, and on NBCnews.com). From NBC: Candidates will have 60 seconds to answer questions and 30 seconds to respond to follow-ups. And there will be no opening statements, though candidates will have a chance to deliver closing remarks. The two-hour debates will zip by quickly, with five segments [...] separated by four commercial breaks. Before last night, most analysts anticipated this would leave each candidate with about 8-10 minutes of speaking time. Instead, the amount of time given to each person on stage varied wildly. Cory Booker got 10.9 minutes, Washington governor Jay Inslee, just five. O\u2019Rourke and Warren, who alongside Booker were the best polling of the ten candidates, were 2nd and 3rd, so we tonight we can likely expect to hear a lot from Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris. But who knows. \u201cFor all the unprecedented scale and diversity of the massive number of candidates vying for presidential nomination of the Democratic party, they can be sheeplike in their herd behavior,\u201d write my colleagues Ed Pilkington and Lauren Gambino. They\u2019re talking about an immigration detention center for child migrants in Homestead, 30 miles south of Miami, which has become the must-visit place for no fewer than 12 of the 20 candidates appearing at the debates. Here, in a scrubby bit of wasteland, a city of white tents houses up to 3,000 child migrants in conditions that protesters say are far from humane. And it is here that the Democratic presidential candidates have been landing like bees to the hive. On Monday it was Eric Swalwell, the congressman from California. On Wednesday, it was Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, US senators for Massachusetts and Minnesota, respectively. On Thursday, New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, snuck in before many of the local and national media had assembled. His luck or loss, depending. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders pitched up at the entrance to the facility shortly after 10am. The moment he stepped out of his SUV he was entirely engulfed in a tight ball of microphone booms and TV cameras. Next up, arriving 23 minutes after Sanders had departed was Beto O\u2019Rourke, fresh from his performance at the first bout of Democratic debates on Wednesday night. So about last night. My colleague Ed Pilkington was here at the debates and rounded up some of the key moments. It was a good night for Cory Booker, Ed writes: The 50-year-old African American has failed to make much of a dent on the Democratic race so far, but on Wednesday night he came across as assured, focused and with a strong personal story that leant heavily on his low-income and diverse neighborhood in Newark, New Jersey. He spoke passionately about immigration reform, a topic that has previously been owned by Juli\u00e1n Castro, the only Latino candidate in the Democratic pack, and O\u2019Rourke. And he planted himself firmly in the Medicare for All camp alongside Warren. Julian Castro had a good time too: he\u2019s been one of the most talked about candidates today. He gave an impassioned response to the news of a father and daughter who had drowned at the border \u2013 \u201cIt should piss us all off,\u201d Castro said \u2013 and shopped his proposal to decriminalizing entering the United States without prior authorization, instead making it a civil offense. As for Elizabeth Warren, Ed writes: She was strong on healthcare, shooting up her hand over Medicare for All, the policy that would introduce a national health system and eradicate private health insurance, and denouncing gun violence which she described as a \u201cnational health emergency\u201d claiming the lives of seven children in America every day. But it was a sign of how brutal the format was, with 10 ambitious people all gasping for air on a cramped stage, that even she faded a little as the evening went on. She didn\u2019t get a word in on several key issues, including immigration. Those of her supporters who were hoping for a dramatic Warren bounce after tonight will probably be disappointed. But so too will those who wanted to see her fall. Here we go again! It\u2019s night two of the Democratic debates. All in all, last night passed without too much drama. Elizabeth Warren performed well, as expected, while Cory Booker and Julian Castro also stood out. The general feeling is that Beto O\u2019Rourke made a bit of a mess of his stage-time, just when he needed a boost to his ailing campaign. The biggest loser was NBC\u2019s sound department, who managed to hot mic themselves and led to Chuck Todd having to cut to an ad break about 30 minutes early. This evening, it\u2019s the turn of the out and out frontrunner: Joe Biden. The former vice-president has been top of the polls since before he even announced his campaign, and this will be the first chance the wider public has had to check him out. But with great polling position comes great responsibility. Biden has the most to lose, and here he will be forced to actually engage with his Democratic rivals, who may confront him over things like his past positions on school bussing, and his working with segregationists in the Senate. Among those up against Biden are Bernie Sanders, who has consistently been second in the polls, the up-and-coming Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris, who is still seeking for a breakout moment. The other six hopefuls are: New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand; Colorado senator Michael Bennet; former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper; California congressman Eric Swalwell; entrepreneur Andrew Yang and author Marianne Williamson. Join us for all the build-up, and then live news and analysis when the debate kicks off at 9pm.",

      "bodyText": "Warren Mundine received approval for government funding for a second season of his Sky News TV show before his application for the grant had been submitted, documents obtained by Guardian Australia reveal. Mundine, a former president of the Australian Labor Party who became Scott Morrison\u2019s pick for the seat of Gilmore at the 2019 federal election, had hosted two seasons of a Sky News TV series showcasing Indigenous businesses called Mundine Means Business. The government was criticised in early 2019 when it was revealed that the show had been funded in part by the federal government as part of its Indigenous Advancement Strategy. The two series were funded, in part, by two contributions from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to Mundine\u2019s business, Nyungga Black Group, totalling just over $300,000. The first was part of a consultancy services package in 2017. The latter grant, worth $200,000, was awarded in mid-2018. The $200,000 made up 15% of total production costs for the show, according to the department. The second grant was awarded several months before Mundine became a Liberal candidate. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia under Freedom of Information law reveal Mundine approached Nigel Scullion, then minister for indigenous affairs, directly for funding for the second season. On 26 March, a staff member in Scullion\u2019s office told department assistant secretaries Clare Sharp and Kirsti McQueen that Mundine \u201chas approached the minister seeking another seasons\u2019 worth of sponsorship (around $200K) for his TV show.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cCould you please get a brief up to us ASAP?\u201d An email dated 3 April 2018 from a staff member in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet shows the department seeking to brief Scullion\u2019s office \u201cas soon as possible\u201d about funding for the second season. On 12 April, Elizabeth Henderson, chair advisory board for Nyungga Black Group, sent the department a costing brief on the proposed second season, which would consist of up to 24 episodes. Mundine submitted the grant application on 31 May2018, but according to the grants website, the tender was approved on 11 May. A spokesperson for the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet told Guardian Australia that this was \u201cstandard practice\u201d. \u201cThe former Minister for Indigenous Affairs approved a direct approach to Nyungga Black Group on 11 May 2018, believing the organisation was best placed to deliver the services required,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThey were then invited to submit an Indigenous Advancement Strategy grant application, which was submitted on 31 May 2018.

      "bodyText": "With some of the most popular surf beaches on the New South Wales South Coast, and neighbouring national park, there are few more naturally beautiful places to visit this close to Sydney. This once-sleepy coastal village just south of greater Wollongong, surrounded by farmland, littoral rainforest, and great surf breaks is booming - it\u2019s no wonder that locals and visitors alike flock to this spot. You\u2019ll find cute cafes, vibrant public art, protected beaches, bobbing boats and parklands bound by Norfolk Pines. Rich with fish and shellfish, the Shellharbour area has plenty of great places for throwing in a line. Alternatively, just pick up dinner at the local fish market and relax in the peaceful surrounds. Take a short walk through Macquarie Pass National Park, snorkel at Bass Point, cycle around Lake Illawarra, and surf at Killalea National Surfing Reserve ( In 2009 The Farm in Killalea State Park was declared a National Surfing Reserve, having long been one of the most popular surf beaches on the South Coast). Day 1 Bushrangers Bay Aquatic Reserve, Shell Cove 11am Arrive at ocean side quaint village of Shellharbour in less than an hour and a half from Sydney. Take a stroll around the harbour and through the village before stopping for a coffee at one of the many cafes. 12pm Have lunch at Paccino\u2019s Cafe. This licensed famil- run cafe serves Italian trattoria classics alongside gourmet burgers - prego. 1pm While you\u2019re in the village, drop in to the Shellharbour Scuba Centre and collect your snorkelling gear before making your way to Bushrangers Bay at Bass Point, an aquatic reserve and shore dive and snorkelling spot that allows you to get close to magnificent marine life. Then take a drive west through Albion Park to Macquarie Pass National Park. There are several walks at the bottom of Macquarie Pass, including the Cascades rainforest walk, an easy stroll to a dramatic waterfall. If retail therapy is more your thing, head to Shellharbour Village to explore the local shops or duck into Stockland Shellharbour. 5pm Stop in at the Shellharbour Square Fish Market (open daily) to pick up some fresh fish for dinner. This area is known for its shellfish, so pick up mussels, crabs and fresh oysters. The market is a fisherman\u2019s co-operative, so you are buying seafood that has come direct from local fisherman. 6pm Check in to your secluded, self-contained accommodation,Escape778. Cook dinner at home with your produce from the fish market - breathe in the fresh air and take in the country surrounds. Day 2 8am Have coffee and breakfast at MJ\u2019s on the deck in Shellharbour Village. Just a block from the water, MJ\u2019s is a casual all-day eatery serving egg breakfasts, pancakes, salads, soups and burgers. It\u2019s very kid friendly, and the melting moments are a local favourite. 10am Head to Killalea Beach (AKA The Farm), or Minnamurra Beach (known as Mystics), for a surf. Spend the whole day here in the Killalea Reserve. Book a surf lesson with Pines Surfing Academy, or just enjoy the view and look out for the dolphins and whales that are spotted here regularly. On the first Sunday of each month, the reserve hosts The Farm\u2019s Market, with more than 90 stalls run by local producers, artisans, brewers and florists. Plus there are lots of delicious food options. In September, the annual Sculptures at Killalea is a 10-day outdoor sculpture festival that includes workshops, artist talks and events. 1pm Grab lunch at The Farm Cafe (Killalea Park Kiosk) up on the hill. It provides takeaway food \u2013 such as sandwiches, burgers and milkshakes - and good coffee using beans from the South Coast roaster, Swell Coffee. Sit on the grass in the sun to eat lunch and enjoy the ocean views. 2pm In the afternoon, walk around the reserve. You\u2019ll find some 2-3km loop walks through littoral rainforest that aren\u2019t too challenging for kids. It\u2019s a beautiful picturesque spot. 3pm Jump aboard a steam train as it navigates through the quiet bushland of Albion Park at the Illawarra Light Railway Museum - kids will love it. 6pm Have dinner at Relish on Addison, serving a creative, modern-Australian menu. Chef Tom Laws and the team change the menu seasonally, with specials on offer to reflect the local produce available. Day 3 Killalea State Park 8am Start the day with an egg and bacon roll and great coffee at Cafe Connie. 9am Immerse yourself in some cultural history with a visit to the HARS Aviation Museum, where you\u2019ll find more than 40 aircraft on display. Walk the wing of a Qantas 747 and sit in the pilot seat of an F-111 fighter jet. 1pm Back in Shellharbour Village, park on Addison Street and head for Salvatore\u2019s Fish Cafe. Walk across the road to the sandy beach on the harbour - there\u2019s a playground for the kids and a picnic tables so you can enjoy your fish and chips by the water. 2pm For a caffeine hit after lunch, grab a coffee at organic espresso spot Village Fix. They serve Byron Bay coffee and organic raw treats. 3pm Finish your long weekend by walking or cycling the 3km Lake Illawarra Art Trail, exploring the region\u2019s history, Aboriginal heritage and works created by local artists. If you want to ride, rent a bike from South Coast Bike Hire. Book your long weekend winter wander in the Unspoilt South Coast",

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump has claimed ahead of his crunch meeting with Xi Jinping that China\u2019s economy is \u201cgoing down the tubes\u201d and that Beijing is desperate to do a trade deal to avert a bigger slowdown.</p> <p>So is there any truth to the US president\u2019s claims?</p> <h2>1. It\u2019s true that China is slowing a bit, but not much</h2> <p>China has seen more than 30 years of spectacular growth. The country\u2019s share of global manufacturing was close to zero in 1990 but today accounts for a quarter of the world\u2019s factory output. The transformation has dragged hundreds of millions out of rural poverty and seen the establishment of megacities centred around industry. The rate of growth peaked at more than 14% in 2007 and has been declining more slowly ever since. The official story is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/21/chinas-economic-growth-slowest-since-1990\">growth was 6.6% last year</a>, the slowest for 28 years, so Trump is right to say that the direction of travel is down. But exports to the US make up only a relatively small part of GDP and the trade war is not seen as being a killer blow to China\u2019s growth machine. In addition, 6.6% growth is still a figure that treasurers in western governments can only dream of, and will be enough for Beijing\u2019s leadership to convince its people that things are manageable.</p> <h2>2. Is that the full story though?</h2> <p>Digging a bit deeper reveals more serious problems for China. According to Roland Rajah of the Lowy Institute thinktank in Sydney there is a \u201cgrain of truth\u201d in what Trump says, although the overall picture is more complex.</p> <p>There are questions about the reliability of China\u2019s official data. The consultancy Capital Economics has devised a proxy measure of the economy that takes into consideration factors such as freight traffic and electricity consumption. Annual car sales in 2018 shrank for the first time in more than 20 years. Capital\u2019s base case is that China\u2019s GDP growth has slowed to around 5.2% and 4.0% by 2021. A \u201chard landing\u201d \u2013 ie some sort of recession, something China has never had in its capitalist era \u2013 cannot be ruled out, Capital says. It sees <a href=\"https://www.capitaleconomics.com/blog/chinas-slowdown-and-what-it-means-for-the-rest-of-the-world/\">Chinese growth to slowing to 2% a year by 2030</a>, which would represent a potentially significant impediment to the domestic and international economy.</p> <p>On the other hand, every time China has seen a dip coming since the global financial crisis it has responded with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/15/china-announces-package-tax-cuts-aid-slowing-economy\">a new round of stimulus</a>. The country has deep pockets thanks to its gigantic foreign reserves of more than $2 trillion and this time is no different. Credit has been loosened through interbank lending rates, billions more yuan have been pumped into the financial system in extra liquidity and it is expected that the central bank will cut regular rates soon. This has seen a sharp rebound in construction activity and a concomitant surge in iron ore prices, bringing another boost to the local economy and trading partners such as Australia that supply China\u2019s raw materials.</p> <h2>3. How long can this stimulus go on?</h2> <p>That\u2019s the big problem, and gets us closer to perhaps what Trump was hinting at. China has some enormous structural problems that need to be tackled to avoid serious economic paralysis. The biggest is debt. Despite its accumulation of so many dollars thanks to its export boom, China is one of the most indebted countries in the world. By some metrics total debt \u2013 including corporate, government and household \u2013 is heading towards 300% of GDP. The leadership has been trying to grapple with the debt bubble but is hampered by many factors such as successive crises that require another shot of stimulus. Much of the cash goes towards propping up inefficient state-owned enterprises that are important for maintaining high employment levels but mean that Beijing\u2019s rulers are getting ever-decreasing bang for their buck in terms of any lasting impact on the economy.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has claimed ahead of his crunch meeting with Xi Jinping that China\u2019s economy is \u201cgoing down the tubes\u201d and that Beijing is desperate to do a trade deal to avert a bigger slowdown. So is there any truth to the US president\u2019s claims? 1. It\u2019s true that China is slowing a bit, but not much China has seen more than 30 years of spectacular growth. The country\u2019s share of global manufacturing was close to zero in 1990 but today accounts for a quarter of the world\u2019s factory output. The transformation has dragged hundreds of millions out of rural poverty and seen the establishment of megacities centred around industry. The rate of growth peaked at more than 14% in 2007 and has been declining more slowly ever since. The official story is that growth was 6.6% last year, the slowest for 28 years, so Trump is right to say that the direction of travel is down. But exports to the US make up only a relatively small part of GDP and the trade war is not seen as being a killer blow to China\u2019s growth machine. In addition, 6.6% growth is still a figure that treasurers in western governments can only dream of, and will be enough for Beijing\u2019s leadership to convince its people that things are manageable. 2. Is that the full story though? Digging a bit deeper reveals more serious problems for China. According to Roland Rajah of the Lowy Institute thinktank in Sydney there is a \u201cgrain of truth\u201d in what Trump says, although the overall picture is more complex. There are questions about the reliability of China\u2019s official data. The consultancy Capital Economics has devised a proxy measure of the economy that takes into consideration factors such as freight traffic and electricity consumption. Annual car sales in 2018 shrank for the first time in more than 20 years. Capital\u2019s base case is that China\u2019s GDP growth has slowed to around 5.2% and 4.0% by 2021. A \u201chard landing\u201d \u2013 ie some sort of recession, something China has never had in its capitalist era \u2013 cannot be ruled out, Capital says. It sees Chinese growth to slowing to 2% a year by 2030, which would represent a potentially significant impediment to the domestic and international economy. On the other hand, every time China has seen a dip coming since the global financial crisis it has responded with a new round of stimulus. The country has deep pockets thanks to its gigantic foreign reserves of more than $2 trillion and this time is no different. Credit has been loosened through interbank lending rates, billions more yuan have been pumped into the financial system in extra liquidity and it is expected that the central bank will cut regular rates soon. This has seen a sharp rebound in construction activity and a concomitant surge in iron ore prices, bringing another boost to the local economy and trading partners such as Australia that supply China\u2019s raw materials. 3. How long can this stimulus go on? That\u2019s the big problem, and gets us closer to perhaps what Trump was hinting at. China has some enormous structural problems that need to be tackled to avoid serious economic paralysis. The biggest is debt. Despite its accumulation of so many dollars thanks to its export boom, China is one of the most indebted countries in the world. By some metrics total debt \u2013 including corporate, government and household \u2013 is heading towards 300% of GDP. The leadership has been trying to grapple with the debt bubble but is hampered by many factors such as successive crises that require another shot of stimulus. Much of the cash goes towards propping up inefficient state-owned enterprises that are important for maintaining high employment levels but mean that Beijing\u2019s rulers are getting ever-decreasing bang for their buck in terms of any lasting impact on the economy. As an example, a recent report by Citigroup estimated that 21% of homes in China are empty which, in terms of vacant floor space, is 1.68 times greater than all the floor space built in the past five years. Another headache is China\u2019s demographic problem, namely that it is running out workers thanks to the failure of its now-abandoned one-child policy. With growth slowing, China faces a race to avoid the dreaded \u201cmiddle-income trap\u201d where the economy of developing countries stagnates once the low-hanging fruit of industrialisation has been picked but before income has been spread widely enough around the population. China is expanding its technology industry as fast as it can to build-up high-value manufacturing but, as the Huawei standoff shows, the policy is bringing conflict with the west. 4. Are there any signs of trouble? The build-up of credit in the system can be seen by the weakness of many banks, a situation highlighted by the rare state and regulatory takeover of Inner Mongolian-based Baoshang bank in May due to a serious credit risk. In an equally unusual move that points to further trouble in China\u2019s financial system, the giant China Evergrande property group last week bought a 40% stake in a small lender called Shengjing bank. \u201cAs the old saying goes, when you see one cockroach, you will discover a swarm of them,\u201d Liu Haiying, founder of Shanghai-based Haiying Investment and author of the book China\u2019s Huge Debts, told Reuters. \u201cWorryingly, Baoshang Bank is likely that first cockroach.\u201d There are no shortage of financiers calling the top of the China boom. One of the most outspoken is US hedge fund manager Kyle Bass. His says China is facing its worst financial situation for years, giving Trump more leverage than any recent president. 5. Isn\u2019t the US economy in just as poor shape? On paper the trade war looks worse for China. But despite Trump\u2019s love of trumpeting US growth, the Federal Reserve has performed a stunning U-turn in recent months on where it thinks the US economy is heading.

      "bodyText": "For Australian newspapers, Scott Morrison\u2019s official dinner with Donald Trump was worthy of front-page treatment. Reports said the US president had \u201clauded\u201d the closeness of the Australian-US alliance and \u201c\u2018lavished\u201d praise on the prime minister. It was true of course. Trump had said Morrison \u201chad a fantastic victory\u201d. But for the US press corps it was a non-event. In its official briefing note the journalists said: \u201cPool was briefly led into dining room where President Trump was meeting with Australian Prime Minister (Scott) Morrison. There was no news.\u201d \u2018Precious\u2019 ABC stories to disappear The ABC\u2019s biggest collection of digital stories from regional Australians, collated on ABC Open since 2010, will disappear from public view on Friday. The broadcaster sent emails to the 28,000 contributors to the site, saying they should download their content before the end of the month because ABC Open was closed. A decision by ABC management to remove the archive from public view has infuriated former ABC producers who worked on the regional project. They say the decision marks the destruction of a valuable social archive of 193,000 documentary and social history stories in text, photography, audio and video. Suzi Taylor, one of 50 Open producers who worked in regional centres on collaborations with the public, has written to the ABC chair, Ita Buttrose, and asked her to halt the move and find a way to preserve the legacy. \u201cWhile former ABC Open producers knew that ABC Open was set to close, we never expected this would mean that these precious stories would be essentially wiped from the public record,\u201d Taylor wrote to Buttrose. \u201cTo give you an idea of how important and groundbreaking ABC Open projects were, the national series Aftermath has come to be Australia\u2019s biggest collection of regional Australian stories documenting natural disasters and recovery (around 1,600 all up). This project is just one of the many vital national projects from ABC Open.\u201d But the ABC says the site is \u201caged\u201d and simply not functional any more and is largely being used for photography now. All user-generated photography has been moved to Instagram using #abcmyphoto and appears on ABC News online. \u201cThe ABC has identified a number of important and ground-breaking written and video projects that form part of ABC Open,\u201d he said. \u201cA number of these projects, such as Separated, a series on forced adoption, and Mother Tongue, have found new homes on ABC Life and ABC Australia and Indigenous YouTube channels.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Former ABC Radio National producer and documentary maker Gretchen Miller says the ABC owes a debt to the members of the public who told their stories for free. \u201cAnd you also need to honour the fact that these are snapshots in time of the way Australians live \u2013 it is a most remarkable archive and resource for our understanding of who we are and how we live, and what we think,\u201d Miller told Weekly Beast. \u201cSo-called \u2018ordinary Australians\u2019 are shown to be anything but in these projects. And now the ABC is going to make that inaccessible to the public, to historians, to social commentators \u2013 it\u2019s just going to wilfully throw it away? I think it\u2019s shameful, and I\u2019m sorry to have wasted the time of those who put such commitment into the projects I ran. It\u2019s a massive waste of social capital, goodwill and content.\u201d Bolt cutter There is at least one journalist at the Herald Sun who won\u2019t be receiving any extra cash no matter how many readers he converts into paying subscribers, and his name is Andrew Bolt. Bolt is one of the best-read columnists and bloggers in the country and his strong opinions generate a lot of traffic, as well as debate, to the News Corp tabloids. But the editors at the Herald Sun who crafted the bonus cash scheme wanted it to benefit everyday news and sport reporters, not highly paid columnists. There is a cut-off rate of pay beyond which you are ineligible for any of the bonuses. Weekly Beast has learned some of News Corp\u2019s local mastheads, which operate under the banner News Local, also offer staff rewards for encouraging readers to sign up with exclusive stories but the Herald Sun is the first major metropolitan masthead to launch a trial. Well-worn path In the fine tradition of ABC communications heads quitting to work for the government, the ABC\u2019s head of public affairs, Emma McDonald, has resigned to join new communications minister Paul Fletcher as an adviser. Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s former principal private secretary Sally Cray occupied the same job at Aunty between 2011 and 2013 before resigning to rejoin the former member for Wentworth in Canberra. McDonald has been at the broadcaster for just one year but has seen a lot of action in that time, including the sacking of one managing director and the resignation of a chairman shortly after that. McDonald, the daughter of former ABC chairman Donald McDonald, is a former lawyer with extensive experience in the media industry. Last shot Also signing off at Aunty, but after a considerably longer period of time, is legendary ABC Melbourne cameraman Vince Tucci, who retires this week. Tucci joined ABC News in 1978 at the age of 21 and has worked for 7.30 since 1992. 7.30 executive producer Justin Stevens said Tucci had been a great ambassador for the program \u201cin addition to his brilliant camera work and collegiality\u201d. Four Corners reporter Louise Milligan was among the staff to pay tribute to Tucci: \u201cVince Tucci is an utter gentleman and a consummate professional. Nothing is ever too much trouble. He never makes a fuss and just gets on with doing what he does best \u2013 beautiful pictures. Vince always makes the talent feel at ease \u2013 even in situations where we are filming very traumatic interviews.\u201d The business editor, Peter Ryan, said: \u201cOverwhelmingly Vince has nurtured and encouraged a generation of reporters to lift their game, and despite regular temptation he\u2019s made them look better than they are with skilled lighting, framing and the odd bit of hairspray for certain male reporters who used to have a lot of hair.\u201d A love letter to newspapers past The News Corp veteran Terry Sweetman has written his last column for the Courier Mail after an even longer innings of 55 years, 25 of which have seen him writing opinion for the Mail and the Sunday Mail. Sweetman, who has worked across nine mastheads and edited three of them, wrote movingly of the great change in the craft of journalism over the half a century he has had a byline. \u201cThey introduced me to a boozing, brawling, fecund, rambunctious, furiously competitive yet oddly fraternal and tribal world inhabited by saints and sinners and by men and women of enormous talent, courage and principle,\u201d Sweetman wrote in his farewell column. \u201cNow, I find it a more homogenous world, the proud nails hammered flat by the conformity of diplomas and degrees, the spontaneity ground down by modern management theories, and the craziness subdued by the demands of multitasking and the appetite for 24-hour news.\u201d Gleeson\u2019s gleeful Logies campaign It\u2019s not an uncommon view to regard the TV Week Logie awards as \u201cpreposterous\u201d and \u201cabsurd\u201d. But when a nominee for the Logies top gong \u2013 the coveted Gold Logie for most popular TV star \u2013 disparages TV\u2019s night of nights it gets a tad awkward. The comedian Tom Gleeson, himself a Gold Logie nominee this year, has been mercilessly mocking the Logies and his fellow nominees in a series of faux attack ads posted on social media posts and in interviews. Because of the popular vote for Gold, each nominee is expected to campaign for public votes ahead of the live event on Sunday. But now Gleeson\u2019s obviously tongue-in-cheek statements appear to have provoked the 2018 Gold Logie winner, Grant Denyer, and Gold Logie nominee and comedian Amanda Keller. Gleeson and Keller are competing with ABC gardener Costa Georgiadis, actress Eve Morey, Sunrise weather man Sam Mac, actor Rodger Corser and The Project\u2019s Waleed Aly to take out the top prize. \u201cIt\u2019s become a joke this year,\u201d Denyer said on radio. \u201cTwo of the loudest Gold nominees are just effectively taking the piss.\u201d As well as Gleeson, Denyer is referring to Sam Mac who is driving across the country in a Sunrise bus emblazoned with logos like a politician touting for votes. \u201cTom Gleeson is just taking all the headlines,\u201d Denyer said. \u201cI\u2019m worried if he wins, that\u2019s it for the Logies forever.\u201d Surprisingly, Keller has also weighed in. \u201cIt\u2019s hard because Tom is playing a different game, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m finding I\u2019m struggling with to be honest,\u201d Keller told news.com.au. \u201cIt\u2019s always been that the nominees are a happy soup, and I still want us to be a happy soup, there\u2019s no need to make it personal and pick us all off. I know Tom\u2019s playing a comedic game, but really, I\u2019m just happy to be in the soup.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Prime minister Scott Morrison says he\u2019s been unable to obtain any new information about the \u201ctroubling\u201d disappearance of Australian man Alek Sigley in North Korea. Family and friends of Sigley, who has been living and studying in Pyongyang, have not been able to speak to the 29-year-old from Perth since Tuesday, which they say is \u201cunusual\u201d. \u201cHe remains out of digital contact with friends and family, and Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to seek clarification as to his whereabouts and welfare,\u201d the family said in a statement on Friday. Sigley had been studying a master\u2019s degree in Korean literature at Kim Il Sung University and runs a tour company that organises trips for foreign students. Fluent in both Korean and Mandarin, he was an active social media user and his sudden silence has sparked fears about the 29-year-old\u2019s welfare. As Dfat scrambles to understand what may have happened, the former Australian foreign minister Bob Carr told Guardian Australia locating Sigley would require some \u201cdeft diplomacy\u201d. Carr said Australia had to work with \u201cour friends and partners on this case with the objective of getting Alek out of North Korea as soon as possible. \u201cSecondly, we need to send a message to North Korea that we\u2019re very focused on his wellbeing.\u201d On Friday Morrison said he\u2019d been unable to confirm whether Sigley has been detained by the repressive regime. \u201cIt is troubling and concerning to me and I\u2019m sure his family as well,\u201d Morrison told the ABC from the G20 summit in Japan. \u201cThe expressions of support and assistance that have come from other nations I have met with here has been very welcome. \u201cWe will continue to focus sharply on that and seek to clarify what exactly has occurred and then take steps from there.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a statement on Friday Sigley\u2019s family said they had still yet to confirm his whereabouts. \u201cSome media have speculated about the shuttering of Alek\u2019s social media accounts,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThis has been done at the instigation of his family to limit unnecessary speculation and commentary on those channels. \u201cAlek\u2019s family and friends hope to hear from him soon.\u201d While there has been no official confirmation of his disappearance, his wife, Yuka Morinaga, who lives in Tokyo, told the Australian newspaper she was \u201cvery concerned\u201d for her husband\u2019s safety. She said she usually speaks to him on Whatsapp every day but their last contact was on Monday night. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice anything weird,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened.

      "bodyText": "When Rotorua resident Susan Gedye was awoken at 2am by \u201ca lot of shaking and jolting\u201d she thought it was an earthquake. But then she headed downstairs at her suburban home and saw that her kitchen windows had steamed up and a large mud geyser had appeared in her garden. Rotorua is known as a tourist hotspot for good reason. It is home to geothermal mud pools which bubble up and shoot geysers high into the air, giving parts of the town a sulphurous smell. Gedye said when morning dawned on Wednesday, the mud geyser had grown even bigger. \u201cSo that was kind of spectacular but different and a little bit scary,\u201d she told Radio New Zealand. The volcanic activity resulted in a large crater on her front lawn with the thermal pool throwing boiling mud 10m into the air. Authorities also found a sinkhole under Gedye\u2019s kitchen meaning her family, including two children, have been forced to move out. The next day the thermal pool, situated on a bank, had again grown with her double garage next in the firing line. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a matter of time before that will probably end up down the bank,\u201d Gedye said. Power has also been cut off and gas bottles on the property have been removed. Brad Scott, a volcanologist at the GNS national research institute, told media at the site on Friday that he had seen people throwing stones into the mud pool. \u201cThat\u2019s human nature, you put fences up and people will climb over it to have a look. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things we\u2019ve noticed over the years with geothermal features, if there\u2019s a spare stone around someone will pick it up and throw it in,\u201d he said. Peter Brownbridge, a geothermal inspector for the local council, said the pool was produced by heat escaping through a fault line which crossed under the town. Gedye said that steam had erupted from the same bank about four times over the past 20 years. \u201cBut it was just steam that would come out of the bank and it would last for a few days or week or something and then just stop. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing, it could stop in a minute, tomorrow or it could last two weeks, but the longer it carries on the worse the damage gets.
