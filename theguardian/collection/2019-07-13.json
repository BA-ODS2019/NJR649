Sorry, we need to cling to that surplus to prevent future generations picking up the tab \u2013 those same future generations whose ability to access public services will now be much less due to the reduction of the tax base.</p> <p>But when you have a political and media system that cares more about a budget surplus now than the provision of public education and health in 10 years time, you end up with our current situation.</p> <ul> <li><p>Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia</p></li> </ul>",

It is appropriate to be thinking about further investments in this area, especially with interest rates at a record low, the economy having spare capacity and some of our existing infrastructure struggling to cope with ongoing population growth.\u201d He doesn\u2019t need to say that if he already believes the government\u2019s current infrastructure plans are sufficient. The surplus fetish, in my mind, is without doubt the biggest failure of Australian macroeconomic policy of the past quarter of a century. A budget surplus tells us absolutely nothing about how well the government is handling the economy. It tells us nothing about wages growth or household living standards, or the provision of government services or the situation of those trying to find work or who are disabled. It measures nothing of importance but it allows the government to wheel out spin, such as Frydenberg\u2019s line in an interview on Sky News this week that \u201cwe believe that future generations should not be picking up the tab for the last, and that means we need to be fiscally responsible.\u201d This from a man who has just presided over tax cuts that are being paid for by dreams of economic sunshine and rainbows for the next decade. When it comes to tax cuts that benefit the wealthy, who cares about paying the bill? But when it comes to assisting the economy to ensure (as Phillip Lowe noted) the benefits of stimulus are more \u201cevenly distributed across the community\u201d? Sorry, we need to cling to that surplus to prevent future generations picking up the tab \u2013 those same future generations whose ability to access public services will now be much less due to the reduction of the tax base. But when you have a political and media system that cares more about a budget surplus now than the provision of public education and health in 10 years time, you end up with our current situation.

      "body": "<h2>Arsenal</h2> <p><strong>What </strong><strong>have they done so far? </strong>Nowhere near enough. Teenage striker Gabriel Martinelli has arrived from regional football in Brazil and is expected to need some adaptation and development time. David Ospina has departed for a modest fee.</p> <p><strong>What do they still need to do?</strong> Lots. They are chasing width, defensive reinforcements and a box-to-box midfielder but so far negotiations are proving troublesome. Equally key is the need to shift unwanted players \u2013 also troublesome.</p> <p><strong>Budget this summer </strong>\u00a340m. <strong>Amy Lawrence</strong></p> <h2>Aston Villa</h2> <p><strong>What </strong><strong>have they done so far? </strong>Been busier than anyone and will soon have spent the best part of \u00a3100m. Seven players and counting have signed, reflecting the desire to strengthen a squad that has just won promotion but also fill the many gaps left after a clear-out at the end of last season. Jota, Anwar El Ghazi, Kortney Hause, Matt Targett, Ezri Konsa, Tyrone Mings and Wesley are the new arrivals \u2026 so far.</p> <p><strong>What do they still need to do?</strong> Douglas Luiz is poised to join from Manchester City and Bj\u00f6rn Engels, the Reims defender, could well follow.</p> <p><strong>Budget this summer</strong> Approximately \u00a3100m. <strong>Stuart James</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2019/jul/11/aston-villa-mistakes-fulham-summer-transfer-window-signings\">Are Aston Villa repeating mistakes Fulham made last summer? Not at all</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Bournemouth</h2> <p><strong>What </strong><strong>have they done so far? </strong>Eddie Howe has freshened up his back line by again dipping into the Football League to sign the young and versatile defenders Lloyd Kelly, 20, and Jack Stacey, 23, who will compete for the left-back and right-back berths respectively. Fringe players Tyrone Mings, Emerson Hyndman and Connor Mahoney have departed.</p> <p><strong>What do they still need to do? </strong>The key will be holding on to their indispensables: Callum Wilson, Ryan Fraser and Nathan Ak\u00e9. The No 1 shirt remains fairly open; Jack Butland is among the goalkeepers of interest while Artur Boruc has signed a new contract to take him beyond his 40th birthday.</p> <p><strong>Budget</strong> \u00a320m. <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <h2>Brighton</h2> <p><strong>What have they done so far?</strong> Another summer, another club-record fee, with Leandro Trossard an \u00a318m arrival from Genk. Brighton hope the Belgian winger, who scored 17 goals in all competitions last season, will provide further firepower. They have also bolstered their defence with the signing of the talented 22-year-old centre-back Matt Clarke, who was a big hit at Portsmouth.</p> <p><strong>What do they still need to do?</strong> With Bruno retiring, links to a loan move for the Chelsea defender Reece James make sense. Keeping Lewis Dunk will be crucial, especially if Graham Potter plans to, as expected, play with a three-man defence. The highly rated Ben White has joined Leeds on loan.</p> <p><strong>Budget </strong>\u00a320m. <strong>BF</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6b3d6b621b94be583f7efe75326a73912857fc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6b3d6b621b94be583f7efe75326a73912857fc7/0_213_4248_2548/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lloyd Kelly has been recruited from Bristol City as Bournemouth continue to shop around in the Championship.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lloyd Kelly has been recruited from Bristol City as Bournemouth continue to shop around in the Championship.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin Jones/AFC Bournemouth via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Burnley</h2> <p><strong>What </strong><strong>have they done so far? </strong>More than this time last year. They have brought Jay Rodriguez home from West Bromwich Albion and signed Erik Pieters from Stoke as cover for Charlie Taylor following the departure of left-back Stephen Ward. Peter Crouch and Jon Walters have both been released.</p> <p><strong>What do they still need to do?</strong> Not too much unless Aston Villa succeed in buying goalkeeper Tom Heaton or big offers come in for the teenage winger Dwight McNeil. Sean Dyche is reasonably happy with the balance of his squad.</p> <p><strong>Budget this summer </strong>Without sales, up to \u00a320m. <strong>Paul Wilson</strong></p> <h2>Chelsea</h2> <p><strong>What </strong><strong>have they done so far? </strong>Their only \u2018new\u2019 incoming business was Mateo Kovacic\u2019s move from Real Madrid, given Christian Pulisic joined back in January, but they have secured Ruben Loftus-Cheek to new terms. Significantly, though, they have sold Eden Hazard as well as some fringe players and agreed a deal that will take \u00c1lvaro Morata to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid permanently at the end of the season.</p> <p><strong>What do they still need to do?</strong> They cannot make any further signings given their transfer ban but assessments will be made on which players will depart on loan.</p> <p><strong>Budget this summer</strong> Not really applicable. <strong>Dominic Fifield</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/jun/04/football-transfer-window-2019-every-summer-deal-from-europe-top-five-leagues\">Transfer window 2019 \u2013 every summer deal from Europe's top five leagues</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Crystal Palace</h2> <p><strong>What </strong><strong>have they done so far? </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/29/manchester-united-complete-45m-signing-of-aaron-wan-bissaka\" title=\"\">Sold Aaron Wan-Bissaka to Manchester United</a> for around \u00a345m, parted with a few experienced squad players under freedom of contract (Jason Puncheon, Juli\u00e1n Speroni and Bakary Sako) and recruited Stephen Henderson from Nottingham Forest as third-choice goalkeeper.</p> <p><strong>What do they still need to do? </strong>Deflect Arsenal\u2019s interest and somehow appease Wilfried Zaha to stay, and secure Luka Milivojevic to new terms. Jordan Ayew is close to signing permanently from Swansea, but the club will still strive to secure a new right-back, striker and a creative forward. They will need many more if Zaha does leave.</p> <p><strong>Budget this summer</strong> The money raised through Wan-Bissaka\u2019s sale, and the leeway granted to the wage bill by the flurry of quieter departures. <strong>DF</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/jun/04/football-transfer-window-2019-every-summer-deal-from-europe-top-five-leagues\">Transfer window 2019 \u2013 every summer deal from Europe's top five leagues</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Everton</h2> <p><strong>What </strong><strong>have they done so far? </strong>Turning Andr\u00e9 Gomes\u2019 loan spell into a permanent stay was a priority for Marco Silva and achieved with minimum fuss for a reasonable fee. Jonas L\u00f6ssl has also arrived on a free from relegated Huddersfield as backup to first-choice goalkeeper, Jordan Pickford.</p> <p><strong>What do they still need to do? </strong>Turn Kurt Zouma\u2019s loan spell into a permanent stay or, if Chelsea refuse to sell, secure another central defender. \u201cAfter that position we have three or four more [areas] to strengthen,\u201d said the Everton manager at the weekend. A message to the board if ever there was one.</p> <p><strong>Budget this summer </strong>Not as substantial as previous summers and there is a need to reduce the wage bill. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca40bc961be83e7bd831094170f72e9727976e79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca40bc961be83e7bd831094170f72e9727976e79/142_203_4937_2962/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ayoz\u00e9 Perez has joined Leicester City in a \u00a330m move from Newcastle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ayoz\u00e9 Perez has joined Leicester City in a \u00a330m move from Newcastle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Leicester</h2> <p><strong>What </strong><strong>have they done so far? </strong>Some impressive business, most notably the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/08/youri-tielemans-joining-leicester-club-record-fee\" title=\"\">club-record signing of Youri Tielemans</a> from Monaco for a fee of around \u00a340m. Tielemans, who was superb on loan last season, appears to be a real coup for Leicester. They have also signed Ayoze P\u00e9rez from Newcastle for \u00a330m to add more goals to the team and paid Luton \u00a36m for James Justin, a highly rated 21-year-old right-back.</p> <p><strong>What do they still need to do? </strong>Hold on to Harry Maguire, which will be easier said than done, and find homes for a number of out-of-favour, highly paid fringe players.

      "bodyText": "Arsenal What have they done so far? Nowhere near enough. Teenage striker Gabriel Martinelli has arrived from regional football in Brazil and is expected to need some adaptation and development time. David Ospina has departed for a modest fee. What do they still need to do? Lots. They are chasing width, defensive reinforcements and a box-to-box midfielder but so far negotiations are proving troublesome. Equally key is the need to shift unwanted players \u2013 also troublesome. Budget this summer \u00a340m. Amy Lawrence Aston Villa What have they done so far? Been busier than anyone and will soon have spent the best part of \u00a3100m. Seven players and counting have signed, reflecting the desire to strengthen a squad that has just won promotion but also fill the many gaps left after a clear-out at the end of last season. Jota, Anwar El Ghazi, Kortney Hause, Matt Targett, Ezri Konsa, Tyrone Mings and Wesley are the new arrivals \u2026 so far. What do they still need to do? Douglas Luiz is poised to join from Manchester City and Bj\u00f6rn Engels, the Reims defender, could well follow. Budget this summer Approximately \u00a3100m. Stuart James Bournemouth What have they done so far? Eddie Howe has freshened up his back line by again dipping into the Football League to sign the young and versatile defenders Lloyd Kelly, 20, and Jack Stacey, 23, who will compete for the left-back and right-back berths respectively. Fringe players Tyrone Mings, Emerson Hyndman and Connor Mahoney have departed. What do they still need to do? The key will be holding on to their indispensables: Callum Wilson, Ryan Fraser and Nathan Ak\u00e9. The No 1 shirt remains fairly open; Jack Butland is among the goalkeepers of interest while Artur Boruc has signed a new contract to take him beyond his 40th birthday. Budget \u00a320m. Ben Fisher Brighton What have they done so far? Another summer, another club-record fee, with Leandro Trossard an \u00a318m arrival from Genk. Brighton hope the Belgian winger, who scored 17 goals in all competitions last season, will provide further firepower. They have also bolstered their defence with the signing of the talented 22-year-old centre-back Matt Clarke, who was a big hit at Portsmouth. What do they still need to do? With Bruno retiring, links to a loan move for the Chelsea defender Reece James make sense. Keeping Lewis Dunk will be crucial, especially if Graham Potter plans to, as expected, play with a three-man defence. The highly rated Ben White has joined Leeds on loan. Budget \u00a320m. BF Burnley What have they done so far? More than this time last year. They have brought Jay Rodriguez home from West Bromwich Albion and signed Erik Pieters from Stoke as cover for Charlie Taylor following the departure of left-back Stephen Ward. Peter Crouch and Jon Walters have both been released. What do they still need to do? Not too much unless Aston Villa succeed in buying goalkeeper Tom Heaton or big offers come in for the teenage winger Dwight McNeil. Sean Dyche is reasonably happy with the balance of his squad. Budget this summer Without sales, up to \u00a320m. Paul Wilson Chelsea What have they done so far? Their only \u2018new\u2019 incoming business was Mateo Kovacic\u2019s move from Real Madrid, given Christian Pulisic joined back in January, but they have secured Ruben Loftus-Cheek to new terms. Significantly, though, they have sold Eden Hazard as well as some fringe players and agreed a deal that will take \u00c1lvaro Morata to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid permanently at the end of the season. What do they still need to do? They cannot make any further signings given their transfer ban but assessments will be made on which players will depart on loan. Budget this summer Not really applicable. Dominic Fifield Crystal Palace What have they done so far? Sold Aaron Wan-Bissaka to Manchester United for around \u00a345m, parted with a few experienced squad players under freedom of contract (Jason Puncheon, Juli\u00e1n Speroni and Bakary Sako) and recruited Stephen Henderson from Nottingham Forest as third-choice goalkeeper. What do they still need to do? Deflect Arsenal\u2019s interest and somehow appease Wilfried Zaha to stay, and secure Luka Milivojevic to new terms. Jordan Ayew is close to signing permanently from Swansea, but the club will still strive to secure a new right-back, striker and a creative forward. They will need many more if Zaha does leave. Budget this summer The money raised through Wan-Bissaka\u2019s sale, and the leeway granted to the wage bill by the flurry of quieter departures. DF Everton What have they done so far? Turning Andr\u00e9 Gomes\u2019 loan spell into a permanent stay was a priority for Marco Silva and achieved with minimum fuss for a reasonable fee. Jonas L\u00f6ssl has also arrived on a free from relegated Huddersfield as backup to first-choice goalkeeper, Jordan Pickford. What do they still need to do? Turn Kurt Zouma\u2019s loan spell into a permanent stay or, if Chelsea refuse to sell, secure another central defender. \u201cAfter that position we have three or four more [areas] to strengthen,\u201d said the Everton manager at the weekend. A message to the board if ever there was one. Budget this summer Not as substantial as previous summers and there is a need to reduce the wage bill. Andy Hunter Leicester What have they done so far? Some impressive business, most notably the club-record signing of Youri Tielemans from Monaco for a fee of around \u00a340m. Tielemans, who was superb on loan last season, appears to be a real coup for Leicester. They have also signed Ayoze P\u00e9rez from Newcastle for \u00a330m to add more goals to the team and paid Luton \u00a36m for James Justin, a highly rated 21-year-old right-back. What do they still need to do? Hold on to Harry Maguire, which will be easier said than done, and find homes for a number of out-of-favour, highly paid fringe players. Adding another midfielder is also a possibility. Budget this summer Approximately \u00a3100m. SJ Liverpool What have they done so far? Very little from a position of strength as European champions. Liverpool invested heavily last year \u2013 on new faces and new contracts for existing stars \u2013 and have so far concentrated on young talent such as 17-year-old defender Sepp van den Berg and 16-year-old Harvey Elliott. What do they still need to do? There are no glaring weaknesses to address in a team that gathered 97 points plus the Champions League last season although defensive cover is required, especially if Dejan Lovren departs. Budget this summer Last year\u2019s world record profit was reinvested in J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s squad plus the new \u00a350m training complex under construction in Kirkby, but the manager will be backed if his first-choice targets become available. AH Manchester City What have they done so far? Triggered Rodri\u2019s \u20ac65m release clause to take the 23-year-old defensive midfielder from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Decided Leicester City\u2019s \u00a375m-plus valuation of Harry Maguire is too much (for the moment). What do they still need to do? Resolve the Maguire/centre-back situation following Vincent Kompany\u2019s departure. Budget \u00a3150m. Jamie Jackson Manchester United What have they done so far? Began promisingly with the signing of two 21-year-olds: pacey winger, Daniel James, who cost \u00a315m from Swansea City; and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, a swift right-back for \u00a345m from Crystal Palace. What do they still need to do? Buy a centre-back \u2013 Harry Maguire is the prime target \u2013 and solve the Paul Pogba headache: there is less than four weeks left of the window so, if he is to leave, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r needs to find a replacement quickly. The same equation is true of the wantaway striker Romelu Lukaku. Budget \u00a3100m plus funds generated from any player sales. JJ Newcastle What have they done so far? Precisely nothing on the incoming front, having been without a manager since the departure of Rafa Ben\u00edtez. New signings are said to be in the pipeline once the vacancy has been filled and straightaway the new manager must set to work replacing goalscorers Ayoze P\u00e9rez and Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n and out-of-contract midfielder Mohamed Diam\u00e9. What do they still need to do? Find out how much money is available for strengthening. The \u00a330m raised from the sale of P\u00e9rez could double if Sean Longstaff joins Manchester United, but that does not mean the new manager will be granted a war-chest and free rein. Budget Possibly \u00a330m. Even Mike Ashley must realise players need to be replaced. PW Norwich What have they done so far? An understudy for Teemu Pukki has arrived in the shape of Swiss forward Josep Drmic. There is also competition for Tim Krul in goal with the signing of long-standing Schalke No 1 Ralf F\u00e4hrmann. Norwich have also taken Manchester City\u2019s Patrick Roberts on loan, the winger having previously starred for Celtic What do they still need to do? Top targets are a first-choice defensive midfielder, and cover for youngster Max Aarons at right-back. But there remains expectation that another forward may yet be acquired and Hull\u2019s Jarrod Bowen and M\u00e1laga\u2019s Javier Ontiveros have been linked. Budget this summer \u00a335m. Paul MacInnes Sheffield United What have they done so far? Luke Freeman arrived from QPR for a club-record fee in excess of \u00a34m and then the Blades broke their transfer record again for the Preston forward Callum Robinson. Phil Jagielka has returned on a free, 12 years after he departed the club for Everton. Ravel Morrison has been on trial. What do they still need to do? More firepower remains key with Brentford\u2019s Neal Maupay and Swansea\u2019s Ollie McBurnie the top targets \u2013 both would cost in excess of \u00a310m. Goalkeeper Dean Henderson is set to return on loan from Manchester United and further midfield options are needed, with Nottingham Forest\u2019s Ben Osborn and Coventry\u2019s Tom Bayliss on the radar. Budget Not huge. Chris Wilder will probably have to break the club\u2019s transfer record again over the summer but he will be shopping in League One and the Championship. John Ashdown Southampton What have they done so far? They have made the loan of Danny Ings from Liverpool permanent and added Che Adams and Moussa Djenepo \u2013 two attacking players that fit the Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl prototype, being young, fast, intelligent and comfortable with a high-pressing style. They have recouped \u00a314m by selling Matt Targett to Aston Villa. What do they still need to do? Hasenh\u00fcttl is likely to add a couple more but he could be more active with outgoing business. The club will listen to offers for Fraser Forster, Wesley Hoedt, Jordy Clasie (who will return to Holland), Mario Lemina, Sofiane Boufal, Charlie Austin and Guido Carrillo. Budget The club\u2019s Chinese owners oversaw a profit on transfers from their first three windows. Balanced books are their rationale. David Hytner Tottenham What have they done so far? They have made a good start, signing Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s No 1 target \u2013 the midfielder Tanguy Ndombele \u2013 for a club-record \u00a355m and also adding the winger Jack Clarke, although he has been loaned back to Leeds. What do they still need to do? Pochettino wants to add the Fulham left-sided player, Ryan Sessegnon and, ideally, an attack-minded midfielder but much will now depend on generating funds, meaning that the situation of the wantaway midfielder, Christian Eriksen, is pivotal. While Eriksen is in limbo, so are Spurs. Budget See above. They have already more than spent it. They could raise further funds by selling Toby Alderweireld and/or Kieran Trippier. DH Watford What have they done so far? The only senior signings are the 38-year-old goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes, not exactly a new face but certainly a popular one, who was convinced to postpone his retirement for a year, and the 29-year-old centre-back Craig Dawson, who arrived from West Brom for a fee of about \u00a35m. There have also been a handful additions to the development squad, including the former Arsenal defender Bayli Spencer-Adams and the 19-year-old Leeds striker Sam Dalby. What do they still need to do? The priorities at the start of the window were to augment central defence and to add pace and width in attack. Further defensive signings are possible but the focus of late has been on Isma\u00efla Sarr, the 21-year-old Rennes winger. Sarr is reportedly willing to join, though a fee has yet to be agreed with his club and the player\u2019s participation with Senegal at the Africa Cup of Nations has complicated the transfer. Budget \u00a340m Simon Burnton West Ham What have they done so far? Pablo Fornals was an exciting addition \u2013 the attacking midfielder joined for \u00a324m from Villarreal and helped Spain win the Under-21 European Championships last month \u2013 but all was quiet until Marko Arnautovic kicked up another stink and forced a move to Shanghai SIPG. What they need to do? Sign a striker. The sale of Arnautovic leaves a gaping hole up front and there is growing anxiety after Maxi G\u00f3mez snubbed them to join Valencia.

As the race drops down to the finish in \u00c9pernay, and Julian Alaphilippe takes a thrilling win, the press buffet flows freely with fizz. Mindful of my professional responsibilities, I abstain until copy has been filed, which leads to a standard French experience as I stride up to the now deserted bar, licking my lips. \u201c<em>D\u00e9sol\u00e9e, monsieur</em>,\u201d the sommelier says coldly. \u201c<em>C\u2019est ferm\u00e9 </em>\u2026\u201d</p> <h2>Tuesday: Reims to Nancy</h2> <p>Not for the first time, Dave Brailsford is putting a positive spin on things. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t five seconds,\u201d he says of Geraint Thomas\u2019s time loss the day before to his Ineos teammate Egan Bernal. \u201cIt was just a small little gap.\u201d It\u2019s pointed out to him that in fact it does say five seconds in the Tour\u2019s standings. \u201cIt\u2019s just 30 metres,\u201d he insists. After more than a century of racing, Brailsford has created a new parameter of Tour time continuum, of success and failure, of distance over time.</p> <h2>Wednesday: St-Di\u00e9 to Colmar</h2> <p>The first day in the Vosges fails to produce any major surprises, as Peter Sagan takes his first stage win of the 2019 Tour, a victory he describes as exquisite. That\u2019s more than can be said for tonight\u2019s accommodation, deep in <em>La France Profonde</em>, in a cavernous old-school auberge with far too much blood red to its interior.

      "bodyText": "Sunday: Brussels Team time trial day is usually more a test of management, organisation and logistics than brute strength. True to form, Ineos are very much on it, on and off the road, while Romain Bardet\u2019s AG2R team ride like they\u2019ve just stumbled out into the afternoon sunshine after a long and boozy Sunday lunch. Instead of Bardet, the French turn their attentions to a resurgent Thibaut Pinot as their big hope, despite his getting lost in some dodgy Brussels backstreets shortly before the stage start. Monday: Binche to \u00c9pernay The Tour leaves Belgium behind for champagne country. As the race drops down to the finish in \u00c9pernay, and Julian Alaphilippe takes a thrilling win, the press buffet flows freely with fizz. Mindful of my professional responsibilities, I abstain until copy has been filed, which leads to a standard French experience as I stride up to the now deserted bar, licking my lips. \u201cD\u00e9sol\u00e9e, monsieur,\u201d the sommelier says coldly. \u201cC\u2019est ferm\u00e9 \u2026\u201d Tuesday: Reims to Nancy Not for the first time, Dave Brailsford is putting a positive spin on things. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t five seconds,\u201d he says of Geraint Thomas\u2019s time loss the day before to his Ineos teammate Egan Bernal. \u201cIt was just a small little gap.\u201d It\u2019s pointed out to him that in fact it does say five seconds in the Tour\u2019s standings. \u201cIt\u2019s just 30 metres,\u201d he insists. After more than a century of racing, Brailsford has created a new parameter of Tour time continuum, of success and failure, of distance over time. Wednesday: St-Di\u00e9 to Colmar The first day in the Vosges fails to produce any major surprises, as Peter Sagan takes his first stage win of the 2019 Tour, a victory he describes as exquisite. That\u2019s more than can be said for tonight\u2019s accommodation, deep in La France Profonde, in a cavernous old-school auberge with far too much blood red to its interior. We eat in a dining room that looks like a set from The Shining and are waited on by a character from Blue Velvet. Thursday: Mulhouse to La Planche The Tour\u2019s first summit stage and every pundit tips Thomas to lose time and Bernal to move further ahead. On the brutal gravelly finish to the \u201cBench of the Beautiful Girls\u201d, the reverse happens and the defending champion makes his point with a powerful acceleration. Bardet meanwhile, loses more time and crosses the line distraught and humiliated. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed,\u201d he says, but the French shrug and move on to Pinot, now the coming man. Friday: Belfort to Chalon The longest day is often the most soporific and that adage holds true as the peloton plods through the 230km trawl through the Doubs and Jura from Belfort to Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne. Dylan Groenewegen\u2019s win proves the highlight of a humdrum day while Tejay van Garderen\u2019s tangle with some road furniture means he rides almost the whole battered, bloodied and broken before he is forced to abandon the Tour. Saturday: M\u00e2con to St-\u00c9tienne You don\u2019t need to have towering climbs to exhaust the peloton as today\u2019s unrelenting ups and downs leading from the Rhone valley into the Massif Central prove.

I cannot believe that is happening to our country.\u201d</p> <p>Campbell, who rose to prominence as former UK prime minister Tony Blair\u2019s chief spin doctor, and is commonly thought of as the basis of Malcolm Tucker in The Thick Of It <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/9049658/Peter-Capaldi-Thick-Of-It-spin-doctor-Malcolm-Tucker-was-not-based-on-Alastair-Campbell.html\">(although this is contested by Peter Capaldi</a>) \u2013 has remained as outspoken on UK politics as you would expect of someone with his all-seeing reputation.</p> <p>He has watched as Brexit has torn apart not just the conservative government but the country at large, and his own side of politics.</p> <p>But on that, he doesn\u2019t just blame the Tories.</p> <p>\u201cI think democratic politics is going through a very, very challenging period,\u201d he says of the western world at large. \u201cI think there are all sort of factors.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At the last election, Theresa May fought the worst campaign ever. It was truly awful.</p> <footer> <cite>Alastair Campbell</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think if I look at one big factor, for me, [it] is the crash, it is a consequence of the global financial crisis playing out, and the feeling that lots and lots of people around the world had nothing to do with it, didn\u2019t cause it and they paid a price, and the people that did cause it didn\u2019t pay much of a price at all.</p> <p>\u201cSo that is one factor. The other factor, and I guess Trump is the sort of apotheosis [of this], and Brexit is part of this as well, is the sense of polarisation that isn\u2019t just about left and right, it is also about cultural attitudes.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I think the media changes, not just social media, but the mainstream media has been part of this as well, with the 24/7 news and the way that has changed the nature of news. I think newspapers \u2013 not least the influence of Murdoch and others \u2013 I think that absolute politicisation, and polarisation of the news media debate, has been exploited and exasperated by populism.\u201d</p> <p>Campbell won\u2019t just be in Australia to escape the expected coming of Boris Johnson. <a href=\"https://www.orygen.org.au/\">He was invited to speak at events hosted by Orygen and the University of New South Wales Centre for Ideas on the politics of mental health</a>.</p> <p>That\u2019s another topic Campbell is intimately across. In 1986, he had a breakdown, which in 2008 he openly spoke about both in a BBC2 documentary, Depression and Me, and a book, All in the Mind. </p> <p>He thinks more people should speak up about their own struggles, if only to help rid mental illness of the stigmas that still allow it to go unspoken or be cut from budgets. Even those in the political classes.</p> <p>\u201cI think you could argue that politics at the top level is something of a laboratory for mental health pressures \u2013 that doesn\u2019t mean, by the way, that that is necessarily all bad,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the arguments I\u2019ll make when I come to Australia and I do these speeches about mental health is when you are talking about top-level pressure and top-level performance, whether that is in politics, in sport, in theatre, in business or whatever, then that sense of \u2018living on the edge\u2019 feeling of knowing how to handle really intense pressure \u2013 sometimes the people who have had experience of real psychological turmoil sometimes can cope with that better.\u201d</p> <p>History has been defined by agenda setters who did great things, Campbell says, while simultaneously battling their own minds. Winston Churchill and his Black Dog. Charles Darwin and his agoraphobia. Florence Nightingale and her depression. Friends and family who keep going, despite life-long illnesses, such as Campbell\u2019s own schizophrenic brother.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I think this mental health debate needs is a government in one part of the world that actually doesn\u2019t just say \u2018this is a priority\u2019 but then really delivers on it, right across the sphere, so we have better mental health support in schools, we have better mental health support in [universities], we have better mental health services for children and adolescents, we have better acute care right across the piece,\u201d he says, citing the Irish government\u2019s decision to ban smoking in workplaces as sparking a worldwide wave of change.</p> <p>\u201cI think if you did that, over time, over a generation, you\u2019d actually see that the healthcare system as a whole, I think, would end up saving money.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c6415afac7503de19ec6298e8ff00c828ecef9c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6415afac7503de19ec6298e8ff00c828ecef9c0/0_62_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alastair Campbell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alastair Campbell: \u2018Brexit is tearing the country apart, the government is doing nothing else, the Tories are about to elect a complete charlatan.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Cracknell Wright/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf we actually start to educate our kids about their mental health and wellbeing, including in schools, and also have a review of the criminal justice system \u2013 and this probably seems too Guardianista for a lot of people \u2013 but anybody who\u2019s ever been inside a prison knows you do not have to go far before you meet somebody and you go \u2018that person is ill, that person is sick, that person needs help\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Yet a failure to holistically deal with mental health issues has not been the only failure of governments.

With what consequences?</p> <p>\u201cWhat populism does \u2013 populism is not just about popularity and saying what people want to hear, it is also about having a date that if you like has nothing to do with fact or proper rigorous analysis and everything to do with emotion.</p> <p>\u201cAnd ultimately, that is unsustainable.\u201d</p> <p>But Campbell is unsure of whether the answer is a Bernie Sanders, or a Jeremy Corbyn, or even an Anthony Albanese \u2013 at least as he is described by his conservative opponents, who are trying to paint him as the Australian Corbyn.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I just wonder if they just decided \u2018we are not electing Bill Shorten\u2019.</p> <footer> <cite>Alastair campbell</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you combat the populism of the right with a populism of the left,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I fear is too many people on what you would say is the progressive side of politics, I think, have learned the wrong lessons about the [global financial] crash. I think there is a feeling that, as a consequence of the crash, the world, the public, moved to the left. And I am not persuaded that is the case. And if you look at what is happening in elections around the world, the opposite would appear to be the case.\u201d</p> <p>Launching that cultural war \u201crisks losing those people you need to win [elections]\u201d, Campbell says.</p> <p>\u201cAt the last election, Theresa May fought the worst campaign ever,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was truly awful. You look at where we are now \u2013 Brexit is tearing the country apart, the government is doing nothing else, the Tories are about to elect a complete charlatan as prime minister, and Labour \u2013 there was one poll recently which had Labour at 18%.</p> <p>\u201cNow that is not a media conspiracy, and it is not just because of Brexit. It is because they think progressive means keep moving to the left. It doesn\u2019t. Progressive means \u2018How do you make progressive change for the better by having a set of policies and values which are located where most people live their lives?\u201d</p> <p>Applying that same train of thought to the recent Australian election, Campbell says, from where he sits, he thinks yet another factor may have come into play \u2013 one which could also dictate the coming UK general election.</p> <p>\u201cI wondered about your election, because I follow it from afar, but I just wonder if maybe what happens \u2013 at a deeper level sometimes \u2013 a country sometimes makes a judgment about people over time, and I just wonder if they just decided \u2018we are not electing Bill Shorten\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think there is a risk they have done that with Jeremy Corbyn already.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Alastair Campbell will be speaking at The Politics of Mental Health in Sydney on Monday 22 July and in Melbourne on Tuesday 23 July.

I think there is a feeling that, as a consequence of the crash, the world, the public, moved to the left. And I am not persuaded that is the case. And if you look at what is happening in elections around the world, the opposite would appear to be the case.\u201d Launching that cultural war \u201crisks losing those people you need to win [elections]\u201d, Campbell says. \u201cAt the last election, Theresa May fought the worst campaign ever,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was truly awful. You look at where we are now \u2013 Brexit is tearing the country apart, the government is doing nothing else, the Tories are about to elect a complete charlatan as prime minister, and Labour \u2013 there was one poll recently which had Labour at 18%. \u201cNow that is not a media conspiracy, and it is not just because of Brexit. It is because they think progressive means keep moving to the left. It doesn\u2019t. Progressive means \u2018How do you make progressive change for the better by having a set of policies and values which are located where most people live their lives?\u201d Applying that same train of thought to the recent Australian election, Campbell says, from where he sits, he thinks yet another factor may have come into play \u2013 one which could also dictate the coming UK general election. \u201cI wondered about your election, because I follow it from afar, but I just wonder if maybe what happens \u2013 at a deeper level sometimes \u2013 a country sometimes makes a judgment about people over time, and I just wonder if they just decided \u2018we are not electing Bill Shorten\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think there is a risk they have done that with Jeremy Corbyn already.\u201d \u2022 Alastair Campbell will be speaking at The Politics of Mental Health in Sydney on Monday 22 July and in Melbourne on Tuesday 23 July.

His two most recent shows, Bunker (2016) and Relax: Everything\u2019s Fucked (2017), had similarly nihilistic themes, but the concept of AutoCannibal came to him in the midst of grief over the death of a close friend. In its bleakness, this play allows us to explore a world deprived of all its richness.</p> <p>Jones\u2019 character is the AutoCannibal himself \u2013 an otherwise nameless former news anchor, and now seemingly the last man standing. His psyche is on a pendulum swing between survival and self-harm. He\u2019s periodically tempted by the saws and knives that descend from the sky, tormenting him with ideas of self-harm and self-feeding.

Fittingly, the preview of the show fell the day after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/10/david-attenborough-says-its-extraordinary-climate-deniers-are-in-power-in-australia\">David Attenborough told a British parliamentary committee</a> that Australia was an \u201cextraordinary\u201d example of a country where people in power remained climate-change deniers despite facing some of the worst effects of global heating. How apt that the AutoCannibal is a former news reader: that neutral mouthpiece of bad tidings.</p> <p>As there are no natural resources left, the AutoCannibal harvests plastic bags. Once the disposable symbols of over-consumerism, they\u2019re now saved and put to every kind of use; even sexual gratification.</p> <p>At one point, he toys with suicide by pulling a bag over his head and hyperventilating, before stuffing the whole thing into his mouth. In a grimly entertaining scene, he sits at a mock desk and reads a news bulletin, his words choked and muffled. At another moment, he play-acts what it is to be human, as if trying to remember, gurning his way through expressions of stupidity, selfishness, ignorance and refusal to listen \u2013 all the qualities that got humankind to this point in time. There\u2019s an endearing way to Jones\u2019 cartoonish physicality, echoing the pathos of Charlie Chaplin\u2019s Little Tramp and the frustrated desires of Tom &amp; Jerry\u2019s Tom Cat, and he\u2019s often met with uncontrollable laughter from the peanut gallery.</p> <p>After cutting his teeth with Circus Oz, Jones forged his style by performing in fetish clubs, where self-harm is part of the BDSM tool kit, and has previously staple-gunned himself and pierced his face with hooks. At the end of the hour tonight, he\u2019s covered in sweat and looking exhausted.</p> <p>In an outrageous case of publicity clickbait \u2013 or, at best, a disingenuous conflation of the actor with the character \u2013 it had been promised that \u201cMitch Jones chops himself up, cooks himself, and then eats himself on stage\u201d. This is untrue \u2013 but it\u2019s probably not accurate to say that no Joneses were harmed during the making of this play.</p> <p><em>\u2022 AutoCannibal is on at TheatreWorks until 21 July</em></p>",

His two most recent shows, Bunker (2016) and Relax: Everything\u2019s Fucked (2017), had similarly nihilistic themes, but the concept of AutoCannibal came to him in the midst of grief over the death of a close friend. In its bleakness, this play allows us to explore a world deprived of all its richness. Jones\u2019 character is the AutoCannibal himself \u2013 an otherwise nameless former news anchor, and now seemingly the last man standing. His psyche is on a pendulum swing between survival and self-harm. He\u2019s periodically tempted by the saws and knives that descend from the sky, tormenting him with ideas of self-harm and self-feeding. The set itself is made of scaffolding \u2013 which Jones navigates with acrobatic prowess \u2013 as if only the bones of buildings are left. Self-harm, here, becomes a metaphor for environmental destruction. Fittingly, the preview of the show fell the day after David Attenborough told a British parliamentary committee that Australia was an \u201cextraordinary\u201d example of a country where people in power remained climate-change deniers despite facing some of the worst effects of global heating. How apt that the AutoCannibal is a former news reader: that neutral mouthpiece of bad tidings. As there are no natural resources left, the AutoCannibal harvests plastic bags. Once the disposable symbols of over-consumerism, they\u2019re now saved and put to every kind of use; even sexual gratification. At one point, he toys with suicide by pulling a bag over his head and hyperventilating, before stuffing the whole thing into his mouth. In a grimly entertaining scene, he sits at a mock desk and reads a news bulletin, his words choked and muffled. At another moment, he play-acts what it is to be human, as if trying to remember, gurning his way through expressions of stupidity, selfishness, ignorance and refusal to listen \u2013 all the qualities that got humankind to this point in time. There\u2019s an endearing way to Jones\u2019 cartoonish physicality, echoing the pathos of Charlie Chaplin\u2019s Little Tramp and the frustrated desires of Tom &amp; Jerry\u2019s Tom Cat, and he\u2019s often met with uncontrollable laughter from the peanut gallery. After cutting his teeth with Circus Oz, Jones forged his style by performing in fetish clubs, where self-harm is part of the BDSM tool kit, and has previously staple-gunned himself and pierced his face with hooks. At the end of the hour tonight, he\u2019s covered in sweat and looking exhausted. In an outrageous case of publicity clickbait \u2013 or, at best, a disingenuous conflation of the actor with the character \u2013 it had been promised that \u201cMitch Jones chops himself up, cooks himself, and then eats himself on stage\u201d. This is untrue \u2013 but it\u2019s probably not accurate to say that no Joneses were harmed during the making of this play. \u2022 AutoCannibal is on at TheatreWorks until 21 July",

Others who spoke to <em>Panorama</em> are also understood to be considering contacting Lewis to represent them in libel actions. </p> <p>On the evening the programme was aired, a Labour spokesman said: \u201cIt appears these disaffected former officials include those who have always opposed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, worked to actively to undermine it and have both personal and political axes to grind.

Those representing the Labour party have acted in a way that set out to destroy the reputations of the whistleblowers. In their effort to destroy these people they have left it for the courts to decide who is telling the truth. It is ironic that the bosses at the workers\u2019 party have decided to go against the workers.\u201d</p> <p>Labour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/13/corbyn-decries-bbcs-inaccuracies-over-labour-antisemitism\" title=\"\">has raised complaints</a> at the highest level of the BBC about the <em>Panorama </em>programme, in which eight whistleblowers spoke out, claiming it was slanted and unbalanced. The allegations from whistleblowers included claims that key aides, including the director of communications, Seumas Milne, and the general secretary, Jennie Formby, interfered with investigations.</p> <p>Both Matthews, the party\u2019s former head of disputes and Withers Green, a former disputes officer, decided to break non-disclosure agreements that they were asked to sign when leaving the party last summer. They insisted they decided to speak out in the public interest.</p> <p>Matthews, who said he was left feeling suicidal because of the pressures placed on him, said last night: \u201cThe Labour party is choosing to ignore the central charges of antisemitism raised by myself and other whistleblowers on Panorama, and instead, they have engaged in a concerted campaign to damage my name. I have instructed Mark Lewis to ensure that the defamation and intimidation of whistleblowers is not allowed to continue.\u201d</p> <p>Withers Green said: \u201cI am incredibly disappointed that the Labour party has not reflected on or engaged with the troubling situation of inaction on anti-Jewish hatred that fellow whistleblowers and I have raised. This should be a stark wake-up call about our collective duty to root out racism. But instead the party has used its full weight to discredit us, with untrue, libellous statements.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have instructed Mark Lewis to clear my name of the defamatory accusations the Labour party has made against me, and I urge the party to cease attacking its own staff and activists and instead take action on what should be our common enemy: antisemitism.\u201d</p> <p>Yesterday, during a visit to the Durham Miners\u2019 Gala, Corbyn said there were \u201cmany, many, inaccuracies\u201d in the documentary. He said: \u201cThe programme adopted a predetermined position on its own website before it was broadcast. We\u2019ve made very clear what our processes [for dealing with anti-Semitism cases] are. Our party members do have the right to be heard if they\u2019re accused of anything and our party staff have a right to be supported and they are supported.\u201d</p> <p>A Labour spokesman said it will call for the programme to be removed from BBC iPlayer until basic facts are corrected, full and unedited quotes are used, and an apology is issued. On the possibility of legal action, a party spokesperson said the party\u2019s response had been fair: \u201cThese are justified statements of opinion. Any claims will be vigorously defended.\u201d The bitterness of the row within Labour deepened yesterday when Unite leader Len McCluskey attacked Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, over his criticism of Formby, who is receiving treatment for cancer. He said in remarks at the Durham gala, which he repeated on Twitter, that Watson was a \u201cfucking disgrace\u201d.</p> <p>A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cThe BBC stands by its journalism and we completely reject any accusations of bias or dishonesty. The investigation was not pre-determined, it was driven by the evidence. The outcome shows the serious questions facing the Labour party and its leadership on this issue. The programme adhered to the BBC\u2019s editorial guidelines, including contacting the Labour party in advance of the broadcast for a full right of reply.\u201d</p> <p>Today in a letter to the <em>Observer,</em> a group of leading Jewish figures express their \u201cbewilderment and disgust\u201d over the handling of antisemitism by Labour, which is already the subject of an investigation by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission. Howard Jacobson, Simon Sebag Montefiore, Sir Simon Schama, Neil Blair, Tracy-Ann Oberman and Rabbi Julia Neuberger say the EHRC inquiry \u201cis not a matter of housekeeping but a taint of international, historic shame\u201d.</p> <p>Separately 20 Labour MPs, all members of the Tribune Group, issued a statement expressing their shock at report of the party\u2019s handling of cases and how individual employees have been treated. \u201cWe support former employees in speaking out and commend their bravery in doing so,\u201d the MPs say.\u201cThe Labour Party has always and always will support whistleblowers in coming forward when they are concerned about wrongdoing. Today a poll reveals that a third of voters believe that Labour is now an antisemitic party. The YouGov poll, for the anti-racist Hope Not Hate campaign, found that 42% of voters believed antisemitism is a \u201cgenuine and serious issue\u201d in Labour.</p> <p>It has also emerged that a group of Labour peers have discussed the idea of resigning en masse should the party not take more decisive action to tackle antisemitism and be more transparent about the party\u2019s disciplinary processes.</p> <p>Other prominent party figures including former leader Neil Kinnock also criticised the way the party had treated whistleblowers. Kinnock told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cThis is a democratic socialist party and, to us and many others, antisemitism is poisonous. It must be rooted out. There are no excuses for failing to do that, or for attacking those who truthfully identify the sickness, or for denying full information to the National Executive and, therefore, the membership.\u201d</p>",

Both Matthews, the party\u2019s former head of disputes and Withers Green, a former disputes officer, decided to break non-disclosure agreements that they were asked to sign when leaving the party last summer. They insisted they decided to speak out in the public interest. Matthews, who said he was left feeling suicidal because of the pressures placed on him, said last night: \u201cThe Labour party is choosing to ignore the central charges of antisemitism raised by myself and other whistleblowers on Panorama, and instead, they have engaged in a concerted campaign to damage my name. I have instructed Mark Lewis to ensure that the defamation and intimidation of whistleblowers is not allowed to continue.\u201d Withers Green said: \u201cI am incredibly disappointed that the Labour party has not reflected on or engaged with the troubling situation of inaction on anti-Jewish hatred that fellow whistleblowers and I have raised. This should be a stark wake-up call about our collective duty to root out racism. But instead the party has used its full weight to discredit us, with untrue, libellous statements.\u201d \u201cI have instructed Mark Lewis to clear my name of the defamatory accusations the Labour party has made against me, and I urge the party to cease attacking its own staff and activists and instead take action on what should be our common enemy: antisemitism.\u201d Yesterday, during a visit to the Durham Miners\u2019 Gala, Corbyn said there were \u201cmany, many, inaccuracies\u201d in the documentary. He said: \u201cThe programme adopted a predetermined position on its own website before it was broadcast. We\u2019ve made very clear what our processes [for dealing with anti-Semitism cases] are. Our party members do have the right to be heard if they\u2019re accused of anything and our party staff have a right to be supported and they are supported.\u201d A Labour spokesman said it will call for the programme to be removed from BBC iPlayer until basic facts are corrected, full and unedited quotes are used, and an apology is issued. On the possibility of legal action, a party spokesperson said the party\u2019s response had been fair: \u201cThese are justified statements of opinion. Any claims will be vigorously defended.\u201d The bitterness of the row within Labour deepened yesterday when Unite leader Len McCluskey attacked Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, over his criticism of Formby, who is receiving treatment for cancer. He said in remarks at the Durham gala, which he repeated on Twitter, that Watson was a \u201cfucking disgrace\u201d. A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cThe BBC stands by its journalism and we completely reject any accusations of bias or dishonesty. The investigation was not pre-determined, it was driven by the evidence. The outcome shows the serious questions facing the Labour party and its leadership on this issue. The programme adhered to the BBC\u2019s editorial guidelines, including contacting the Labour party in advance of the broadcast for a full right of reply.\u201d Today in a letter to the Observer, a group of leading Jewish figures express their \u201cbewilderment and disgust\u201d over the handling of antisemitism by Labour, which is already the subject of an investigation by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission. Howard Jacobson, Simon Sebag Montefiore, Sir Simon Schama, Neil Blair, Tracy-Ann Oberman and Rabbi Julia Neuberger say the EHRC inquiry \u201cis not a matter of housekeeping but a taint of international, historic shame\u201d. Separately 20 Labour MPs, all members of the Tribune Group, issued a statement expressing their shock at report of the party\u2019s handling of cases and how individual employees have been treated. \u201cWe support former employees in speaking out and commend their bravery in doing so,\u201d the MPs say.\u201cThe Labour Party has always and always will support whistleblowers in coming forward when they are concerned about wrongdoing. Today a poll reveals that a third of voters believe that Labour is now an antisemitic party. The YouGov poll, for the anti-racist Hope Not Hate campaign, found that 42% of voters believed antisemitism is a \u201cgenuine and serious issue\u201d in Labour. It has also emerged that a group of Labour peers have discussed the idea of resigning en masse should the party not take more decisive action to tackle antisemitism and be more transparent about the party\u2019s disciplinary processes. Other prominent party figures including former leader Neil Kinnock also criticised the way the party had treated whistleblowers. Kinnock told the Observer: \u201cThis is a democratic socialist party and, to us and many others, antisemitism is poisonous. It must be rooted out. There are no excuses for failing to do that, or for attacking those who truthfully identify the sickness, or for denying full information to the National Executive and, therefore, the membership.\u201d",

Hundreds marched to the east Khartoum home of one of those who died in the June attacks to greet his family.

It is the lifestyle of a small proportion of the population in the developed world that is responsible not only for the burning of fossil fuels causing global heating, but for the massive impact on the environment of agribusiness and our rapacious appetite for any resources Mother Earth can provide. As the US environmentalist Bill McKibben said: \u201cMy daughter, four at this writing, has already used more stuff and added more waste to the environment than most of the world\u2019s residents do in a lifetime.

In that decade he was in three plays at the Whitehall, totalling more than 4,000 performances. By 1961, the Whitehall farces had broken the record as London\u2019s longest running farce team. <br><strong>Jonathan Rix</strong><br>Henfield, West Sussex<br></p> <h2>Civil servants under attack<br></h2> <p>In this time of political turmoil, with parliament and political parties stuck in infighting, no group has done more to keep the country running than the civil service, and no group has received as little praise. It is they who handled the detail of the Brexit negotiations, despite contradictory and unrealistic demands from parliament. It is civil servants who have made sure we are as prepared as possible for no deal. And while ministers have checked out to focus on internal leadership elections, civil servants have kept the ship of state afloat.</p> <p>As a reward, civil servants have been subjected to sustained attacks from across the political spectrum. We have seen a malicious briefing campaign against individual civil servants involved in Brexit negotiations, attacks on Treasury officials when their forecasts warn of the dangers of no deal and the disgraceful attempt to blame civil servants for the national security leak involving Huawei. Then just a few weeks ago we learned that civil servants will once again receive some of the worst pay awards in the public sector, far below what MPs have received. The culmination has been the disgraceful and unprecedented treatment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/10/kim-darroch-resigns-as-uk-ambassador-to-us-after-leaked-trump-comment\" title=\"\">Sir Kim Darroch</a>. This episode is extraordinary and shameful, but it is part of a wider culture of abusing civil servants that has been allowed to develop over the last few years.</p> <p>Civil servants cannot respond to these attacks, and must not be a punchbag for politicians from the right or left. They are not part of a secretive deep state; they are deeply committed men and women doing their best to serve their country. If only more politicians would act in the same manner.<br><strong>Mike Clancy</strong>, general secretary of Prospect union<br><strong>Dave Penman</strong>, general secretary of FDA union<br></p> <p></p> <h2>The poison in Labour\u2019s soul<br></h2> <p>Over the past four years, we have watched the unchecked spread of vicious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/antisemitism\" title=\"\">antisemitism</a> \u2013 anti-Jewish racism \u2013 in the Labour party with bewilderment and disgust \u2013 all the more so since we respected Labour\u2019s long previous history of fighting racism, and its many brave and decent members.</p> <p>As accusations of antisemitism became too insistent to ignore, the Labour leadership set out to change the narrative from hate to housekeeping. Yes, there were minor issues, the Labour leadership conceded, but those related only to the time it was taking to identify the few actual or seeming antisemites in the party and the occasionally flawed system of dealing with them. Otherwise, all suggestions that racist hate against Jews was becoming endemic to Labour were mendacious, mischievous and malign.</p> <p>Now, after <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0006p8c/panorama-is-labour-antisemitic\" title=\"\">the BBC\u2019s <em>Panorama</em> programme</a>, we can see for ourselves what is and isn\u2019t false. The extent of Labour\u2019s antisemitism, the degree to which it has been protected, sanctioned and propagated by the leadership faction, can brook no further denial; the labyrinthine attempts to deflect attention from the problem and discredit officials supposedly charged with identifying and rooting it out, are now laid bare. There is nowhere left for the Labour leadership to hide. It is clear this is not just about Jeremy Corbyn but the pernicious world view of a faction that has \u2013 temporarily, we hope \u2013 taken control of Labour.</p> <p>But yet again, rather than seize this moment to face up to the racism at its heart, the Labour leadership remains determined to go on piously protesting its innocence, rejecting the message and blaming the messenger. People prepared to bear witness have been forced to sign gagging orders; those who have dared to speak out have been bullied, defamed, and stigmatised as dishonest and disloyal. What drives them, the leadership insists, is nothing other than political or personal disaffection. We are where we were before. Whistleblowers would be heroes to any other Labour party; to this Labour party they are traitors. Regrettable double standards are therefore operating, where Labour is keen to support whistleblowers elsewhere but not in its own house.</p> <p>In our view, those whistleblowers and Labour members who could no longer stomach what was happening in a party they loved, and were in some cases driven to the point of nervous breakdown by it, have shown a rare moral courage and decency that belongs in a great tradition, and gives us hope. In the meantime, trust between Corbyn\u2019s Labour and most Jews in Britain appears to be fractured beyond repair. The very fact that Labour is, like the BNP before it, being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jul/12/jennie-formby-hits-back-tom-watson-in-labour-antisemitism-row-corbyn\" title=\"\">statutorily investigated</a> by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for racism is not a matter of housekeeping, but a taint of international, historic shame.</p> <p>There are procedures that could take the heat out of this \u2013 a fully independent complaints body, for example, over which Corbyn and his inner circle exert no covert influence. Not with the aim of shuffling off blame, but in order, finally, that the party will honestly own up to what can no longer be filed away in a folder. After <em>Panorama</em>, damage limitation should not be the first priority for Labour. Draining the antisemitism that lies like a pool of poison in the party\u2019s soul is. Now, nothing else will do.<br><strong>Howard Jacobson, Simon Sebag Montefiore, Sir Simon Schama, Neil Blair, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Rabbi Julia Neuberger</strong></p> <h2>Life is different in Yorkshire<br></h2> <p>Far from criticising Sally Wainwright for writing <em>Gentleman Jack</em> through \u201cthe prism of Halifax and West Yorkshire\u201d, Richard Brooks should praise her and the BBC for offering those of us not living metrosexual lives the chance to see life from different perspectives (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/07/more-to-anne-lister-gentleman-jack-paxman-coal-jellyfish-national\" title=\"\">Behind the scenes</a>, New Review).

      "bodyText": "Robin McKie left the crucial point about population to the very end of his otherwise excellent article (\u201cEight billion up: we can\u2019t go on like this\u201d, Focus). It is the lifestyle of a small proportion of the population in the developed world that is responsible not only for the burning of fossil fuels causing global heating, but for the massive impact on the environment of agribusiness and our rapacious appetite for any resources Mother Earth can provide. As the US environmentalist Bill McKibben said: \u201cMy daughter, four at this writing, has already used more stuff and added more waste to the environment than most of the world\u2019s residents do in a lifetime. In my 37 years I have probably outdone small Indian villages.\u201d Eileen Peck Benfleet, Essex May the farce be with you It was a pleasure to see my father\u2019s farces being recalled by Vanessa Thorpe (\u201cTour de farce: how the West End rediscovered joy of broad comedy\u201d, News). Farce\u2019s heyday was not from the 60s to the 80s, however. It was successful almost throughout the 20th century. My dad [the actor-manager Brian Rix] had a fairly successful 1950s, for example. In that decade he was in three plays at the Whitehall, totalling more than 4,000 performances. By 1961, the Whitehall farces had broken the record as London\u2019s longest running farce team. Jonathan Rix Henfield, West Sussex Civil servants under attack In this time of political turmoil, with parliament and political parties stuck in infighting, no group has done more to keep the country running than the civil service, and no group has received as little praise. It is they who handled the detail of the Brexit negotiations, despite contradictory and unrealistic demands from parliament. It is civil servants who have made sure we are as prepared as possible for no deal. And while ministers have checked out to focus on internal leadership elections, civil servants have kept the ship of state afloat. As a reward, civil servants have been subjected to sustained attacks from across the political spectrum. We have seen a malicious briefing campaign against individual civil servants involved in Brexit negotiations, attacks on Treasury officials when their forecasts warn of the dangers of no deal and the disgraceful attempt to blame civil servants for the national security leak involving Huawei. Then just a few weeks ago we learned that civil servants will once again receive some of the worst pay awards in the public sector, far below what MPs have received. The culmination has been the disgraceful and unprecedented treatment of Sir Kim Darroch. This episode is extraordinary and shameful, but it is part of a wider culture of abusing civil servants that has been allowed to develop over the last few years. Civil servants cannot respond to these attacks, and must not be a punchbag for politicians from the right or left. They are not part of a secretive deep state; they are deeply committed men and women doing their best to serve their country. If only more politicians would act in the same manner. Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect union Dave Penman, general secretary of FDA union The poison in Labour\u2019s soul Over the past four years, we have watched the unchecked spread of vicious antisemitism \u2013 anti-Jewish racism \u2013 in the Labour party with bewilderment and disgust \u2013 all the more so since we respected Labour\u2019s long previous history of fighting racism, and its many brave and decent members. As accusations of antisemitism became too insistent to ignore, the Labour leadership set out to change the narrative from hate to housekeeping. Yes, there were minor issues, the Labour leadership conceded, but those related only to the time it was taking to identify the few actual or seeming antisemites in the party and the occasionally flawed system of dealing with them. Otherwise, all suggestions that racist hate against Jews was becoming endemic to Labour were mendacious, mischievous and malign. Now, after the BBC\u2019s Panorama programme, we can see for ourselves what is and isn\u2019t false. The extent of Labour\u2019s antisemitism, the degree to which it has been protected, sanctioned and propagated by the leadership faction, can brook no further denial; the labyrinthine attempts to deflect attention from the problem and discredit officials supposedly charged with identifying and rooting it out, are now laid bare. There is nowhere left for the Labour leadership to hide. It is clear this is not just about Jeremy Corbyn but the pernicious world view of a faction that has \u2013 temporarily, we hope \u2013 taken control of Labour. But yet again, rather than seize this moment to face up to the racism at its heart, the Labour leadership remains determined to go on piously protesting its innocence, rejecting the message and blaming the messenger. People prepared to bear witness have been forced to sign gagging orders; those who have dared to speak out have been bullied, defamed, and stigmatised as dishonest and disloyal. What drives them, the leadership insists, is nothing other than political or personal disaffection. We are where we were before. Whistleblowers would be heroes to any other Labour party; to this Labour party they are traitors. Regrettable double standards are therefore operating, where Labour is keen to support whistleblowers elsewhere but not in its own house. In our view, those whistleblowers and Labour members who could no longer stomach what was happening in a party they loved, and were in some cases driven to the point of nervous breakdown by it, have shown a rare moral courage and decency that belongs in a great tradition, and gives us hope. In the meantime, trust between Corbyn\u2019s Labour and most Jews in Britain appears to be fractured beyond repair. The very fact that Labour is, like the BNP before it, being statutorily investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for racism is not a matter of housekeeping, but a taint of international, historic shame. There are procedures that could take the heat out of this \u2013 a fully independent complaints body, for example, over which Corbyn and his inner circle exert no covert influence. Not with the aim of shuffling off blame, but in order, finally, that the party will honestly own up to what can no longer be filed away in a folder. After Panorama, damage limitation should not be the first priority for Labour. Draining the antisemitism that lies like a pool of poison in the party\u2019s soul is. Now, nothing else will do. Howard Jacobson, Simon Sebag Montefiore, Sir Simon Schama, Neil Blair, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Rabbi Julia Neuberger Life is different in Yorkshire Far from criticising Sally Wainwright for writing Gentleman Jack through \u201cthe prism of Halifax and West Yorkshire\u201d, Richard Brooks should praise her and the BBC for offering those of us not living metrosexual lives the chance to see life from different perspectives (Behind the scenes, New Review). A glance through any TV listings will tell him how much is seen \u201cthrough the prism\u201d of London, not to mention the main news bulletins. He should get out more. Barbara Street Cardiff The risks of online content Andrew Przybylski and Amy Orben rightly highlight that we don\u2019t fully understand the impact of big tech on our society and that more research is needed (\u201cWe\u2019re told that too much screen time hurts our kids. Where\u2019s the evidence?\u201d, Comment). Frontline clinicians, like me, regularly encounter young people who are self-harming, engaging with pro-anorexia content or are being groomed online to devastating effect. Gaming addiction and online gambling are other areas of concern, and we welcome the announcement of new NHS England-funded gambling clinics to support them. Research must not only look at the impact of screen time but should also consider the nuances of what content is being viewed by whom, how technology is being used and how it can affect mental health. We call on a levy to be paid by technology companies to fund this much-needed independent research and to invest in further studies on how technology can also be used to help young people. Przybylski and Orben\u2019s largely retrospective data mainly focuses on the effects of screen time in the general population rather than exploring the harms of online content on more vulnerable users, or detailed analysis of how young people use technology. The death of Molly Russell is a tragic example of a young life needlessly ended after viewing harmful online content linked to anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide. We must continue to bang the drum to ensure vulnerable users like Molly are protected against the risks of online content. Screen time is a different issue; content is crucial.

But at that point her opponent, Serena Williams, was shuffling towards the net, head bowed and hand outstretched. And Centre Court was rising and roaring to salute a performance of staggering intensity.</p> \n<p>Watching on it seemed impossible that when Halep was a young child in Romania she used to cry before going on to court because she was so shy. Yet on the game\u2019s biggest stage the tiny introvert was transformed into a lion with ice in her veins, producing a near-faultless display to dismantle the greatest women\u2019s player in history.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/13/serena-williams-simona-halep-powerhouse-wimbledon-final\">Serena Williams pays tribute to \u2018little powerhouse\u2019 Halep after final defeat</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s tough to describe the moment,\u201d she said after a 6-2, 6-2 victory in which she hit three unforced errors. \u201cYou just feel light. You feel everything is beautiful. I\u2019m very sure that was the best match of my life.\u201d</p> \n<p>This made her the first Romanian to win here, although Ilie Nastase got close in 1972 before losing 7-5 in the fifth set to Stan Smith, and she was rewarded with \u00a32.25m in prize money and lifetime membership of the All-England Club. It also fulfilled a longtime promise. Halep\u2019s mum once told her that she if wanted to do something in tennis she had to play in a Wimbledon final. \u201cIt was my mum\u2019s dream when I was about 10,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cAnd the day came and my mum is here to see it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet when Halep finally wended her way through Wimbledon\u2019s burrows and corridors to catch up with her mother she found her too dumbstruck to speak. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything because she was crying,\u201d said Halep. \u201cI just hugged her and I kissed her. I knew she\u2019s very emotional.\u201d</p> \n<p>The 27-year-old has long been regarded as the best mover in the women\u2019s game but she has always regarded grass with a natural clay-courter\u2019s suspicion. Indeed when she was asked when she started to truly think that winning Wimbledon was possible she was blunt. \u201cToday,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very honest. I never thought that I would be able to win on grass, with all these players that are very tall and serving with a lot of power. But this year I started to feel the game more and more. I started to feel safe on court, which helped me a lot to believe.\u201d</p> \n<p>Belief has not always been the strongest part of her game. Two years ago she lost a French Open final from being a set and 3-0 up, and she had also lost two other grand slam titles before winning in Paris last year. Such setbacks would have crushed many, but instead it only strengthened her resolve.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a16972a7f10f99ade87be7c1b44f16293eddde8d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a16972a7f10f99ade87be7c1b44f16293eddde8d/0_0_4252_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Serena Williams congratulates Simona Halep after the Romanian\u2019s dominant victory on Centre Court.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Serena Williams congratulates Simona Halep after the Romanian\u2019s dominant victory on Centre Court.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThose finals I lost in the past helped me for this moment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s never easy to face a grand slam final. You can get intimidated by the moment. You can get nervous, too nervous.\u201d</p> \n<p>Not this time. Halep had lost nine of her 10 matches against Williams but on Friday she spent 30 minutes practising her returns, knowing that she had to face down the American\u2019s barrage to have any chance of getting into the match.</p> \n<p>It worked and then some as Halep broke into the opening game and then again to go 4-0 up after 11 minutes. Wimbledon was stunned, but not half as much as Williams. Afterwards the Romanian was asked what she was thinking at that point. \u201cNothing,\u201d she replied.</p> \n<p>In the past two decades dozens of opponents have felt what it is like to suffer a Serena attack and be a set down before settling into the match. Now Williams was getting a taste of her own medicine and did not know how to respond.</p> \n<p>The pattern continued in the second set \u2013 with Halep\u2019s superior speed and waspish groundstrokes allowing her to get Williams\u2019s cannonballs back with interest until she had forced the error.</p> \n<p>With every minute the match went on Williams, who was short of fitness after playing seven tournaments all year, was being stretched out of her comfort zone and away from victory.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/13/simona-halep-stuns-serena-williams-to-win-first-wimbledon-title\">Simona Halep stuns Serena Williams to win first Wimbledon title</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI have always been intimidated a little bit when I faced Serena,\u201d Halep said. \u201cShe\u2019s an inspiration for everyone. But I decided before the match that I\u2019m going to focus on myself and on the final of grand slam, not on her. That\u2019s why I was able to play my best, to be relaxed, and to be able to be positive and confident against her.</p> \n<p>\u201cI knew that I had to be aggressive, being 100% for every ball, that I can\u2019t let her come back in to the match because she\u2019s so powerful and so strong.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even when she was serving for the match Halep was calmness personified. \u201cI looked at the scoreboard. I said: \u2018OK, it\u2019s 5-2, it\u2019s real.\u2019 Then I just played every ball. I didn\u2019t think about the score at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>Then in a great and wondrous rush it finally hit her.

      "bodyText": "It took 56 minutes into the biggest match of Simona Halep\u2019s career for her legs to go finally wobbly. But at that point her opponent, Serena Williams, was shuffling towards the net, head bowed and hand outstretched. And Centre Court was rising and roaring to salute a performance of staggering intensity. Watching on it seemed impossible that when Halep was a young child in Romania she used to cry before going on to court because she was so shy. Yet on the game\u2019s biggest stage the tiny introvert was transformed into a lion with ice in her veins, producing a near-faultless display to dismantle the greatest women\u2019s player in history. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to describe the moment,\u201d she said after a 6-2, 6-2 victory in which she hit three unforced errors. \u201cYou just feel light. You feel everything is beautiful. I\u2019m very sure that was the best match of my life.\u201d This made her the first Romanian to win here, although Ilie Nastase got close in 1972 before losing 7-5 in the fifth set to Stan Smith, and she was rewarded with \u00a32.25m in prize money and lifetime membership of the All-England Club. It also fulfilled a longtime promise. Halep\u2019s mum once told her that she if wanted to do something in tennis she had to play in a Wimbledon final. \u201cIt was my mum\u2019s dream when I was about 10,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cAnd the day came and my mum is here to see it.\u201d Yet when Halep finally wended her way through Wimbledon\u2019s burrows and corridors to catch up with her mother she found her too dumbstruck to speak. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything because she was crying,\u201d said Halep. \u201cI just hugged her and I kissed her. I knew she\u2019s very emotional.\u201d The 27-year-old has long been regarded as the best mover in the women\u2019s game but she has always regarded grass with a natural clay-courter\u2019s suspicion. Indeed when she was asked when she started to truly think that winning Wimbledon was possible she was blunt. \u201cToday,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very honest. I never thought that I would be able to win on grass, with all these players that are very tall and serving with a lot of power. But this year I started to feel the game more and more. I started to feel safe on court, which helped me a lot to believe.\u201d Belief has not always been the strongest part of her game. Two years ago she lost a French Open final from being a set and 3-0 up, and she had also lost two other grand slam titles before winning in Paris last year. Such setbacks would have crushed many, but instead it only strengthened her resolve. \u201cThose finals I lost in the past helped me for this moment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s never easy to face a grand slam final. You can get intimidated by the moment. You can get nervous, too nervous.\u201d Not this time. Halep had lost nine of her 10 matches against Williams but on Friday she spent 30 minutes practising her returns, knowing that she had to face down the American\u2019s barrage to have any chance of getting into the match. It worked and then some as Halep broke into the opening game and then again to go 4-0 up after 11 minutes. Wimbledon was stunned, but not half as much as Williams. Afterwards the Romanian was asked what she was thinking at that point. \u201cNothing,\u201d she replied. In the past two decades dozens of opponents have felt what it is like to suffer a Serena attack and be a set down before settling into the match. Now Williams was getting a taste of her own medicine and did not know how to respond. The pattern continued in the second set \u2013 with Halep\u2019s superior speed and waspish groundstrokes allowing her to get Williams\u2019s cannonballs back with interest until she had forced the error. With every minute the match went on Williams, who was short of fitness after playing seven tournaments all year, was being stretched out of her comfort zone and away from victory. \u201cI have always been intimidated a little bit when I faced Serena,\u201d Halep said. \u201cShe\u2019s an inspiration for everyone. But I decided before the match that I\u2019m going to focus on myself and on the final of grand slam, not on her. That\u2019s why I was able to play my best, to be relaxed, and to be able to be positive and confident against her. \u201cI knew that I had to be aggressive, being 100% for every ball, that I can\u2019t let her come back in to the match because she\u2019s so powerful and so strong.\u201d Even when she was serving for the match Halep was calmness personified. \u201cI looked at the scoreboard. I said: \u2018OK, it\u2019s 5-2, it\u2019s real.\u2019 Then I just played every ball. I didn\u2019t think about the score at all.\u201d Then in a great and wondrous rush it finally hit her. She was Wimbledon champion.",

      "bodyText": "Security forces in Somalia are braced for a wave of new attacks by Islamist extremists following a bloody overnight assault on a hotel that ended on Saturday. The death toll from the attack in the southern port city of Kismayo, which began on Friday evening, has risen to 26 people, including a prominent Canadian-Somali journalist and several foreigners. The victims include one Briton, three Kenyans, three Tanzanians, two Americans and one Canadian, said Ahmed Madobe Islam, the president of the Jubaland regional state that controls Kismayo. He told reporters that 56 people, including two Chinese, were injured. At least four al-Shabaab militants attacked the Asasey hotel, which is popular with politicians, foreigners and lawmakers. A suicide car bomb demolished the entrance gate, allowing gunmen to storm the main building. Al-Shabaab tends to launch campaigns of multiple strikes when it the group is under pressure. Five people, including three civilians, were killed in a gun battle in the capital, Mogadishu, on Monday after extremists opened fire on a checkpoint. Regional intelligence officials and analysts say that a spate of public executions by al-Shabaab in recent weeks is part of a broader effort to demonstrate continued strength despite casualties sustained in airstrikes and a series of clashes with Somali troops over recent months. The pace of US airstrikes against al-Shabaab has escalated dramatically. There were 47 in 2018 and have been 50 so far this year. These are thought to have killed about 300 militants, according to a count by the Bureau for Investigative Journalism. Al-Shabaab operations have been disrupted by the strikes, and though the group\u2019s hold on swaths of territory in central and southern Somalia remains strong, commanders will want to demonstrate their capacity to harm enemies. Hotels are a favourite target of al-Shabaab, which claimed responsibility for Friday\u2019s attack. Troops fought for more than 12 hours before eventually killing all attackers inside the hotel compound, said Col Abdiqadir Nur, a police officer. Analysts said the operation had all the hallmarks of the group, which often uses suicide car bombs to blast through defences of heavily fortified targets. The group was also behind the massive truck bomb in Mogadishu in 2017 that killed more than 500 people. Despite its proximity to some major al-Shabaab strongholds, Kismayo has been relatively quiet in recent years. Hodan Nalayeh, a Canadian journalist, and her husband, Farid Jama Suleiman, died in the attack, confirmed the Mogadishu-based independent radio station Radio Dalsan. Omar Suleiman, a Texas-based imam who knew the journalist, wrote on social media: \u201cI\u2019m absolutely devastated by the news of the death of our dear sister Hodan Nalayeh and her husband in a terrorist attack in Somalia today. What a loss to us. Her beautiful spirit shined through her work and the way she treated people.\u201d The BBC journalist Farhan Jimale tweeted: Nalayeh was born in Somalia in 1976 but spent most of her life in Canada, first in Alberta and then Toronto. She founded Integration TV, an international web-based video production company aimed at Somali viewers around the world. She was the first female Somali media owner. \u201cThrough her work as a journalist, Hodan highlighted the community\u2019s positive stories and contributions in Canada. She became a voice for many. We mourn her loss deeply, and all others killed in the #KismayoAttack,\u201d Ahmed Hussen, Canada\u2019s immigration minister, tweeted. Kismayo resident Osman Nur told Reuters the explosion had destroyed huge parts of the hotel and nearby businesses and security forces were deployed all over the city. TV footage showed walls peppered with bullet holes and furniture strewn across the hotel courtyard. Another anguished resident said she lost relatives in the attack. \u201cI have been looking for the whereabouts of my nephew who worked at the hotel. I got his dead body this morning and have just buried him,\u201d Halima Nur, a mother of four, told Reuters. \u201cAnd this afternoon I will attend the burial of other relatives.\u201d Al-Shabaab, which is an official affiliate of al-Qaida, has been waging a war for more than a decade to overthrow Somalia\u2019s western-backed central government and install its own rule based on its strict interpretation of sharia law. In March, the group killed five people, including the deputy labour minister, in an attack on a government building in the capital, Mogadishu. In January it launched a spectacular assault on a luxury hotel, restaurant and retail complex in Nairobi, Kenya. The US has ramped up its support for the government in Somalia, deploying hundreds of special forces soldiers, and frequently uses drones to attack the militants. In March 2017, Donald Trump approved greater authority for military operations against al-Shabaab, allowing increased actions in support of the African Union Mission in Somalia and Somali forces. Earlier this year, a report by Amnesty International claimed attacks have killed or wounded nearly two dozen civilians, and said the Pentagon is not adequately investigating potential casualties.",

His stats are overwhelmingly in his favour - more than 850 runs this season - but many pundits will say his technique cannot stand up to facing the likes of Starc, Cummins and Pattinson. His hands are too low is a popular comment.</p> <p>Here, from late morning to late evening, he hit 111 off 212 balls and shared a third-wicket partnership of 199 with Tom Kohler-Cadmore (77 not out) to give Somerset plenty to think about at 282 for three. The leaders did not bowl badly and could have had more reward, but their decision to bowl first was a questionable one, albeit that the skies were overcast when Tom Abell walked out for the toss at 10.30am.</p> <p>At Chelmsford last week, Yorkshire attacked against Simon Harmer and co and were bowled out for 208 on the way to defeat. Here, Ballance and Kohler-Cadmore were much more cautious, and it worked a treat as they were able to play with more freedom after tea.</p> <p>Sticking with Chelmsford, and second-placed <strong>Essex </strong>were bowled out for 245 by <strong>Warwickshire</strong> as Will Rhodes claimed five for 17 from 14.3 overs of medium pace, including Sir Alastair Cook caught in the gully for 84. It was, however, a major surprise to see off-spinner Jeetan Patel go wicketless at a venue where spin has ruled the roost this year.</p> <p>Felix Organ, <strong>Hampshire</strong>\u2019s 20-year-old opener born in Sydney, scored his maiden century (100 off 235 balls) in only his third first-class match to underpin a home score of 340 for six against <strong>Kent</strong> at the Ageas Bowl, while Indian Test off-spinner Ravi Ashwin claimed six for 69 as <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong> bowled<strong> Surrey</strong> out for 240 at Trent Bridge and closed on 20 for one. </p> <p>In Division Two, Matthew Parkinson sent the perfect \u2018You should have picked me earlier, shouldn\u2019t you\u2019 message to <strong>Lancashire</strong>\u2019s hierarchy with a career best six for 23 in his first Championship appearance of the season, with <strong>Sussex</strong> (127 all out) losing all 10 wickets for just 50 in a remarkable collapse either side of lunch at Old Trafford. A leg-spinner with a coiled action, the England Lions man had been kept out of the team largely due to the success of the Lancashire\u2019s plethora of seamers. <br></p> <p>But Parkinson, with help from Glenn Maxwell\u2019s off-spinners, wrecked Sussex\u2019s strong start of 77 without loss. Lancashire will have celebrated Australia\u2019s World Cup semi-final exit more keenly than most given it opened the door for Maxwell to return to their ranks a few days earlier than expected.</p> <p>The all-rounder was only due to return to Old Trafford in time for the start of the T20 Blast on Friday. Instead, he finished with four for 41 before Lancashire closed on 149 for one.</p> <p>Rain affected progress at Chester-le-Street where <strong>Durham</strong> struggled to 122 for six against <strong>Worcestershire </strong> while Dawid Malan\u2019s 166 off 194 balls was his fourth Championship hundred of the season and kept second-placed <strong>Glamorgan </strong>at bay at Sophia Gardens. <strong>Middlesex</strong> were bowled out for 384 late in the day and Tom Helm ripped out the hosts\u2019 top order with a remarkable spell of 4-0-8-4 to leave the hosts reeling on 24 for four in reply. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d2a04788f0845f89e30c8cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-13T16:22:59.199Z\">5.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>I\u2019ll take a short break now before returning with my daily round-up</strong> of all the action from today\u2019s seven matches.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d2a04408f08cf92bb76f485\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-13T16:18:29.555Z\">5.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Just looking at Dawid Malan\u2019s stats this season</strong>.

Loss, win, loss. Somerset, 15 points clear of Essex at the summit, have won seven of their nine games so far, and the popular opinion is that a maiden title is theirs to lose.</p> <p>Having seen Yorkshire lose at Essex last week, I don\u2019t subscribe to that view. Essex are the real deal. They \u2018Simon Harmered\u2019 the White Rose county and were nowhere near at their best. In bowling Yorkshire out for 208 on day one, Essex were apparently of the opinion that it was the worst they\u2019d bowled all season. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/99-94-cricket-blog/2019/jul/11/county-cricket-talking-points-essex-winning-somerset\">County cricket talking points: Essex keep winning ... but so do Somerset</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One thing is for sure. It is a two horse race. Given Yorkshire, in third, were playing Essex and Somerset in succession, they had a chance with two wins. This clash throws up a couple of interesting asides. The return of Jack Brooks to Headingley will rouse the home crowd, I\u2019m sure. A Championship winner in 2014 and 2015 with Yorkshire, he took more than 300 wickets for them in that competition in six seasons. </p> <p>Then you have Dom Bess playing for Somerset against the county he is about to rejoin on loan for T20. Bess played four Championship matches for Yorkshire earlier in the season. \u201cAt least it saves me doing the trip back and forth,\u201d he joked a couple of days ago. </p> <p>Essex host Warwickshire at Chelmsford, where their 100% record stands at five fixtures this summer. But the Bears will be no pushovers, as their Houdini like escape with a draw from Hampshire away earlier this week suggests. Ninth-wicket pair Henry Brookes and Jeetan Patel batted out the best part of the last 28 overs on Tuesday to secure a draw from the jaws of defeat. They will have to do without in-form opener Dom Sibley due to the England Lions versus Australia A game at Canterbury, which starts on Sunday. Mind you, they are not alone. Most counties are affected by that game with absentees. </p> <p>Hampshire are at home again, against a Kent side who beat Surrey at the Oval earlier this week, while struggling Surrey \u2013 at Trent Bridge \u2013 face a Nottinghamshire side who are having a nightmare campaign and are on course for relegation. </p> <p>There are three fixtures in Division Two starting today and a fourth on Sunday \u2013 Derbyshire v Northamptonshire at Chesterfield. They are all attractive clashes too. Leaders Lancashire host fourth-placed Sussex at Old Trafford, while second-placed Glamorgan host a Middlesex side who will hope their win over Gloucestershire earlier this week sparks a drive for the promotion places. They are currently seventh and 15 points behind Derbyshire in fourth. At the Riverside, Durham host Worcestershire. </p> <p>I did wonder for a moment whether there would be any alteration in scheduling of this round due to England\u2019s World Cup final appearance.. An obvious way would be to return briefly to the old Test match rest day and have day two on Monday instead of Sunday. After all, around this time last year if you remember, Yorkshire rearranged a T20 Blast fixture with Derbyshire which clashed with England\u2019s football World Cup semi-final against Croatia.</p> <p>Yorkshire have since said a big reason for that was safety. Earlier in the competition when England beat Sweden people were dancing in the streets and climbing on top of buses celebrating for example. Instead of re-jigging this game, Yorkshire have stressed that Sunday\u2019s World Cup game will be shown around the ground on TVs in places such as the East Stand Long Room. </p> <p>The scheduling of the Vitality Blast will also be a big factor. There are counties who start that competition on Thursday and most others on Friday, so pushing the Championship back a day would eat into valuable preparation time.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-13T09:28:23.744Z\">at 10.28am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Gary Ballance, after a few barren innings, was back in the runs for Yorkshire as his fifth hundred in 10 Championship matches this season put the league leaders Somerset under significant pressure during a hard fought opening day as slow and steady ultimately reaped rewards. It is difficult to know whether Ballance is a genuine Ashes contender. His stats are overwhelmingly in his favour - more than 850 runs this season - but many pundits will say his technique cannot stand up to facing the likes of Starc, Cummins and Pattinson. His hands are too low is a popular comment. Here, from late morning to late evening, he hit 111 off 212 balls and shared a third-wicket partnership of 199 with Tom Kohler-Cadmore (77 not out) to give Somerset plenty to think about at 282 for three. The leaders did not bowl badly and could have had more reward, but their decision to bowl first was a questionable one, albeit that the skies were overcast when Tom Abell walked out for the toss at 10.30am. At Chelmsford last week, Yorkshire attacked against Simon Harmer and co and were bowled out for 208 on the way to defeat. Here, Ballance and Kohler-Cadmore were much more cautious, and it worked a treat as they were able to play with more freedom after tea. Sticking with Chelmsford, and second-placed Essex were bowled out for 245 by Warwickshire as Will Rhodes claimed five for 17 from 14.3 overs of medium pace, including Sir Alastair Cook caught in the gully for 84. It was, however, a major surprise to see off-spinner Jeetan Patel go wicketless at a venue where spin has ruled the roost this year. Felix Organ, Hampshire\u2019s 20-year-old opener born in Sydney, scored his maiden century (100 off 235 balls) in only his third first-class match to underpin a home score of 340 for six against Kent at the Ageas Bowl, while Indian Test off-spinner Ravi Ashwin claimed six for 69 as Nottinghamshire bowled Surrey out for 240 at Trent Bridge and closed on 20 for one. In Division Two, Matthew Parkinson sent the perfect \u2018You should have picked me earlier, shouldn\u2019t you\u2019 message to Lancashire\u2019s hierarchy with a career best six for 23 in his first Championship appearance of the season, with Sussex (127 all out) losing all 10 wickets for just 50 in a remarkable collapse either side of lunch at Old Trafford. A leg-spinner with a coiled action, the England Lions man had been kept out of the team largely due to the success of the Lancashire\u2019s plethora of seamers. But Parkinson, with help from Glenn Maxwell\u2019s off-spinners, wrecked Sussex\u2019s strong start of 77 without loss. Lancashire will have celebrated Australia\u2019s World Cup semi-final exit more keenly than most given it opened the door for Maxwell to return to their ranks a few days earlier than expected. The all-rounder was only due to return to Old Trafford in time for the start of the T20 Blast on Friday. Instead, he finished with four for 41 before Lancashire closed on 149 for one. Rain affected progress at Chester-le-Street where Durham struggled to 122 for six against Worcestershire while Dawid Malan\u2019s 166 off 194 balls was his fourth Championship hundred of the season and kept second-placed Glamorgan at bay at Sophia Gardens. Middlesex were bowled out for 384 late in the day and Tom Helm ripped out the hosts\u2019 top order with a remarkable spell of 4-0-8-4 to leave the hosts reeling on 24 for four in reply. I\u2019ll take a short break now before returning with my daily round-up of all the action from today\u2019s seven matches. Just looking at Dawid Malan\u2019s stats this season. Four hundreds in nine matches. Is he an Ashes contender? He is currently unbeaten on 132 in Middlesex\u2019s 329-8 against Glamorgan. He has shared 87 for the ninth wicket with Nathan Sowter (46). Craig Overton has returned to the attack but gets pulled for four by Gary Ballance, who has 76. After that, he takes the new ball. Yorkshire are 225-2 in the 81st over. Will Rhodes has four of the six wickets to fall at Chelmsford, and he has only bowled seven overs. Essex have slipped from 157-2 to 171-6. If I\u2019d just seen the score, I would have said that Jeetan Patel would be in the thick of the action, but he\u2019s gone wicketless in 20 overs. Sir Alastair, for 84, was the first wicket of the collapse. As Lancashire take a stranglehold on their clash with Sussex at Old Trafford - they are 50-0 in reply to 127 - second-placed Glamorgan are chipping away at Middlesex, who are 235-7 with Dawid Malan 94 not out. Veteran Aussie seamer Michael Hogan (I really have to stop myself from typing Hulk, seriously) has taken three wickets. Here at Headingley, Gary Ballance has just reached 50 off 135 balls and Tom Kohler-Cadmore follows him there as I type off 100 balls. Yorkshire are 188-2. Time for tea around the country. Interesting cloud formation at Headingley. As tea approaches, we have a rare occurrence - a team are ahead of the over-rate. Somerset will have bowled 34 overs in the session. Yorkshire are going well at 181-2, with Gary Ballance and Tom Kohler-Cadmore on 47 and 48 respectively. They have shared 99 for the third wicket. Play due to restart at Durham at 3.15pm, where there will be 51.1 overs remaining in the day after a couple of hours of rain. Durham are 47-6. Ravi Ashwin has taken all four wickets, including more recently Dean Elgar bowled for 59 and Jamie Smith, via a sharp catch by Ben Slater at short leg, for 42. Surrey are now 158-4 at Trent Bridge. Here at Headingley, Somerset are yet to break through after lunch as Yorkshire reach 149-2. Gary Ballance has 30 and Tom Kohler-Cadmore 33. Sussex are all out for 127, with Matthew Parkinson claiming a career best 6-23 - not a bad way to say to the coaching staff and captain, \u2018Hey, you should have picked me earlier shouldn\u2019t you!\u2019. So, having been 77-0, Sussex lost all 10 wickets for 50 runs. Ian Holland has been caught at first slip for 60 off Harry Podmore, shimmying down the pitch ever so slightly too. He has fallen to leave Hampshire at 95-1 against Kent at the Ageas Bowl. It\u2019s not been a bad start to his spell at the top of the order after a ton against Warwickshire last week It is raining at Durham, where they haven\u2019t resumed after lunch at the Riverside against Worcestershire. That will be some relief to Durham, who are 47-6. Some collapse at Old Trafford, where Sussex were 77-0 not too long before lunch. Now they\u2019re 95-8. Glenn Maxwell and Matthew Parkinson have four wickets apiece. Here, Yorkshire are 98-2. For me, this afternoon is a big one for Somerset, who can really reaffirm their title credentials. At 80-0 just before lunch, Yorkshire were on top. Somerset didn\u2019t bowl badly, but they were on the back foot. However, two quick wickets before lunch and they\u2019re back in it. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if Yorkshire were 250 all out because that is what champion sides do when they get a sniff. Here\u2019s a lunch update from around the grounds, where runs are being scored in Division One and wickets are tumbling in Division Two. Division One Essex 73-2 v Warwickshire, Chelmsford Henry Brookes with a couple of wickets for the visitors, while Sir Alastair Cook is unbeaten on 34. Hampshire 74-0 v Kent, Ageas Bowl - Ian Holland continuing his good form at the top of the order as a locum opener with 53 not out. Surrey 104-2 v Nottinghamshire, Trent Bridge - Dean Elgar unbeaten on 47 for the slumbering champions, but Rory Burns fell for 22, trapped lbw by Ravi Ashwin, who has both wickets. Yorkshire 83-2 v Somerset, Headingley - Early frustration for the leaders turned to late joy as Jack Brooks and Dom Bess removed Will Fraine and Adam Lyth after an 80 opening stand. Division Two Durham 47-6 v Worcestershire, Riverside - Horrible morning for the hosts, who were asked to bat. Joe Leach and Charlie Morris have two wickets apiece. Middlesex 115-4 v Glamorgan, Sophia Gardens - Dawid Malan is 43 not out, but the hosts are on top. Lukas Carey removed Sam Robson and Nick Gubbins for seven and nought. Sussex 95-5 v Lancashire, Old Trafford - Sussex slip from 77-0, with Glenn Maxwell taking three wickets having returned to Championship action after Australia\u2019s World Cup exit. Yorkshire have lost Will Fraine for 45, caught just in front of square-leg by Dom Bess off Jack Brooks having timed a flick off his legs. Unfortunately for him, he just picked out the man. In comes Gary Ballance, who hasn\u2019t had a great few weeks. After a sensational start to the summer, Ballance\u2019s form has just dipped recently. Yorkshire 80-1 as we approach lunch. Not often that Lancashire have relied on spin this season, but they are doing this morning after a healthy Sussex start at Old Trafford. Glenn Maxwell and Matthew Parkinson, the latter playing his first Championship match of the season, have struck to leave the score at 85-2. Parkinson trapped Varun Chopra lbw for 32 in his third over after Maxwell got Phil Salt for 40. Both wickets fell with the score on 77. Here at Headingley, Yorkshire are 67-0 and going well. Durham are 43-5 against Worcestershire at the Riverside, with two wickets for Joe Leach and one apiece for Messrs Pennington, Barnard and Morris. No one has yet managed to pass 12 for the hosts. It looks as if there\u2019s been a quartet of solid starts for the batting teams in Division One; Essex, Surrey, Hampshire and Yorkshire, with the latter\u2019s being the best of them at 55-0 in the 18th over. Adam Lyth has just pulled Jamie Overton for six to move to 29. Glamorgan seamer Lukas Carey has removed Sam Robson and Nick Gubbins cheap in Cardiff and Middlesex are 35-2. Here, the new Emerald Stand is open to the Yorkshire faithful for the first time, and they have a pretty good view of Yorkshire\u2019s steady start at 33-0 in the 14th over. There have been a couple of wickets in Division Two, including Cameron Bancroft trapped lbw by Dillon Pennington trapped lbw for eight. Durham are 19-1 in the sixth over against Worcestershire at the Riverside. Quiet start, wickets-wise, around the country, in fact a non-existent start as there hasn\u2019t been one yet. Here, Yorkshire have reached 15-0 after six overs, with Craig Overton and Jack Brooks, who received a warm hand from the home faithful, sharing the new ball. Play at Old Trafford was preceded by a minute\u2019s silence in memory of former Lancashire captain Jack Bond, who died on Friday aged 87. Glenn Maxwell is back in the Red Rose team after World Cup duty with Australia. Sussex are batting first having won the toss. Uncontested tosses here at Headingley, so Somerset are bowling, at Chelmsford where Warwickshire have chosen to bowl against Essex and the Riverside in Division Two \u2013 Worcestershire are bowling against Durham. Good morning from Emerald Headingley, where the leaders are in town to face a Yorkshire side who have had an up and down last few weeks. Loss, win, loss. Somerset, 15 points clear of Essex at the summit, have won seven of their nine games so far, and the popular opinion is that a maiden title is theirs to lose. Having seen Yorkshire lose at Essex last week, I don\u2019t subscribe to that view. Essex are the real deal. They \u2018Simon Harmered\u2019 the White Rose county and were nowhere near at their best. In bowling Yorkshire out for 208 on day one, Essex were apparently of the opinion that it was the worst they\u2019d bowled all season. One thing is for sure. It is a two horse race. Given Yorkshire, in third, were playing Essex and Somerset in succession, they had a chance with two wins. This clash throws up a couple of interesting asides. The return of Jack Brooks to Headingley will rouse the home crowd, I\u2019m sure. A Championship winner in 2014 and 2015 with Yorkshire, he took more than 300 wickets for them in that competition in six seasons. Then you have Dom Bess playing for Somerset against the county he is about to rejoin on loan for T20. Bess played four Championship matches for Yorkshire earlier in the season. \u201cAt least it saves me doing the trip back and forth,\u201d he joked a couple of days ago. Essex host Warwickshire at Chelmsford, where their 100% record stands at five fixtures this summer. But the Bears will be no pushovers, as their Houdini like escape with a draw from Hampshire away earlier this week suggests. Ninth-wicket pair Henry Brookes and Jeetan Patel batted out the best part of the last 28 overs on Tuesday to secure a draw from the jaws of defeat. They will have to do without in-form opener Dom Sibley due to the England Lions versus Australia A game at Canterbury, which starts on Sunday. Mind you, they are not alone. Most counties are affected by that game with absentees. Hampshire are at home again, against a Kent side who beat Surrey at the Oval earlier this week, while struggling Surrey \u2013 at Trent Bridge \u2013 face a Nottinghamshire side who are having a nightmare campaign and are on course for relegation. There are three fixtures in Division Two starting today and a fourth on Sunday \u2013 Derbyshire v Northamptonshire at Chesterfield. They are all attractive clashes too. Leaders Lancashire host fourth-placed Sussex at Old Trafford, while second-placed Glamorgan host a Middlesex side who will hope their win over Gloucestershire earlier this week sparks a drive for the promotion places. They are currently seventh and 15 points behind Derbyshire in fourth. At the Riverside, Durham host Worcestershire. I did wonder for a moment whether there would be any alteration in scheduling of this round due to England\u2019s World Cup final appearance.. An obvious way would be to return briefly to the old Test match rest day and have day two on Monday instead of Sunday. After all, around this time last year if you remember, Yorkshire rearranged a T20 Blast fixture with Derbyshire which clashed with England\u2019s football World Cup semi-final against Croatia. Yorkshire have since said a big reason for that was safety. Earlier in the competition when England beat Sweden people were dancing in the streets and climbing on top of buses celebrating for example. Instead of re-jigging this game, Yorkshire have stressed that Sunday\u2019s World Cup game will be shown around the ground on TVs in places such as the East Stand Long Room. The scheduling of the Vitality Blast will also be a big factor. There are counties who start that competition on Thursday and most others on Friday, so pushing the Championship back a day would eat into valuable preparation time.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cIn my mind I have had the following list for a long time: Ajax-Arsenal-Barcelona. Call it the Marc Overmars route,\u201d Frenkie de Jong said this past week. \u201cBut then again, if you can go directly to Barcelona, then you are right where you want to be. Faster than you ever dared to dream.\u201d It is six years since another elegant Ajax midfield graduate decided to leave in search of his fortune, opting for north London after helping to secure a third successive Eredivisie title under Frank de Boer. Christian Eriksen, born in Middelfart \u2013 a small town at the gateway to Funen, Denmark\u2019s third-largest island \u2013 had arrived in the Dutch capital as a teenager in 2008, spurning interest from, among others, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United to continue Ajax\u2019s tradition of developing top Danish talent. He was spotted playing for Odense\u2019s youth team by John Steen Olsen, the celebrated Scandinavian scout whose long list of discoveries includes S\u00f8ren Lerby, Jan Molby and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. His latest prot\u00e9g\u00e9 fulfilled the early promise by becoming the youngest player to appear at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. In stark contrast to De Jong\u2019s generation Ajax struggled to compete with Europe\u2019s elite under De Boer and exited the Champions League at the group stages in three successive seasons between 2010-11 and 2012-13, by which time Eriksen had indicated it was time to move on, having allowed his contract to enter its final 12 months. Tottenham, flush with money from the world-record \u00a385m sale of Gareth Bale to Real Madrid, signed the 21-year-old for \u00a311m \u2013 one of seven signings by Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas that summer, including the \u00a326m Roberto Soldado. Only Eriksen and \u00c9rik Lamela remain, with the Dane having developed into one of Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s key players. Sixty assists and 49 goals from 209 Premier League appearances tell only half the story of a midfielder who is so often the architect of Spurs\u2019 attacks from deep and is regularly among the players to cover the greatest distance in the league. Eriksen signed a new four-year deal in 2016 worth an estimated \u00a375,000 a week and his representatives resisted attempts to bring him in line with the club\u2019s highest earners last summer when Tottenham told suitors he was not for sale. \u201cThere were three clubs, two English and one foreign, interested in paying a huge amount to Spurs,\u201d his agent, Martin Schoots, said last month. \u201cFor the club it was then a no-go area and for Christian not a must-have. I have the impression we are in a new situation now.\u201d Eriksen\u2019s typically polite and unassuming admission to a Danish newspaper that \u201cI might want to try something new\u201d a few days after Tottenham\u2019s defeat in the Champions League final was designed to encourage Real Madrid to follow through with their reported interest, although no offer has been forthcoming despite a \u00a3270m spending spree. Zinedine Zidane\u2019s apparent preference to sign Paul Pogba from Manchester United and Tottenham\u2019s asking price \u2013 believed to have been set as high as \u00a3130m by the chairman, Daniel Levy \u2013 have left him in limbo. Eriksen has fallen foul of the increasing trend of clubs holding out for big fees for players who have entered the final year of their contracts, even if Spurs will be under pressure not to allow one of their star performers to leave for free given the financial commitments at their stadium. Eden Hazard\u2019s transfer to Real for an initial \u00a388.5m was the most any club have paid for a player in such a situation \u2013 an astronomical fee for someone who would have been free to sign a pre-contract agreement with them next January. Other than Madrid, only a handful of sides have the resources and stature to attract Eriksen given the platform he has been provided by Tottenham\u2019s progression under Pochettino. Juventus, masters of the free-agent signing, have long been credited with an interest but may decide to hold off for now given their attempts to bring back Pogba and the presence of Aaron Ramsey. Barcelona \u2013 perhaps his spiritual home, given the Ajax upbringing \u2013 have been embroiled in a messy pursuit of Neymar and Antoine Griezmann yet could certainly do much worse than adding his guile in tandem with De Jong, while Bayern Munich appear to be preoccupied with their long overdue quest to replace Arjen Robben and Franck Rib\u00e9ry. United\u2019s failure to reach the Champions League means they are not an option and a move to another team in England is seemingly out of the question at the moment. Liverpool have heavily invested in his position and, even though Pep Guardiola must have considered Eriksen as a potential replacement for David Silva when the playmaker finally departs Manchester City at the end of next season, being 28 by then will probably work against him.

      "body": "<p>As I write, I am about to celebrate a major birthday (yes, 40 \u2026 <em>again</em>), and while I\u2019d rather not think too much about my face, my bum and various other body parts \u2013 I\u2019d rather not think about them because, in fact, I don\u2019t dislike them even half as much as the world tells me I should \u2013 this seems a good moment to take stock. For half a century now, I have been a hearty eater (ie a greedy pig). For 30 years, I have been a cook: first a rubbish one, then quite a competent one. For a quarter of a century, I have written about food, or edited writing about food by other people. What, then, have I learned so far? What are the bullet points? Uncap your pens, and we will begin\u2026</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Let\u2019s get the pomposity out of the way. Food, and by extension the ability to cook it, is very important. This cannot be overstated. Good food makes people happy and healthy. It punctuates the days in the loveliest and, sometimes, the most memorable ways. It connects to kindness, to generosity and even, I think, to sanity. But you don\u2019t have to take my word for this. \u201cGood cooking is a moral agent,\u201d wrote Joseph Conrad in his introduction to the cookbook his wife Jessie published in 1923. <em>Joseph bloody Conrad</em>. I rest my case.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Tomatoes should never be kept in the fridge.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> People are getting fussier. This isn\u2019t only true of the young. People my age (which, as I said, is 40) are getting fussier, too. Some of this, admittedly, may be the result of the best intentions (eg born-again veggies), but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that there\u2019s a certain amount of aggro involved in accommodating all the various intolerances, loathings and nervous states.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/01/spaghetti-carbonara-recipe-felicity-cloake\" title=\"\">Spaghetti carbonara</a> is the best stand-by late-night supper ever invented, and it comprises pasta, pancetta, eggs, cheese and black pepper. Add cream, and you have ruined perfection. (Don\u2019t email me about this.)</p> <p><strong>5</strong> I am suspicious of people who do not have a bag of peas in their freezer. What do you eat with your emergency fish fingers if not frozen peas? Frozen peas are so brilliant. Stew them with butter, any old lettuce leaves and a few sliced spring onions, <em>et voila</em>, you have <em>petits pois a la </em><em>Francaise</em> to go with your roast chicken. Alternatively \u2013 this is nicked from Nigella \u2013 roast a garlic bulb and then blitz it with some parmesan, olive oil and frozen peas. Spread on toast for delicious and posh-seeming crostini.</p> <p><strong>6</strong> People with the swankiest kitchens are very often the worst cooks. Knowing this helps with kitchen envy, from which I suffer badly.</p> <p><strong>7</strong> Whatever people say, there is no substitute for butter. I like toast on mine. Also, salt: chefs use a lot more than the rest of us, which is why their food tastes so good. When in doubt, add salt.</p> <p><strong>8</strong> If someone is feeling a bit fragile or sad, give them a dinner that involves roast potatoes: starch for the soul.

      "bodyText": "As I write, I am about to celebrate a major birthday (yes, 40 \u2026 again), and while I\u2019d rather not think too much about my face, my bum and various other body parts \u2013 I\u2019d rather not think about them because, in fact, I don\u2019t dislike them even half as much as the world tells me I should \u2013 this seems a good moment to take stock. For half a century now, I have been a hearty eater (ie a greedy pig). For 30 years, I have been a cook: first a rubbish one, then quite a competent one. For a quarter of a century, I have written about food, or edited writing about food by other people. What, then, have I learned so far? What are the bullet points? Uncap your pens, and we will begin\u2026 1 Let\u2019s get the pomposity out of the way. Food, and by extension the ability to cook it, is very important. This cannot be overstated. Good food makes people happy and healthy. It punctuates the days in the loveliest and, sometimes, the most memorable ways. It connects to kindness, to generosity and even, I think, to sanity. But you don\u2019t have to take my word for this. \u201cGood cooking is a moral agent,\u201d wrote Joseph Conrad in his introduction to the cookbook his wife Jessie published in 1923. Joseph bloody Conrad. I rest my case. 2 Tomatoes should never be kept in the fridge. 3 People are getting fussier. This isn\u2019t only true of the young. People my age (which, as I said, is 40) are getting fussier, too. Some of this, admittedly, may be the result of the best intentions (eg born-again veggies), but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that there\u2019s a certain amount of aggro involved in accommodating all the various intolerances, loathings and nervous states. 4 Spaghetti carbonara is the best stand-by late-night supper ever invented, and it comprises pasta, pancetta, eggs, cheese and black pepper. Add cream, and you have ruined perfection. (Don\u2019t email me about this.) 5 I am suspicious of people who do not have a bag of peas in their freezer. What do you eat with your emergency fish fingers if not frozen peas? Frozen peas are so brilliant. Stew them with butter, any old lettuce leaves and a few sliced spring onions, et voila, you have petits pois a la Francaise to go with your roast chicken. Alternatively \u2013 this is nicked from Nigella \u2013 roast a garlic bulb and then blitz it with some parmesan, olive oil and frozen peas. Spread on toast for delicious and posh-seeming crostini. 6 People with the swankiest kitchens are very often the worst cooks. Knowing this helps with kitchen envy, from which I suffer badly. 7 Whatever people say, there is no substitute for butter. I like toast on mine. Also, salt: chefs use a lot more than the rest of us, which is why their food tastes so good. When in doubt, add salt. 8 If someone is feeling a bit fragile or sad, give them a dinner that involves roast potatoes: starch for the soul. (While we\u2019re on roast potatoes, always make twice as many you think you will need.) 9 Cheese is everything. I knew this at eight years old, eating brie for the first time in long grass at the side of a French road, and I know it now I am \u2026 um, older. 10 As Julian Barnes wisely notes in The Pedant in the Kitchen, most of us have too many cookbooks. You probably don\u2019t need a new one, and you might also want to cull some of those you already own (Easy Recipes from the Kazakh Steppe; Aquafaba for Ninnies). My most loved and best used cookbooks are Roast Chicken and Other Stories by Simon Hopkinson and Margaret Costa\u2019s Four Seasons Cookery Book. I\u2019m also fond of Rowley Leigh\u2019s No Place Like Home. His crab linguine is the best (NB involves butter). And no, I don\u2019t read cookbooks in bed.

      "body": "<p>After 27 years of misery brought about by unrelenting cock\u2011ups whenever the cricketing nations of the world have come together, England now have another go at winning the one-day trophy that matters.</p> \n<p>All was quiet here on the eve of the match except in the real tennis court behind the pavilion, which has been transformed into a press room. There was not a spare seat to be found as Eoin Morgan and Kane Williamson addressed the world\u2019s media, both captains calm yet excited. Both sides lauded the qualities of their opponents. Morgan acknowledged the influence of Brendon McCullum, one of his best friends, in England\u2019s resurgence. Given McCullum was also Williamson\u2019s predecessor as Kiwi captain he is in the happy position of being able to claim some responsibility whichever side prevails, though he is too much of a gentleman to do that.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/13/eoin-morgan-england-world-cup-final-new-zealand\">Eoin Morgan says England World Cup victory would inspire the nation</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Given the Kiwi press corps would struggle to fill a minibus, here was a reminder that cricket\u2019s greatest global event was about to take place. Yet all was serenity out in the middle, at least until the crucial advertising mats were being meticulously pinned down 30 yards beyond the stumps.</p> \n<p>As ever the outfield resembles a massive putting green, albeit a tricky one given the slope. On Sunday the ball will slide across what always appears to be frictionless grass at a remarkable pace. The pitch looked surprisingly green from a distance though Morgan said that the covering of grass was sparser when viewed from close quarters.</p> \n<p>Even so, whichever captain wins the toss may have pause for thought. In the first half of the tournament everybody wanted to bowl first; in the second everyone wanted to bat. Ideally, it will not be a decisive toss. The side batting first in the four games here in this tournament has won every time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a467dc20-9a45-4248-9ca2-fb6679a1a83a\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Only one batsman, Albert Trott back in 1899, has launched a cricket ball over the pavilion at Lord\u2019s, but Jason Roy has his sights set on joining him after escaping a ban for today\u2019s World Cup final against New Zealand.</p>\n    <p>It's a fanciful notion, but Roy\u2019s response when this feat was put to him \u2013 'Oh really? Let\u2019s try to get an opportunity tomorrow' \u2013 was in keeping with the relaxed mood as England prepared for the game of their lives.</p>\n    <p>Having struck three successive sixes twice in this tournament \u2013 including an effort off Steve Smith that found the Edgbaston&nbsp;pavilion\u2019s upper tier \u2013 Roy is probably as equipped as any to repeat Trott\u2019s blow.</p>\n    <p>But the incendiary opener, averaging 71 in the campaign, nearly missed out on the final following a significant show of dissent towards the umpire during the win over Australia. Roy has apologised to the umpire,&nbsp;Kumar Dharmasena, and was fined.</p>\n    <p>'To get out like that was slightly disappointing, and I probably showed it more than I should have,' Roy said. 'But&nbsp;it\u2019s&nbsp;professional sport&nbsp;and emotions run high.' <i>Ali Martin</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hopefully the quality of the best team will decide the outcome. Most certainly a new team will win the trophy. After 12 tournaments West Indies, India, Australia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have won the World Cup. This will be England\u2019s fourth time in the final. In 1979, against West Indies, they fell 92 runs short despite an opening partnership of 129 between Mike Brearley and Geoff Boycott. The problem was they took so many overs to get there.</p> \n<p>After Brearley\u2019s dismissal, the first in the innings, England scored another 65 runs. I have been trying to think of a parallel between Brearley and Boycott and Jonny Bairstow and Jason Roy, who are opening the batting 40 years later \u2013 and I have failed.</p> \n<p>In 1987, England were closer to the trophy, losing to Australia by seven runs in Kolkata in a match always signposted by Mike Gatting\u2019s unsuccessful reverse sweep to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/13/england-cricket-world-cup-final-losers\" title=\"\">Allan Border\u2019s first delivery</a>.</p> \n<p>In 1992, in Melbourne, England controlled much of the final against Imran Khan\u2019s cornered tigers but the irresistible combination of Wasim Akram and Mushtaq Ahmed saw them off when they were 22 runs short of their target. Thereafter, England have consigned themselves to the wasteland after a sequence of hapless campaigns \u2013 until now.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"849d1aff20bd036bba30b13d7ac66d73a212d1ba\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/849d1aff20bd036bba30b13d7ac66d73a212d1ba/158_47_2244_1788/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trent Boult is Kane Williamson\u2019s banker on a ground where left-arm pacemen have enjoyed themselves against England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"797\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trent Boult is Kane Williamson\u2019s banker on a ground where left-arm pacemen have enjoyed themselves against England.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>New Zealand will have five players who appeared in their nation\u2019s one and only final <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/mar/29/australia-new-zealand-world-cup-final\" title=\"\">four years ago against Australia</a> in Melbourne: Williamson, Ross Taylor, Martin Guptill, Trent Boult and Matt Henry.</p> \n<p>In that World Cup under the leadership of McCullum, New Zealand were fearless and refreshing and, as far as Australia\u2019s wicketkeeper, Brad Haddin, was concerned, much too nice. The Kiwis captured the imagination of their nation but upon crossing the Tasman for the final they were swept away by Australia.</p> \n<p>Perhaps that experience will help them. Even so, New Zealand enter this match as the underdogs. It might suit them if the grass stays on the surface and their bowlers spy some encouragement. They have prospered in low-scoring matches in this tournament, which may also explain why so few of their batsmen are in mid-summer form.</p> \n<p>Williamson has stapled their batting together quite brilliantly in his understated way. He has been dismissed once under 40 and that was when he was run out for 27 at the bowler\u2019s end <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/03/england-new-zealand-match-report\" title=\"\">at Chester-le-Street</a> via Mark Wood\u2019s fingertips. He has not devastated but he has not needed to; he has batted at an old-fashioned tempo as his side compiled old fashioned scores that have often been sufficient to win the game.</p> \n<p>His main ally has been the veteran Ross Taylor. The disappointment has been Martin Guptill, who has tormented England in the past, though he has done his best to atone by a serious of brilliant manoeuvres in the field.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/13/new-zealand-cricket-fans-dare-to-hope\">New Zealand\u2019s cricket fans also know the pain of seizing defeat from the jaws of victory</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Williamson\u2019s bowlers have been more helpful. His banker is Trent Boult on a ground where left-arm pacemen \u2013 such as Mitchell Starc and Jason Behrendorff \u2013 have enjoyed themselves recently against England. Lockie Ferguson has been one of the more unexpected stars in a tournament where few new names have barged in to the cricketing firmament. Matt Henry and Jimmy Neesham have provided handy support along with the stately Colin de Grandhomme, whose batting has been more threatening than his bowling.</p> \n<p>England are fortified by the fact that they have won three do-or-die matches on the way to the final. All of their batsmen have made runs along the way. Recently, they have not been required to do much because of the excellence of the Bairstow and Roy, who have struck four century partnerships in a row.</p> \n<p>Morgan has even been spared selectorial dilemmas. He has used 13 players in the tournament and there will be no change at Lord\u2019s. He has picked the same team in the past three games and he is likely to stick with that combination. Chris Woakes and Adil Rashid have become more confident about their bowling and their bodies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There are logical reasons for English supporters to be optimistic.

      "bodyText": "After 27 years of misery brought about by unrelenting cock\u2011ups whenever the cricketing nations of the world have come together, England now have another go at winning the one-day trophy that matters. All was quiet here on the eve of the match except in the real tennis court behind the pavilion, which has been transformed into a press room. There was not a spare seat to be found as Eoin Morgan and Kane Williamson addressed the world\u2019s media, both captains calm yet excited. Both sides lauded the qualities of their opponents. Morgan acknowledged the influence of Brendon McCullum, one of his best friends, in England\u2019s resurgence. Given McCullum was also Williamson\u2019s predecessor as Kiwi captain he is in the happy position of being able to claim some responsibility whichever side prevails, though he is too much of a gentleman to do that. Given the Kiwi press corps would struggle to fill a minibus, here was a reminder that cricket\u2019s greatest global event was about to take place. Yet all was serenity out in the middle, at least until the crucial advertising mats were being meticulously pinned down 30 yards beyond the stumps. As ever the outfield resembles a massive putting green, albeit a tricky one given the slope. On Sunday the ball will slide across what always appears to be frictionless grass at a remarkable pace. The pitch looked surprisingly green from a distance though Morgan said that the covering of grass was sparser when viewed from close quarters. Even so, whichever captain wins the toss may have pause for thought. In the first half of the tournament everybody wanted to bowl first; in the second everyone wanted to bat. Ideally, it will not be a decisive toss. The side batting first in the four games here in this tournament has won every time. Hopefully the quality of the best team will decide the outcome. Most certainly a new team will win the trophy. After 12 tournaments West Indies, India, Australia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have won the World Cup. This will be England\u2019s fourth time in the final. In 1979, against West Indies, they fell 92 runs short despite an opening partnership of 129 between Mike Brearley and Geoff Boycott. The problem was they took so many overs to get there. After Brearley\u2019s dismissal, the first in the innings, England scored another 65 runs. I have been trying to think of a parallel between Brearley and Boycott and Jonny Bairstow and Jason Roy, who are opening the batting 40 years later \u2013 and I have failed. In 1987, England were closer to the trophy, losing to Australia by seven runs in Kolkata in a match always signposted by Mike Gatting\u2019s unsuccessful reverse sweep to Allan Border\u2019s first delivery. In 1992, in Melbourne, England controlled much of the final against Imran Khan\u2019s cornered tigers but the irresistible combination of Wasim Akram and Mushtaq Ahmed saw them off when they were 22 runs short of their target. Thereafter, England have consigned themselves to the wasteland after a sequence of hapless campaigns \u2013 until now. New Zealand will have five players who appeared in their nation\u2019s one and only final four years ago against Australia in Melbourne: Williamson, Ross Taylor, Martin Guptill, Trent Boult and Matt Henry. In that World Cup under the leadership of McCullum, New Zealand were fearless and refreshing and, as far as Australia\u2019s wicketkeeper, Brad Haddin, was concerned, much too nice. The Kiwis captured the imagination of their nation but upon crossing the Tasman for the final they were swept away by Australia. Perhaps that experience will help them. Even so, New Zealand enter this match as the underdogs. It might suit them if the grass stays on the surface and their bowlers spy some encouragement. They have prospered in low-scoring matches in this tournament, which may also explain why so few of their batsmen are in mid-summer form. Williamson has stapled their batting together quite brilliantly in his understated way. He has been dismissed once under 40 and that was when he was run out for 27 at the bowler\u2019s end at Chester-le-Street via Mark Wood\u2019s fingertips. He has not devastated but he has not needed to; he has batted at an old-fashioned tempo as his side compiled old fashioned scores that have often been sufficient to win the game. His main ally has been the veteran Ross Taylor. The disappointment has been Martin Guptill, who has tormented England in the past, though he has done his best to atone by a serious of brilliant manoeuvres in the field. Williamson\u2019s bowlers have been more helpful. His banker is Trent Boult on a ground where left-arm pacemen \u2013 such as Mitchell Starc and Jason Behrendorff \u2013 have enjoyed themselves recently against England. Lockie Ferguson has been one of the more unexpected stars in a tournament where few new names have barged in to the cricketing firmament. Matt Henry and Jimmy Neesham have provided handy support along with the stately Colin de Grandhomme, whose batting has been more threatening than his bowling. England are fortified by the fact that they have won three do-or-die matches on the way to the final. All of their batsmen have made runs along the way. Recently, they have not been required to do much because of the excellence of the Bairstow and Roy, who have struck four century partnerships in a row. Morgan has even been spared selectorial dilemmas. He has used 13 players in the tournament and there will be no change at Lord\u2019s. He has picked the same team in the past three games and he is likely to stick with that combination. Chris Woakes and Adil Rashid have become more confident about their bowling and their bodies. There are logical reasons for English supporters to be optimistic. No doubt the same was true among West Indian fans in 1983 and Australian ones in Lahore in 1996 when India and Sri Lanka were victorious against the odds. Take nothing for granted. After all, this is a World Cup final.",

It will be hot and the roads are going to be rough, literally. The region is renowned amongst riders for the poor quality of the road surfacing, which might sound slightly diva-ish but over the course of 200km it strains the legs. Add into that some narrow tracks and tricky ascents for what should offer a test for the entire peloton.</p> <p>There is a interesting wrinkle in the day\u2019s final climb up C\u00f4te de la Jailli\u00e8re. It is only a short 2km burst but with gradients at 7.6% and occasionally far steeper and at 10km from the finish there is a designated eight point-bonus mark. Introduced to create some interest for the yellow jersey, if a rider close can take the eight seconds at the summit and then hold on for the stage victory they will earn an 18-second bonus in the GC standings. You imagine that Julian Alaphilippe, heavily tipped as today\u2019s victor, fancies that incentive as he plots a route back into the yellow jersey that he and his Deceuninck-QuickStep team needlessly let slip on Thursday. </p> <p>Other theories are that this could be a day for a breakaway but how often in recent Tour de France history has that been allowed to happen? Perhaps a big break with no GC contenders? It is a stage that suits a man of Alejandro Valverde\u2019s talents but will Movistar let one of their triumvirate freelance for a stage win? At 2:55 down he could be let go but his team could well decide that he is better served to save his legs as a super domestique. </p> <p>There are plenty of questions, but hopefully none of them will be \u201ccan you wake me up for the sprint?\u201d</p> <p>Catching up?

      "bodyText": "That is it from me for today\u2019s live coverage of Tour de France stage eight. Jeremy Whittle\u2019s report from Saint Etienne will soon follow, as well as plenty of other cycling coverage before tomorrow\u2019s Bastille Day stage. Tom Davies will be the one to guide you through stage nine from around 11am tomorrow. Thomas speaks! \u201cI\u2019m fine but obviously [crashing] was frustrating, it was a key moment in the race. Woodsy crashed, that took out Gianni and me. I just got tangled up in Gianni\u2019s bike a bit, took a bit of time get going. Wout did a great job and closed the gap for the final bit and slowly moved up the group. When I got to the top 20-15 that\u2019s then when they sprinted over the top for the seconds. I was gassed kind of a bit. \u201cIt\u2019s annoying and frustrating but to get back like I did shows the legs are there. You just don\u2019t want to ever give any unnecessary time away.\u201d You what? De Gendt speaks! \u201cWith 70km to go we started to ride a bit faster, King and Terpstra dropped, so it was just Di Marchi and I. We kept riding pretty full till to the last climb. The bunch was coming closer so I had to go solo and try to stay ahead of them and it was just by five or ten seconds. \u201cI had a really good feeling all day but we only got five minutes, then it went down really fast to three and a half. We didn\u2019t go easy or push that hard on the climb where the feed zone was. After that we went full because those that were pulling before started to drop, so that was a moment to try and get a bigger gap again. \u201cWhen we got four minutes I started to believe again. We almost crashed in a few corners, but from 70km to go I started to believe in victory. Still, it hurts, it hurts so much.\u201d And here are the latest GC standings with Alaphilippe in yellow: Here are the provisional final standings. Good effort from Thomas to get back after that crash but this was really all about De Gendt and Alaphilippe. Alaphilippe takes the yellow jersey back ahead of Bastille Day! The rest of the contenders all cross together as we await confirmation of the final time checks. 1. De Gendt 2. Pinot +6sec 3. Alaphilippe ST 4. Matthews +26sec 5. Sagan ST What a break! De Gendt puts his hands on his head, unable to believe the result as he crosses the line. Pinot takes second, Alaphilippe third. 1km to go. De Gendt is away you think, glory for him. Now the focus goes back to the distance between the Alaphilippe-Pinot group and the contenders behind. 2km to go. Alaphilippe is pushing hard, De Gendt is just ahead by some 16sec. Can he hold on? 3.5km to go. If De Gendt can make it up this 900m ramp he could hang on for victory. Alaphilippe might get yellow but he and Pinot are not making on any more ground on the peloton. 5km to go. The peloton are panicking, all the pursuers are on the radio. Maybe just peddle, lads? De Gendt is holding out ahead, around 20sec ahead of Alaphilippe and Pinot, with the latter struggling. 9km to go. Pinot and Alaphilippe are working together and have around 15sec on the chasers and are 10 sec behind De Gendt. Pinot is with him and the chase is on behind. He is the drama we were promised. De Gendt got the eight second bonus but Alaphilippe picked up six, the Frenchman is gunning for yellow. 13km to go. At the front De Gendt has gone it alone, with De Marchi unable to hold the wheel. The Belgian has less than a minute on the main group now but once he is over the top of Jailli\u00e8re he will fancy his chances. Thomas looks to be getting back on, with Wout Poels pacing him up. 15km to go. Thomas takes a tumble as one of the Team Ineos riders slips on a turn. He is quickly back in the saddle, but Gianni Moscon\u2019s bike has snapped in half! Ineos are pacing Thomas back but lost 20-odd seconds to the peloton. The gap for the break is now less than 1min 30sec and shrinking. EF Education first are burying themselves at the front of the peloton, perhaps trying to set up Alberto Bettiol. All results remain possible with the key men all still placed apart from Wout van Aert, a pre-stage tip, who has been dropped. 25km to go. Alaphilippe is clearly feeling good. With that mechanical sorted he is even going back to the team car to get bottles for himself and teammate Enric Mas. 31km to go. It is mostly a downhill run now as the riders head towards the C\u00f4te de la Jailli\u00e8re and that climb for the eight bonus seconds. You feel the break, just a couple of minutes ahead, will be reeled in before then. 38km to go. Brian Smith on Eurosport thinks that the De Gendt and De Marchi\u2019s chances of success are dwindling. Astana are pulling hard on the front of the peloton and the gap is down to 2min 30sec so he could well be right. 45km to go. De Gendt and De Marchi still have 3min so sec on the peloton but King and Terpstra are back in the main bunch. Here are the polka dot point results from the C\u00f4te d\u2019Aveize: 1. De Gendt, 5pts 2. De Marchi, 3pts 3. King, 2pts 4. Omar Fraile, 1pt 50km to go. Lots of excitement on Eurosport as they focus on Sagan struggling to stay on the back of the peloton, baffling. With less than kilometre to the summit Sagan will easily be able to make up any gaps on the descent. As the kilometres tick down are the break\u2019s chances of victory increasing? 55km to go. The peloton, which is around 3min 55sec down on the two leaders, has seen Bahrain\u2013Merida\u2019s Dylan Teuns go off the back on the climb, according to race radio. The Belgian is currently third on GC. Astana climber Luis Le\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez has also apparently fallen back. 60km to go. With De Gendt and De Marchi at 45sec ahead of Terpstra and King, with the peloton at 3min 50sec, the Italian is lucky to escape a serious crash as he misses a turn on the descent. De Marchi gets back to De Gendt as they approach the penultimate categorised climb of the day. 67km to go. We have a split in the breakaway, De Gendt and De Marchi have left their fellow leaders behind on the climb and opened up a 20 second gap to Terpstra and King. They are all over the C\u00f4te de la Croix de Part now though. The King of the Mountain points going thus: 1. De Gendt, 5pts 2. De Marchi, 3pts 3. Terpstra, 2pts 4. King, 1pt it has also been confirmed that Cofidis\u2019 Christophe Laporte has abandoned. 69km to go. A little issue for Alaphilippe at the start of the climb, the Frenchman was looking down at this chain and apparently has a mechanical issue. He could well need a bike change but there is enough time for him to get back, the only question will be what that takes out of him. Meanwhile the break has been working hard and gone back out to almost four minutes ahead. 71km to go. We are climbing again, this could well be where the break is ultimately undone. The gap is back down to around three minutes. Bad news for the break? 84km to go. Perhaps at the behest of De Gendt, the break has pulled out the time gap back to 3min 20sec with the race in a bit of a lull before the next climb sees the riders go up the C\u00f4te de la Croix de Part. De Gendt still doing his job for the team. Over the C\u00f4te d\u2019Affoux he took a couple more King of the Mountain points, King took the other one on offer. 101km to go. Up and over the Cote d\u2019Affoux, the breakaway\u2019s gap is now just three minutes. There has been some cracks beginning to emerge amongst the foursome up the road, De Gendt and De Marchi sharing some terse words with suggestions that the Belgian was unhappy with effort being put in by the CCC rider. The Lotto-Soudal man could well disappear off up the road if he feels the riders around him holding back his chances of victory. David Hindle emails in... The thought is beginning to propagate that perhaps Alaphilippe isn\u2019t completely without hope for the GC. Pyrenees will certainly be interesting on this front. Thomas will overhaul him, you\u2019d imagine. But he may not be completely without hope of the podium. But in general, it\u2019s funny how Alaphilippe is treated in this regard. He can really climb with the best of them. I would certainly agree with that, David. With Alaphilippe the question is not so much his climbing but how he maintains a challenge over the course of a three-week race. If he is looking good in the Pyrenees then it will be interesting to see what kind of resources Deceuninck\u2013Quick-Step give him to compete. A hairy moment for Geraint Thomas. Looks like I missed this during lunch, but the Team Ineos co-leader appeared to suffer a mechanical. According to race radio Thomas is now back in the pack. 115km to go. I am back from a quick dash to [insert well-known sandwich chain]. The break is now just 3min 20 sec, but they are are over the Col de la Croix de Paquet. Here are the polka dot points from there: 1. De Gendt, 5pts 2. King, 3pts 3. De Marchi, 2pts 4. Niki Terpstra, 1pts Catching up, De Gendt also took the mountain points at the Col de la Croix de Thel, here are those results: 1. De Gendt, 5pts 2. King, 3pts 3. De Marchi, 2pts 4. Terpstra, 1pt At this point I am going to run out for a quick spot of lunch. But never fear, any major updates will still be covered. 127km to go. The breakaway\u2019s advantage continues to shrink as they head up Col de La Criox de Thel. It is now down to around four minutes, this could could well keep falling but the quality of the riders in that lead group suggests they will fight to stay away. De Gendt, who has history riding into Saint Etienne from his 2017 Dauphin\u00e9 win there, in particular will be dangerous. Bora-Hansgrohe have taken up the front of the peloton and are pushing hard. After getting out to beyond five minutes the break is now starting to be reeled back in, it is now down to 4min 40sec. The break has passed the over the summit of Col de la Croix Montmain with De Gendt soaking up the King of the Mountain points to help his Lotto Soudal teammate Tim Wellens stay in the polka dot jersey. Here is how that mini-battle panned out: 1. De Gendt, 5 pts 2. King, 3 pts 3. De Marchi, 2 pts 4. Terpstra, 1 pts Thibaut Pinot and the rest of the Frenchmen in the peloton will certainly be keen to make their mark this weekend but I am not sure today is one for the GC contenders. Alaphilippe on the other hand... The break is making its way up the Col de la Croix Montmain, stage eight\u2019s first and seemingly most straightforward climb. The time gap back to the peloton continues to hover around the five minute mark. The points classification now reads: 1. Peter Sagan, 187 pts 2. Sonny Colbrelli, 129 pts 3. Elia Viviani, 128 pts 4. Michael Matthews, 125 pts 5. Caleb Ewan, 76 pts And here is how that sprint shook out: Elia Viviani, Peter Sagan and Michael Matthews make up the demi-podium as the peloton goes through the sprint marker at Cercie. Bahrain-Merida\u2019s Sonny Colbrelli came in fourth. Here is how that shakes out in terms of points: 5. Viviani, 11 pts 6. Sagan, 10 pts 7. Matthews, 9 pts 8. Colbrelli, 8 pts Terpstra takes the 20 points on offer in the points race in uncontested fashion. We should see more competition when the main group comes through in about five minutes. As the breakaway group nears a five-minute lead on the peloton, Jonathan Harris-Bass is talking about beaujolais wine on Eurosport. The leaders are about a kilometre out from the intermediate sprint, the day\u2019s first point of action. De Marchi has now joined De Gendt, Terpstra and King at the front. The four-man break has around 3min 55sec on the peloton. How fast do you need to ride to get in the break? Well today it was around 47km/h: I think it is safe to say that with the gap growing to more than two minutes that this trio will be allowed to stay away, at least for the time being. De Marchi is still in pursuit, around 35 second back, and as the break continues to gain time De Gendt, Terpstra and King could let the Italian join, but it is not happening quickly though. CCC\u2019s Alessandro De Marchi is now after the trio up the road after W\u00fcrtz failed to bridge. Early stages but the time gap continues to grow. We have a trio of breakaway riders. Thomas de Gendt (Lotto Soudal), Niki Terpstra (Total Direct \u00c9nergie) and Ben King (Dimension Data) have gone off front, with Katusha\u2019s Mads W\u00fcrtz in pursuit. They have about 30 seconds on the peloton at the moment with CCC on the front weighing up whether to try and put the effort in to bring them back. In case you did not know, it is Bastille Day tomorrow: A quick update, Tejay van Garderen is out of the Tour. The EF Education First rider was not considered a GC contender but his absence will not help Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n in the Colombian\u2019s bid for yellow. The American broke his hand in an early crash on Friday and has been forced to abandon. And we\u2019re off... kind of. The flag drops to signal the end of the neutral zone at around 7km, there is an early sprint so we could well have action from the gun. The countdown is on at the start line. The jerseys are all placed at the front, riders are twitchily checking their tyres and streets are packed. Time for the rollout. Stage eight, Saturday 13 July, M\u00e2con \u2013 Saint \u00c9tienne, 200km \u201cI don\u2019t think [Saturday] will affect the GC, but it will certainly be a tough day,\u201d said Geraint Thomas after stage seven. After Friday\u2019s bore de France, ASO had to offer up something to re-energise the viewing public and it looks like they have delivered. The Tour\u2019s first saunter into La Massif Central features four category two climbs - difficult but not a real challenge for the general classification contenders - amongst plenty of lesser bumps. It will be hot and the roads are going to be rough, literally. The region is renowned amongst riders for the poor quality of the road surfacing, which might sound slightly diva-ish but over the course of 200km it strains the legs. Add into that some narrow tracks and tricky ascents for what should offer a test for the entire peloton. There is a interesting wrinkle in the day\u2019s final climb up C\u00f4te de la Jailli\u00e8re. It is only a short 2km burst but with gradients at 7.6% and occasionally far steeper and at 10km from the finish there is a designated eight point-bonus mark. Introduced to create some interest for the yellow jersey, if a rider close can take the eight seconds at the summit and then hold on for the stage victory they will earn an 18-second bonus in the GC standings. You imagine that Julian Alaphilippe, heavily tipped as today\u2019s victor, fancies that incentive as he plots a route back into the yellow jersey that he and his Deceuninck-QuickStep team needlessly let slip on Thursday. Other theories are that this could be a day for a breakaway but how often in recent Tour de France history has that been allowed to happen? Perhaps a big break with no GC contenders? It is a stage that suits a man of Alejandro Valverde\u2019s talents but will Movistar let one of their triumvirate freelance for a stage win? At 2:55 down he could be let go but his team could well decide that he is better served to save his legs as a super domestique. There are plenty of questions, but hopefully none of them will be \u201ccan you wake me up for the sprint?\u201d Catching up? Here\u2019s Jeremy Whittle\u2019s report from stage seven...",

To a certain hetero mindset, it seems there are two distinct groups \u2013 cultural gays (acceptable), and sexual gays (unacceptable!). Some people pride themselves on \u201ctolerating\u201d what they perceive as cultural gays, but then recoil from evidence of their sexuality. Perhaps that\u2019s when they start pompously opining to people with clipboards about non-acceptance \u2013 as though somehow their homophobia had been forced upon them by gay people who just had to go and spoil everything by having sex.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/jul/06/pride-in-london-parade-in-pictures\">Pride in London parade \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The day might come when gay people are surveyed about their distaste at heterosexual sex (\u201cunnatural in the eyes of God!\u201d), when gay people are as unhealthily obsessed with policing straight sex as certain straight people are with policing gay sex. Then again, I doubt it. Certainly, it\u2019s depressing that, even today, people think they have a right to condemn the gay sex they\u2019re never likely to have \u2013 and for that squeamishness to affect the safety and happiness of others on a daily basis.</p> <p>While this bizarre disconnect has long been an issue, it seemed to be under control. Now the figures are starting to move even slightly the other way, things seem more ominous, if only because they may hint at more illiberal attitudes lurking beneath.

While this may be difficult for the modern, fashion-conscious celebrity, Diana had discovered the answer to being papped \u2013 instead of ducking and diving in hats and shades, just wear the same boring top.</p> <h2>Too many firsts dishonour the students who work hardest</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56653e852cc91a34184ee8a228f33812e9ba8c2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56653e852cc91a34184ee8a228f33812e9ba8c2a/0_196_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rear shot of university graduates in cap and gowns.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Office for Students has found that firsts were awarded to three out of 10 graduates at English universities in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Radburn/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Who\u2019d have imagined that commodifying university education \u2013 to the point where a student \u201cclientele\u201d could demand customer satisfaction in the form of stellar results, leading to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/11/government-calls-on-ofs-to-clamp-down-on-university-grade-inflation\" title=\"\">widespread grade inflation</a> \u2013 would lead to trouble? Oh hang on.</p> <p>The universities regulator, the Office for Students, has found that first-class degrees were awarded last summer to almost three out of 10 graduates at English universities \u2013 almost double the amount of firsts in 2011 (the year before fees trebled).</p> <p>At first I wondered if some of this could be because students are working harder to justify the cost of their degrees. However, it transpires firsts and 2:1s are being achieved by 70% of those who scored three Ds or less at A-level. Erm, sorry, young people \u2013 even allowing for academic improvement on the 70%\u2019s part, it all looks a tad suspicious. There\u2019ll still be people who richly deserve their top degrees, although the outside world would be hard-pressed to tell them apart from the others. What are employers supposed to do \u2013 focus on A-level results, and ignore the inexplicably elevated degrees? What then is the point of a degree?</p> <p>There are calls for greater clarification and transparency from the universities involved. Good.

      "bodyText": "The number of people believing there is nothing wrong with gay sex has fallen for the first time since the Aids crisis. The British Social Attitudes survey puts it at dipping from 68% in 2017 to 66% in 2018, leaving a third of the population in some way opposed. NatCen, who conducted the survey, said that, while further polling was advisable, \u201cliberalisation of attitudes does seem to be slowing down\u201d. The findings coincide with the first decrease in more than a decade of people comfortable with pre-marital sex. On the plus side, last week also saw the Commons victory for gay legislation in Northern Ireland. Still, what a hammering same-sex couples have had recently \u2013 everything from attacks on buses to Ann Widdecombe (the Aunt Lydia of Brexit, anyone?) pondering how science could \u201cproduce an answer\u201d to gayness. In this context, is the NatCen survey indicative of new attitudes, or yet more evidence that people are feeling bolder about expressing previously veiled prejudices? Part of the problem seems to lie with gay sex in particular, rather than gay people generally, the bizarre phenomenon of almost \u201cenforced asexuality\u201d, where gay people (or anyone non-straight) can be accepted, even celebrated, but only so long as the \u201csex stuff\u201d is played down to the point of being undetectable. This often seemed to be the \u201cproblem\u201d with the late George Michael \u2013 that he was an actively sexual gay man, and didn\u2019t care who knew it. To a certain hetero mindset, it seems there are two distinct groups \u2013 cultural gays (acceptable), and sexual gays (unacceptable!). Some people pride themselves on \u201ctolerating\u201d what they perceive as cultural gays, but then recoil from evidence of their sexuality. Perhaps that\u2019s when they start pompously opining to people with clipboards about non-acceptance \u2013 as though somehow their homophobia had been forced upon them by gay people who just had to go and spoil everything by having sex. The day might come when gay people are surveyed about their distaste at heterosexual sex (\u201cunnatural in the eyes of God!\u201d), when gay people are as unhealthily obsessed with policing straight sex as certain straight people are with policing gay sex. Then again, I doubt it. Certainly, it\u2019s depressing that, even today, people think they have a right to condemn the gay sex they\u2019re never likely to have \u2013 and for that squeamishness to affect the safety and happiness of others on a daily basis. While this bizarre disconnect has long been an issue, it seemed to be under control. Now the figures are starting to move even slightly the other way, things seem more ominous, if only because they may hint at more illiberal attitudes lurking beneath. In 2019, it\u2019s high time the overtly and covertly prejudiced got over their issues with gay sex \u2013 to accept that gay people are sexual beings, not asexual toys for straight people to play with, and project on to. Sweatshirt let Diana hide from the paparazzi in plain sight A top worn by Princess Diana has been sold at auction in the US for more than \u00a340,000 \u2013 about 10 times the expected price. Diana gave the garment to her friend and personal trainer, Jenni Rivett, who\u2019ll use the proceeds to help a Malawian family. Just a sweatshirt with the Virgin Atlantic logo on it, it presumably went for so much partly because it was Diana\u2019s \u201canti-paparazzi\u201d top. She would put it on every time she went to the gym to deter paps from photographing her \u2013 they\u2019d just get the same shot every time. So it wasn\u2019t just any old top \u2013 it was Diana\u2019s customised pap-repellent. It wouldn\u2019t do to overstate Diana\u2019s aversion to the paparazzi \u2013 in life, she enjoyed (and endured) a complex, symbiotic relationship with the media. However, the top ruse was clever, and it\u2019s perhaps significant that it was gym-based. In one incident, a secret camera was rigged inside a gym, to take aerial shots of Diana working out with her legs splayed. Grim. Today, you hear occasionally of celebrities pulling the same stunt \u2013 wearing the same outfit repeatedly so that photographs of them become less valuable. While this may be difficult for the modern, fashion-conscious celebrity, Diana had discovered the answer to being papped \u2013 instead of ducking and diving in hats and shades, just wear the same boring top. Too many firsts dishonour the students who work hardest Who\u2019d have imagined that commodifying university education \u2013 to the point where a student \u201cclientele\u201d could demand customer satisfaction in the form of stellar results, leading to widespread grade inflation \u2013 would lead to trouble? Oh hang on. The universities regulator, the Office for Students, has found that first-class degrees were awarded last summer to almost three out of 10 graduates at English universities \u2013 almost double the amount of firsts in 2011 (the year before fees trebled). At first I wondered if some of this could be because students are working harder to justify the cost of their degrees. However, it transpires firsts and 2:1s are being achieved by 70% of those who scored three Ds or less at A-level. Erm, sorry, young people \u2013 even allowing for academic improvement on the 70%\u2019s part, it all looks a tad suspicious. There\u2019ll still be people who richly deserve their top degrees, although the outside world would be hard-pressed to tell them apart from the others. What are employers supposed to do \u2013 focus on A-level results, and ignore the inexplicably elevated degrees? What then is the point of a degree? There are calls for greater clarification and transparency from the universities involved. Good. That said, universities have long been caught between a rock and a hard place: tasked with maintaining academic standards, while hamstrung by funding, and judged on ratings from student clients, some of whom may feel that a first is something they\u2019ve already paid for before they open a book. What a mess, and one that\u2019s been tirelessly flagged since fees were introduced more than two decades ago. The lesson here is that grade inflation helps nobody \u2013 it\u2019s an insult to deserving students, past and present, and makes laughing stocks of modern graduates. Slowly but surely, the very concept of higher education is being debased. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

Some drivers were bored, others were furious.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s unfuckingbelievable.

The group staged simultaneous events throughout Saturday \u2013 a traffic block hailed \u201ca swarm\u201d at the Olympic park, a critical mass bike ride down the A10, a people\u2019s assembly outside Hackney town hall and an all-day gathering at London Fields of talks and panels.

As a decentralised movement aiming to work without hierarchy, it has spawned numerous self-organised branches worldwide and has a presence in at least 80 countries. \u201cI\u2019ve stopped following how many because it\u2019s breaking my brain but it\u2019s going according to plan; we wanted to be gigantic.

      "bodyText": "Extinction Rebellion has staged a blockade in Dalston, east London, disrupting traffic at its busiest central junction. Car horns, sirens and swearing competed with drumming protesters, singing and hula dancing. On Saturday the group kicked off a weekend of activity ahead of its summer uprising this week, which aims to disrupt five major UK cities and shock people into action against the climate crisis. About 50 protesters lined the road with banners reading \u201cthank you for your patience\u201d and \u201csorry for the disruption\u201d in the hope of placating the public for the seven-minute intervals during which they blocked traffic. Some drivers were bored, others were furious. \u201cIt\u2019s unfuckingbelievable. Fucking peasants, arseholes \u2013 you lot take the fucking piss,\u201d shouted the driver of a truck from a recycling and waste management company. He told the protesters his clients were waiting and that his job was at risk. Tiranthe Amarasinghe, a \u201cconscientious protector\u201d who works in financial services, engaged him in a chat about Extinction Rebellion\u2019s aims. \u201cNothing changes anyway, we\u2019re fucked, none of this will work, mate,\u201d insisted the driver. Extinction Rebellion\u2019s east London uprising was three months in the planning. The group staged simultaneous events throughout Saturday \u2013 a traffic block hailed \u201ca swarm\u201d at the Olympic park, a critical mass bike ride down the A10, a people\u2019s assembly outside Hackney town hall and an all-day gathering at London Fields of talks and panels. Amarasinghe was keen to stress the latter was not a party or festival. On the streets, the reception was curious \u2013 largely warm rather than hostile. Several families joined the general hubbub, and passersby stopped to read the leaflets being handed out. Ian Dickinson, a conservation biologist who has been with the movement since its formation, said: \u201cThere is more than enough data to tell us we should be taking drastic action now and we\u2019re not. We\u2019ve got solutions out there as well, but we\u2019re not using them, there\u2019s no point arguing about this stuff, the problem is engaging the middle.\u201d Dickinson admitted to being taken aback by Extinction Rebellion\u2019s rapid global success. As a decentralised movement aiming to work without hierarchy, it has spawned numerous self-organised branches worldwide and has a presence in at least 80 countries. \u201cI\u2019ve stopped following how many because it\u2019s breaking my brain but it\u2019s going according to plan; we wanted to be gigantic. We just had more modest expectations,\u201d he said. In the final seven-minute swarm of the morning, police officers quickly intervened as a blue van swerved around traffic and accelerated towards the line of rebels, who held steady and kept smiling. \u201cPeople think activism is for those with all the time in the world,\u201d said Amarasinghe, who works long hours in the City. \u201cIt isn\u2019t. Since April I\u2019ve noticed that Extinction Rebellion are really getting the message out and I\u2019m giving this as much time as I can.

      "body": "<p>Computer pioneer Margaret Hamilton was critical to landing astronauts on the moon for the first time on 20 July 1969 and returning them safely a few days later. The young Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) computer programmer and working mother led the team that created the onboard flight software for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/06/everyones-going-to-the-moon-again-apollo-11-50th-aniversary\" title=\"\">Apollo missions, including Apollo 11</a>. The computer system was the most sophisticated of its day. Her rigorous approach was so successful that no software bugs were ever known to have occurred during any crewed Apollo missions. \u201cShe symbolises that generation of unsung women who helped send humankind into space,\u201d said President Barack Obama in 2016 when he awarded Hamilton the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States\u2019 highest civilian award. In 2017, she was one of a handful of Nasa women to be immortalised as a <a href=\"https://shop.lego.com/en-LT/product/Women-of-NASA-21312\" title=\"\">Lego figurine</a>.On the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing, Hamilton, 82, looks back on her trailblazing work in computing.</p> <p><strong>What got you into software engineering? There were no </strong><strong>computer science degrees when you were starting out\u2026</strong><br>I got married in 1958, just after I graduated in math with a minor in philosophy from Earlham College [in Indiana]. We both had assistantships to attend graduate school \u2013 me in abstract math and my husband in chemistry \u2013 but in the meantime I had taught high school for a year, we had my daughter, and my husband decided he wanted to go to law school at Harvard. I found a job to support our family at the nearby Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It was in the laboratory of Prof <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/27/weather\" title=\"\">Edward Lorenz</a>, the father of chaos theory, working on a system to predict weather. He was asking for math majors. To take care of our daughter, we hired a babysitter. Here I learned what a computer was and how to write software. Computer science and software engineering were not yet disciplines; instead, programmers learned on the job. Lorenz\u2019s love for software experimentation was contagious, and I caught the bug.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was fortunate to have a\u00a0very modern husband. There\u00a0were some men who understood equality</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>How did you end up joining the Apollo project in 1964?</strong><br>I had moved to writing software for detecting enemy aircraft at MIT\u2019s Lincoln Laboratory. I was planning to resume graduate school when my husband saw a newspaper advert. The MIT Instrumentation Laboratory was looking for people to develop software to \u201csend man to the moon\u201d. The lab had received the Nasa contract to build the onboard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/30/apollo-11-review-a-front-row-seat-for-the-moon-landing\" title=\"\">flight software for the Apollo project</a>, having already been selected to design the computer hardware. I was attracted both by the sheer idea and the fact that it had never been done before. I was the first programmer to join and the first woman they hired. Male engineers were already working on the project, but they were hardware engineers and it wasn\u2019t their thing. I had it as my background. I think [the lab] just figured that I could handle the unknown.</p> <p><strong>You first worked on the software for the unmanned Apollo missions. But you were gradually promoted to lead the team developing the software for the manned spacecraft, including Apollo 11. What did your job entail?</strong><br>There were two onboard computers \u2013 one on the command module, Columbia, and one on the lunar module, Eagle. Our task included developing the software to run on each and the systems software they shared. At the beginning, nobody thought software was that big a deal.

      "bodyText": "Computer pioneer Margaret Hamilton was critical to landing astronauts on the moon for the first time on 20 July 1969 and returning them safely a few days later. The young Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) computer programmer and working mother led the team that created the onboard flight software for the Apollo missions, including Apollo 11. The computer system was the most sophisticated of its day. Her rigorous approach was so successful that no software bugs were ever known to have occurred during any crewed Apollo missions. \u201cShe symbolises that generation of unsung women who helped send humankind into space,\u201d said President Barack Obama in 2016 when he awarded Hamilton the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States\u2019 highest civilian award. In 2017, she was one of a handful of Nasa women to be immortalised as a Lego figurine.On the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing, Hamilton, 82, looks back on her trailblazing work in computing. What got you into software engineering? There were no computer science degrees when you were starting out\u2026 I got married in 1958, just after I graduated in math with a minor in philosophy from Earlham College [in Indiana]. We both had assistantships to attend graduate school \u2013 me in abstract math and my husband in chemistry \u2013 but in the meantime I had taught high school for a year, we had my daughter, and my husband decided he wanted to go to law school at Harvard. I found a job to support our family at the nearby Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It was in the laboratory of Prof Edward Lorenz, the father of chaos theory, working on a system to predict weather. He was asking for math majors. To take care of our daughter, we hired a babysitter. Here I learned what a computer was and how to write software. Computer science and software engineering were not yet disciplines; instead, programmers learned on the job. Lorenz\u2019s love for software experimentation was contagious, and I caught the bug. How did you end up joining the Apollo project in 1964? I had moved to writing software for detecting enemy aircraft at MIT\u2019s Lincoln Laboratory. I was planning to resume graduate school when my husband saw a newspaper advert. The MIT Instrumentation Laboratory was looking for people to develop software to \u201csend man to the moon\u201d. The lab had received the Nasa contract to build the onboard flight software for the Apollo project, having already been selected to design the computer hardware. I was attracted both by the sheer idea and the fact that it had never been done before. I was the first programmer to join and the first woman they hired. Male engineers were already working on the project, but they were hardware engineers and it wasn\u2019t their thing. I had it as my background. I think [the lab] just figured that I could handle the unknown. You first worked on the software for the unmanned Apollo missions. But you were gradually promoted to lead the team developing the software for the manned spacecraft, including Apollo 11. What did your job entail? There were two onboard computers \u2013 one on the command module, Columbia, and one on the lunar module, Eagle. Our task included developing the software to run on each and the systems software they shared. At the beginning, nobody thought software was that big a deal. But then they began to realise how much they were relying on it. The group grew so there were approximately 100 software engineers on my team. Astronauts\u2019 lives were at stake. Our software needed to be ultra-reliable and it needed to be able to detect an error and recover from it at any time during the mission. And it all had to fit on the hardware.

It created much havoc and required the mission to be reconfigured. After that, they let me put the program change in, all right. The astronauts get most credit for landing on the moon.

      "bodyText": "Eoin Morgan has called on his England players to deliver an iconic sporting moment that inspires the nation by winning their first World Cup at the most famous cricket ground of all. With Lord\u2019s a picture, the weather set fair, the match televised free of charge across Sky and Channel 4, and the only major sporting distraction a handful of motor cars and tennis players, Sunday\u2019s final between the previously uncrowned England and New Zealand has all the ingredients to be a classic. Morgan, expected to name an unchanged side from the one that tore through Australia in Thursday\u2019s semi-final at Edgbaston, is under no illusions about the enormity of the occasion and its transformational potential. Morgan said: \u201cI haven\u2019t allowed myself to think about lifting the trophy. Sport and cricket in particular is very fickle. If you ever get ahead of yourself, it always seems to bite you in the backside. \u201cBut for us to win it, around the country it would be awesome \u2013 great for the game. It would be quite iconic and certainly in young kids\u2019 memories if they are watching it at home and we manage to lift the trophy. It would be awesome.\u201d Regardless of the result, Morgan knows his trailblazing side have secured a place in English cricket history. They have risen from the despair of a miserable group-stage exit four years ago to No 1 in the world rankings thanks to a diverse set of talents embracing their captain\u2019s dynamic style. No side during this time can match their 65 ODI wins, their 44 totals in excess of 300 \u2013 India are next best with 25 \u2013 nor their 2,389 fours and 582 sixes. England\u2019s attack, a homogeneous collection of right-arm fast-mediums and an off-spinner for years, now boasts the electric pace of Jofra Archer and Mark Wood, as well as a top-class wrist-spinner in Adil Rashid. Morgan said: \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognise the work that has been done and the foundations that have been laid. It\u2019s not just for this World Cup, it\u2019s for the future. \u201cWe\u2019d all like to be contenders going into every World Cup and not just an afterthought, as we probably have been before. That\u2019s a lot of hard work behind us and we\u2019ve earned the right to be in the final because of that. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all or nothing.\u201d His ambitions for the team are slightly compromised by his employers, with the England and Wales Cricket Board set to relegate the men\u2019s domestic 50-over cup to secondary status when the currently unloved 100-ball competition overlaps next year. Back in the here and now, England head into Sunday\u2019s final with a tailwind of goodwill \u2013 not least from the 101 England players to have featured in previous men\u2019s World Cups, who in a video produced by the Professional Cricketers\u2019 Association have sent messages of support. \u201cAs the only Englishman to play in all three losing finals \u2013 1979, 1987 and 1992 \u2013 I know the pain of losing,\u201d said Graham Gooch, the former England captain. \u201cYou\u2019ve played brilliantly so far. Believe in yourselves, everyone in our country is proud of you. Go and win the trophy.\u201d Morgan\u2019s one injury doubt before the match, Jonny Bairstow, is all set to play despite a groin niggle and with a green tinge to the pitch 24 hours out, the chances of Moeen Ali returning as a second spinner alongside Rashid appear to be slim. Before heading off for photographs with his opposite number, Kane Williamson, Morgan offered one final thought on proceedings, a reminder that Lord\u2019s \u2013 his home ground for Middlesex \u2013 often produces low-scoring affairs in ODI cricket and added: \u201cIt will be a bit of a battle.\u201d",

She certainly paid for a lack of match practice today, as well as a lack of matches this year against quality opponents. Was she nervous? She was moving slowly at the start, which is usually a sign she\u2019s feeling the pressure. But even if she had been sharper, I don\u2019t think it would have been enough against Halep in that form. That was one of the great Wimbledon final performances and the best match of Halep\u2019s life, a devastating display of aggression and consistency from a player we all thought was a counterpuncher. Halep will move up to No 4 in the rankings and could be back at No 1 by the time of the US Open, while Williams must regroup for another shot at that 24th grand slam, at a major where the pressure has often boiled over for her in previous years.

Flushing Meadows was also the scene of her infamous meltdown in the final against Naomi Osaka last year, which left her unwilling to play for rest of the season and, as she admitted this week, needing therapy.</p> \n  <p>Williams returned for the Australian Open, where she beat today\u2019s opponent, Simona Halep, in a superb last-16 encounter, before losing in the next round. By this point not only was her mind aching but so was her body. A knee injury contributed to her early defeat at the French Open last month and she arrived at Wimbledon seriously short of matches, having played only 12 all season.</p> \n  <p>But this has been a restorative fortnight for the seven-times champion. She has appeared calmer and more content as the rounds have gone by, her game no doubt sharpened by her Murena double act with Andy Murray. The indication in her 59-minute semi-final demolition of Barbora Strycova was that she is no longer crippled but inspired by what her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, calls the \u201cultimate\u201d piece of history, the reason she returned to tennis so quickly after a life-threatening labour and what drives her to continue playing at the age of 37.</p> \n  <p>While Williams is chasing history, Halep, who has battled her own emotions over the years, has her own motivations. Since winning her first grand slam at the French Open last year after three final defeats and a reputation as a big-match choker, the counter-punching Romanian has lost the world No 1 ranking and has not been beyond the last eight at a major. This is a first Wimbledon final for Halep but, given who she\u2019s facing over the net, she can play this match without pressure or expectation.</p> \n  <p>However, as the great Billie Jean King once said: \u201cPressure is a privilege \u2013 it only comes to those who earn it.\u201d This match will be played in Williams\u2019s mind as much as it will be on court. </p> \n  <p><strong>The mental battle begins at:</strong> 2pm BST</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-13T12:16:08.373Z\">at 1.16pm BST</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "That was a gracious press conference from Williams. She certainly paid for a lack of match practice today, as well as a lack of matches this year against quality opponents. Was she nervous? She was moving slowly at the start, which is usually a sign she\u2019s feeling the pressure. But even if she had been sharper, I don\u2019t think it would have been enough against Halep in that form. That was one of the great Wimbledon final performances and the best match of Halep\u2019s life, a devastating display of aggression and consistency from a player we all thought was a counterpuncher. Halep will move up to No 4 in the rankings and could be back at No 1 by the time of the US Open, while Williams must regroup for another shot at that 24th grand slam, at a major where the pressure has often boiled over for her in previous years. Thanks so much for your company today and this fortnight, do join Jacob tomorrow for Djokovic v Federer. Bye! Williams is being quizzed in the press conference room. She just played great. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a surprise. But I made way too many errors. I just have to figure out a way to win a final [to get that record-equalling 24th grand slam]. Maybe playing finals outside of a grand slam final would be really helpful. She was just getting so many balls back. I think I was over-hitting it and trying to go for too much. I can\u2019t say I blame injury. I wasn\u2019t injured when the tournament started which is a positive for me. I just need to keep going and moving forward. Any loss is not easy but when someone plays lights-out, there\u2019s not much you can do. You just have to accept it was their day. It seems every grand slam final I\u2019ve been in recently has been an unbelievable effort to get there. It would be interesting to see how it would be in different circumstances. And Donald McRae\u2019s interview with Halep from back in January is well worth a read. It helps explain why the new Wimbledon champion played with so much freedom today: Kevin Mitchell has been typing away furiously next to me and here\u2019s his match report: \u201cI\u2019m shocked,\u201d says John McEnroe on the BBC. \u201cHalep obviously is a tremendous and, at this stage in her career, the superior athlete. But I didn\u2019t think it would intimidate Serena Williams as much as it did today. \u201cHalep completely and thoroughly outplayed her. It wasn\u2019t even a match. There\u2019s only a handful of times in your life when you feel as though you\u2019re in the zone like that and that was one of them. \u201cWilliams has to get herself even fitter because at that level she can be exposed \u2013 especially if nerves come into play. Halep moves better than anyone on the tour. Why she thought she couldn\u2019t play well on grass I don\u2019t know. Maybe it took her a while to figure out. \u201cToday was the best match she\u2019s ever played and she\u2019s just beaten Williams in 55 minutes.\u201d The victory speech. Halep is still beaming as she looks at her name, which is already painted on the winners\u2019 board. There\u2019s nothing like Wimbledon efficiency. And here\u2019s the moment she\u2019s been waiting for, as she meets the Duchess of Cambridge. She\u2019s now out on the balcony of the clubhouse showing off the trophy. Lovely scenes. The championship point. A beaming champion speaks. \u201cHave you ever played a better match?\u201d asks Sue Barker. \u201cNever,\u201d replies Halep, still clutching the trophy, which I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be letting go of for a while. \u201cIt was the best match. I have worked a lot for this moment. It\u2019s an honour to play in front of the Royal Box. I don\u2019t have the words to explain. \u201cI had nerves! My stomach was not well before the match, but I came on court and gave my best. It\u2019s something special and I\u2019ll never forget this day. It\u2019s my mum\u2019s dream. She said that if I want to do something in tennis it is to play in the Wimbledon final. \u201cI told people in the locker room that if I win I will get membership for life, it was one of the motivations for me. \u201cI have worked a lot to change my game, to be able to win matches on grass. It was an amazing tournament and I can\u2019t wait to come back. It\u2019s been an honour.\u201d A great speech from a great champion. \u201cShe literally played out of her mind,\u201d says Williams. \u201cIt was a little bit deer in the headlights for me. Whenever a player plays like that you just have to take your hat off. I love coming out here, playing in front of you guys. It\u2019s literally a joy.\u201d Trophy time. Williams trudges up to collect her runners-up trophy and still manages to find a smile. As does Meghan in the Royal Box. Sadly no sign of any hostilities between her and Kate this afternoon, by the way. And here comes Halep to collect the Venus Rosewater Dish, which she proudly lifts above her head. Wow. I\u2019m not sure Halep has ever played better than that. Williams looks shell-shocked. She remains stuck on 23 grand slam titles. First it was Angelique Kerber here last year, then Naomi Osaka at the US Open, and now this. Much has been said about the history Williams is chasing, but history will still be made with a Halep victory. She\u2019d be the first Romanian to win Wimbledon, going one better than Illie Nastase who lost the epic 1972 final to Stan Smith. Halep opens confidently with a quick first point. 15-0. And she takes the second too after another wild and wayward Williams shot. 30-0. Make that 40-0, three championship points. Halep\u2019s heart must be jumping out of her chest. She misses her first serve and the net gods are on her side when her second clips the tape and goes over. She lands her second second serve ... and Williams goes on to net! Halep has claimed her first Wimbledon title, to add to the French Open she won last year! She\u2019s graduated from the group of one-slam champions and denies Williams the ultimate piece of tennis history with a quite devastating display! Second set: Williams 2-6, 2-5 Halep* (*denotes next server) Williams\u2019s box, including her mother, Oracene, and husband, Alexis Ohanian, look extremely worried. As does Williams. Her body language isn\u2019t at all positive. Only her second ace of the day gets her to game point. And she\u2019d hit 45 coming into this match. But she then clunks into the net. Deuce. Advantage Halep, break point, which would leave the Romanian serving for her first Wimbledon title. Advantage Williams. But there\u2019s a 24th unforced error. Deuce. Advantage Halep, a second break point. Game and break Halep, with a laser-like backhand down the line! Halep is a game away from becoming a Wimbledon champion! Second set: *Williams 2-6, 2-4 Halep (*denotes next server) However Halep has had some nightmares of her own over the years, especially that French Open final of 2017 when she snatched defeat from the jaws of victory against Jelena Ostapenko, having led by a set and 3-0. Will she be able to hold serve from here and close this out? There\u2019s no indication yet of any nerves, as Halep confidently comes through to 30. The former world No 1\u2019s still hitting so deep and true. Second set: Williams 2-6, 2-3 Halep* (*denotes next server) Williams finds herself in a bit of a hole at 0-30, which becomes even deeper at 15-40. Two break points. Williams looks as if she\u2019s got her spade and will dig herself out of it when she takes complete control of a lengthy rally but, at the net with plenty of the court to aim into, Williams blinks and biffs her backhand long! If Williams loses this match, she\u2019ll be having nightmares about that miss tonight. Second set: *Williams 2-6, 2-2 Halep (*denotes next server) But anything Williams can do ... Halep matches the love hold with one of her own, the highlight of which was a wonderful game of cat and mouse, in which Halep shows her cunning with a improvised volley before going on to prevail. She\u2019s still made only three unforced errors. She could probably out-Djokovic Djokovic with the consistency she\u2019s showing this afternoon. Second set: Williams 2-6, 2-1 Halep* (*denotes next server) Halep is only the second top-10 player Williams has faced this year, and the step up in class has been telling. But signs here that Williams is steadying herself. Some Hawk-Eye drama on opening point. They\u2019ll replay it. Williams wins through. As she does on the second, third and fourth points. Her second successive love hold after those two successive breaks at the start of the match. Second set: *Williams 2-6, 1-1 Halep (*denotes next server) \u201cCoco Gauff is probably feeling a little better about things right now,\u201d parps Stephen Cooper, referring to Halep\u2019s straight-sets win over tennis\u2019s newest star in the fourth round. Halep holds to 30. Second set: Williams 2-6, 1-0 Halep* (*denotes next server) Beware a wounded Williams, who roars from the depths of her being when a winning volley gets her to 15-all. She\u2019s going to have to summon all the strength she has to put away the inspired Romanian. She\u2019s upping the intensity of her serve, and takes the opening game of the second set to 30. A vital hold to staunch the flow after that brutal first set. At 15-all, a quite unbelievable point, in which Halep has to use all of her defensive skills to get her backhand back into play before forcing the mistake from Williams. Wonderful stuff. 30-15. Some more tremendous retrieving from Halep and it\u2019s 40-15, two set points. Williams releases some frustration with a forehand return winner. She goes for broke with another forehand on the second set point but it flies wide! Halep has the first set after 26 minutes of near flawless tennis! Can she maintain this level? First set: Williams 2-5 Halep* (*denotes next server) Williams holds to love to at least ask a question of Halep, who will soon step up to serve for the first set ... First set: *Williams 1-5 Halep (*denotes next server) Williams has almost become an honorary Brit what with her link-up with Andy Murray in the mixed doubles this fortnight and the crowd are urging her to get back into this, urging her to haul herself up off the canvas and get closer to that piece of history. She looks to be finding her feet at 15-30 on Halep\u2019s serve, having applauded the Romanian\u2019s winner on the previous point, but Halep has Williams on the run and the 37-year-old makes the error. Deuce. Advantage Williams, a first break point for her after a torrid start. Williams hoiks a forehand wide. Deuce. Advantage Halep. Some hard hitting from Williams, but Halep sees her opponent\u2019s power and raises it with a fizzing forehand winner that leaves Williams absolutely stranded! First set: Williams 1-4 Halep* (*denotes next server) Williams puffs out her cheeks after finally getting on the board, with a love hold. She has her head buried in her towel at the changeover, and gets some notes out of her bag. I doubt any of those notes predicted this scenario though. First set: *Williams 0-4 Halep (*denotes next server) Five winners for Halep so far and no unforced errors. No winners from Williams and seven unforced errors. And we thought Williams would be the attacking player. Halep\u2019s even out-acing Williams, the tournament ace leader, too, and one here helps her to a 30 hold. This is stunning stuff from the 2018 French Open champion in her first Wimbledon final. First set: Williams 0-3 Halep* (*denotes next server) Williams\u2019s footwork is usually the first thing that goes when she\u2019s nervous, it\u2019s as if she\u2019s had a ton of concrete poured into her shoes. And she\u2019s completely rooted to the grass when her serve out wide on break point at 30-40 is bludgeoned away by Halep for a backhand winner. Halep has the double break! Few would have seen this coming. First set: *Williams 0-2 Halep (*denotes next server) Much has been said in the build-up about whether we\u2019d see the relaxed Williams of this fortnight or the angst-ridden Williams who can collapse with records in sight. At the moment she looks like a woman who has the weight of history on her shoulders. Halep hurtles to 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, and takes the game when the umpire overrules a call, with Halep\u2019s backhand winner just catching the line. Halep\u2019s claimed eight of the opening 10 points and Williams is reeling. First set: Williams 0-1 Halep* (*denotes next server) So up steps Williams to get the 126th Wimbledon women\u2019s singles final under way. Williams\u2019s serve is the best shot in women\u2019s tennis or, as Martina Navratilova calls it, the weapon of mass destruction. She\u2019ll want to send Halep an early message here. Which she does with an unreturned serve on the first point. But Halep soon finds her groove with a forehand cross-court winner. 15-all. Another unreturned serve makes it 30-15 but two errors from the Williams racket and it\u2019s 30-40, an early break point! A third error and Halep has made the perfect start! Tik! Tok! Tikity! Tok! They\u2019re warming up. Meanwhile there could be a right royal scrap between duchesses in the Royal Box this afternoon. Halep was asked after her semi-final who she\u2019d most like to watch her today and she said Kate. She\u2019s got her wish. But Meghan is also here, supporting her good friend Serena. Spectators would have probably paid even more for their \u00a3185 tickets if they\u2019d known there was the prospect of these two going at each other from opposing corners. Other names in the Royal Box include former champions Martina Navratilova, Virginia Wade, Conchita Martinez and Marion Bartoli, along with Theresa May, who could tell Williams a thing or two about pressure. The coin toss. Williams has won the first battle and has elected to serve first. Here they come, weaving and winding their way through the corridors of the All England Club, both presented with bouquets of flowers before they step on to court, as is the pre-final tradition. And they\u2019ve not even won anything yet. They arrive to a spine-tingling standing ovation. Not that Williams fully heard it because she\u2019s got her headphones on. I bet she never tires of these moments even though this is her 11th Wimbledon final. Halep says: \u201cOf course, I respect a lot what she has done and what she\u2019s doing, but now I feel stronger mentally facing her. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great feeling to face Serena in a grand slam final. If you are able to win, it makes it sweeter.\u201d Williams says: \u201cI was calm [in the semi-final]. It\u2019s a day-to-day basis with me. We all know that. I\u2019m far from perfect. \u201c[Halep] finished the year No 1 twice in a row. I feel like she\u2019s back. She wants to prove that she can do it again. You can\u2019t underestimate her. She\u2019s like a little powerhouse.\u201d Tactics time. This is a fascinating match-up between the game\u2019s best attacker and best defender. Halep will make Williams run, just as Kerber did so successfully in last year\u2019s Wimbledon final. If Halep gets everything back, she could plant a seed of doubt in Williams\u2019s mind. And if Williams starts doubting herself, we know what can happen. But the crucial difference could be the serve. Halep\u2019s is not as strong as Kerber\u2019s and can be vulnerable against Williams, as shown by the fact Williams has won nine of their previous 10 meetings. And Williams\u2019s serve is the best in the business. And their fourth-round battle at the Australian Open this year: Highlights of their 2011 Wimbledon meeting, to get you in the mood: Road to the final. Both have had an easier time of it than they would have expected. Williams has faced only one top-20 player in Julia Goerges, while Halep has played only one seed, Elina Svitolina, although she did also end the challenge of Coco Gauff and the former world No 1 Victoria Azarenka. Williams First round def Giulia Gatto-Monticone 6-2, 7-5 Second round def Kaja Juvan 2-6, 6-2, 6-4 Third round def Julia Goerges 6-3, 6-4 Fourth round def Carla Suarez Navarro 6-2, 6-2 Quarter-final def Alison Riske 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 Semi-final def Barbora Strycova 6-1, 6-2 Halep First round def Aliaksandra Sasnovich 6-4, 7-5 Second round def Mihaela Buzarnescu 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 Third round def Victoria Azarenka 6-3, 6-1 Fourth round def Coco Gauff 6-3, 6-3 Quarter-final def Shuai Zhang 7-6 (4), 6-1 Semi-final def Elina Svitolina 6-1, 6-3 Tale of the tape. Williams - Halep 37 Age 27 10 World ranking 7 72 Singles titles 18 7 Wimbledon titles 0 9 Head-to-head 1 \u201cWhat Williams and Halep both share is a lingering fight with their emotions. Until Halep calmed her outer shell over the past couple of years, she was among the most volatile of competitors on the WTA Tour. Williams, as she admitted on Thursday after her best performance of the tournament \u2013 a 59-minute demolition of Barbora Strycova \u2013 cannot be sure from day to day how she will handle the pressures and expectations of her calling, even though she is by overwhelming consensus the finest player of her era ... She alternates between handling the responsibilities and rewards of greatness and being consumed by them.\u201d The words of our tennis correspondent, Kevin Mitchell. You can read his full preview here: A couple of results already in the wheelchair events: The player who Williams walloped in the semi-final, Barbora Strycova, is also in action this afternoon, in the women\u2019s doubles final, which takes place after the men\u2019s: Centre Court (2pm) (11) Serena Williams (USA) v (7) Simona Halep (Rom) (11) Nicolas Mahut (Fra) &amp; Edouard Roger-Vasselin (Fra) v (2) Juan Sebastian Cabal (Col) &amp; Robert Farah (Col) (3) Su-Wei Hsieh (Tpe) &amp; Barbora Zahlavova Strycova (Cze) v (4) Gabriela Dabrowski (Can) &amp; Yi Fan Xu (Chn) Court 1 (1pm) Daria Snigur (Ukr) v (10) Alexa Noel (USA) Mansour Bahrami (Irn) &amp; Chris Wilkinson (Gbr) v Jeremy Bates (Gbr) &amp; Andrew Castle (Gbr) Arnaud Clement (Fra) &amp; Michael Llodra (Fra) v Tommy Haas (Ger) &amp; Mark Philippoussis (Aus) Jonas Bjorkman (Swe) &amp; Todd Woodbridge (Aus) v Wayne Ferreira (Rsa) &amp; Mark Woodforde (Aus) Court 12 (11am) Richard Krajicek (Ned) &amp; Mark Petchey (Gbr) v Henri Leconte (Fra) &amp; Patrick McEnroe (USA) Kamilla Bartone (Lat) &amp; Oksana Selekhmeteva (Rus) v Polina Kudermetova (Rus) &amp; Giulia Morlet (Fra) Court 18 (11am) Aubane Droguet (Fra) &amp; Selena Janicijevic (Fra) v Savannah Broadus (USA) &amp; Abigail Forbes (USA) Arthur Fery (Gbr) &amp; Toby Samuel (Gbr) v (7) Liam Draxl (Can) &amp; Govind Nanda (USA) (1) Jonas Forejtek (Cze) &amp; Jiri Lehecka (Cze) v (3) Martin Damm (USA) &amp; Toby Kodat (USA) When Serena Williams left Wimbledon 12 months ago as the runner-up, falling just short in only her fourth tournament back after maternity leave as she attempted to draw level with Margaret Court\u2019s all-time record of 24 grand slam singles titles, it seemed that by the time she returned this year she would have matched Court\u2019s count if not overtaken it to become the game\u2019s undisputed greatest. But chasing history took its toll, just as it had in 2015 when, two wins from a calendar slam and Steffi Graf\u2019s Open era record of 22 majors, she collapsed under the not so considerable challenge of Roberta Vinci in the US Open semi-finals. Flushing Meadows was also the scene of her infamous meltdown in the final against Naomi Osaka last year, which left her unwilling to play for rest of the season and, as she admitted this week, needing therapy. Williams returned for the Australian Open, where she beat today\u2019s opponent, Simona Halep, in a superb last-16 encounter, before losing in the next round. By this point not only was her mind aching but so was her body. A knee injury contributed to her early defeat at the French Open last month and she arrived at Wimbledon seriously short of matches, having played only 12 all season. But this has been a restorative fortnight for the seven-times champion. She has appeared calmer and more content as the rounds have gone by, her game no doubt sharpened by her Murena double act with Andy Murray. The indication in her 59-minute semi-final demolition of Barbora Strycova was that she is no longer crippled but inspired by what her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, calls the \u201cultimate\u201d piece of history, the reason she returned to tennis so quickly after a life-threatening labour and what drives her to continue playing at the age of 37. While Williams is chasing history, Halep, who has battled her own emotions over the years, has her own motivations. Since winning her first grand slam at the French Open last year after three final defeats and a reputation as a big-match choker, the counter-punching Romanian has lost the world No 1 ranking and has not been beyond the last eight at a major. This is a first Wimbledon final for Halep but, given who she\u2019s facing over the net, she can play this match without pressure or expectation. However, as the great Billie Jean King once said: \u201cPressure is a privilege \u2013 it only comes to those who earn it.\u201d This match will be played in Williams\u2019s mind as much as it will be on court. The mental battle begins at: 2pm BST",

Caroline and Linda were great roles, but they\u2019re both quite angsty, they\u2019re not joyous, carefree characters. So it\u2019s nice putting on something that feels a bit lighter with the wonderful music of Harold Arlen, Johnny Mercer, Duke Ellington and Bessie Smith. It\u2019s fantastic jazz and blues music with superb close harmonies, and I adore singing in harmony.</p> <p><strong>How does it feel being </strong><strong>directed</strong><strong> by your wife, Susie McKenna</strong><strong>?</strong><br>It feels fabulous. People ask me all the time: \u201cIs it weird working together?\u201d But we fell in love working together at the <a href=\"https://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/mother-goose-casting-sharon-clarke_36028.html\" title=\"\">Hackney Empire</a>, so it\u2019s a situation we\u2019re very used to \u2013 and love. Also, it\u2019s a chance to see her. When we\u2019re both doing different shows we see each other very rarely, just on Sundays and Saturday mornings. So it\u2019s actually lovely to be having a laugh during the day and working together.</p> <p><strong>In the past year you\u2019ve had two huge back-to-back theatrical successes with </strong><em><strong>Caroline, or Change</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>Death of a Salesman.</strong></em><strong> Do you feel your time has come?</strong><br>I have been at it a long time \u2013 since 1988 \u2013 and it does feel like at last things have come together. I\u2019m a 30-year overnight sensation! It\u2019s nice to be at the point where people call me and say, \u201cListen do you want to meet and have a chat about doing this show?\u201d, rather than me continually auditioning, having to go in there and say: \u201cOK, this is my piece, now do you want to hear me sing Killing Me Softly?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d8b89d568f59cf795d4c1e19250821e21cc3427\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d8b89d568f59cf795d4c1e19250821e21cc3427/0_23_4720_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cast of the Young Vic\u2019s Death of a Salesman, left to right: Arinz\u00e9 Kene, Wendell Pierce, Sharon D Clarke and Martins Imhangbe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cast of the Young Vic\u2019s Death of a Salesman, left to right: Arinz\u00e9 Kene, Wendell Pierce, Sharon D Clarke and Martins Imhangbe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brinkhoff-Moegenburg/\u00a9 BrinkhoffM\u00f6genburg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Do you think the acting industry is becoming more diverse?</strong><br>The minute someone asks me that question, I think we\u2019re not there yet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve never felt hatred in London up to now. I don\u2019t want to live in a city where I don\u2019t feel safe to walk around</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>But do you see a change in the kind of parts </strong><strong>you are </strong><strong>offered?</strong><br>I\u2019ve been lucky. Because I do musical theatre as well as acting, I\u2019m not sitting around waiting for straight parts I can be shoehorned into. I\u2019ve seen change, but it is very slow. I attended my first Olivier awards in 1995, and at that point as black people, it was me and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/adrian-lester\" title=\"\">Adrian Lester</a> in the room. Just the two of us. So to go to the Oliviers now and look around and see an array of creeds and colours, that warms my heart. But when people ask me what do we do about speeding up change, I say I\u2019m just an actor trying to get a job, trying to keep food on my table, a roof over my head. We need to be looking at producers, casting directors, writers. We need these people to be thinking outside of the box. We need producers and directors to tell casting directors, your list is all white, bring me some people of colour. It\u2019s up to the people in the industry, who actually have the power to do it, to make the change.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s been your favourite </strong><strong>part ever?</strong><br>It would have to be Caroline, my first lead in the West End. It\u2019s such an amazing role; a wonderful singing role, but also there\u2019s the depth of the character. I think it made quite a few people see me in a different light. People go, \u201cYes she sings,\u201d but now they look at me as an actor, too.</p> <p><strong>Do you have a dream role?</strong><br>My dream role was always Effy in <em>Dreamgirls</em>. That\u2019s the only part I have ever really had my eye on. But when <em>Dreamgirls</em> did finally come to the West End, I was too old to play the part. There you go \u2013 as my mum has always said, what is for you, is for you. As for roles at the moment, I am quite happy to wait and see what comes my way. Everything up to now in my career has been a joy. If Quincy Jones wants to write a musical and put me in it, I\u2019d be extra happy.</p> <p><strong>When did you first realise </strong><strong>you wanted to be a performer?</strong><br>When I first went with a friend to a local dance school in Clapton where a little Jewish lady called Ivy taught us ballet and tap. My first panto was <em>Babes in the </em><em>Woods</em> when I was six, and that was it \u2013 I was absolutely hooked. The only other thing I\u2019m actually trained in is social work. That was something my mum and dad wanted me to do, so I\u2019d have something to fall back on, in case acting and singing didn\u2019t work out. And, you know, there is a social worker in me. I just really love talking to people. Before <em>Holby City</em>, which was when people started to recognise me, I\u2019d be on the bus and I\u2019d be the person people start telling their troubles to. I\u2019d be the one telling kids, no, you can\u2019t talk to your mum like that. I still counsel my mates. It\u2019s what I love to do.</p> <p><strong>What advice would you give to a young, black person wanting to become an actor today?</strong><br>I would advise them to get out there and see as much theatre as they possibly can. Go to drama school if you have the wherewithal, but also get out and see the craft in action. I always say to young people that they should usher: put yourself in a theatrical situation, in the building where you see actors coming in and out. You get some pocket money and you are privileged to watch a show each night which you can use as a masterclass.</p> <p><strong>What makes you happy?</strong><br>My people. My family, my good friends. Spending time with them, laughing, cooking; I love to cook, love to eat. I love to have people around the table, chatting. That\u2019s great joy for me. Ultimate happiness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b73c9a24e3e38106d49a4233b5a22e564fbb00cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b73c9a24e3e38106d49a4233b5a22e564fbb00cf/0_179_2953_1772/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon D Clarke and ensemble in Caroline, Or Change at the Playhouse theatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharon D Clarke and ensemble in Caroline, Or Change at the Playhouse theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Maybanks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What about what makes you angry</strong><strong>?</strong><br>Injustice and some of the madness I see happening in the world. I don\u2019t know what to do with it, and I know that as a gay, black female I\u2019ll have to fight for my rights at some point. I look at what\u2019s happening across the pond with women\u2019s rights and abortion rights and think, OK, if the Brexit thing happens, and we don\u2019t have a body overseeing us, what\u2019s going to happen to all the rights we fought hard for, over the years? They are slowly being taken away from us. The world just seems so topsy-turvy at the moment. It makes me very afraid.</p> <p><strong>Have you felt threatened recently?</strong><br>Susie and I went on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2019/jun/04/thousands-of-people-protest-against-donald-trumps-state-visit-video\" title=\"\">anti-Trump march</a> last month and we were walking back up Whitehall past a pub and there were a couple of guys outside who started shouting racist, homophobic stuff at us. We let it pass and they continued, so we started to answer back. A policeman turned around and said: \u201cAll right, ladies, keep it down.\u201d And I thought, hang on, these guys have been going off at us and you\u2019ve said nothing to them. Another time, I was working in <em>Caroline</em> at the Playhouse and I walked through Trafalgar Square when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/09/antiracist-marchers-in-london-claim-they-had-more-than-double-the-support-of-far-right-protest\" title=\"\">Tommy Robinson\u2019s Brexit rally</a> was on. I was just trying to get into work and I felt this hatred coming towards me. These people did not agree with me being on the street. I\u2019ve never felt hatred in London up to now. I don\u2019t want to be living in a city where I don\u2019t feel safe to walk around. That saddens me.</p> <p><strong>Does anything give you hope?</strong><br>Young people, like the young girl who talks about climate change...</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/11/greta-thunberg-schoolgirl-climate-change-warrior-some-people-can-let-things-go-i-cant\" title=\"\">Greta Thunberg</a></strong><strong>?</strong><br>Yes, young people like her are fabulous. Long may they reign. To those young people I say, I will uplift you and support you. And I thank God for them, because without them, we are lost.</p>",

Also, it\u2019s a chance to see her. When we\u2019re both doing different shows we see each other very rarely, just on Sundays and Saturday mornings. So it\u2019s actually lovely to be having a laugh during the day and working together. In the past year you\u2019ve had two huge back-to-back theatrical successes with Caroline, or Change and Death of a Salesman. Do you feel your time has come? I have been at it a long time \u2013 since 1988 \u2013 and it does feel like at last things have come together. I\u2019m a 30-year overnight sensation! It\u2019s nice to be at the point where people call me and say, \u201cListen do you want to meet and have a chat about doing this show?\u201d, rather than me continually auditioning, having to go in there and say: \u201cOK, this is my piece, now do you want to hear me sing Killing Me Softly?\u201d Do you think the acting industry is becoming more diverse? The minute someone asks me that question, I think we\u2019re not there yet. But do you see a change in the kind of parts you are offered? I\u2019ve been lucky. Because I do musical theatre as well as acting, I\u2019m not sitting around waiting for straight parts I can be shoehorned into. I\u2019ve seen change, but it is very slow. I attended my first Olivier awards in 1995, and at that point as black people, it was me and Adrian Lester in the room. Just the two of us. So to go to the Oliviers now and look around and see an array of creeds and colours, that warms my heart. But when people ask me what do we do about speeding up change, I say I\u2019m just an actor trying to get a job, trying to keep food on my table, a roof over my head. We need to be looking at producers, casting directors, writers. We need these people to be thinking outside of the box. We need producers and directors to tell casting directors, your list is all white, bring me some people of colour. It\u2019s up to the people in the industry, who actually have the power to do it, to make the change. What\u2019s been your favourite part ever? It would have to be Caroline, my first lead in the West End. It\u2019s such an amazing role; a wonderful singing role, but also there\u2019s the depth of the character. I think it made quite a few people see me in a different light. People go, \u201cYes she sings,\u201d but now they look at me as an actor, too. Do you have a dream role? My dream role was always Effy in Dreamgirls. That\u2019s the only part I have ever really had my eye on. But when Dreamgirls did finally come to the West End, I was too old to play the part. There you go \u2013 as my mum has always said, what is for you, is for you. As for roles at the moment, I am quite happy to wait and see what comes my way. Everything up to now in my career has been a joy. If Quincy Jones wants to write a musical and put me in it, I\u2019d be extra happy. When did you first realise you wanted to be a performer? When I first went with a friend to a local dance school in Clapton where a little Jewish lady called Ivy taught us ballet and tap. My first panto was Babes in the Woods when I was six, and that was it \u2013 I was absolutely hooked. The only other thing I\u2019m actually trained in is social work. That was something my mum and dad wanted me to do, so I\u2019d have something to fall back on, in case acting and singing didn\u2019t work out. And, you know, there is a social worker in me. I just really love talking to people. Before Holby City, which was when people started to recognise me, I\u2019d be on the bus and I\u2019d be the person people start telling their troubles to. I\u2019d be the one telling kids, no, you can\u2019t talk to your mum like that. I still counsel my mates. It\u2019s what I love to do. What advice would you give to a young, black person wanting to become an actor today? I would advise them to get out there and see as much theatre as they possibly can. Go to drama school if you have the wherewithal, but also get out and see the craft in action. I always say to young people that they should usher: put yourself in a theatrical situation, in the building where you see actors coming in and out. You get some pocket money and you are privileged to watch a show each night which you can use as a masterclass. What makes you happy? My people. My family, my good friends. Spending time with them, laughing, cooking; I love to cook, love to eat. I love to have people around the table, chatting. That\u2019s great joy for me. Ultimate happiness. What about what makes you angry? Injustice and some of the madness I see happening in the world. I don\u2019t know what to do with it, and I know that as a gay, black female I\u2019ll have to fight for my rights at some point. I look at what\u2019s happening across the pond with women\u2019s rights and abortion rights and think, OK, if the Brexit thing happens, and we don\u2019t have a body overseeing us, what\u2019s going to happen to all the rights we fought hard for, over the years? They are slowly being taken away from us. The world just seems so topsy-turvy at the moment. It makes me very afraid. Have you felt threatened recently? Susie and I went on the anti-Trump march last month and we were walking back up Whitehall past a pub and there were a couple of guys outside who started shouting racist, homophobic stuff at us. We let it pass and they continued, so we started to answer back. A policeman turned around and said: \u201cAll right, ladies, keep it down.\u201d And I thought, hang on, these guys have been going off at us and you\u2019ve said nothing to them. Another time, I was working in Caroline at the Playhouse and I walked through Trafalgar Square when Tommy Robinson\u2019s Brexit rally was on. I was just trying to get into work and I felt this hatred coming towards me. These people did not agree with me being on the street. I\u2019ve never felt hatred in London up to now. I don\u2019t want to be living in a city where I don\u2019t feel safe to walk around. That saddens me. Does anything give you hope? Young people, like the young girl who talks about climate change... Greta Thunberg? Yes, young people like her are fabulous. Long may they reign. To those young people I say, I will uplift you and support you. And I thank God for them, because without them, we are lost.",

The show is regarded as Netflix\u2019s flagship series, especially after the demise of <em>House of Cards</em>.

Last week, the company struck an exclusive deal to take over all the studio space at Shepperton Studios, home to productions such as Alien and Mamma Mia!, to make sure that the 40-plus productions it makes in the UK annually can be churned out without delay. It would be very helpful for Netflix if several of those productions turned into timeless classics, because rival studios and broadcasters are not as amicable as they once were. Best of the bunch Stranger Things The third series of the 1980s-set sci-fi horror has smashed Netflix records, with 40.7 million account holders watching the show in its first four days after release, making it the most-watched film or series in the streaming service\u2019s history. The show is regarded as Netflix\u2019s flagship series, especially after the demise of House of Cards. It is proving a hit with critics and is also a commercial cash cow \u2013 there are an estimated 75 brand tie-ins for its third season. House of Cards The one that propelled Netflix to global dominance. The series about a malevolent US presidentmay have lost its attraction following sexual assault allegations against star Kevin Spacey, who was hurriedly written out of the show, but the $100m deal to make the first two series of the high-quality political drama proved to be a smart gamble. Roma The film that gave Netflix the Hollywood credibility the company craved. Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s black-and-white, 70s-set foreign language drama won the Oscar for best director, finally making Netflix a force at the Academy Awards, the last bastion of the traditional film industry. Netflix has pushed some films into Oscar contention by giving them a limited theatrical release ahead of streaming \u2013 and has used the strategy to woo talent like Cuar\u00f3n. The Crown The lavish drama costs \u00a38m-\u00a310m an episode and has been a hit with subscribers and critics alike. Claire Foy scooped an Emmy award for her portrayal of the young Queen Elizabeth II. Orange is the New Black Set in a women\u2019s prison, with mostly unknown actors, the comedy-drama has won bags of awards. The seventh and final season of the series based on Piper Kerman\u2019s memoir is released this month. BoJack Horseman The bizarre animated comedy led by an alcoholic, washed-up actor who is an anthropomorphic horse launched in 2014 to mixed reviews. Subsequent seasons cemented the show as a bona fide hit with viewers and critics alike. ... AND TWO FAILURES The Get Down Baz Luhrmann may have enjoyed plenty of success on the big screen, from his hyper-stylised Romeo and Juliet to Moulin Rouge, but his first foray into television was a flop. With a budget of up to \u00a314m per episode The Get Down, a retelling of the founding of hip-hop, was cancelled after just one season. Marco Polo Netflix\u2019s historical saga lasted two seasons before the plug was finally pulled, reportedly resulting in a \u00a3160m loss.",

I like collecting \u2018stuff\u2019, especially things that feel as if they have a back story.\u201d With second-hand furniture, artists\u2019 prints and end-of-line fabrics, her 1930s house in Stamford, Lincolnshire, might be short on echoey white spaces, but it\u2019s got plenty of personality.</p> <p>Ruthie, her husband Michael and their sons Jasper, seven, and Felix, five, live in a house that was originally built as accommodation for a police officer. It hadn\u2019t been lived in for many years, but instead had been used as an overflow storage space for the police station a few doors down. \u201cThe rooms were full of recovered stolen bikes,\u201d Ruthie says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean just one or two \u2013 there were about 50, all in different shapes and sizes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"df15dc1beb663f1b4cb97149e56a46ccdd07d096\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df15dc1beb663f1b4cb97149e56a46ccdd07d096/0_0_6700_8942/749.jpg\" alt=\"Ruthie Hudson in the garden room, with wallpaper by Pearl Lowe for Woodchip & Magnolia.\" width=\"749\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruthie Hudson in the garden room, with wallpaper by Pearl Lowe for Woodchip &amp; Magnolia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Weeds and plants had taken root in the window frames and the garden was so overgrown they couldn\u2019t see where it ended. That abundance of space out the back was a bonus, as it meant that over the next few years they could extend the original two-up, two-down house, adding a larger kitchen, a garden room and two bedrooms.</p> <p>The newest addition is the garden room, a space that was inspired by a 1969 photograph of David Hockney and Sir Cecil Beaton, taken in Beaton\u2019s conservatory at Reddish House. \u201cEver since I saw that image of the two men surrounded by plants in a room with an elegant black and white tiled floor I\u2019d thought, \u2018I\u2019d love to sit in a space like that,\u2019\u201d Ruthie says.</p> <p>In her version, leafy fronds drape down from shelves, but in lieu of Beaton\u2019s mass of pink geraniums, Ruthie opted for a flowing floral wallpaper. \u201cSome patterns look lovely as a small sample, but when you get them on the wall the repeat can look too orderly. This one feels more natural, as if there\u2019s no beginning and no end.\u201d</p> <p>Ruthie has furnished this room with an old cabinet that she painted dark green and a vintage French table, a baby version of one in the kitchen. \u201cBoth tables came from <a href=\"https://www.iacf.co.uk/Newark\" title=\"\">Newark antiques fair</a>, but bought 10 years apart,\u201d says Ruthie. She found the larger one first, at a time when she was buying and selling vintage and mid-century furniture for a living.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c71d4d539c6391dc7f148600545ef8575bf60c1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c71d4d539c6391dc7f148600545ef8575bf60c1d/0_0_8409_6307/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mix it up: eras work together in a contemporary kitchen with a vintage French table from Newark antiques fair.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mix it up: eras work together in a contemporary kitchen with a vintage French table from Newark antiques fair.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen we were furnishing our first house I kept finding really beautiful pieces of old furniture and couldn\u2019t resist buying a few extras, which I put in the garage,\u201d she says.

Well, once your lots come up. In between, there\u2019s lots of just waiting, often in the cold\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Ruthie progressed from selling to friends to taking pitches at pop-up fairs. \u201cIt coincided with people we knew getting their first homes and wanting to furnish them stylishly but without spending loads of money,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>But some items never made it on to her stall. \u201cThere were a fair few things that I put in our house to photograph in order to sell them, but liked them so much that I kept them. It wasn\u2019t exactly a ruthless business plan,\u201d she says.</p> <p>A stall in Stamford market has also been a good source of fabrics, which Ruthie has used to re-cover old furniture. \u201cAlmost all our chairs, the footstool and a sofa have been given new life with end-of-roll materials I\u2019ve bought there,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Other fabrics came via Ruthie\u2019s first job. She worked in the production department of a publishing company, where samples and offcuts were sold off for charity once they had been photographed. A square of embroidered silk on the couple\u2019s bed is one such cast-off. \u201cIt had its moment in the news pages of the <em><a href=\"http://www.worldofinteriors.co.uk/\" title=\"\">World of Interiors</a></em> and is just beautiful. I\u2019d never have come across it if I hadn\u2019t worked there,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87cf07454bed327c91158a0a79769cf36a89550a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87cf07454bed327c91158a0a79769cf36a89550a/0_1654_6719_5225/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The couple\u2019s bedroom, with an embroidered silk offcut on the bed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"778\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The couple\u2019s bedroom, with an embroidered silk offcut on the bed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ruthie now works as an artist and a printmaker, making linocuts and using a 19th-century lithograph press that she bought on eBay. \u201cIt dates from 1856 so it\u2019s slightly temperamental and results can vary each time I make a print,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that lack of identikit perfection appeals to me.

Ruthie, her husband Michael and their sons Jasper, seven, and Felix, five, live in a house that was originally built as accommodation for a police officer. It hadn\u2019t been lived in for many years, but instead had been used as an overflow storage space for the police station a few doors down. \u201cThe rooms were full of recovered stolen bikes,\u201d Ruthie says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean just one or two \u2013 there were about 50, all in different shapes and sizes.\u201d Weeds and plants had taken root in the window frames and the garden was so overgrown they couldn\u2019t see where it ended. That abundance of space out the back was a bonus, as it meant that over the next few years they could extend the original two-up, two-down house, adding a larger kitchen, a garden room and two bedrooms. The newest addition is the garden room, a space that was inspired by a 1969 photograph of David Hockney and Sir Cecil Beaton, taken in Beaton\u2019s conservatory at Reddish House. \u201cEver since I saw that image of the two men surrounded by plants in a room with an elegant black and white tiled floor I\u2019d thought, \u2018I\u2019d love to sit in a space like that,\u2019\u201d Ruthie says. In her version, leafy fronds drape down from shelves, but in lieu of Beaton\u2019s mass of pink geraniums, Ruthie opted for a flowing floral wallpaper. \u201cSome patterns look lovely as a small sample, but when you get them on the wall the repeat can look too orderly. This one feels more natural, as if there\u2019s no beginning and no end.\u201d Ruthie has furnished this room with an old cabinet that she painted dark green and a vintage French table, a baby version of one in the kitchen. \u201cBoth tables came from Newark antiques fair, but bought 10 years apart,\u201d says Ruthie. She found the larger one first, at a time when she was buying and selling vintage and mid-century furniture for a living. \u201cWhen we were furnishing our first house I kept finding really beautiful pieces of old furniture and couldn\u2019t resist buying a few extras, which I put in the garage,\u201d she says. She began doing this when mid-century sideboards were having a moment and Stamford, Peterborough and the surrounding areas proved to be a rich \u2013 and cheap \u2013 hunting ground. \u201cI shopped at vintage fairs, auctions and charity shops and prices were far better than in other parts of the country,\u201d Ruthie says. Some of her best finds have been at auctions, both in Stamford and at more ramshackle barns out in the countryside. \u201cYou tend to get better things when you\u2019re there in person, rather than bidding over the phone or online,\u201d Ruthie says. \u201cAnd there\u2019s something about the buzz of being there that\u2019s great. Well, once your lots come up. In between, there\u2019s lots of just waiting, often in the cold\u2026\u201d Ruthie progressed from selling to friends to taking pitches at pop-up fairs. \u201cIt coincided with people we knew getting their first homes and wanting to furnish them stylishly but without spending loads of money,\u201d she adds. But some items never made it on to her stall. \u201cThere were a fair few things that I put in our house to photograph in order to sell them, but liked them so much that I kept them. It wasn\u2019t exactly a ruthless business plan,\u201d she says. A stall in Stamford market has also been a good source of fabrics, which Ruthie has used to re-cover old furniture. \u201cAlmost all our chairs, the footstool and a sofa have been given new life with end-of-roll materials I\u2019ve bought there,\u201d she says. Other fabrics came via Ruthie\u2019s first job. She worked in the production department of a publishing company, where samples and offcuts were sold off for charity once they had been photographed. A square of embroidered silk on the couple\u2019s bed is one such cast-off. \u201cIt had its moment in the news pages of the World of Interiors and is just beautiful. I\u2019d never have come across it if I hadn\u2019t worked there,\u201d she says. Ruthie now works as an artist and a printmaker, making linocuts and using a 19th-century lithograph press that she bought on eBay. \u201cIt dates from 1856 so it\u2019s slightly temperamental and results can vary each time I make a print,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that lack of identikit perfection appeals to me. You know that each print is done by hand.\u201d It\u2019s that love of personality over production-line \u201cperfection\u201d that characterises Ruthie and Michael\u2019s home. \u201cWhether it\u2019s furniture, clothes or art, I think it\u2019s far more interesting to see some signs of a life well lived.\u201d Ruthie Hudson Prints, rhprints.com",

No wonder: everything about this story, bar Campbell\u2019s ability to argue with an articulate conviction that Foster\u2019s decision barely deserved, is terrible. During his many interviews, Foster tried various methods of justifying his refusal to be alone with a professional woman doing her job. (It made me wonder if he has the same stringent policy when it comes to dentists, doctors, plumbers, even. Does he ask for a new cab if it arrives with a female driver? Manufacturers take note: religious extremists may now be an untapped market for driverless vehicles.)</p> <p>Foster has said that he will not be alone with a woman who is not his wife \u2013 the infamous, deplorable <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/billy-graham-rule-what-is-mike-pence-presidents-men-women-room-alone-dead-a8221416.html\" title=\"\">\u201cBilly Graham rule\u201d</a> \u2013 because of the way any picture taken of him and a woman, any woman, might be perceived.

He has said that it is his Christian faith to require a woman in his truck to have a male chaperone, which is something Jesus must have said off the record, or in a secret code to which only fundamentalists have the key.</p> <p>One of the more depressing elements of the story is the speculation that it will give his campaign to be governor a boost.

During his many interviews, Foster tried various methods of justifying his refusal to be alone with a professional woman doing her job. (It made me wonder if he has the same stringent policy when it comes to dentists, doctors, plumbers, even. Does he ask for a new cab if it arrives with a female driver? Manufacturers take note: religious extremists may now be an untapped market for driverless vehicles.) Foster has said that he will not be alone with a woman who is not his wife \u2013 the infamous, deplorable \u201cBilly Graham rule\u201d \u2013 because of the way any picture taken of him and a woman, any woman, might be perceived. By this, he is implying that potential voters are at best stupid, and at worst perverts who can see only a sexual relationship when two people of the opposite gender are seen together. (Last weekend\u2019s London Pride would have made him very confused indeed.) He has said: \u201cI think a lot of people believe in this day and time \u2013 and I\u2019ve heard people say that in this post-MeToo movement \u2013 men just can\u2019t be too careful,\u201d insulting women, half of his electorate, by implying that they might falsely accuse any man they are alone with of assaulting them, which is a well-known hobby us gals like to take part in, along with baking and buying shoes. He has said that it is his Christian faith to require a woman in his truck to have a male chaperone, which is something Jesus must have said off the record, or in a secret code to which only fundamentalists have the key. One of the more depressing elements of the story is the speculation that it will give his campaign to be governor a boost. If that is the case, then he has made his job more possible by making it impossible for another human being to do hers. Johanna Konta, a forgivable loss of grace under pressure We all have our off days at work. I have forgotten customers in restaurants, made terrible, undrinkable coffees, made terrible, undrinkable cocktails, given myself serious burns in a bain-marie incident, and I thought Broadchurch was, after its first episode, a bit silly and probably wouldn\u2019t do very well. So when Johanna Konta gave her post-match press conference after losing in the quarter-finals of Wimbledon to Barbora Str\u00fdcov\u00e1, having been 4-1 up in the first set, I understood why she might not be in the mood to chat about it. That is the brutality of a post-match interview, particularly for the loser. It\u2019s usually a series of questions that rephrase the same issues \u2013 \u201cWhy did you lose?\u201d and \u201cWhy weren\u2019t you good enough?\u201d \u2013 with ever-piercing requests for more and more detail about what went so very wrong. Usually they are bland, if a little awkward, affairs, as polite as they are strained. But Konta had had enough. When a journalist asked if she could have done better at key points, she asked curtly: \u201cIs that your professional tennis opinion?\u201d To which he said no, but the answer should, more accurately, probably have been yes, since it was the biggest tennis tournament in the world and he was asking a quarter-finalist about her performance during a tennis match. More than the debate about whether she was right to challenge the journalist, or the journalist was right to challenge her, though, it goes to show the limits of the \u201cthink positive\u201d approach. She didn\u2019t tank the match; Str\u00fdcov\u00e1 just played better. In that moment, on that stage, Konta simply reached her limit. Now, please direct all correspondence on \u201cwhy can\u2019t this column be better\u201d and \u201cwhat do you think you could have done to improve that sentence\u201d to the press room, SW19. Shirley Manson shows that resilience only comes with age Shirley Manson was almost 30 when Garbage became one of the biggest rock bands in the world. She is on my mental list of incredible women who made it when they weren\u2019t squeaky teens: Patti Smith releasing Horses in her late 20s, Deborah Harry becoming a superstar with Blondie in her 30s. Last week, Manson spoke to told the Evening Standard that coming to success late, having already grafted her way around the music industry, gave her a more solid foundation for dealing with it. \u201cI earned my keep and had already been in the music business for 12 years before I stepped on to the world stage. Which is what helped me keep it together,\u201d she said. She also said that compared with younger, straight-from-stage-school stars, she was better prepared for an industry that is \u201cunforgiving, highly competitive, it\u2019s nasty, it pits people up against one another\u201d. She\u2019s not wrong, on any count. I\u2019ve interviewed plenty of famous people over the years, and it has usually stood as a firm and fast rule that the older a person was when they became well-known, the less ruined by it they were. The campaign to ban all celebrities from the public eye until they have passed a maturity test starts here. \u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>A moment of collective exhalation and the swaths of union flags held aloft in anticipation of celebration sagged downwards across Silverstone. The tensest of finales here failed to stick to the script as Valtteri Bottas denied Lewis Hamilton pole position for the British Grand Prix by the finest of margins.</p> <p>As the huge crowd slumped back to their seats there was an air almost of disbelief. Here, then, was the twist in the tale they had not anticipated \u2013 a reminder that their hero, despite his overwhelming dominance in the past on the old airfield, could still be bested. Bottas had spoiled their party but more is sure to come on Sunday.</p> <p>Ferrari\u2019s hoped-for challenge failed quite to materialise, with Charles Leclerc in third and Sebastian Vettel managing only sixth. Max Verstappen was fourth for Red Bull with his teammate, Pierre Gasly, fifth.</p> <p>Bottas took the place with an exceptional lap on his first run in Q3, setting a time of 1min 25.093sec.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/13/george-russell-silverstone-special-f1-british-grand-prix\">George Russell: \u2018Silverstone gives you a special feeling, goosebumps\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On his first hot run in the final third Hamilton was quickest in the first and third sectors but had a moment of oversteer through Brooklands in the middle sector and Bottas was quicker by three-tenths. When they emerged for the final time the expectation was Hamilton would pull something out of the bag on his final run, as he has done so many times before. The crowd held their breath in expectation of emitting a mighty roar but, as the British driver crossed the line, Bottas\u2019s time stood by a margin so small as to be almost invisible \u2013 six thousandths of a second across a 3.66-mile lap.</p> <p>Bottas had not improved on his second run and, although Hamilton had managed to string together three strong sectors, he was still not happy with his final lap. \u201cIt just got away from us,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Yet despite the strong support at the circuit, Hamilton was forced after qualifying to once again defend his decision to live in Monaco, when he was asked if his \u201cBritishness\u201d was in question. \u201cIt is crazy because I remember growing up and watching Jenson Button and all the youngsters coming through and they all migrated to Monaco,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody ever said anything. Of course, when I did, they had something to say.</p> <p>\u201cNo matter how often you go abroad or elsewhere in the world, you come back to the UK. This is where my heart is. I am fully British. I go to these races and I lift the British flag proudly. There is no one else in this sport that has raised it so high.\u201d</p> <p>Bottas rightly celebrated beating Hamilton at his home circuit in front of a fiercely partisan crowd, a major result for the Finn. The cameras had followed Hamilton\u2019s lap, as had the crowd, but Bottas\u2019s first run was as good a performance as he has delivered in qualifying this season. He blasted through the sweeping fast corners that define Silverstone but was also inch-perfect through the challenge of Brooklands, Luffield and Woodcote, obviously finding the relaid smooth surface to his liking.</p> <p>He has out-qualified Hamilton now by four poles to three and badly wants to ensure he converts his latest effort into a win. In China and Spain, where he had pole, he was beaten off the line by Hamilton, who went on to take victory. The championship leader has four wins from the last five races and leads Bottas by 31 points, with Vettel 74 points back.</p> <p>Bottas clearly desperately wants to prevent Hamilton from romping away with it, however. The Finn took a dominant win in Australia and was similarly strong in Baku for his second victory; he needs to back them up by taking the flag here to return the pressure to Hamilton.</p> <p>\u201cThe championship fight is still on,\u201d Bottas said. \u201cI am the one chasing, I am behind but there are so many races to go and it is up to me and my performance. Every opportunity there is now I need to take. If I don\u2019t, Lewis is going to be far away and out of reach. So tomorrow is super important but so is the race after and the race after. The season is long and I need to take those opportunities and I will do everything I can to keep that lead tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton, too, was sanguine that he still has more to come. He has six wins this season and another here would make him the most successful driver at the British Grand Prix, surpassing the record of five he shares with Jim Clark and Alain Prost. He showed great pace in his long runs in practice and was optimistic about his chances.</p> <p>\u201cIt is just qualifying. As you have seen, a lot of the races it doesn\u2019t necessarily determine what happens in the race,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is great to start at the front. It makes your day a little bit more simple. But I am proud to be a part of locking out the front row. Valtteri and I have a great relationship but we always want to beat each other. The duel is who can do a better job tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>A sellout crowd of 141,000 fans will be there to see if he can do it. Their hopes will be refreshed, their spirits buoyant once more. The victory would be Hamilton\u2019s were it decided by the crowd but this is a race both drivers desperately want to win and certainly Leclerc believes he, too, may have a part to play.

      "bodyText": "A moment of collective exhalation and the swaths of union flags held aloft in anticipation of celebration sagged downwards across Silverstone. The tensest of finales here failed to stick to the script as Valtteri Bottas denied Lewis Hamilton pole position for the British Grand Prix by the finest of margins. As the huge crowd slumped back to their seats there was an air almost of disbelief. Here, then, was the twist in the tale they had not anticipated \u2013 a reminder that their hero, despite his overwhelming dominance in the past on the old airfield, could still be bested. Bottas had spoiled their party but more is sure to come on Sunday. Ferrari\u2019s hoped-for challenge failed quite to materialise, with Charles Leclerc in third and Sebastian Vettel managing only sixth. Max Verstappen was fourth for Red Bull with his teammate, Pierre Gasly, fifth. Bottas took the place with an exceptional lap on his first run in Q3, setting a time of 1min 25.093sec. On his first hot run in the final third Hamilton was quickest in the first and third sectors but had a moment of oversteer through Brooklands in the middle sector and Bottas was quicker by three-tenths. When they emerged for the final time the expectation was Hamilton would pull something out of the bag on his final run, as he has done so many times before. The crowd held their breath in expectation of emitting a mighty roar but, as the British driver crossed the line, Bottas\u2019s time stood by a margin so small as to be almost invisible \u2013 six thousandths of a second across a 3.66-mile lap. Bottas had not improved on his second run and, although Hamilton had managed to string together three strong sectors, he was still not happy with his final lap. \u201cIt just got away from us,\u201d he said. Yet despite the strong support at the circuit, Hamilton was forced after qualifying to once again defend his decision to live in Monaco, when he was asked if his \u201cBritishness\u201d was in question. \u201cIt is crazy because I remember growing up and watching Jenson Button and all the youngsters coming through and they all migrated to Monaco,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody ever said anything. Of course, when I did, they had something to say. \u201cNo matter how often you go abroad or elsewhere in the world, you come back to the UK. This is where my heart is. I am fully British. I go to these races and I lift the British flag proudly. There is no one else in this sport that has raised it so high.\u201d Bottas rightly celebrated beating Hamilton at his home circuit in front of a fiercely partisan crowd, a major result for the Finn. The cameras had followed Hamilton\u2019s lap, as had the crowd, but Bottas\u2019s first run was as good a performance as he has delivered in qualifying this season. He blasted through the sweeping fast corners that define Silverstone but was also inch-perfect through the challenge of Brooklands, Luffield and Woodcote, obviously finding the relaid smooth surface to his liking. He has out-qualified Hamilton now by four poles to three and badly wants to ensure he converts his latest effort into a win. In China and Spain, where he had pole, he was beaten off the line by Hamilton, who went on to take victory. The championship leader has four wins from the last five races and leads Bottas by 31 points, with Vettel 74 points back. Bottas clearly desperately wants to prevent Hamilton from romping away with it, however. The Finn took a dominant win in Australia and was similarly strong in Baku for his second victory; he needs to back them up by taking the flag here to return the pressure to Hamilton. \u201cThe championship fight is still on,\u201d Bottas said. \u201cI am the one chasing, I am behind but there are so many races to go and it is up to me and my performance. Every opportunity there is now I need to take. If I don\u2019t, Lewis is going to be far away and out of reach. So tomorrow is super important but so is the race after and the race after. The season is long and I need to take those opportunities and I will do everything I can to keep that lead tomorrow.\u201d Hamilton, too, was sanguine that he still has more to come. He has six wins this season and another here would make him the most successful driver at the British Grand Prix, surpassing the record of five he shares with Jim Clark and Alain Prost. He showed great pace in his long runs in practice and was optimistic about his chances. \u201cIt is just qualifying. As you have seen, a lot of the races it doesn\u2019t necessarily determine what happens in the race,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is great to start at the front. It makes your day a little bit more simple. But I am proud to be a part of locking out the front row. Valtteri and I have a great relationship but we always want to beat each other. The duel is who can do a better job tomorrow.\u201d A sellout crowd of 141,000 fans will be there to see if he can do it. Their hopes will be refreshed, their spirits buoyant once more. The victory would be Hamilton\u2019s were it decided by the crowd but this is a race both drivers desperately want to win and certainly Leclerc believes he, too, may have a part to play. Another tense afternoon awaits on the Northamptonshire-Buckinghamshire border. Vettel and Leclerc set their best times in Q2 on the soft tyres, perhaps looking for extra grip off the line in contrast to Hamilton and Bottas, who will start on the medium rubber. Pirelli believe the tyre wear will be such that the teams will have to adopt a two-stop strategy. McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris was once again very strong, with eighth place. Daniel Ricciardo and Nico H\u00fclkenberg were in seventh and 10th for Renault, with Toro Rosso\u2019s Alexander Albon in ninth. Antonio Giovinazzi and Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen were in 11th and 12th, with the second McLaren of Carlos Sainz in 13th. Roman Grosjean was in 14th for Haas and Sergio P\u00e9rez was in 15th for Racing Point. Kevin Magnussen finished in 16th for Haas, in front of the Toro Rosso of Daniil Kvyat.

      "bodyText": "Simona Halep played a near-flawless final on Saturday to become the first Romanian woman to win Wimbledon, simultaneously wrecking Serena Williams\u2019s bid for a record-equalling 24th major, a dream that grows more unlikely by the day. The 37-year-old American \u2013 still one short of Margaret Court\u2019s all-time tally \u2013 smiled graciously at the end but will have been crying inside, while Halep beamed like a lighthouse in celebration of a 6-2, 6-2 drubbing in 56 minutes of perhaps the game\u2019s greatest player. \u201cShe really played out of her mind,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWhenever a player plays that amazing you just have to take your hat off and give her a nod.\u201d Halep, charm and joy personified, agreed she had never played a better match. \u201cI had nerves,\u201d she said. \u201cMy stomach was not very well before the match. But I had no time for emotions and just came out and tried my best. \u201cIt was my mum\u2019s dream when I was about 10. And the day came and my mum is here to see it. I have worked a lot to change a little bit my game to play on grass. I started to feel this year when the ball comes to me I knew what to do with it. I can\u2019t wait to come back here.\u201d A hat-trick of errors, culminating in a forehand wide, cost Williams her opening service game and Halep held to love to go 2-0 up inside five minutes, the perfect start. When she ran down a third angled reply to hit a winner on the run in the third game, Halep was like a terrier snapping at the wheels of a Rolls-Royce. Williams\u2019s coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, shook his head in the stands when Halep went 3-0 up with a sublime return into the forehand corner. \u201cThis is the best returning I\u2019ve seen since I can\u2019t remember when,\u201d John McEnroe observed. It was 4-0 Halep in 11 minutes. This was Serena-pace demolition. Writers in the press seats looked around, wondering if they would have enough copy to fill their alloted wordages. And then a love hold for Williams. Was normal service about to be resumed? The first five games had taken less than a quarter of an hour \u2013 but this did not resemble Williams\u2019s odd struggle in the quarter-finals against Alison Riske, when her tennis deserted her for long periods. She was still hitting the ball with deadly precision; it was just that Halep was hitting it back at her in nearly every rally. Williams finally made some inroads on the Halep serve in the sixth game, taking her to deuce with a wicked crosscourt forehand and getting her first break point with another down the line. But she could do nothing about the Halep forehand with which she held for 5-1 after just 20 minutes. Within six minutes the set belonged to Halep, although the manner of her taking it left Centre Court stunned. Williams had not done a lot wrong. She had just been out-hustled in a whirlwind start and her challenge was first to stem the bleeding, then to get up and start winning the race. There was a moment of almost existential release after she hit a solid winner in the opening game of the second set, when she bent over the turf and screamed at it for 10 seconds. Shot by shot, she got back into the fight. Her sister, Venus, looked on calmly from her box, no doubt quietly worrying for her as hard as she would for herself. Over in the royal box her best royal friend, Meghan Markle, smiled benignly, in a Duchess of Sussex sort of way. Cambridge was near to Sussex, for royal box purposes anyway, and she smiled brightly too. If there were any Romanians up there, they probably were not smiling like this. Williams did not smile. She never does, until the job is done and then she gives it the full lights-on treatment. She had some work to do to get the opportunity. Halep stayed steady, kept running, kept getting the forehand killers back, kept asking the questions. She got another look on the Williams serve in the fifth game that might have opened up a pathway to the finish line. Williams spoilt the good work in a long rally by putting a straightforward winner long. Crisis now enveloped Williams, a set and a break down with history calling her. She had been here so many times before but, since becoming a mother in September 2017 she had not won a tournament in what has been a stuttering comeback. In key moments Halep was not making dumb mistakes, and that was the difference between them. Her serve was less than lethal but it was serviceable; she gave Williams very few opportunities to hurt her second serve and she led 4-2 after a solid hold. \u201cShe seems to have lost her spirit, her belief,\u201d Tracy Austin observed of her fellow American, as she struggled to get back in the match, an anaemic backhand at 40-30 dribbling into the net. Another gave Halep break point. She had won all three to come her way to this point \u2013 but Williams found an ace, when the Romanian misjudged the flight of the ball. Again, however, Williams netted and her head dropped, her 24th unforced error, to three from Halep. A 25th arrived immediately and Halep had her fifth break point of the match. This time she drove it down the line and, after 54 minutes, she stepped up to serve for her second slam title. Williams thudded a backhand into the net: 15-0. Her nervous forehand went long: 30-0. Halep served big down the middle: 40-0 and three championship points. One more desperate Williams forehand, almost in angry response to her wretched slippage, and the job was done.

      "bodyText": "I learned to swim in Aberdeen\u2019s Bon Accord Baths, a stern, granite pile dating from 1937, executed in a purse-lipped, Scottish municipal version of art deco. While not exactly sybaritic, it did have an unforgettable sense of spatial and social drama. Replete with a four-tier diving platform and a 15ft deep end \u2013 \u201cScotland\u2019s deepest deep end\u201d \u2013 the pool was usually a frantic free for all, bodies churning in water, some hurtling perilously off the diving boards. Ingrained in my memory, it resembled the pool in north London painted in 1971 by Leon Kossoff, the figurative artist who died earlier this month: packed with swimmers plashing and cavorting, you can practically smell the chlorine. Kossoff\u2019s vision of cacophonous communality contrasts with David Hockney\u2019s lushly ambrosial Californian pools of the same period, with their narcissistic lone bathers, aptly epitomising the difference between swimming in the public and private spheres. Whether for survival, sport or recreation, humans have always found a reason to swim. Healthful and sociable, swimming is an unmitigated individual and collective good, kind to bodies of all ages, shapes and dispositions. It is also the most sensuous form of physical exercise. Paul Val\u00e9ry, the French poet and philosopher, described it as \u201cfornication avec l\u2019onde\u201d. Summer brings out pleasure-seeking bathers, frolicking in the cooling embrace of lidos, ponds and sea baths. Last year\u2019s intense heatwave saw siege conditions at London\u2019s Brockwell Lido, one of the capital\u2019s more popular open air pools. And so, with immaculate timing, the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), in partnership with the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, this month opens Into the Blue, a display telling the story of British bathing habits. From Roman baths to Zaha Hadid\u2019s London Aquatics Centre, the swimming pool comes to life through the architectural drawings, photographs and models in the RIBA\u2019s collections. Andrea Palladio\u2019s conjectured reconstruction of the Baths of Caracalla, the second largest of ancient Rome\u2019s thermae, roots formal bathing culture in classical antiquity, though its origins go back much further. Equipped with hot, cold and tepid baths, together with gymnasiums and libraries, Caracalla was a hedonistic temple calculated to cultivate body and mind. Bronze mirrors directed sunlight into the natatio or swimming pool, capable of holding 1,600 people. Roman baths provided the model for the bath houses that emerged in Britain from the 17th century onwards. Over time, these evolved into the modern, more sportif pool. De Arte Natandi, published in English in 1658 as The Compleat Swimmer, provided early instruction on technique, with woodcuts illustrating variants of breaststroke and backstroke. However, as an activity with salacious propensities \u2013 scantily clad or naked people in proximity to each other \u2013 swimming was disdained and discouraged, especially by the church. Cleanliness was always next to godliness. The Baths and Wash-houses Act of 1846, which established a network of public buildings in British towns and cities, was primarily impelled by a Victorian crusade against dirt. Associated with ignorance and immorality, dirt was also seen as an impediment to an efficient workforce. Swimming was a secondary preoccupation but it gradually gained ground, accommodated in increasingly elaborate Victorian baths. One high point was the Charing Cross floating bath of 1875 moored on the Thames at Hungerford Bridge. Engravings of the time show moustachioed bathers in chastely voluminous trunks (inevitably, it was men only), gliding around a water-filled barge enclosed by a greenhouse-like structure. Its backers hoped it would be the first in a series of floating baths along the Thames, but it eventually closed in 1884. London still awaits a modern floating lido, unlike Paris, which has the Piscine Jos\u00e9phine Baker on the Seine. Throughout the Victorian era, social stratification was rigidly enforced, with first- and second-class baths catering for their respective constituencies. Women were generally relegated to laundry duties and rarely had the opportunity to learn to swim. The catastrophic sinking of the pleasure cruiser Princess Alice in the Thames in 1878 pointed up this stark, existential inequality. More than 600 people drowned, most of them female passengers, who would have been non-swimmers, dragged under by their heavy clothing. Underscored by social and economic change, the development of the swimming pool was bound up with urbanisation, progressive reform and the emergence of popular recreation.

      "body": "<h2>1979: David Gower</h2> <p><strong><em>Lord\u2019s: West Indies, 286-9, beat England, 194, by 92 runs </em></strong><em>Viv Richards (138) and Collis King (86) help West Indies rebuild from 99-4. Geoff Boycott and Mike Brearley put on 129 for the first wicket but too slowly and Joel Garner\u2019s 5-38 leads a rout.</em></p> <p>\u201cAt 22 and having played a year of international cricket I\u2019d faced nothing as unique as a World Cup final because, let\u2019s face it, they don\u2019t come around that often as we\u2019ve noticed. At that age it was a very special day. You\u2019re not thinking: \u2018This could be my only one,\u2019 you\u2019re thinking: \u2018This is great,\u2019 because with that youth comes a certain naivety and the truth is with West Indies everyone was aware it needed to be a very special performance if we were going to come out with the World Cup in our hands.</p> <p>\u201cI learned to have great respect for the West Indies pace attack pretty early on and I still have it now more than 40 years later. I still think on their day they were as good as any attack in history. That Lord\u2019s pitch was a good one \u2013 flat, low bounce, it wasn\u2019t frightening \u2013 but when you get to the stage where you need to accelerate rapidly by the standards of the day and they stick Joel Garner on you\u2019re thinking: \u2018That\u2019s not fair.\u2019 So that was tough.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"901026b56aa09d680c332ae5100b4397db3944d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/901026b56aa09d680c332ae5100b4397db3944d4/0_445_5340_3204/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joel Garner holds the trophy after West Indies beat England in the 1979 Cricket World Cup final at Lord\u2019s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joel Garner holds the trophy after West Indies beat England in the 1979 Cricket World Cup final at Lord\u2019s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was a 60-over game but by the standards of the day 280-odd was a lot and the game was played very differently. The wickets-in-hand mantra was a big one in those days. There were conflicting reports of what was said or not said during that chase but the simple truth is we got off to a steady but too slow start.</p> <p>\u201cThis year is England\u2019s best chance ever, we\u2019ve got a brilliant team. On this occasion, they\u2019ve got better and better the last three games they\u2019ve played. So let\u2019s hope that trend continues, in which case we\u2019ll be having a very, very lovely day at Lord\u2019s.\u201d</p> <h2>1987: Mike Gatting </h2> <p><strong><em>Eden Gardens, Kolkata: Australia, 253-5, beat England, 246-8, by seven runs</em></strong><em> With England 135 for two in the 32nd over of their chase, Allan Border brings himself on to bowl his part-time slow-left-arm spin. The decision by Mike Gatting</em><em> to reverse-sweep Border\u2019s first ball turns the game.</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jul/13/cricket-world-cup-england-44-years-of-hurt-matthew-engel\">First World Cup transfixed England but set tone for 44 years of hurt | Matthew Engel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was probably the best atmosphere I\u2019d played in, the noise the crowd made was absolutely phenomenal. But after we had beaten India in the semi-final most of them were supporting Australia. Myself and Bill Athey got us somewhere close in the chase and then I played a shot that people are still talking about to this day. I had played it a lot during my career and with the field Allan Border had set, there was only one place he was going to bowl the ball and that was somewhere around leg stump. So I just set my sights on playing that whatever his first ball was going to be, because I was in, playing well and was just going to try and continue being positive.</p> <p>\u201cHad I left it, it would certainly have been a leg-side wide. But I was seeing the ball well, feeling good and it was a shot I was quite happy playing. Unfortunately, it just clipped my shoulder and just lobbed up to the wicketkeeper. Had it missed my shoulder it would have been three or four runs, we\u2019d have still been going and we might have won it.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shot batsmen nowadays play all the time but I suppose back then it was unusual \u2013 but not for me. I played it all the time \u2013 certainly all the way through our semi\u2011final against India and all the way through the competition. But my chairman of selectors [Peter May] didn\u2019t like it and told me I shouldn\u2019t play it. But it was a shot that got me runs and I continued to play it.

      "bodyText": "1979: David Gower Lord\u2019s: West Indies, 286-9, beat England, 194, by 92 runs Viv Richards (138) and Collis King (86) help West Indies rebuild from 99-4. Geoff Boycott and Mike Brearley put on 129 for the first wicket but too slowly and Joel Garner\u2019s 5-38 leads a rout. \u201cAt 22 and having played a year of international cricket I\u2019d faced nothing as unique as a World Cup final because, let\u2019s face it, they don\u2019t come around that often as we\u2019ve noticed. At that age it was a very special day. You\u2019re not thinking: \u2018This could be my only one,\u2019 you\u2019re thinking: \u2018This is great,\u2019 because with that youth comes a certain naivety and the truth is with West Indies everyone was aware it needed to be a very special performance if we were going to come out with the World Cup in our hands. \u201cI learned to have great respect for the West Indies pace attack pretty early on and I still have it now more than 40 years later. I still think on their day they were as good as any attack in history. That Lord\u2019s pitch was a good one \u2013 flat, low bounce, it wasn\u2019t frightening \u2013 but when you get to the stage where you need to accelerate rapidly by the standards of the day and they stick Joel Garner on you\u2019re thinking: \u2018That\u2019s not fair.\u2019 So that was tough. \u201cIt was a 60-over game but by the standards of the day 280-odd was a lot and the game was played very differently. The wickets-in-hand mantra was a big one in those days. There were conflicting reports of what was said or not said during that chase but the simple truth is we got off to a steady but too slow start. \u201cThis year is England\u2019s best chance ever, we\u2019ve got a brilliant team. On this occasion, they\u2019ve got better and better the last three games they\u2019ve played. So let\u2019s hope that trend continues, in which case we\u2019ll be having a very, very lovely day at Lord\u2019s.\u201d 1987: Mike Gatting Eden Gardens, Kolkata: Australia, 253-5, beat England, 246-8, by seven runs With England 135 for two in the 32nd over of their chase, Allan Border brings himself on to bowl his part-time slow-left-arm spin. The decision by Mike Gatting to reverse-sweep Border\u2019s first ball turns the game. \u201cIt was probably the best atmosphere I\u2019d played in, the noise the crowd made was absolutely phenomenal. But after we had beaten India in the semi-final most of them were supporting Australia. Myself and Bill Athey got us somewhere close in the chase and then I played a shot that people are still talking about to this day. I had played it a lot during my career and with the field Allan Border had set, there was only one place he was going to bowl the ball and that was somewhere around leg stump. So I just set my sights on playing that whatever his first ball was going to be, because I was in, playing well and was just going to try and continue being positive. \u201cHad I left it, it would certainly have been a leg-side wide. But I was seeing the ball well, feeling good and it was a shot I was quite happy playing. Unfortunately, it just clipped my shoulder and just lobbed up to the wicketkeeper. Had it missed my shoulder it would have been three or four runs, we\u2019d have still been going and we might have won it. \u201cIt\u2019s a shot batsmen nowadays play all the time but I suppose back then it was unusual \u2013 but not for me. I played it all the time \u2013 certainly all the way through our semi\u2011final against India and all the way through the competition. But my chairman of selectors [Peter May] didn\u2019t like it and told me I shouldn\u2019t play it. But it was a shot that got me runs and I continued to play it. That\u2019s what I like about this England team \u2013 they are not afraid to be positive and play their own way. Don\u2019t underestimate New Zealand but I\u2019m feeling very positive about England\u2019s chances.\u201d 1992: Alec Stewart Melbourne Cricket Ground: Pakistan, 249-6, beat England, 227, by 22 runs Javed Miandad survives two lbw appeals from Derek Pringle when England have Pakistan two wickets down early on but Graham Gooch\u2019s side are unable to chase down a sizable total. \u201cBack in the day there was no internet, so you were unaware of what was happening back home. We saw the odd English newspaper and the English journos were out there but you didn\u2019t know if the whole country was behind you or anything like that because, one, you\u2019re in Australia and, two, communication was nothing like it is now. For us it felt big \u2013 it was one of the biggest disappointments of my career not to have won that final. \u201cIt was the best one-day side I played in but we ran out of gas and Pakistan got stronger and sadly they outplayed us in the final along with [umpire] Steve Bucknor depriving Pring [Derek Pringle] of a couple of lbws which he still goes on about. \u201cIt was the very early days of the Barmy Army, it was a good atmosphere at the MCG, maybe 80-odd thousand there but the majority were Australians because they thought they\u2019d get there but they didn\u2019t even reach the knockout stage, which was good. \u201cIt was a massive occasion but when you\u2019re out there you block out the crowd to do your job.

They showed little ambition going forward though save for the occasional isolated breakaway from Joel Chianese or Bruno Fornaroli. </p> <p>The only injury concern from the night looks to be a possible hamstring injury to Luke Shaw.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-13T13:13:25.132Z\">at 2.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d29d5438f08d0b6ca52fe9d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-13T12:58:49.650Z\">1.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Perth Glory 0-2 Manchester United</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Far from a rollicking show-stopper but Manchester United begin their preseason with a win. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"541993e21ce271a9fb19c1cb6db92e6897476ad0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/541993e21ce271a9fb19c1cb6db92e6897476ad0/0_0_2190_1459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcus Rashford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcus Rashford celebrates Manchester United\u2019s opener.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Wainwright/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-13T13:16:07.850Z\">at 2.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d29d4ec8f08cf92bb76f2f5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-13T12:56:19.600Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PerthGloryFC/status/1150025615816286209\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">88&#39; / Tonight&#39;s attendance is 50,206!

A strong squat centre-forward with a low centre of gravity and an eye for goal El Tuna (the prickly pear) was frozen out of Melbourne City last season by former United staffer Warren Joyce. Fornaroli has been cooling his jets for a number of months and will be eager to remind the world of his talents. </li> <li><strong>Exiles</strong> - Glory\u2019s squad contains a number of players with English football experience and in Neil Kilkenny a man who knows what it feels like to beat Man Utd from his time at Leeds. Shane Lowry was a United fan growing up while Jake Brimmer was on the books at Liverpool. </li> <li><strong>Kids</strong> - Perth\u2019s starting XI is full of senior bodies but the bench is an eye to the future. Tony Popovic has a reputation for being reluctant to blood younger players so it will be instructive who he trusts to appear tonight.</li> <li><strong>Popa - </strong>Speaking of the coach it would be no surprise to see arguably the brightest managerial prospect in the Australian game handed a profile-raising appointment in the near future. A Socceroos coach in waiting Popovic has already attracted the attention of former club Crystal Palace and a good showing tonight would do his reputation no harm at all.</li> <li><strong>Optus Stadium - </strong>Australia has an abundance of state of the art multi-purpose arenas and this 60,000 seat belter in Perth is one of them. Home of Western Australia\u2019s Ashes Test, Australian Rules football and the recent A-League grand final, United will be delighted with the facility after suffering some uneven surfaces on previous overseas adventures.</li> </ol>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32c1deb8ff5119121757ce37211ebf69d3a79367\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32c1deb8ff5119121757ce37211ebf69d3a79367/0_0_3281_2187/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Popovic and Neil Kilkenny\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Popovic and Neil Kilkenny will be keen to remind English audiences of their talent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Kane/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-13T10:43:23.335Z\">at 11.43am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d2998938f08cf92bb76f17a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-13T10:30:08.787Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Five things to look out for - Man Utd:</strong></p> <ol> <li><strong>New signings</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/26/aaron-wan-bissaka-manchester-united-patience-tackling-energy-crystal-palace\">Aaron Wan-Bissaka </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/11/daniel-james-manchester-united-swansea-huge-prospect\">Daniel James</a> are not the galactico recruits United fans have become accustomed to but that may be no bad thing. The Glazer family\u2019s failure to appoint an empowered director of football with long-term ownership of squad development has led to a succession of missteps since Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s retirement. Wan-Bissaka and James point to Solksjaer putting the club\u2019s longer-term interests beyond his own immediate ambitions.</li> <li><strong>Pogba</strong> - United\u2019s record signing may yet be the transfer saga of the summer but while he remains at the club, and among the tour party, he\u2019ll be expected to put in a shift. Whether he does or not, and how he\u2019s received by coaches and teammates along the way, will be closely scrutinised.</li> <li><strong>Kids</strong> - Tahith Chong, Mason Greenwood, James Garner and Angel Gomes have all been tipped for the top for some time. Their chances of regular game time increased with the dismissal of Jose Mourinho and matches like tonight\u2019s offer the chance to catch Solksjaer\u2019s eye. </li> <li><strong>Solskjaer</strong> - Caretaker Ole was straight out of a Roy of the Rovers cartoon strip but once he was awarded the gig full-time the magic soon wore off. At the start of his first preseason at the helm it will be fascinating to chart his progress. Will he look to make any big statements from the outset? How will he handle Pogba and Lukaku? Are there any tactical tweaks to identify?</li> <li><strong>Intent</strong> - This is the first of five preseason fixtures for United and arrives following a week of heavy training and a near 24-hour flight. Consequently they could be forgiven for taking things easy, but after finishing last season so disappointingly nobody will want to risk a rot setting in. </li> </ol>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0479880ae18cae5294e6c1a5d3622a87cb01ed21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0479880ae18cae5294e6c1a5d3622a87cb01ed21/0_0_4188_2792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aaron Wan-Bissaka\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aaron Wan-Bissaka begins life as a Manchester United player against Perth Glory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Wainwright/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d299a128f08cf92bb76f180\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-13T10:27:44.560Z\">11.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Perth Glory starting XI</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Tony Popovic is not going to die wondering.

Preparations for the new campaign begin against A-League outfit Perth Glory with kick-off at Optus Stadium around 7pm local time (9pm on Australia\u2019s east coast or noon in the UK). </p> <p>Not for the first time in recent years United are enduring a turbulent preseason. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s first transfer window in the hot seat has already seen fevered speculation over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/06/paul-pogba-stalemate-a-pain-for-manchester-united-manager-and-fans\">the future of record signing Paul Pogba</a>, question marks over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/12/romelu-lukaku-inter-manchester-united-bid\">whether Romelu Lukaku will begin the season at Old Trafford</a>, and renewed supporter discontent with the club\u2019s ownership. All of this unrest is magnified by a trophy cabinet that went unfurnished last season while fierce rivals Manchester City and Liverpool went from strength to strength.</p> <p>In better news a couple of new faces have arrived to brighten the place up.

      "bodyText": "Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r will be pleased with a lot of what he saw from his side tonight. United dominated from start to finish and played with a decent tempo and impetus throughout. Daniel James and Aaron Wan-Bissaka looked at home on debut while youngsters Angel Gomes, Tahith Chong, Mason Greenwood and James Garner all impressed. The lack of penetration, especially in the first half, would have frustrated the United bench but the introductions of Pogba and Mata added some potency. For their part Perth were organised and diligent defensively, making their more illustrious guests earn every opening. They showed little ambition going forward though save for the occasional isolated breakaway from Joel Chianese or Bruno Fornaroli. The only injury concern from the night looks to be a possible hamstring injury to Luke Shaw. Far from a rollicking show-stopper but Manchester United begin their preseason with a win. 88 min: Greenwood hits the post after jinking in from the right, shaping to go on his left, exploiting the half-yard of space then whipping an angled shot in on his right foot. Pretty much the first thing Garner does is accept a soft turnover on the edge of Glory\u2019s box and drill a low right-footed effort wide of the keeper\u2019s despairing dive. It was a smart finish from the substitute but the way he read the play to pick Perth\u2019s pocket was even better. Excellent stuff from Garner. 83 min: Australian TV is suggesting Pogba was due to be substituted - no word if it was pre-planned or injury related. However, when James Garner was introduced it was for Luke Shaw with the left-back heading straight down the tunnel, presumably for treatment. Questions no doubt for Solskjaer postmatch. 81 min: Nice spell for Glory and Kristian Popovic, pushing United onto the back foot briefly and forcing Pogba reluctantly into some defensive work. 79 min: Smalling climbs at the far post but can\u2019t direct his header on target. 77 min: As we enter the closing stages United are still eager to maintain the tempo but Perth are starting to slow proceedings down with substitutions. 76 min: There\u2019s a Popovic on the bench and there\u2019s now two on the pitch with Tony\u2019s sons Kristian and Gabriel entering the fray as substitutes. 74 min: Greenwood holds his head in his hands after his effort is blocked following a lovely passing move. Pogba cuts out the middleman shortly afterwards but his long range pile-driver is straight at Reddy. 72 min: Greenwood has plenty of promise and shows a glimpse of it darting in from the right and shaping to shoot on his left. He, Gomes and Chong have all given Solskjaer food for thought. 70 min: Rojo climbs strongly and meets a Mata corner firmly with his forehead but he can\u2019t locate the Glory goal. 68 min: Best moment of the night for the hosts. Glory capitalise on a turnover down their right and whip a deep cross over but there\u2019s nobody on the end of it despite Pereira and Wan-Bissaka colliding in the six-yard box. 66 min: It could be Perth tiring, it could be the composure of Pogba and Mata in the final third, but United have much more threat this second half. The latest blur of passes ends with Greenwood through on goal but he scuffs his opportunity. 63 min: United have found some zip since that goal and Gomes shows his pace and power to fashion a shooting opportunity but his drive is well dealt with by Reddy. Relentless possession, passing and movement finally tells for United. Perth fail to clear their lines following one attack too many. The ball falls to Mata who feeds Pogba, the Frenchman impudently flicking the ball to Rashford to slap home first time with his left foot across the goal and into the bottom corner. 58 min: Joel Pereira is called into action to claim a deep Kilkenny free-kick. The first moment of note from a United keeper all evening. 55 min: Nice interplay from Mata, Rashford and Gomes in the box but there\u2019s no space and a corner was the inevitable outcome. Perth are proving obdurate opponents. 53 min: After Chianese\u2019s burst in the first-half, Ivan Franjic doubles the amount of Perth forward runs in possession with a persistent run down the left. United snuff out any danger and rebuild from the back with McTominay dictating the tempo, picking up where Matic left off. 52 min: Rojo shoots from about 40-yards away and the ball misses the target by about the same distance. 49 min: Wan-Bissaka\u2019s into the action immediately playing pretty much as a right winger, linking with Greenwood and Pogba. United are again dominating possession, camped on the edge of Glory\u2019s box trying to prise an opening. Greenwood almost does that with some trickery but the resulting shot is the third of the night to hit the wrong side of the side netting. 47 min: Paul Pogba\u2019s first action of note in savannah (I still can\u2019t get my head around it) is to drag a snapshot wide from outside the box. 46 min: Second half underway and United immediately on the attack with Angel Gomes. He\u2019s on the left of a front three with Rashford through the middle and Greenwood down the right. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has named an entirely different XI at half-time. That means a debut for Wan-Bissaka, a good look at Gomes and Greenwood, and the small matter of Paul Pogba. Utd: Pereira, Wan-Bissaka, Shaw, Smalling, Rojo, McTominay, Pogba, Mata, Gomes, Greenwood, Rashford. Goalless at the break at Optus Stadium. The hosts have defended deep and manfully to good effect. The visitors have probed nimbly but without penetration. For United James started brightly before fading while Chong impressed later in the half. Perth fans will be delighted by how fit and hungry Fornaroli looks. 45 min: Sharp footwork from Martial but his attempted curler is deflected wide. 44 min: Credit must go to Perth for their defensive organisation and commitment to keeping United at bay. Solksjaer wouldn\u2019t mind a little more ambition though to open up a few more spaces with the match unfolding mainly in one congested half of the field. 42 min: Chong again is busy, linking nicely with Lingard, but his drive is blocked before he reaches Reddy. After a slow start wide on the right Chong has grown into this game in a more central role. 39 min: Pereira again is almost found with a Scholes-type run behind Perth\u2019s defence but he lacks the strength to hold off a couple of purple shirts. United\u2019s forward line lacks presence and is ill-suited to unlocking opponents defending so deep. 37 min: United have shuffled things around a little, James drifting to the right, Lingard to the left, and Chong in the No.10 role. The latter catches the eye with a superb dribble through the heart of Glory\u2019s defence but there\u2019s no change from the referee when he goes down in the box. The most eye-catching moment of the half. 35 min: The outcome of that template is United opting to shoot from outside the box after running out of ideas. Matic is the latest to try his luck but his dragged drive is comfortable for Reddy diving to his left. 32 min: United continue to work hard, press without the ball and pass neatly with it, but there\u2019s little penetration. The front three of James, Martial and Chong haven\u2019t really taken the game by the scruff of the neck despite the ball making its way swiftly from back to front via Matic and Pereira. There\u2019s an opening for an advanced fulcrum to dictate play. 28 min: Save! Top drawer stuff from the flying Liam Reddy, getting his fingertips to a rasping drive from Lingard struck from the edge of the box. Tuanzebe wins the header from the resulting corner but can\u2019t direct it on target. 27 min: Perth do finally fashion an opening of sorts through Joel Chianese down the right but Jones snuffs out the danger and then United dismissively play out from the back and look to exploit the rare space but Martial can\u2019t capitalise and they settle for a corner. 25 min: Another side netting effort from United that half the ground thinks is a goal. This time it\u2019s Martial using quick feet in a crowded box but his stabbed effort is just wide. Perth have settled now and appear to have figured out the right shape to stop United passing through them at will. They still haven\u2019t established how to retain possession or build an attack yet though. 21 min: Pereira fluffs his lines after a superb floated ball over the top catches Perth\u2019s deep defensive line off guard. United have been neat and tidy but look a little short of menace for the time being. Just as I typed that the big screen cut to Romelu Lukaku in one of the corporate boxes. 19 min: From the resulting free-kick Ashley Young ripples the side netting with a terrific effort just a few inches the wrong side of the post. 18 min: Not a lot to report from a Perth point of view but Fornaroli\u2019s trademark strength with his back to goal has not diminished during his time on the sidelines. Nor has Kilkenny\u2019s appetite for the contest, putting James on the turf with a clear foul then offering the referee some advice with a sharpened tongue and pointed finger. 16 min: United\u2019s intent is not lacking. A well-timed forward press ends with Lingard diving in aggressively and winning the ball back. 13 min: United\u2019s plan A is increasingly obvious: recycle possession until there\u2019s an opportunity to free James down the inside-left channel. The former Swansea man has looked bright but has yet to deliver a telling final ball, his latest again intercepted before it can reach another savannah shirt. 11 min: First spell of possession for Glory but it leads to a cheap turnover in midfield and the chance for United to get in behind but they lack penetration down the right. This is already attack vs defence. A real test of United\u2019s patience and guile in the final third. 9 min: Dalot, starting at right-back larrups a left-footed drive high and wide. 7 min: United look sharp, passing and moving smartly, probing around Perth\u2019s penalty area, trying to get James on the ball as often as possible. The new signing is on the left of a front three with Chong on the right and Martial in the middle. Behind them Lingard has a free role with Pereira linking play and Matic holding. 5 min: James again finds space down the inside-left channel and he\u2019s found smartly by a Young free-kick but again his cross is cut out before it finds a teammate. 4 min: Shot from range from Andreas Pereira but it\u2019s straight at Reddy. All United in these early stages, moving the ball nicely in Perth\u2019s half with Glory dropping deep in a low block (hi Graeme). 2 min: United on the front foot early and an early couple of touches for Daniel James down the left. His first cross is blocked, his second is a teasing low curler across the six-yard box but there\u2019s no teammate to honour it. Underway at Optus Stadium... Shane Lowry and Ashley Young lead the sides out onto Optus Stadium to the strains of This is the One by The Stone Roses, United\u2019s traditional walk-out music at Old Trafford. In case it wasn\u2019t clear, savannah (the colour of United\u2019s new away strip) is a mucky creamy colour. Apparently it\u2019s something to do with Manchester\u2019s Northern Quarter, possibly the flaking paint on an inside wall of Affleck\u2019s Palace? Paul Pogba is not in the starting XI but that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t be making tomorrow\u2019s headlines. The weather is a tad more Mancunian than the visitors might have expected for a trip to Australia. It\u2019s chilly with an easterly breeze, but thankfully no rain. Just a reminder that Romelu Lukaku is not in the matchday squad tonight, and we\u2019re told it\u2019s because of a minor injury. Both sides are sporting new uniforms for tonight\u2019s match. Glory\u2019s purple home kit has been spruced up for the new season while United are modelling their latest away jersey, coloured - wait for it - savannah. Nope, me neither. Five things to look out for - Perth Glory: Bruno Fornaroli - For a couple of seasons the Uruguayan was the most dangerous player in the A-League. A strong squat centre-forward with a low centre of gravity and an eye for goal El Tuna (the prickly pear) was frozen out of Melbourne City last season by former United staffer Warren Joyce. Fornaroli has been cooling his jets for a number of months and will be eager to remind the world of his talents. Exiles - Glory\u2019s squad contains a number of players with English football experience and in Neil Kilkenny a man who knows what it feels like to beat Man Utd from his time at Leeds. Shane Lowry was a United fan growing up while Jake Brimmer was on the books at Liverpool. Kids - Perth\u2019s starting XI is full of senior bodies but the bench is an eye to the future. Tony Popovic has a reputation for being reluctant to blood younger players so it will be instructive who he trusts to appear tonight. Popa - Speaking of the coach it would be no surprise to see arguably the brightest managerial prospect in the Australian game handed a profile-raising appointment in the near future. A Socceroos coach in waiting Popovic has already attracted the attention of former club Crystal Palace and a good showing tonight would do his reputation no harm at all. Optus Stadium - Australia has an abundance of state of the art multi-purpose arenas and this 60,000 seat belter in Perth is one of them. Home of Western Australia\u2019s Ashes Test, Australian Rules football and the recent A-League grand final, United will be delighted with the facility after suffering some uneven surfaces on previous overseas adventures. Five things to look out for - Man Utd: New signings - Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James are not the galactico recruits United fans have become accustomed to but that may be no bad thing. The Glazer family\u2019s failure to appoint an empowered director of football with long-term ownership of squad development has led to a succession of missteps since Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s retirement. Wan-Bissaka and James point to Solksjaer putting the club\u2019s longer-term interests beyond his own immediate ambitions. Pogba - United\u2019s record signing may yet be the transfer saga of the summer but while he remains at the club, and among the tour party, he\u2019ll be expected to put in a shift. Whether he does or not, and how he\u2019s received by coaches and teammates along the way, will be closely scrutinised. Kids - Tahith Chong, Mason Greenwood, James Garner and Angel Gomes have all been tipped for the top for some time. Their chances of regular game time increased with the dismissal of Jose Mourinho and matches like tonight\u2019s offer the chance to catch Solksjaer\u2019s eye. Solskjaer - Caretaker Ole was straight out of a Roy of the Rovers cartoon strip but once he was awarded the gig full-time the magic soon wore off. At the start of his first preseason at the helm it will be fascinating to chart his progress. Will he look to make any big statements from the outset? How will he handle Pogba and Lukaku? Are there any tactical tweaks to identify? Intent - This is the first of five preseason fixtures for United and arrives following a week of heavy training and a near 24-hour flight. Consequently they could be forgiven for taking things easy, but after finishing last season so disappointingly nobody will want to risk a rot setting in. Tony Popovic is not going to die wondering. His starting XI is as mature as you could expect for this stage of preseason featuring nine regulars from the recent A-League premiership campaign as well as new signings Jacob Tratt and, most notably, Bruno Fornaroli. The bench is packed with kids, and we\u2019re sure to see them at some point during the night, possibly even the coach\u2019s sons, Kristian and Gabriel. The headline news is no Lukaku, while Pogba starts on the bench. According to United Lukaku is carrying a knock and is expected to appear against Leeds on Wednesday. There are starts for the returning Axel Tuanzebe, new signing Daniel James and promising youngster Tahith Chong. Hello and welcome to a special preseason minute-by-minute to keep an eye on the action from the opening match of Manchester United\u2019s preseason tour. Preparations for the new campaign begin against A-League outfit Perth Glory with kick-off at Optus Stadium around 7pm local time (9pm on Australia\u2019s east coast or noon in the UK). Not for the first time in recent years United are enduring a turbulent preseason. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s first transfer window in the hot seat has already seen fevered speculation over the future of record signing Paul Pogba, question marks over whether Romelu Lukaku will begin the season at Old Trafford, and renewed supporter discontent with the club\u2019s ownership. All of this unrest is magnified by a trophy cabinet that went unfurnished last season while fierce rivals Manchester City and Liverpool went from strength to strength. In better news a couple of new faces have arrived to brighten the place up. Aaron Wan-Bissaka didn\u2019t come cheap but should provide the dynamic right-back United have lacked since Antonio Valencia decided he no longer fancied getting to the byline while Daniel James offers searing pace. Both are expected to feature tonight along with a smattering of the club\u2019s most promising youngsters as Solskj\u00e6r remodels his inheritance. Perth Glory may be unfamiliar to United fans but they should not be underestimated. Glory finished the most recent A-League season on top of the ladder, but lost the grand final in a penalty shootout. Their domestic success was founded on the meticulous preparation of coach (and former Crystal Palace defender) Tony Popovic and an imposing spine marshalled by former Leeds United midfielder Neil Kilkenny. There\u2019s a while until kick-off so if you want to get in touch with any pre-match thoughts feel free to drop me an email or send a tweet to @JPHowcroft. You can try your luck during the 90 minutes as well but best to stick to Twitter once we\u2019re underway.",

I\u2019ve worked with everyone: Madonna, Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan. But David Bowie really was fantastic. In truth, people hardly ever approach me to work with them.

It wasn\u2019t about them not liking the music; they were scared of the societal change that disco was bringing about. It got really weird when they tried to pit Chic against the Knack in a race for a number one single. They framed it as \u201cdisco vs rock\u201d. Even though we used the same studio, saw each other every day, and were good friends \u2013 and their song My Sharona was about one of our friends, Sharona! David Bowie was an inspiration to me. I\u2019ve worked with everyone: Madonna, Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan. But David Bowie really was fantastic. In truth, people hardly ever approach me to work with them. Pretty much everything comes from hanging out and chance meetings. Whenever me and Bowie would meet, we\u2019d always end up talking about jazz. Really strange avant-garde jazz. He loved that stuff and he was such an ally for black rights. He was a fantastic human. Music and science were my twin loves growing up. I guess music just spoke to me that little bit more, and so it became my life. But I\u2019m still absolutely fascinated by science. Space is something I\u2019m consumed by. What are we? How did we get here? I\u2019m lucky that I know people at Nasa and the like, so I get invited to all sorts of conferences and big scientific gatherings. I became friends with Stephen Hawking. His brain was enormous, and he was a total genius, but not enough people talk about how funny he was. He was one of the funniest men I\u2019ve ever met. Was he a fan of Chic? I don\u2019t know. I presume so. I never asked. It\u2019s not like he ever asked me if I was a fan of his theorems, you know? I accidentally invented hip-hop. I remember the first time I heard Rapper\u2019s Delight by the Sugarhill Gang. I was in a nightclub in New York called Leviticus and the DJ was playing a record that opened with the bassline from the Chic song Good Times. At first I thought they were playing it live in the DJ booth and I was really impressed. Then the DJ told me he\u2019d bought the record that day in Harlem. I asked to see the sleeve, and when our name wasn\u2019t on there, things got legal. It\u2019s an amazing song though, and I\u2019m really proud of our part in it.

Even better, the film\u2019s principal dystopian vision is undercut by more physical comedy and emotional intimacy than you might expect from the often lugubrious Yorke: another sequence finds Yorke and his real-life partner, the Italian actor Dajana Roncione, vertically rolling over one another, touching foreheads.</p> <p>Only when Yorke is dancing, you suspect, can he feel this free.

In a recent interview, however, Yorke railed against obvious biographical interpretations of his work. Even unanchored from biography, <em>Anima</em>\u2019s standout ballad, Dawn Chorus, is spectacularly moving, with Yorke reckoning with time past. The song itself has been knocking around as an unfinished bootleg for a while; it lent its name to <a href=\"https://consequenceofsound.net/2016/01/radiohead-establish-new-company-dawn-chorus-llp-in-advance-of-new-album/\" title=\"\">the company Radiohead set up in 2015</a> in the run-up to the release of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/may/08/radiohead-a-moon-shaped-pool-review\" title=\"\">A Moon Shaped Pool </a></em>(2016).</p> <p>Tonight, the set list rightly focuses on <em>Anima</em>, which takes its name from the Italian for soul, but also for the Jungian concept of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_and_animus\" title=\"\">femininity within the masculine</a>; more generally, it is concerned with sleep and dream states. \u201cI must be asleep,\u201d sings Yorke on the icy, minimal house-inflected (Ladies &amp; Gentlemen, Thank You for Coming).</p> <p>But Yorke is an artist well aware of external realities. In all his incarnations, he has been perpetually alert to misdeeds by the powerful and the impending climate apocalypse. Recently, when blackmailed by a leaker, Radiohead <a href=\"https://rebellion.earth/2019/06/11/breaking-thank-you-radiohead/\" title=\"\">donated the proceeds</a> of hours of <em>OK Computer</em> outtakes to Extinction Rebellion.</p> <p>His solo song <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?id=143726162898904&amp;story_fbid=320048201933365\" title=\"\">Harrowdown Hill</a>, off 2006\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jul/07/popandrock.shopping2\" title=\"\">The Eraser</a></em>, comes early on tonight, in an unsettling funk-adjacent version. It serves as a reminder that the parlous state of politics wasn\u2019t actually that much better back then, when the apparent suicide of the scientist Dr David Kelly (who found that Iraq was not manufacturing weapons of mass destruction) inspired <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5092160.stm\" title=\"\">one of Yorke\u2019s clearest songs</a>.</p> <p>But the dream state prevails tonight. If there\u2019s an enduring criticism of Yorke\u2019s flag-bearing for the digital sphere, it is that his music tends to avoid resolution: there are smears over washes, wailing looped over atmospheres, sometimes to little obvious purpose. You\u2019re often hard-pressed to spot the development of a motif, because a number of ideas just sit alongside each other, not really interacting. So whenever something pierces the wishy-washy fug, you want to cheer: <a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/allsoundsbyal/posts/128482967332333\" title=\"\">Default</a>, by Atoms for Peace, features both earwax-loosening bass and dynamism.</p> <p>Although the set never satisfyingly erupts into out-and-out rave dynamics, one of the peaks finds Yorke and Godrich deploying sub-bass wub-wubs and cascades of digital percussion. The punishing sonics of Traffic, a recent song off <em>Anima, </em>turn into the strobing finale of the same album\u2019s Twist. There are points, too, where you can detect an echo of a house piano, or the palest impression of soul. Unexpectedly, Runwayaway recalls the constituent parts of Donna Summer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhKqs7dUMa8\" title=\"\">I Feel Love</a> with Godrich\u2019s bubbling amniotic atmospheres redolent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/28/giorgio-moroder-his-20-greatest-songs-ranked\" title=\"\">Giorgio Moroder</a>\u2019s famous bassline.</p> <p>A bard for our anxious times, Yorke has talked about his own <a href=\"https://crackmagazine.net/article/long-reads/thom-yorke-daydream-nation/\" title=\"\">troublesome internal weather</a> and it seems likely that succour, for him, lies within the body, in movement.</p> <p>On <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/376809456137031/posts/httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbtzl9kmjbru/526792691138706/\" title=\"\">Suspirium</a>, the final song of two encores, from the film score of the same name, one lyric stands out. \u201cThis is a waltz,\u201d Yorke sings, \u201cThinking about our bodies/ What they mean for our salvation.\u201d</p>",

There are ink blots in milk, mechanised amoebas, iron filing mountains collapsing, and bars of neon colour that gently suggest In Rainbows, the Radiohead album of 2007. We are in a would-be rave, of sorts, in a spectacular modernist concert hall aptly named after Pierre Boulez, the avant garde French composer who, in the second half of his career, experimented with electronic music. Just two weeks ago, Yorke released his third solo album, Anima (his fourth, if you\u2019re counting 2013\u2019s Amok by Atoms for Peace, a non-Radiohead outing with Flea and Joey Waronker). Anima\u2019s release was accompanied by a three-song Netflix \u201cone-reeler\u201d directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, in which Yorke\u2019s commitment to dance was made even more blatant. Somewhere between an extended music video and a performance piece, the film stars Yorke as a sleepy commuter alongside similarly attired workers. The initial sequence, in which Yorke and the corps try to stop themselves nodding off, is a thing of wonder \u2013 choreography brilliantly transposed from real-life movements. Even better, the film\u2019s principal dystopian vision is undercut by more physical comedy and emotional intimacy than you might expect from the often lugubrious Yorke: another sequence finds Yorke and his real-life partner, the Italian actor Dajana Roncione, vertically rolling over one another, touching foreheads. Only when Yorke is dancing, you suspect, can he feel this free. Tonight, during Not the News \u2013 one of eight tracks Yorke plays from Anima \u2013 Yorke goes through the \u201cslap myself awake\u201d movements to a huge cheer. At other times, he waves distantly, notably during Nose Grows Some from Tomorrow\u2019s Modern Boxes \u2013 the 2014 album from which this ongoing fits-and-starts tour takes its name (it began in 2017). Yorke shakes like a leaf, bounds from console to console, looping his own keening. He seems, within the context of his anxious, racked music, very happy. It is not difficult to love Yorke. He is the Old Testament prophet of British music, a man who turned his back on the prospect of conventional ubiquity after Radiohead\u2019s OK Computer, performing a left-field handbrake turn instead. Kid A introduced great swaths of the rock audience to open-ended digital music. Yorke has never looked back, exploring textures and dynamics derived from club culture, alongside glitchy digitals and dubstep bass frequencies over the course of a 15-year parallel solo career. The 2015 breakup of his 23-year relationship to Rachel Owen made Yorke seem more like an ordinary mortal than previously; her death in 2018 will have added a deeper resonance to Yorke\u2019s already emotionally intelligent music. In a recent interview, however, Yorke railed against obvious biographical interpretations of his work. Even unanchored from biography, Anima\u2019s standout ballad, Dawn Chorus, is spectacularly moving, with Yorke reckoning with time past. The song itself has been knocking around as an unfinished bootleg for a while; it lent its name to the company Radiohead set up in 2015 in the run-up to the release of A Moon Shaped Pool (2016). Tonight, the set list rightly focuses on Anima, which takes its name from the Italian for soul, but also for the Jungian concept of femininity within the masculine; more generally, it is concerned with sleep and dream states. \u201cI must be asleep,\u201d sings Yorke on the icy, minimal house-inflected (Ladies &amp; Gentlemen, Thank You for Coming). But Yorke is an artist well aware of external realities. In all his incarnations, he has been perpetually alert to misdeeds by the powerful and the impending climate apocalypse. Recently, when blackmailed by a leaker, Radiohead donated the proceeds of hours of OK Computer outtakes to Extinction Rebellion. His solo song Harrowdown Hill, off 2006\u2019s The Eraser, comes early on tonight, in an unsettling funk-adjacent version. It serves as a reminder that the parlous state of politics wasn\u2019t actually that much better back then, when the apparent suicide of the scientist Dr David Kelly (who found that Iraq was not manufacturing weapons of mass destruction) inspired one of Yorke\u2019s clearest songs. But the dream state prevails tonight. If there\u2019s an enduring criticism of Yorke\u2019s flag-bearing for the digital sphere, it is that his music tends to avoid resolution: there are smears over washes, wailing looped over atmospheres, sometimes to little obvious purpose. You\u2019re often hard-pressed to spot the development of a motif, because a number of ideas just sit alongside each other, not really interacting. So whenever something pierces the wishy-washy fug, you want to cheer: Default, by Atoms for Peace, features both earwax-loosening bass and dynamism. Although the set never satisfyingly erupts into out-and-out rave dynamics, one of the peaks finds Yorke and Godrich deploying sub-bass wub-wubs and cascades of digital percussion. The punishing sonics of Traffic, a recent song off Anima, turn into the strobing finale of the same album\u2019s Twist. There are points, too, where you can detect an echo of a house piano, or the palest impression of soul. Unexpectedly, Runwayaway recalls the constituent parts of Donna Summer\u2019s I Feel Love with Godrich\u2019s bubbling amniotic atmospheres redolent of Giorgio Moroder\u2019s famous bassline. A bard for our anxious times, Yorke has talked about his own troublesome internal weather and it seems likely that succour, for him, lies within the body, in movement. On Suspirium, the final song of two encores, from the film score of the same name, one lyric stands out. \u201cThis is a waltz,\u201d Yorke sings, \u201cThinking about our bodies/ What they mean for our salvation.\u201d",

As evidence mounted about the impact of poor air quality on children\u2019s health, the headteacher restricted time outside.</p> <p>Carnevali and other parents decided to take action. Within months they had crowdfunded almost \u00a3100,000, and last month a 126-metre \u201cliving wall\u201d of 12,000 plants was installed as part of a clean-air initiative at the school. They hope the wall \u2013 designed to trap exhaust particles, absorb sound and increase biodiversity \u2013 will transform one of London\u2019s most polluted schools into one of its greenest.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re immensely pleased,\u201d said Carnevali. \u201cThe council is monitoring changes in air quality, and we hope for a 40% improvement \u2013 but even 10% would be good.\u201d</p> <p>St Mary\u2019s living wall is one of many being installed around the country by local authorities and private developers.

They will be monitored for air quality improvement for a year; if the pilot is successful, it could be extended to some of the other estimated 494,000 lamp-posts in central London.</p> <p>In Hull, the council is <a href=\"https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/living-green-wall-whitefriargate-hull-2995877\" title=\"\">considering a proposal</a> to transform Whitefriargate, a historic thoroughfare now blighted by empty shops, with vertical gardens.</p> <p>\u201cDemand is definitely growing.

      "bodyText": "When Andrea Carnevali\u2019s son started at St Mary\u2019s Catholic primary school in Chiswick he was alarmed to find that pupils were sometimes kept indoors at break times, despite a large playground. The reason was the nearby six-lane A4 road, which has up to 100,000 vehicles thundering past the school each day. As evidence mounted about the impact of poor air quality on children\u2019s health, the headteacher restricted time outside. Carnevali and other parents decided to take action. Within months they had crowdfunded almost \u00a3100,000, and last month a 126-metre \u201cliving wall\u201d of 12,000 plants was installed as part of a clean-air initiative at the school. They hope the wall \u2013 designed to trap exhaust particles, absorb sound and increase biodiversity \u2013 will transform one of London\u2019s most polluted schools into one of its greenest. \u201cWe\u2019re immensely pleased,\u201d said Carnevali. \u201cThe council is monitoring changes in air quality, and we hope for a 40% improvement \u2013 but even 10% would be good.\u201d St Mary\u2019s living wall is one of many being installed around the country by local authorities and private developers. Tennis fans may have noticed two enormous living walls flanking the giant outdoor screen at this year\u2019s Wimbledon championships. And they are increasingly a feature of hotel and retail developments. A stunning vertical garden graces Elephant &amp; Castle underground station in south London, part of a plan to improve air quality at one of the capital\u2019s busiest road intersections. In a variation on a theme, \u201cliving lamp-posts\u201d were installed this month as a trial in Ebury Street in Belgravia, central London. They will be monitored for air quality improvement for a year; if the pilot is successful, it could be extended to some of the other estimated 494,000 lamp-posts in central London. In Hull, the council is considering a proposal to transform Whitefriargate, a historic thoroughfare now blighted by empty shops, with vertical gardens. \u201cDemand is definitely growing. There\u2019s been a steady rise in interest over the past two years, and a noticeable increase since the beginning of this year,\u201d said Calvin Dalrymple, a living wall consultant with ANS Global, one of the country\u2019s leading suppliers, and the creator of St Mary\u2019s living wall. \u201cIt\u2019s being mainly driven by local authorities, but also a greater awareness in the private sector of the need for sustainable architecture.\u201d According to Benz Kotzen of the Green Roofs and Living Walls Centre at the University of Greenwich, \u201cwe need every tool to try to improve things, and there just isn\u2019t enough capacity in urban environments to create green infrastructure at ground level. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer good enough to have a building facade that just keeps out the weather.

Living walls range from simple wire structures to support climbing plants to sophisticated modular systems, using soil or hydroponic manmade substrate, and solar-powered irrigation.

The main challenge with maintenance was working at height, said Kotzen. \u201cGrowing plants vertically is no more difficult than horizontally, but all gardens need maintaining.\u201d Not everyone is a fan of the trend towards vertical gardens. \u201cThey\u2019re not a solution, except for the wealthy,\u201d said Mick Crawley, professor of plant ecology at Imperial College London. \u201cThere are much cheaper and more effective ways of improving air quality.\u201d Local authorities struggling to pay for essential services would be better advised to plant trees, he said. London\u2019s first living wall, installed in 2005 by Islington council at a children\u2019s centre at a cost of \u00a3100,000, withered and died within four years after the irrigation system failed. \u201cLiving walls will die if they\u2019re not designed properly and maintained,\u201d said Dalrymple. \u201cThere are four key things to longterm sustainability: correct water management, correct substrate, maintenance and plant selection taking into account shade, wind and elevation.\u201d With between 28,000 and 36,000 deaths in the UK each year attributed by Public Health England to long-term exposure to air pollution, living walls are expected to become more common.

Throw in 100 representative games for Australia, Queensland and various All Stars teams and that\u2019s seventeen years of pure punishment. What mentality - not just to endure, but to consistently thrive.</p> <p>At the other end of the scale, we\u2019ve closed with as limp a performance as you\u2019ll see from paid athletes, as the Gold Coast crawled to a 95-point drubbing. It was better elsewhere in the AFL with Essendon clinching a dramatic finish with just 17 seconds to play against the Kangaroos, an impressive win for Carlton over the Swans, with the Hawks and Cats also getting it done well.</p> <p>The NRL also threw up a remarkable 90-minute draw - the first in three years between the Broncos and the Warriors - while South Sydney snuck home courtesy an Adam Reynold drop-goals against Manly.</p> <p>The Wallaroos recorded an impressive win over Japan in women\u2019s rugby union, while the Diamonds won back-to-back group games against netball World Cup debutants Zimbabwe.</p> <p>All eyes will now turn to Serena Williams, and the women\u2019s Wimbledon final, as the champion chases a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam against Romania\u2019s Simona Halep. </p> <p>Thanks as always for your company, JP Howcroft is your man with the plan tomorrow, as Sportwatch, like Herbie, rides again.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d29c79b8f0845f89e30c6a9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-13T12:08:58.566Z\">1.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">AFL: Gold Coast 8.8 (56) lose to Adelaide 23.13 (151)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Yuck.

      "bodyText": "So from the sublime to the ridiculous, we\u2019ve had it all on Sportwatch tonight. Cameron Smith has offered a masterclass in professionalism - bagging 16 points and with key involvements in much of his side\u2019s better play, as the Storm put the Sharks to the sword in their skipper\u2019s 400th NRL match. Throw in 100 representative games for Australia, Queensland and various All Stars teams and that\u2019s seventeen years of pure punishment. What mentality - not just to endure, but to consistently thrive. At the other end of the scale, we\u2019ve closed with as limp a performance as you\u2019ll see from paid athletes, as the Gold Coast crawled to a 95-point drubbing. It was better elsewhere in the AFL with Essendon clinching a dramatic finish with just 17 seconds to play against the Kangaroos, an impressive win for Carlton over the Swans, with the Hawks and Cats also getting it done well. The NRL also threw up a remarkable 90-minute draw - the first in three years between the Broncos and the Warriors - while South Sydney snuck home courtesy an Adam Reynold drop-goals against Manly. The Wallaroos recorded an impressive win over Japan in women\u2019s rugby union, while the Diamonds won back-to-back group games against netball World Cup debutants Zimbabwe. All eyes will now turn to Serena Williams, and the women\u2019s Wimbledon final, as the champion chases a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam against Romania\u2019s Simona Halep. Thanks as always for your company, JP Howcroft is your man with the plan tomorrow, as Sportwatch, like Herbie, rides again. Yuck. Who\u2019d be a Suns fan. What a tough watch for the faithful. They\u2019ve been almost outscored by Eddie Betts alone, the home side, with four Suns goals in the final quarter only just sparing some blushes, on a night when Eddie\u2019s kicked six again. Josh Jenkins, Taylor Walker, Tyson Stengle also grabbing a swag of goals, as the visitors ran riot over a side that\u2019s now lost 12 games on the spin. And to think they were 3-1 after four rounds. Done by 92 last week against Richmond, they\u2019ve now been done by 95. Ach, Gold Coast. This is real Clive Palmer areas. There\u2019s a reason they\u2019re top, and despite some early feather ruffling the Saints resistance has been quashed with relative comfort. The Cats sharing the goals around - eight different scorers for their 12 goals, while Dangerfield and Duncan have ruled the touches, with Gary Ablett turning back the clock with another vintage showing. They took the lead shortly into the second half and have just ground the Saints from there. A 13th win in 16 matches - they\u2019ll be hard catching for the minor premiership from here. It\u2019s Cameron Smith 16, Sharks 16, with the landmark man\u2019s teammates putting on a show and 24 points of their own. He kicked 8/9 and for one brief moment looked like he\u2019d crown the night with a try of his own. It was left to namesake, Brandon, who did cross for two tries to get the Smith name up in lights. The Sharks did threaten briefly into the second with Shaun Johnson pulling the strings, but injuries began to toll as both Josh Dugan and Matt Moylan limped out of the contest. It means a nasty run of four straight losses, as they slip out of the top eight. Football: Perth Glory v Manchester United - kickoff! And a reminder - we\u2019re underway over in Perth for the battle of purple and savannah (see Jonathan Howcroft\u2019s liveblog for a forensic dissection of the colour of United\u2019s new away strip). And excuse the indulgence, but what a moment for some of these Glory players. Tony Popovic\u2019s two young sons are on the bench tonight, as are several other Glory juniors. Imagine telling your kids you faced off again Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial and friends. AFL - half-time: Geelong 5.7 (37) trail St Kilda 6.3 (39) Hello. The ladder tells you this one shouldn\u2019t even be a contest, but it\u2019s been a bright start from the Saints over at Kardinia Park. Both sides traded goals early before Geelong went out to a 14 point lead, before four unanswered majors put St Kilda ten ahead. Patrick Dangerfield an unsurprising touch leader with 18, but Billings and Clark getting through a power of work as well with six tackles each. Don\u2019t get too excited yet though - how many times have we seen half-time leads turned around this season? AFL - half-time: Gold Coast 2.5 (17) trails Adelaide 12.9 (81) And out of respect for Suns fans I\u2019ve not brought you any updates from this one yet, where, well. On a day on which even Carlton bagged a rare \u2018W\u2019 it just hasn\u2019t come together for the league\u2019s other battlers. The Crows with nine separate goalscorers - you\u2019d imagine this second half will be all about percentage for the 8th placed side, with the business end of the season fast approaching. NRL - half-time: Melbourne 18-4 Cronulla Reliably solid execution from the Storm, as we\u2019ve come to expect over the years. Want to guess who\u2019s the leading point scorer so far in Cam Smith\u2019s 400th NRL game? It\u2019s him. 10 points from the boot, a reliable 5/5 after the Sharks offered up far too many sloppy penalties. This was as good as it got for the Sharks - some sharp hands in this one, as Aaron Gray crossed in the corner: And we\u2019ve a special pre-season live-blog for fans of A-League premiers Perth Glory and some visiting football team from Manchester. Jonathan Howcroft is our eyes on that one - follow his minute-by-minute rolling report: Not for the first time in recent years United are enduring a turbulent preseason. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s first transfer window in the hot seat has already seen fevered speculation over the future of record signing Paul Pogba, question marks over whether Romelu Lukaku will begin the season at Old Trafford, and renewed supporter discontent with the club\u2019s ownership. All of this unrest is magnified by a trophy cabinet that went unfurnished last season while fierce rivals Manchester City and Liverpool went from strength to strength. NRL - first blood, Storm! Cronulla are one of just two teams to have beaten the Storm this season, but do you think Cam Smith\u2019s teammates fancy sending him home a loser in his landmark game? Smith ran at the line with ball in hand, before Jahrome Hughes put it on the toe, and it\u2019s a comfortable finish from Cameron Munster. Smith with the two from the boot, and he\u2019s slotted an early penalty as well. 8-0 with ten played. And here\u2019s our eyes at the ground, Erin Delahunty, with her match report from Liverpool at the Netball World Cup: Hard to imagine a day out where you sink almost 50 points but leave the court a frustrated figure, but by all accounts skipper C-Bass was in a real scrap out there. Still, two from two, and they roll on, the defending champs. Cripes. It\u2019s a 90-minute draw! We\u2019ve not had one for three seasons - both sides through the washing machine, the meat freezer and the kitchen sink at that one - but miraculously couldn\u2019t find the winner. Payne Haas with a match-saving tackle after the Warriors ran 99m only to fall short of the stripe. They traded droppies, but neither side could land one. The point you imagine may not be enough for either team\u2019s finals hopes, but what an exciting finish for the neutral. Pretty decent build up for Cam Smith\u2019s 400th as well - we\u2019ll have more from that, shortly. Two from two, and looking comfortable for the Australians so far in Manchester. World Cup debutants Zimbabwe with no answers for the world\u2019s top side, with Caitlin Bassett firing an unstoppable 49/53. We\u2019ll have Erin Delahunty\u2019s match report shortly - I\u2019ll let the expert fill us in in more detail how this one unfolded. NRL - here we go, golden point! Sheesh. It\u2019s all happening - we\u2019re 18-18 after 80 between the Broncos and the Warriors, and we\u2019re off to golden point! Both sides 6-9, across the season, surely this is one team\u2019s campaign on the line, right now. Who can be the saviour, who might be the villain?! Broncos have legendary half Alfie Langer working as a runner, but the Warriors have Stacey Jones running the drinks! What either team would give for those legendary brains on the field. We\u2019re under way and it\u2019s the Warriors who work the first opportunity. They set up for Kody Nikorima, he\u2019s about 37m out. He strikes it, it flies, and ...... it drifts wide! Would you believe it! 45,000+ here have been treated to something very special here at Docklands - with just 17 seconds on the clock, who else but Anthony McDonald-Tipungwuti has slotted a miraculous goal from the right pocket! Heartbreak from the Roos - they played so brilliantly in that last quarter. Six goals to Ben Brown, a terrific performance for the Roos with 12 marks and 18 touches as well. But it was AMT - who butchered one of the chances of the game in the second quarter - who made amends right at the death: 4.2 in the end for the mercurial forward. What a game for the faithful! Can they finally spark this Jekyll &amp; Hyde Bombers season? AFL - Essendon point! We\u2019re back to one Okay, let\u2019s take this one home over the last ten. We\u2019ve had only two scores in almost twenty minutes in a nervy final quarter. It\u2019s almost like they\u2019ve been too scared to play, the Bombers! Tarryn Thomas and Ben Brown with goals for the Roos to record a seventh change of lead, but with six to play Jayden Laverde tries one.. but it drags wide! Roos still lead. NRL - Cam Smith watch: Meanwhile, the clock ticks down to the evening Storm v Sharks fixture, where the incredible Cam Smith is just minutes away from an incredible 400th NRL appearance. As somebody mentioned on radio the other day, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s cotton-wooled his way through 400 matches either - he\u2019s been in the guts of it, making 30+ tackles game-in, game-out. Remarkable. AFL - Roos by two with fifteen to play! Ooph. I mentioned early that this one was bubbling nicely, apologies for missing the 3/4 score as I ducked out for sustenance, so let\u2019s bring it home from here. It\u2019s Essendon 11.13 (79) trailing North Melbourne 12.9 (81), in a game that\u2019s oscillated wildly. The Roos went 20 up in the first quarter, the Dons 18 up in the third, but they\u2019ve lost their nerve in the final, the Bombers - with 20 minutes gone, they\u2019ve not registered a single point! NRL - half-time: Brisbane 6-16 New Zealand And it\u2019s time to play our favourite NRL game, which Warriors is it this week! So far, it looks like the good ones - it may not be Magic round again, but they\u2019ve led the Broncos a merry dance at Suncorp. Payne Haas opening the scoring with brute force, but it was all Warriors from there - this from David Fusitu\u2019a the pick of the bunch. Adam Blair and Isaac Luke also bashing over. They\u2019re not a million miles off the eight, the Warriors. Dare to dream? AFL - half-time: Essendon 6.11 (47) draw with North Melbourne 7.5 (47) Hello. We\u2019ve got a game on here. Both sides leading into this one with four wins in five - not the form you associate with teams outside the eight - but they\u2019re looking fresh under Rhyce Shaw, the Roos. It was a ten-goal opening quarter with the Kangaroos flying out of the blocks through Zuhaar (3), Brown (2) and Thomas, before the Bombers led by Jake \u201cthe Package\u201d Stringer fired four of their own, before the skill level got a bit scratchy in the second. Essendon were especially wasteful, kicking 1.6 at one stage. The Bombers defence leading with 37 tackles but the forwards kicking just six majors off 34 inside 50s. Plenty to come in this one. They hung tough for long periods in the first half, Japan, but the lengthy absence of competitive international rugby fixtures eventually came to cost them in a second half where the Wallaroos proved a class above. Trileen Pomare, Mhicca Carter and Eva Karpani all crossing for tries early in the second half as the hosts steamrolled their visitors in front of nearly 4,000 fans in Newcastle. A mixed day for Sam Treherne with the boot - slotting just 2/5, but she sealed proceedings with a late try of her own. Australia face Japan again in a week\u2019s time at North Sydney Oval. The Rabbitohs have overcome a controversial early try to snap their poor recent run with a nailbiter out at Homebush in Sydney. Adam Reynold\u2019s with a 75th minute drop goal to revenge an earlier season golden-point loss to the Sea Eagles. Britt, Gagai and Graham to hop to a seemingly comfortable 18-6 half-time lead after Manly\u2019s opener came despite a pretty clear-cut knock on in the build up. The Sea Eagles then roared back into contention through tries to Sironen, Suli and later Thompson to make for a tense finish. Wayward kicking from Reuben Garrick proving costly for Dessie\u2019s Dogs Eagles with 2/4 conversions seeing easy points dropped. No such mistakes from the boot from Reynolds however as Bennett\u2019s boys snapped a run of losses to Parramatta, Newcastle, Penrith and West Tigers to bounce back to second spot. A see-sawer down in Tas, as the Hawks looked to be making short work of the visiting Dockers running out to a 33-3 lead midway through the second. The Nat Fyfe show cut it back to just six as he kicked three of four unanswered for Fremantle, but from there it was all Hawthorn. Mitchell Lewis and Luke Breust with three, Hanrahan and Wingard with two for the Hawks, with Worpel grabbing 32 touches, five marks and four tackles. Both clubs go 7-9, still clinging to hopes of a top-eight finish, with Ross Lyon\u2019s 300th game as coach ending sadly, with Fyfe also limping out of the contest injured. Women\u2019s cricket: Australia lead England Academy by 400 runs Is there any more you can write about Ellyse Perry? Her bowling partner Megan Schutt wrote this lovely piece for Guardian Australia a just yesterday, and the brilliant all-rounder has been back among it today - this time with the bat. Perry knocked an unbeaten 101* to lead Australia to a commanding lead at stumps on day three of the four-day warm up match against England\u2019s development squad - the final hit-out before the Ashes series gets underway. Wowee. Not the response the Swans hierarchy would have wanted, having announced Longmire\u2019s re-commitment to the club for another three seasons, but it\u2019s a third win in six as the spluttering Blues threaten to finally cash in on so many near-misses this season. Casboult, Silvagni and McKay kicking final-term goals for the Blues who started the quarter confidently before Heeney and Reid threatened to mount a late charge for the Swans. Jake Lloyd added a goal to his 32 disposals with a minute to play to make for some nervy last moments for any travelling Blues fans, but a foul by Rowbottom saw Carlton home with McKay marking well and holding it til the siren. Big win, Carlton! Half-time: Australia 12-0 Japan We start our coverage with women\u2019s rugby union and the friendly Test match from Newcastle, where the Wallaroos have made a steady start against visitors Japan. An early 9th minute try on debut to hooker Averyl Mitchell settled the nerves for the home side, but resolute defence from the 2017 Asian champions has kept proceedings tight thereafter. The Wallaroos backs combined well as outside centre Ariana Hira-Herangi crossed just before half-time, with Samantha Treherne adding the extras with the boot. AFL - three-quarter-time: Sydney 5.12 (42) trail Carlton 6.13 (49) In our first of five AFL fixtures today we\u2019ve got a battle on between the cellar dwellers, with the Swans seemingly failing to lift despite news of coach John Longmire\u2019s contract extension. Newman, Curnow and Walsh running proceedings for the Blues with 24 disposals all, and Cripps his usual all-action presence adding six tackles to his 22 touches on his return. Not a lot happening in that third quarter, with a late goal to the Blues dousing a better showing from the Swans after a disappointing second stanza where the Blues got a little on top. No multiple goalkickers from either side, which is unusual - big final 30 to come, especially for the Swans outside finals hopes. Hi all! Lovely to be back in the Sportwatch chair after an extender summer sojourn round France for the Women\u2019s World Cup. As usual though sport waits for no man, and we\u2019ve an absolutely packed day ahead. Wimbledon? Cricket World Cup? Netball World Cup? Formula One? Tour de France? And that\u2019s before we even get to our domestic sports where there\u2019s plenty afoot in the NRL and AFL as always - none less so than Cameron Smith\u2019s record 400th NRL appearance as Melbourne prepare to take on Cronulla.

Both men found the experience testing, though while Johnson seemed to bluff his way through the encounter, Hunt often appeared caught in the headlights.

Article 24. Get the detail right. Get the detail right, Andrew.

And I did vote three times for Theresa May\u2019s deal, and I\u2019ll tell you exactly why: because I wanted to leave the European Union as quickly as possible.

      "bodyText": "The two candidates for the Conservative leadership, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, were questioned by the BBC\u2019s veteran political commentator Andrew Neil on Friday night. Both men found the experience testing, though while Johnson seemed to bluff his way through the encounter, Hunt often appeared caught in the headlights. Here are the key moments from the two half-hour interviews. Johnson on not backing Kim Darroch Johnson, the frontrunner, was pressed to explain his decision not to support the British ambassador to Washington, Sir Kim Darroch, who quit on Wednesday after days of criticism by the US president, Donald Trump. AN: When you were asked four times in the ITV debate to support our man in Washington, you did not do so. After watching it, he was so dismayed by your failure to do so it was one of the reasons he resigned. BJ: Actually, I spoke to him the following day and said how sad I was that he had resigned, and he pointed out that he didn\u2019t watch it. So you might need to check your facts, Andrew, before you make \u2013 AN: Did it play a factor in his resignation? BJ: He said that what somebody had relayed to him had certainly played, had been a factor in his resignation \u2013 AN: So what \u2013 your lack of support for him was a factor in his resignation? BJ: I think that unfortunately what I \u2013 what I said on that TV debate was misrepresented to Kim. Johnson on the Gatt arrangement Johnson\u2019s claims on Europe were also forensically examined, and the pair shared a bad-tempered exchange about the minutiae of article 24 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade (Gatt), which ended with the leadership hopeful admitting he did not know what one of the key clauses consisted of. AN: So how would you handle \u2013 you talk about article 5B in Gatt 24 \u2013 BJ: Paragraph 5B. Article 24. Get the detail right. Get the detail right, Andrew. It\u2019s article 24, paragraph 5B. AN: And how would you handle paragraph 5C? BJ: I would confide entirely in paragraph 5B, because that is \u2013 AN: How would you get round what\u2019s in 5C? BJ: I would confide entirely in paragraph 5B, which is enough for our purposes. AN: Do you know what\u2019s in 5C? BJ: No. Johnson on London\u2019s crime rate during his mayoralty Neil also challenged the former foreign secretary about his achievements as London mayor, since Johnson has repeatedly tried to take credit for falling crime rates during his stewardship of the capital between 2008 and 2016. AN: It went down 20% in London when you were mayor, crime? BJ: Crime went down roughly 20% when I was mayor. AN: How much did it go down at the same time in the rest of the country? BJ: Well \u2013 AN: By 26%. AN: So you were behind the rest of the country. Hunt on not being \u2018Theresa May in trousers\u2019 Hunt has been painted as the continuity candidate, having backed May\u2019s EU withdrawal bill each time it was put before the House of Commons.

Hunt on being an entrepreneur The foreign secretary has repeatedly reminded audiences at hustings and on TV debates he was the only person running for the leadership who had a successful business background, but Neil gave him short shrift on this. JH: \u2026 I would be the first prime minister who\u2019s been an entrepreneur \u2013 AN: You\u2019re an entrepreneur? JH: Yeah. AN: Who knew that? JH: Have you not heard that before, Andrew?

And for very good reason: the women aren\u2019t just sports stars, they\u2019re rock stars. They\u2019re fighting for equal pay; they\u2019re using their platforms to speak up about inequality and stand up to Donald Trump; they\u2019re raising the profile of women\u2019s sports. And they\u2019re doing it all while being loudly, proudly and unapologetically themselves.</p> <p>While I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m still a little miffed that the US beat England, watching the USWNT team celebrate this week has been magical. It\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cecurran/status/1148982266770710528\">been a dose of unadulterated joy</a> at a time when things are looking increasingly grim. And it\u2019s been a reminder of all that is best about the United States. \u201cWe have pink hair and purple hair,\u201d Megan Rapinoe said at Wednesday\u2019s parade in New York. \u201cWe have tattoos and dreadlocks.

That\u2019s one of the reasons conservatives had a meltdown about that video of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez dancing earlier this year. And it\u2019s why insecure conservative men are currently frothing at the mouth about the USWNT.

Experts aren\u2019t entirely thrilled about this trend because of the possibility of contamination. One 2015 study found 10% of breast milk purchased online had been mixed with cow\u2019s milk. Stalkerware apps and digital abuse \u201cThe domestic-violence charity Refuge estimates that around 95% of its cases involve some form of technology-based abuse,\u201d MIT Technology Review reports. This might involve obsessively tracking a partner using a feature like Find My Friends or stealthily installing \u201cstalkerware\u201d apps that give an abuser access to everything on their victims\u2019 devices. One Million Moms need to get a life The conservative group One Million Moms is calling for a boycott of Toy Story 4. Why? Well because there is a scene in which two women are seen dropping a kid off at school. \u201cThe scene is subtle in order \u2026 to desensitize children,\u201d One Million Moms wrote on its website. Imagine caring more about two loving mothers in a cartoon than the fact that America is ripping kids away from their parents.",

We also have a programme about Jack Thorne, who, while writing successfully for the stage, is also behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/20/national-treasure-operaiton-yewtree-story-channel-4-drama\" title=\"\"><em>National Treasure</em></a> and <em>This is England</em>.

It was odd, to say the least, that writers of such quality were seen as mere footnotes when compared to playwrights whose work in the West End was seen by just a few thousand over an entire run. Quantity does not equal quality, but these television writers are of the highest order and certainly bear comparison with contemporaries in theatre and film.</p> <p>So why has television drama been undervalued until recently? Partly it is down to the stain of snobbery which has discoloured culture in this country every bit as much as it determined the bonds of class. Telly, \u201cthe gogglebox\u201d, could not possibly be as good as Covent Garden or the National Theatre. Of course, live drama and television are chalk and cheese, and offer quite different experiences. But when we look at the quality of the writing, the boldness of the subjects and the brilliance of the execution, then the old hierarchical pyramid crashes to the ground.</p> <p>Cultural snobbery still holds sway in many areas of the arts. Yet I have been to many productions in the forums of the elite that have just not been very good. It was often the grand context and a sense of history that made them seem significant.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These TV writers are of the highest order and certainly bear comparison with contemporaries in theatre and film.</p> <footer> <cite>Melvin Bragg</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By contrast, the touch-of-a-switch public access to television breaks through all that. A stage play might have the advantage of being repeated later elsewhere by other companies, giving it what could be called a living posterity. But television drama does have repeatability. And it can now stand on the shelf alongside a novel.</p> <p>Thomas\u2019s 10 million viewers for <em>Call the Midwife </em>are not watching a cosy show that offers the comforts of a cup of tea. It\u2019s fierce, it\u2019s difficult, it\u2019s painful. And it\u2019s the truth of it that draws in such a devoted audience. The extraordinary and sinister artistry of Pemberton and Shearsmith is currently unmatched anywhere on the screen or the stage, and the fury of Thorne, especially coupled with Shane Meadows, makes us face a country which is vivid, difficult, bleak and full of guts.</p> <p>Mercurio\u2019s <em>Bodyguard</em>, meanwhile, seized the nation by the throat; his last episode was eventually watched by 17 million viewers.</p> <p>We seem to be good at the arts in this country, and their importance should not be underestimated. We need them now more than ever in order to unleash imagination in schools and colleges across the country. The creative industry employs about two million people and, given a bit of a push, that could double in the next 10 years. Out of the mire of the moment, the arts could become the hub of a post-Brexit Britain. Why not? What else is there?</p> <p>Television drama today faces up to the best and to the worst, the bleakest, the most complicated and the most joyful of subjects. Why did it take me so long to devote a whole series to it?</p> <p><em>The new series of The South Bank Show </em><em>begins on Sky Arts on 16 July</em></p>",

Acclaimed drama series such as A Very English Scandal, Killing Eve, Bodyguard and Patrick Melrose have shaped the national conversation. We start with a study of the creator of Line of Duty and Bodyguard, Jed Mercurio, and then focus on Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, who write the BBC\u2019s darkly comic Inside No 9 together. We also have a programme about Jack Thorne, who, while writing successfully for the stage, is also behind National Treasure and This is England. Then we look at the work of Call the Midwife writer Heidi Thomas, who also adapted Cranford. In the early days of television, its writers were lucky to get one or two appreciative mentions, despite attracting audiences of many millions. It was odd, to say the least, that writers of such quality were seen as mere footnotes when compared to playwrights whose work in the West End was seen by just a few thousand over an entire run. Quantity does not equal quality, but these television writers are of the highest order and certainly bear comparison with contemporaries in theatre and film. So why has television drama been undervalued until recently? Partly it is down to the stain of snobbery which has discoloured culture in this country every bit as much as it determined the bonds of class. Telly, \u201cthe gogglebox\u201d, could not possibly be as good as Covent Garden or the National Theatre. Of course, live drama and television are chalk and cheese, and offer quite different experiences. But when we look at the quality of the writing, the boldness of the subjects and the brilliance of the execution, then the old hierarchical pyramid crashes to the ground. Cultural snobbery still holds sway in many areas of the arts. Yet I have been to many productions in the forums of the elite that have just not been very good. It was often the grand context and a sense of history that made them seem significant. By contrast, the touch-of-a-switch public access to television breaks through all that. A stage play might have the advantage of being repeated later elsewhere by other companies, giving it what could be called a living posterity. But television drama does have repeatability. And it can now stand on the shelf alongside a novel. Thomas\u2019s 10 million viewers for Call the Midwife are not watching a cosy show that offers the comforts of a cup of tea. It\u2019s fierce, it\u2019s difficult, it\u2019s painful. And it\u2019s the truth of it that draws in such a devoted audience. The extraordinary and sinister artistry of Pemberton and Shearsmith is currently unmatched anywhere on the screen or the stage, and the fury of Thorne, especially coupled with Shane Meadows, makes us face a country which is vivid, difficult, bleak and full of guts. Mercurio\u2019s Bodyguard, meanwhile, seized the nation by the throat; his last episode was eventually watched by 17 million viewers. We seem to be good at the arts in this country, and their importance should not be underestimated. We need them now more than ever in order to unleash imagination in schools and colleges across the country. The creative industry employs about two million people and, given a bit of a push, that could double in the next 10 years. Out of the mire of the moment, the arts could become the hub of a post-Brexit Britain. Why not? What else is there? Television drama today faces up to the best and to the worst, the bleakest, the most complicated and the most joyful of subjects. Why did it take me so long to devote a whole series to it? The new series of The South Bank Show begins on Sky Arts on 16 July",

Or, after the high-water mark of her Booker-winning 1978 novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/feb/10/iris-murdoch-sea-booker\" title=\"\">The Sea</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/feb/10/iris-murdoch-sea-booker\" title=\"\">, </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/feb/10/iris-murdoch-sea-booker\" title=\"\">The Sea</a></em>, and a late period of longer, more philosophically abstruse books, did her work collapse into her biography \u2013 the jumble of love affairs, absurdly messy kitchens and Alzheimer\u2019s disease that were dramatised by Kate Winslet and Judi Dench in the 2001 film of her life? And, once the attention paid to her life had abated, had contemporary fiction simply moved on?</p> <p>A set of reissues to mark her centenary this week suggest that her 26 novels still resonate with novelists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sarah-perry\" title=\"\">Sarah Perry</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/daisy-johnson\" title=\"\">Daisy Johnson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/02/what-belongs-to-you-garth-greenwell-review\" title=\"\">Garth Greenwell</a>, who have written new introductions to the works. Last year, when I took part in the Cheltenham literary festival\u2019s annual Booker prize event \u2013 a classy balloon debate to determine who might have won the prize in the years before its invention \u2013 Murdoch\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/aug/11/books-to-give-you-hope-the-bell-by-iris-murdoch\" title=\"\">The Bell</a> </em>(1958), championed by Madeleine Thien, only narrowly lost out to Chinua Achebe\u2019s <em>Things Fall Apart</em>.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I love most about Murdoch\u2019s writing is its accuracy in portraying the human experience at its most passionate and comically absurd,\u201d says the novelist Sophie Hannah, who has written the introduction to Murdoch\u2019s reissued 1973 novel <em>The Black Prince</em>. \u201cPeople fall in and out of love at breakneck speed, and act in the most undignified and preposterous ways for reasons so insubstantial or intensely personal that it is hard to identify with them unless you perceive yourself to be equally ridiculous and changeable \u2013 which I absolutely do. Her characters speak the way we would all speak if we did not feel obliged to mask our true, unhinged psyches with the trappings of normality.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>She understood our secret lives: falling in love with the wrong person, maddened with inconvenient lust, sadness and fear</p> <footer> <cite>Charlotte Mendelson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/charlottemendelson\" title=\"\">Charlotte Mendelson</a>, who has written the introduction to <em>Under the Net</em> (1954), Murdoch\u2019s novels \u201cwork for everyone because she understood our secret lives: falling in love with exactly the wrong person, maddened with inconvenient lust and sadness and fear. Her books are full of passion and disaster; I loved her as a teenager and will never stop.\u201d</p> <p>A crucial idea in Murdoch\u2019s fiction is the reality of others, a material fact that we are confronted with daily but, in our innermost selves, seem hardly able to grasp. We glimpse them in continually evolving contexts inflected with our own agendas, which may also remain mysterious to us. That situation, often manifesting itself in the form of a dilemma, struck her as the novel\u2019s primary concern. An essay she wrote in 1959 argues: \u201cProse literature can reveal an aspect of the world which no other art can reveal \u2026 and in the case of the novel, the most important thing to be thus revealed, not necessarily the only thing, but incomparably the most important thing, is that other people exist.\u201d</p> <p>To write a novel, Murdoch continues, is to quickly discover that \u201chowever much one is in the ordinary sense \u2018interested in other people\u2019, this interest has left one far short of possessing the knowledge required to create a real character who is not oneself. It is impossible, it seems to me, not to see one\u2019s failure here as a sort of spiritual failure.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7062e484fb2f75a47538da2479d56f4dad377647\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7062e484fb2f75a47538da2479d56f4dad377647/0_0_1949_1169/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Winslet as Murdoch in the 2001 biopic Iris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Winslet as Murdoch in the 2001 biopic Iris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Buena Vista/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Murdoch\u2019s novels teem with characters who are opaque to one another, confusingly impulsive, acting out ruptures in their supposedly intimate relationships or with their personal histories. It is common for us to meet them in moments of crisis, sometimes entering a space already filled by a group of people at odds with one another. In <em>The Bell</em>, her fourth novel, a young woman, Dora, reunites with her estranged husband in the setting of a lay religious community. Among those she meets are a teenage boy who, unbeknown to him, has been strategically placed to watch over a dissolute drunk; a woman (the drunk\u2019s twin sister) set on becoming a nun and a man once in love with the drunk, and disgraced in the process.</p> <p>Soon after her arrival, Dora is shown the abbey to which the lay community is attached by the formidable Mrs Mark, and asks whether she can climb the tower. No, she is told, the order is enclosed, and \u201cno one goes in or comes out\u201d. Dora is horrified: \u201c\u2018Do you mean,\u2019 she said, \u2018that they\u2019re completely imprisoned in there?\u2019\u201d Mrs Mark is unperturbed, and laughs. \u201c\u2018Not imprisoned, my dear,\u2019 she said. \u2018They are there of their own free will. This is not a prison. It is on the contrary a place which it is very hard to get into, and only the strongest achieve it. Like Mary in the parable, they have chosen the better part.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Why somebody would choose to be imprisoned, and what they choose to be imprisoned by, is the puzzle to which Murdoch repeatedly returns in her work. It is also the reason that, for all their surface narrowness \u2013 the rarefied classes from which her characters are drawn, the milieux that veer from <em>haut</em> establishment to threadbare bohemian, the endless trope of the love triangle and constant romantic volte-faces \u2013 her novels still speak to us. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Murdoch explored the terrifying truth that humans, in the absence of God, are off the leash, animated by internal forces</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Murdoch\u2019s people are shapeshifters, even when she is being glib or incidental. Their relations with one another rarely stay the same, and their concept of themselves is subject to continual assault. In the most gothic of her novels, <em>The Unicorn</em> (1963), a young woman journeys to become a governess in a remote part of western Ireland. (It transpires that she is really to be a sort of companion to a woman confined to a castle by her absent husband, to whom she has been unfaithful.) Picked up from the station, \u201cshe saw in the shadowy interior what she took at first to be a large dog, but then recognised as a very pretty boy of about fifteen\u201d. Later, she sees a seal that seems, \u201cwith its head of a primitive sea-god, like a portent\u201d. Disturbing feelings and fears embodied by animals, the presence of roiling water, humans that can only be dimly made out: all classic Murdoch touches.From her debut <em>Under the Net</em> in 1954 to her final novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1995/oct/01/fiction.reviews\" title=\"\">Jackson\u2019s Dilemma</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1995/oct/01/fiction.reviews\" title=\"\">, published in 1995</a>, not long before her diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s and four years before her death in 1999, her career ran in parallel with her life as a philosopher at the University of Oxford. She became a fellow there in 1948, teaching at St Anne\u2019s College, and married John Bayley, who became Warton professor of English in 1974. In younger life and during the course of their marriage, she had affairs with both men and women (she famously described herself in a letter to her friend and fellow author Brigid Brophy as \u201ca male homosexual in female guise\u201d).</p> <p>For her detractors, her devotion to moral philosophy is written all too large on her fiction<em>. </em>Others take issue with the novels\u2019 melodramatic situations; can we really take seriously the manic manipulations of theatre director Charles Arrowby in <em>The Sea, The Sea</em> when all he is really doing is cooking terrible meals in seclusion and messing with his ex-girlfriend\u2019s head?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9447226404042cbec50b6d59de5195c90b72342b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9447226404042cbec50b6d59de5195c90b72342b/0_41_2400_1560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iris Murdoch with John Bayley in 1997.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iris Murdoch with John Bayley in 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Judges/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Murdoch\u2019s contrivances contained, for her, the terrifying truth that human beings, in the absence of God, are off the leash, motivated and animated by powerful internal forces beyond their apprehension, unable to conceive of goodness as an end in itself. \u201cAll altruism feeds the fat ego,\u201d argues the priest in 1966\u2019s <em>The Time of the Angels</em>: \u201cPeople will endlessly conceal from themselves that good is only good if one is good for nothing \u2026 With or without the illusion of God, goodness is impossible to us. We have been made too low in the order of things.\u201d</p> <p>In that lowness, Murdoch found the subject of her novels, each to a greater or lesser degree peopled by delusionals and lunatics. Often, those who are compelled by the attempt to be good are the most dangerous, particularly when they have covered themselves in the cloak of mysticism, a recurring trope that allows Murdoch to study \u2013 in common with Muriel Spark \u2013 the devastating power of charisma.</p> <p>When Murdoch\u2019s novels falter a procession of unappealing people (\u201crebarbative\u201d, as <em>The Bell</em>\u2019s teenager Toby would have it) trail in and out of rooms saying bizarre things to each other and then catch a train to a country house to say something bizarre to someone else. Something horrid might happen to a dog, and then someone else will die or decide to get unsuitably married. They are, in other words, ripe for parody. But, at their best, they are thrillingly fabular, giving us the sense that we are witnessing a shadow play, our attention absorbed while elsewhere something fundamental takes place. Like Marian in <em>The Unicorn</em>, we are held in suspension, apprised of deeply disturbing knowledge and unsure what to do with it: \u201cHer desire to go out was gone. She was afraid to step outside. She stood paralysed in the gateway for some time, keeping her breathing quiet.

      "bodyText": "Do Iris Murdoch\u2019s novels still matter to people? Or, after the high-water mark of her Booker-winning 1978 novel, The Sea, The Sea, and a late period of longer, more philosophically abstruse books, did her work collapse into her biography \u2013 the jumble of love affairs, absurdly messy kitchens and Alzheimer\u2019s disease that were dramatised by Kate Winslet and Judi Dench in the 2001 film of her life? And, once the attention paid to her life had abated, had contemporary fiction simply moved on? A set of reissues to mark her centenary this week suggest that her 26 novels still resonate with novelists such as Sarah Perry, Daisy Johnson and Garth Greenwell, who have written new introductions to the works. Last year, when I took part in the Cheltenham literary festival\u2019s annual Booker prize event \u2013 a classy balloon debate to determine who might have won the prize in the years before its invention \u2013 Murdoch\u2019s The Bell (1958), championed by Madeleine Thien, only narrowly lost out to Chinua Achebe\u2019s Things Fall Apart. \u201cWhat I love most about Murdoch\u2019s writing is its accuracy in portraying the human experience at its most passionate and comically absurd,\u201d says the novelist Sophie Hannah, who has written the introduction to Murdoch\u2019s reissued 1973 novel The Black Prince. \u201cPeople fall in and out of love at breakneck speed, and act in the most undignified and preposterous ways for reasons so insubstantial or intensely personal that it is hard to identify with them unless you perceive yourself to be equally ridiculous and changeable \u2013 which I absolutely do. Her characters speak the way we would all speak if we did not feel obliged to mask our true, unhinged psyches with the trappings of normality.\u201d For Charlotte Mendelson, who has written the introduction to Under the Net (1954), Murdoch\u2019s novels \u201cwork for everyone because she understood our secret lives: falling in love with exactly the wrong person, maddened with inconvenient lust and sadness and fear. Her books are full of passion and disaster; I loved her as a teenager and will never stop.\u201d A crucial idea in Murdoch\u2019s fiction is the reality of others, a material fact that we are confronted with daily but, in our innermost selves, seem hardly able to grasp. We glimpse them in continually evolving contexts inflected with our own agendas, which may also remain mysterious to us. That situation, often manifesting itself in the form of a dilemma, struck her as the novel\u2019s primary concern. An essay she wrote in 1959 argues: \u201cProse literature can reveal an aspect of the world which no other art can reveal \u2026 and in the case of the novel, the most important thing to be thus revealed, not necessarily the only thing, but incomparably the most important thing, is that other people exist.\u201d To write a novel, Murdoch continues, is to quickly discover that \u201chowever much one is in the ordinary sense \u2018interested in other people\u2019, this interest has left one far short of possessing the knowledge required to create a real character who is not oneself. It is impossible, it seems to me, not to see one\u2019s failure here as a sort of spiritual failure.\u201d Murdoch\u2019s novels teem with characters who are opaque to one another, confusingly impulsive, acting out ruptures in their supposedly intimate relationships or with their personal histories. It is common for us to meet them in moments of crisis, sometimes entering a space already filled by a group of people at odds with one another. In The Bell, her fourth novel, a young woman, Dora, reunites with her estranged husband in the setting of a lay religious community. Among those she meets are a teenage boy who, unbeknown to him, has been strategically placed to watch over a dissolute drunk; a woman (the drunk\u2019s twin sister) set on becoming a nun and a man once in love with the drunk, and disgraced in the process. Soon after her arrival, Dora is shown the abbey to which the lay community is attached by the formidable Mrs Mark, and asks whether she can climb the tower. No, she is told, the order is enclosed, and \u201cno one goes in or comes out\u201d. Dora is horrified: \u201c\u2018Do you mean,\u2019 she said, \u2018that they\u2019re completely imprisoned in there?\u2019\u201d Mrs Mark is unperturbed, and laughs. \u201c\u2018Not imprisoned, my dear,\u2019 she said. \u2018They are there of their own free will. This is not a prison. It is on the contrary a place which it is very hard to get into, and only the strongest achieve it. Like Mary in the parable, they have chosen the better part.\u2019\u201d Why somebody would choose to be imprisoned, and what they choose to be imprisoned by, is the puzzle to which Murdoch repeatedly returns in her work. It is also the reason that, for all their surface narrowness \u2013 the rarefied classes from which her characters are drawn, the milieux that veer from haut establishment to threadbare bohemian, the endless trope of the love triangle and constant romantic volte-faces \u2013 her novels still speak to us. Murdoch\u2019s people are shapeshifters, even when she is being glib or incidental. Their relations with one another rarely stay the same, and their concept of themselves is subject to continual assault. In the most gothic of her novels, The Unicorn (1963), a young woman journeys to become a governess in a remote part of western Ireland. (It transpires that she is really to be a sort of companion to a woman confined to a castle by her absent husband, to whom she has been unfaithful.) Picked up from the station, \u201cshe saw in the shadowy interior what she took at first to be a large dog, but then recognised as a very pretty boy of about fifteen\u201d. Later, she sees a seal that seems, \u201cwith its head of a primitive sea-god, like a portent\u201d. Disturbing feelings and fears embodied by animals, the presence of roiling water, humans that can only be dimly made out: all classic Murdoch touches.From her debut Under the Net in 1954 to her final novel Jackson\u2019s Dilemma, published in 1995, not long before her diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s and four years before her death in 1999, her career ran in parallel with her life as a philosopher at the University of Oxford. She became a fellow there in 1948, teaching at St Anne\u2019s College, and married John Bayley, who became Warton professor of English in 1974. In younger life and during the course of their marriage, she had affairs with both men and women (she famously described herself in a letter to her friend and fellow author Brigid Brophy as \u201ca male homosexual in female guise\u201d). For her detractors, her devotion to moral philosophy is written all too large on her fiction. Others take issue with the novels\u2019 melodramatic situations; can we really take seriously the manic manipulations of theatre director Charles Arrowby in The Sea, The Sea when all he is really doing is cooking terrible meals in seclusion and messing with his ex-girlfriend\u2019s head? But Murdoch\u2019s contrivances contained, for her, the terrifying truth that human beings, in the absence of God, are off the leash, motivated and animated by powerful internal forces beyond their apprehension, unable to conceive of goodness as an end in itself. \u201cAll altruism feeds the fat ego,\u201d argues the priest in 1966\u2019s The Time of the Angels: \u201cPeople will endlessly conceal from themselves that good is only good if one is good for nothing \u2026 With or without the illusion of God, goodness is impossible to us. We have been made too low in the order of things.\u201d In that lowness, Murdoch found the subject of her novels, each to a greater or lesser degree peopled by delusionals and lunatics. Often, those who are compelled by the attempt to be good are the most dangerous, particularly when they have covered themselves in the cloak of mysticism, a recurring trope that allows Murdoch to study \u2013 in common with Muriel Spark \u2013 the devastating power of charisma. When Murdoch\u2019s novels falter a procession of unappealing people (\u201crebarbative\u201d, as The Bell\u2019s teenager Toby would have it) trail in and out of rooms saying bizarre things to each other and then catch a train to a country house to say something bizarre to someone else. Something horrid might happen to a dog, and then someone else will die or decide to get unsuitably married. They are, in other words, ripe for parody. But, at their best, they are thrillingly fabular, giving us the sense that we are witnessing a shadow play, our attention absorbed while elsewhere something fundamental takes place. Like Marian in The Unicorn, we are held in suspension, apprised of deeply disturbing knowledge and unsure what to do with it: \u201cHer desire to go out was gone. She was afraid to step outside. She stood paralysed in the gateway for some time, keeping her breathing quiet. The great lawn at the cliff top remained cold and attentive, visible yet unreal, waiting to see what she would do.\u201d Five key works by Iris Murdoch The Flight from the Enchanter (1956) Murdoch\u2019s second novel creates a monster in newspaper magnate Mischa Fox and circles a cast of chaotic characters, mainly women, around him in a portrait of glittering, rootless London. Written at the start of her partnership with John Bayley, it reflects on personal and public power. The Bell (1958) A great bell is coming to the religious community at Imber Court, to replace the ancient one that, legend has it, flew out of the abbey and threw itself in the lake after a novice\u2019s tragic death. Murdoch uses the themes of enclosure and release as a basis to explore the nature of faith and its absence. A Severed Head (1961) An adulterous husband is surprised when his wife abandons him for a relationship with her psychoanalyst, but the chaos only increases with the arrival of anthropologist Honor Klein, who has a laser-like ability to cut through the torments of the bourgeoisie. The Black Prince (1973) Drawing inspiration from Hamlet, this novel centres on writer Bradley Pearson and his rivalry with his former protege Arnold Baffin. Crisis comes when Pearson falls in love with Baffin\u2019s daughter, Julian, in a thicket-like narrative that presents itself as a story within a story, complete with postscripts from the leading players. The Sea, The Sea (1978) Murdoch\u2019s Booker prize-winning novel, which parallels The Tempest, introduces playwright and director Charles Arrowby, who has decided to renounce the world and its works. But his plan is upended when he meets his former lover Hartley, and feels compelled to disrupt her quiet existence. \u2022 The Iris Murdoch centenary conference is at St Anne\u2019s and Somerville colleges, Oxford University, until 15 July. A centenary event is at The Second Shelf, London W1F, on 18 July. A centenary exhibition is at Phibsboro Library, Dublin, until 31 July.",

      "body": "<p>It was spring when my wife\u2019s waters broke, three months early. We rushed to hospital, terrified. If our daughter arrived now, she might not survive. If she did, she would probably be plagued by lifelong health problems. Jo spent the next four days in hospital, while we prayed labour wouldn\u2019t begin. But the night after we returned home, Jo\u2019s contractions started and we raced back to hospital. Straight away, a foetal monitor was placed on her tummy. The brisk heartbeat we had been following so closely in the previous days was gone. Our daughter had died.</p> <p>The train of our life was shunted on to a parallel track. We could see the train we were meant to be on pulling away, passing the milestones \u2013 the due date, introducing the baby to our family, the first smiles. But ahead of us now lay despair, guilt, a funeral, photos of our precious girl that some family members could barely bring themselves to look at, and support groups where every story would be more heart-rending than the last. There is no right way to deal with losing a baby, but I would call my coping strategy unusual: I became obsessed with growing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/29/safe-magic-mushrooms-psilocybin-drug-depression-illegal\" title=\"\">magic mushrooms</a>.</p> <p>Even before the stillbirth, I had experienced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/anxiety\" title=\"\">years of anxiety</a>, exacerbated by long hours spent working alone as a writer, self-esteem issues, a young family (we had a three-year-old, Grace), a midlife crisis. Whatever the cocktail of causation, it had begun to feel like a full-on depression.</p> <p>I had tried <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/\" title=\"\">cognitive behavioural therapy</a>, which took the edge off it, but I felt that I needed something radical to break myself out of the deepening loops of negativity and lethargy. I had read that psychedelic substances, such as LSD or the psilocybin in magic mushrooms, taken in very low doses, were being touted as the latest so-called smart drugs. I was interested in microdosing, not for the creativity boost that advocates in Silicon Valley extol, but for the effect it is said to have on anxiety; on breaking patterns of negative thought.</p> <p>In the course of my work, I had spoken to Dr Robin Carhart-Harris at Imperial College London, a leading researcher into psilocybin as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/10/magic-mushrooms-treatment-depression-aztecs-psilocybin-mental-health-medicine\" title=\"\">a potential treatment for depression</a>. He told me about <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13282-7\" title=\"\">the promising results</a> he had seen in people with treatment-resistant depression. He also described how the brains of people on a mushroom trip <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsif.2014.0873\" title=\"\">\u201clight up\u201d in an fMRI scanner</a>, revealing communication between areas that don\u2019t normally \u201ctalk\u201d to each other.</p> <p>In another study, at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, a mushroom trip was shown to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5367557/\" title=\"\">ease the anxiety of people with life-threatening cancer</a>, leading to dramatic improvements in mood and wellbeing. I also found <a href=\"http://www.ias.org.uk/uploads/pdf/news%20stories/dnutt-lancet-011110.pdf\" title=\"\">an article in </a><a href=\"http://www.ias.org.uk/uploads/pdf/news%20stories/dnutt-lancet-011110.pdf\" title=\"\">the Lancet</a> that concluded that magic mushrooms are the least harmful \u201crecreational\u201d drug you can take. Mushrooms are not addictive and you can\u2019t kill yourself by overdosing on them, as long as you take them in a safe environment. It is a mystery to me why they share class A illegal status with crack cocaine and heroin.</p> <p>So, in the months before we lost our daughter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/may/03/psychedelic-drugs-women-taking-tiny-doses-hattie-garlick\" title=\"\">I decided to try microdosing</a>. That presented a problem: I didn\u2019t know any drug dealers. So, I turned to YouTube. I discovered that to grow magic mushrooms at home I needed two things: mushroom spores, in a syringe filled with sterilised water; and a growth medium, or substrate, into which I would inject the spores. A simple substrate is a mix of one part organic brown rice flour, one part water and two parts vermiculite (a moisture-retaining mineral sold in garden centres). I also discovered that, while it is illegal to grow magic mushrooms, it is not illegal to buy the spores \u2013 to look at under a microscope, for example. I found a spore syringe online for \u00a315 plus postage and a substrate kit, pre-mixed and sterilised, on eBay, for \u00a326. I was excited about taking a step towards improving my mental health. Under normal circumstances am a pathetically obedient citizen. But this time I felt I was informed about the science and had evaluated the risks.</p> <p>The technical process of growing magic mushrooms appealed to my nerdy side. Any bacteria or unwanted fungus can contaminate the substrate. I was careful to don latex gloves, clean my arms and all surfaces with rubbing alcohol before I injected the spores through the plastic lid of the substrate tub. It would take about six weeks in darkness for my spores to germinate and colonise the entire substrate with mycelium, turning it white. After that, I would \u201cbirth the cake\u201d into a daylit \u201cfruiting chamber\u201d \u2013 a lidded, ventilated, clear-plastic tub with a layer of soaked perlite (volcanic glass granules) across the bottom, to keep things moist \u2013 and wait for the mushrooms to grow.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was risking seven years\u2019 jail time and the destruction of my family for what had essentially become a mad hobby</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was during the colonisation period, before seeing any mushrooms, that Jo and I lost our daughter, whom we had already named Isobelle. We would discover later that the most likely reason for her death was insufficient follow-up after Jo had been treated with antibiotics for a common infection. When Jo returned to her GP a few weeks later, complaining of further symptoms, Nice guidelines were not followed and she was sent home. We would later blame ourselves that we had not been demanding enough.</p> <p>Because Isobelle was stillborn after 24 weeks of pregnancy, our paternity and maternity rights kicked in. We were spending a lot of time at home. In my grief, I became obsessed by the progress of my mycelium, which was growing in the dark inside a tub on top of a wardrobe. I had even rigged up a night-vision camera inside the tub so that I could check the growth on my phone: like live-streaming grass growing, only slower.</p> <p>When the cake was fully colonised, I put it in the fruiting chamber. Within about four days, little brown dots, the heads of baby mushrooms, began to appear. Soon, my first crop, or \u201cflush\u201d, was ready for picking. At the time, my mother-in-law had moved in to support us. Few mothers-in-laws would approve of harvesting class A drugs in the kitchen, but mine is different. She is a keen gardener, and open-minded. When I placed the fruiting chamber on the kitchen table, put on my surgical gloves and started harvesting, she said: \u201cMy son-in-law is Walter White.\u201d As a fan of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/20/breaking-bad-10-years-on-tv-is-still-in-walter-whites-shadow\">Breaking Bad</a>, I took that as a compliment.</p> <p>About three weeks after Isobelle\u2019s death, with my anxiety buried under grief, I decided to begin microdosing. I would take 0.3 grams of dried mushrooms every third morning (<a href=\"https://thethirdwave.co/microdosing/mushrooms/\" title=\"\">a popular </a><a href=\"https://thethirdwave.co/microdosing/mushrooms/\" title=\"\">timeline</a>, recommended by Dr James Fadiman, the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychedelic-Explorers-Guide-Therapeutic-Journeys/dp/1594774021\" title=\"\">The Psychedelic Explorer\u2019s Guide</a>). I was such a mess that it was difficult to know what effect it might have. I just knew that things couldn\u2019t get any worse.</p> <p>On the days I took the dose, my mind felt more open and free-ranging; I would make more lateral connections when thinking. I would feel closer to nature, which would appear more beautiful, and more present in the moment, better connected to my family and to my own emotions, more likely to spark up conversations with strangers. The dose was too small to cause visual disturbances. It was more a feeling of energised openness; I would notice details that had previously passed me by.</p> <p>In the months that followed our loss, Jo and I struggled to keep ourselves intact. We cried frequently, tried to be strong for our daughter, Grace. Jo threw herself into gardening. Together we attended regular support groups run by <a href=\"https://www.sands.org.uk\" title=\"\">the amazing charity</a><a href=\"https://www.sands.org.uk\" title=\"\"> S</a><a href=\"https://www.sands.org.uk\" title=\"\">ands</a>. Jo began weekly sessions with a counsellor. I immersed myself in mushroom-growing. I used the spores from first flush to make my own spore syringes and injected six more tubs bought off the internet. I bought mason jars, customised them with air filters and injection ports, and filled them with my own varieties of substrate. Before long, I had 18 jars colonising and fruiting. They were concealed on top of wardrobes, out of Grace\u2019s sight and reach. I read that adding coffee grounds to the substrate could increase yields. The next day, I noticed a bin in the gardening section outside Waitrose, with a sign on it that read: \u201cCollect your coffee grounds here.\u201d Handy. I soon decided I wanted to \u201cspawn to bulk\u201d, to increase my yield. This approach was lengthier, with a variety of processes and ingredients, but produced a dense canopy of large mushrooms \u2013 one as long as my hand.</p> <p>There was no longer any logic to my behaviour. I already had enough mushrooms to microdose for at least a decade, if I chose to, and I wasn\u2019t about to become a drug dealer. To say my wife was patient is an understatement. She saw this for what it was: a bizarre coping mechanism, something productive for me to focus on. I had no financial motive; <a href=\"https://www.talktofrank.com/drug/magic-mushrooms#the-law\" title=\"\">I was risking seven years\u2019 jail time</a> and the destruction of my family for what had become a mad hobby. \u201cI liked it. I was good at it,\u201d as Walter White put it. Reluctantly, I stopped production less than six months after I had started.

      "bodyText": "It was spring when my wife\u2019s waters broke, three months early. We rushed to hospital, terrified. If our daughter arrived now, she might not survive. If she did, she would probably be plagued by lifelong health problems. Jo spent the next four days in hospital, while we prayed labour wouldn\u2019t begin. But the night after we returned home, Jo\u2019s contractions started and we raced back to hospital. Straight away, a foetal monitor was placed on her tummy. The brisk heartbeat we had been following so closely in the previous days was gone. Our daughter had died. The train of our life was shunted on to a parallel track. We could see the train we were meant to be on pulling away, passing the milestones \u2013 the due date, introducing the baby to our family, the first smiles. But ahead of us now lay despair, guilt, a funeral, photos of our precious girl that some family members could barely bring themselves to look at, and support groups where every story would be more heart-rending than the last. There is no right way to deal with losing a baby, but I would call my coping strategy unusual: I became obsessed with growing magic mushrooms. Even before the stillbirth, I had experienced years of anxiety, exacerbated by long hours spent working alone as a writer, self-esteem issues, a young family (we had a three-year-old, Grace), a midlife crisis. Whatever the cocktail of causation, it had begun to feel like a full-on depression. I had tried cognitive behavioural therapy, which took the edge off it, but I felt that I needed something radical to break myself out of the deepening loops of negativity and lethargy. I had read that psychedelic substances, such as LSD or the psilocybin in magic mushrooms, taken in very low doses, were being touted as the latest so-called smart drugs. I was interested in microdosing, not for the creativity boost that advocates in Silicon Valley extol, but for the effect it is said to have on anxiety; on breaking patterns of negative thought. In the course of my work, I had spoken to Dr Robin Carhart-Harris at Imperial College London, a leading researcher into psilocybin as a potential treatment for depression. He told me about the promising results he had seen in people with treatment-resistant depression. He also described how the brains of people on a mushroom trip \u201clight up\u201d in an fMRI scanner, revealing communication between areas that don\u2019t normally \u201ctalk\u201d to each other. In another study, at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, a mushroom trip was shown to ease the anxiety of people with life-threatening cancer, leading to dramatic improvements in mood and wellbeing. I also found an article in the Lancet that concluded that magic mushrooms are the least harmful \u201crecreational\u201d drug you can take. Mushrooms are not addictive and you can\u2019t kill yourself by overdosing on them, as long as you take them in a safe environment. It is a mystery to me why they share class A illegal status with crack cocaine and heroin. So, in the months before we lost our daughter, I decided to try microdosing. That presented a problem: I didn\u2019t know any drug dealers. So, I turned to YouTube. I discovered that to grow magic mushrooms at home I needed two things: mushroom spores, in a syringe filled with sterilised water; and a growth medium, or substrate, into which I would inject the spores. A simple substrate is a mix of one part organic brown rice flour, one part water and two parts vermiculite (a moisture-retaining mineral sold in garden centres). I also discovered that, while it is illegal to grow magic mushrooms, it is not illegal to buy the spores \u2013 to look at under a microscope, for example. I found a spore syringe online for \u00a315 plus postage and a substrate kit, pre-mixed and sterilised, on eBay, for \u00a326. I was excited about taking a step towards improving my mental health. Under normal circumstances am a pathetically obedient citizen. But this time I felt I was informed about the science and had evaluated the risks. The technical process of growing magic mushrooms appealed to my nerdy side. Any bacteria or unwanted fungus can contaminate the substrate. I was careful to don latex gloves, clean my arms and all surfaces with rubbing alcohol before I injected the spores through the plastic lid of the substrate tub. It would take about six weeks in darkness for my spores to germinate and colonise the entire substrate with mycelium, turning it white. After that, I would \u201cbirth the cake\u201d into a daylit \u201cfruiting chamber\u201d \u2013 a lidded, ventilated, clear-plastic tub with a layer of soaked perlite (volcanic glass granules) across the bottom, to keep things moist \u2013 and wait for the mushrooms to grow. It was during the colonisation period, before seeing any mushrooms, that Jo and I lost our daughter, whom we had already named Isobelle. We would discover later that the most likely reason for her death was insufficient follow-up after Jo had been treated with antibiotics for a common infection. When Jo returned to her GP a few weeks later, complaining of further symptoms, Nice guidelines were not followed and she was sent home. We would later blame ourselves that we had not been demanding enough. Because Isobelle was stillborn after 24 weeks of pregnancy, our paternity and maternity rights kicked in. We were spending a lot of time at home. In my grief, I became obsessed by the progress of my mycelium, which was growing in the dark inside a tub on top of a wardrobe. I had even rigged up a night-vision camera inside the tub so that I could check the growth on my phone: like live-streaming grass growing, only slower. When the cake was fully colonised, I put it in the fruiting chamber. Within about four days, little brown dots, the heads of baby mushrooms, began to appear. Soon, my first crop, or \u201cflush\u201d, was ready for picking. At the time, my mother-in-law had moved in to support us. Few mothers-in-laws would approve of harvesting class A drugs in the kitchen, but mine is different. She is a keen gardener, and open-minded. When I placed the fruiting chamber on the kitchen table, put on my surgical gloves and started harvesting, she said: \u201cMy son-in-law is Walter White.\u201d As a fan of Breaking Bad, I took that as a compliment. About three weeks after Isobelle\u2019s death, with my anxiety buried under grief, I decided to begin microdosing. I would take 0.3 grams of dried mushrooms every third morning (a popular timeline, recommended by Dr James Fadiman, the author of The Psychedelic Explorer\u2019s Guide). I was such a mess that it was difficult to know what effect it might have. I just knew that things couldn\u2019t get any worse. On the days I took the dose, my mind felt more open and free-ranging; I would make more lateral connections when thinking. I would feel closer to nature, which would appear more beautiful, and more present in the moment, better connected to my family and to my own emotions, more likely to spark up conversations with strangers. The dose was too small to cause visual disturbances. It was more a feeling of energised openness; I would notice details that had previously passed me by. In the months that followed our loss, Jo and I struggled to keep ourselves intact. We cried frequently, tried to be strong for our daughter, Grace. Jo threw herself into gardening. Together we attended regular support groups run by the amazing charity Sands. Jo began weekly sessions with a counsellor. I immersed myself in mushroom-growing. I used the spores from first flush to make my own spore syringes and injected six more tubs bought off the internet. I bought mason jars, customised them with air filters and injection ports, and filled them with my own varieties of substrate. Before long, I had 18 jars colonising and fruiting. They were concealed on top of wardrobes, out of Grace\u2019s sight and reach. I read that adding coffee grounds to the substrate could increase yields. The next day, I noticed a bin in the gardening section outside Waitrose, with a sign on it that read: \u201cCollect your coffee grounds here.\u201d Handy. I soon decided I wanted to \u201cspawn to bulk\u201d, to increase my yield. This approach was lengthier, with a variety of processes and ingredients, but produced a dense canopy of large mushrooms \u2013 one as long as my hand. There was no longer any logic to my behaviour. I already had enough mushrooms to microdose for at least a decade, if I chose to, and I wasn\u2019t about to become a drug dealer. To say my wife was patient is an understatement. She saw this for what it was: a bizarre coping mechanism, something productive for me to focus on. I had no financial motive; I was risking seven years\u2019 jail time and the destruction of my family for what had become a mad hobby. \u201cI liked it. I was good at it,\u201d as Walter White put it. Reluctantly, I stopped production less than six months after I had started. Mushrooms are mostly made of water, so when you dehydrate them for storing they lose about 90% of their mass. Even so, I had filled about 10 litres-worth of containers. I often felt I needed to cry over Isobelle, yet as the months passed it became increasingly difficult: I would busy-think myself out of my emotional states. But on the days that I microdosed, I noticed I was much more likely to sit with my feelings and cry. It was a relief. In the summer, we discovered that Jo was pregnant again, and so began another cycle of stress and fear. We dreaded the thought that this new child would die, too. By September, my grief had withdrawn inside me like a dark, choking mass. I felt there was no point to anything. Keeping up with my professional commitments became a struggle. I seemed to be returning to a depressed state, and microdosing wasn\u2019t helping enough. It was then that I began to consider taking a full dose of mushrooms. *** I had taken a mushroom trip once in my life, five years before, with friends. We spent some of that trip in a garden and I experienced the famed psychedelic visuals. The bark on a tree flowed and bulged; the grass moved in diamond formations; time became incomprehensible. But my main takeaway from that trip was a realisation that, beneath my uncertainty about the new relationship that I was in, deep down, our connection was solid. (This faith would be borne out: reader, I married her.) For this new trip, I calculated my dose based on that given to the subjects of Carhart-Harris\u2019s study of people with treatment-resistant depression.

Will we choose a survival-of-the\u2011fittest system, in which poverty and disability are treated as moral failings, deserving of punishment? Or are we prepared to face our own vulnerability, recognise our shared humanity, and rebuild our welfare state?</p> <p>Ryan, a Guardian columnist, makes clear just how far we have fallen over what she evocatively calls the \u201cprecipice of national character\u201d. Over six chapters she sets out the many ways in which disabled people have been made to pay since the financial crash. In Poverty we learn how the cumulative impact of benefit changes \u2013 cuts to council tax support, the bedroom tax, increased sanctions \u2013 has pushed an estimated 650,000 disabled people into destitution.</p> <p>The chapter on Work considers how parts of the media reviled disabled people as fakes and \u201cbenefit cheats\u201d in the early years of austerity, laying the groundwork for a new, punitive system of benefits assessment. By 2016, there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/13/benefit-or-tax-evasion-row-over-the-tories-targets\" title=\"\">3,700 benefit investigators</a> \u2013 five times as many as investigate tax evasion (benefit fraud costs the taxpayer \u00a31.3bn a year, while the tax gap caused by unpaid taxes is around \u00a335bn). At the same time, the support that had been in place to help disabled people into work was stripped away.</p> <p>Chapters on Independence and Housing look at how these problems have been compounded by cuts to social care services. It is a miserable catalogue of penny-pinching: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/03/less-than-half-of-councils-still-offering-meals-on-wheels\" title=\"\">meals on wheels</a> being scrapped; disabled people being charged for care visits, or left alone and unable to wash or eat; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/31/benefits-cuts-lost-motability-car-scooter-wheelchair\" title=\"\">Motability cars</a> taken away, leaving people housebound; people being refused wheelchairs and/or essential alterations to their homes. One particularly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/15/disabled-people-suffer-inaccessible-social-housing\" title=\"\">shocking example is that of Robert</a>, a tetraplegic man housed in a second floor flat with no lift access; in order to leave his home, his carer has to drag him down the stairs.</p> <p>In Women and Children, Ryan examines how these groups have been particularly impacted by austerity: in some tragic cases the loss of benefits and support services for disabled mothers has led to their children being taken into care. Hundreds of thousands of children have been left looking after their disabled parents in the absence of state services. All of this is harder to challenge because of cuts to legal aid.</p> <p>I wonder if the book might have been better structured as a series of case studies, which would have dialled down the polemic and encouraged more empathy. Ryan has a devastating case to make; the question is: are we ready to listen?</p> <p><em> \u2022 Crippled is published by Verso (\u00a312.99).

The chapter on Work considers how parts of the media reviled disabled people as fakes and \u201cbenefit cheats\u201d in the early years of austerity, laying the groundwork for a new, punitive system of benefits assessment. By 2016, there were 3,700 benefit investigators \u2013 five times as many as investigate tax evasion (benefit fraud costs the taxpayer \u00a31.3bn a year, while the tax gap caused by unpaid taxes is around \u00a335bn). At the same time, the support that had been in place to help disabled people into work was stripped away. Chapters on Independence and Housing look at how these problems have been compounded by cuts to social care services. It is a miserable catalogue of penny-pinching: meals on wheels being scrapped; disabled people being charged for care visits, or left alone and unable to wash or eat; Motability cars taken away, leaving people housebound; people being refused wheelchairs and/or essential alterations to their homes. One particularly shocking example is that of Robert, a tetraplegic man housed in a second floor flat with no lift access; in order to leave his home, his carer has to drag him down the stairs. In Women and Children, Ryan examines how these groups have been particularly impacted by austerity: in some tragic cases the loss of benefits and support services for disabled mothers has led to their children being taken into care. Hundreds of thousands of children have been left looking after their disabled parents in the absence of state services. All of this is harder to challenge because of cuts to legal aid. I wonder if the book might have been better structured as a series of case studies, which would have dialled down the polemic and encouraged more empathy. Ryan has a devastating case to make; the question is: are we ready to listen? \u2022 Crippled is published by Verso (\u00a312.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

The town, which is not far from Saint-Malo, is the oyster capital of Brittany and a number of blue- and white-striped stalls run by local fishermen sell different sizes and species for just a few euros. Simply squeeze on a drizzle of lemon juice and swig them back while gazing at Mont Saint-Michel away on the horizon. \u2022 From around \u20ac6 a dozen, prices change daily, marcheauxhuitres-cancale.com Le Comptoir Breizh Caf\u00e9, Saint-Malo The ubiquitous Breton galettes (buckwheat pancakes) and cr\u00eapes are a good bet in most places, but the renowned Comptoir Breizh takes these local specialities to another level. Their delicious golden galettes are filled with everything from simple local ham and decadent butter to more sophisticated andouille sausage and confit onions cooked in cider. The restaurant\u2019s links to Japan go beyond its adjacent sushi restaurant; so loved by the Japanese is the Breizh Caf\u00e9 there\u2019s a branch in Tokyo (as well as in Cancale and Paris). Reservations essential. \u2022 Mains from \u20ac12.50, breizhcafe.com Le Brise Lames, Roscoff The charming port town of Roscoff is blessed with its local produce; not only is there a bounty of fish and seafood being landed daily at its port, the surrounding countryside is famous for its high-quality vegetables, including the famous pink onions, which onion-sellers of the 19th and early 20th century touted door-to-door across Britain. One of the town\u2019s best restaurants is Le Brises Lames, which uses these local ingredients to create an excellent modern European menu. There is a small dining room and a terrace overlooking the harbour. \u2022 Mains from \u20ac13, on Facebook Cr\u00eaperie Ty Malou, La Trinit\u00e9-sur-Mer It may be a coincidence that a cr\u00eaperie in the sailing hub of Trinit\u00e9-sur-Mer serves the holy trinity of Breton pancake toppings: confit apples, salted caramel and butter, but whatever the reason, this friendly harbourside cafe is the place to indulge. Its galette menu offers all the classics \u2013 such as ham, cheese and egg for Le Compl\u00e8te \u2013 and don\u2019t forget to order a bol, the traditional ceramic cup of local cider to go with it. Walk off the meal around the harbour, admiring the moored yachts. \u2022 Mains from around \u20ac7, on Facebook Bistrot du Port, Billiers Just a 10-minute drive from the autoroute that zips through southern Brittany, this excellent little bistro is a great place to stop en route east.

It was only going to end one way and if it took longer than expected it was concluded when Griezmann\u2019s lawyer, Sevan Karian, arrived at La Liga\u2019s HQ \u2013 although Atl\u00e9tico say that \u20ac120m is not enough, claiming the true value to be \u20ac200m.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/12/antoine-griezmann-joins-barcelona-from-atletico-madrid-for-120m\">Barcelona sign Antoine Griezmann and make buyout clause \u20ac800m</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The clause dropped to \u20ac120m at the start of this month but Barcelona had hoped to reach a negotiated settlement rather than be forced to pay up front in one go. Atl\u00e9tico refused, publicly accusing Barcelona and the Frenchman of a lack of respect in a statement that also demanded he report for training last Sunday. This was despite Atl\u00e9tico requesting he record a video announcing his intention to leave on 14 May, despite Griezmann not having had his statutory 30 days\u2019 holiday and despite their using the money to sign Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix for \u20ac126m, handing him Griezmann\u2019s No 7 shirt.</p> \n<p>Griezmann will now report for training on Monday \u2013 in Barcelona. Luis Su\u00e1rez and Lionel Messi will not be there but how well he fits with them will be crucial to his success at the Camp Nou.</p> \n<p>It is not entirely clear where he does fit \u2013 his natural playing position is the same as Messi\u2019s \u2013 and there have been some suggestions those two would prefer to see Neymar come back from Paris Saint\u2011Germain.</p> \n<p>There has been a sense of unease at Barcelona returning to a player who so publicly rejected them 13 months ago. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/07/liverpool-barcelona-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">the ignominious Champions League defeat at Anfield</a>, though, most of their followers will celebrate this signing. It is one they have chased for a while.</p> \n<p>Barcelona first approached Griezmann last year, aware that his buyout clause would temporarily drop to \u20ac100m. They were prepared to pay that sum, unilaterally releasing him from his contract, and reached an agreement on personal terms. That left Griezmann\u2019s future in his own hands and his deliberations became the focus of a documentary called <em>La Decisi\u00f3n</em> where \u2013 in soft focus and stylish shots \u2013 he can be seen agonising over what decision to make: stay or go?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7943fff9-2bad-4fe8-a383-cf35cc47ffb9\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>1</b> Neymar, Barcelona to PSG, 2017, \u00a3200.6m<br><b>2</b> Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 Monaco to PSG, 2017, \u00a3128m&nbsp;<br><b>3</b> Antoine Griezmann, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid to Barcelona, 2019, \u00a3107.6m<br><b>4</b> Philippe Coutinho, Liverpool to Barcelona, 2018, \u00a3106.4m&nbsp;<br><b>5</b> Cristiano Ronaldo, Real Madrid to Juventus, 2018, \u00a399.2m&nbsp;<br><b>6</b> Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Borussia Dortmund to Barcelona, 2017, \u00a396.8m<br><b>7</b> Paul Pogba, Juventus to Manchester United, 2016, \u00a389m&nbsp;<br><b>8</b> Gareth Bale, Tottenham to Real Madrid, 2013, \u00a385.3m&nbsp;<br><b>9</b> Cristiano Ronaldo, Manchester United to Real Madrid, 2009, \u00a380m&nbsp;<br><b>10</b>&nbsp;Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, Napoli to Juventus, 2016, \u00a375.3m</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Over 30 minutes, the audience is given glimpses of Griezmann contemplating his future, looking pensive at the dinner table, pensive playing basketball, pensive in a plane and pensive on a horse.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he says often but at the end of the film, shown on 14 June, he finally announces his decision to stay at Atl\u00e9tico. He called Barcelona to apologise: their board did not know the documentary was being made, even though the production company belongs in part to Gerard Piqu\u00e9, their centre-half.</p> \n<p>Griezmann signed an improved deal at Atl\u00e9tico, worth \u20ac20m a year after tax, but that was far from definitive: the new contract included a \u20ac200m buyout clause but it would again drop on 1 July \u2013 explicitly allowing for an exit, should the player want one, and inviting suitors to line up once more. Once they had the signal, they did just that.</p> \n<p>Griezmann may not have regretted renewing, staying for another season, but he soon decided that he did want to depart and so the deal was picked up again, 12 months on, and for \u20ac20m more. The same amount Atl\u00e9tico had spent paying him last season.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChampionsLeague/status/1149670691840520192\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Griezmann \u27a1\ufe0f Barcelona <br><br>\ud83d\udcdd OFFICIAL: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FCBarcelona?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@FCBarcelona</a> have confirmed the signing of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AntoGriezmann?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AntoGriezmann</a> <br><br>2020 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/UCL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#UCL</a> winner? \ud83e\udd14 <a href=\"https://t.co/4sTuYdBK8a\">pic.twitter.com/4sTuYdBK8a</a></p>\u2014 UEFA Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChampionsLeague/status/1149670691840520192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 12, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Ultimately, his season was a disappointing one, which plays its part in his leaving. Atl\u00e9tico had strengthened the team in an attempt to convince him to remain and they again finished ahead of Real Madrid in La Liga, but that was not enough.</p> \n<p>Legacy looms large in the documentary, Griezmann acutely aware that any history made at Atl\u00e9tico would be his, while success elsewhere would be shared. But that requires success in the first place and it did not come. He admitted that living in Messi\u2019s shadow had been a factor in choosing to stay then, but he has thought again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/02/neymar-psg-barcelona-tells-team-mates-leave\" title=\"\">There is a parallel to Neymar\u2019s departure to PSG</a>, the Brazilian\u2019s realisation that playing with Messi may cast more light than shadow.</p> \n<p>The season was defined above all by the Champions League: the primary focus of the documentary, Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s obsession and the competition whose final would be held at their Wanda Metropolitano. That became a target and, by extension, a kind of watershed, too \u2013 it is almost as if the Frenchman was convinced, like some kind of crime caper, to do one last job, their biggest yet.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It did not work out and it does not feel like chance that, if Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s allegations are to be believed \u2013 and his new club will not recognise this \u2013 Griezmann had agreed to join Bar\u00e7a in the days after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/12/juventus-atletico-madrid-champions-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">Atl\u00e9tico lost to Juventus </a>in the last 16.</p> \n<p>There was still a long way to go and there may be arguments ahead even now, but essentially it was done.

Atl\u00e9tico refused, publicly accusing Barcelona and the Frenchman of a lack of respect in a statement that also demanded he report for training last Sunday. This was despite Atl\u00e9tico requesting he record a video announcing his intention to leave on 14 May, despite Griezmann not having had his statutory 30 days\u2019 holiday and despite their using the money to sign Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix for \u20ac126m, handing him Griezmann\u2019s No 7 shirt. Griezmann will now report for training on Monday \u2013 in Barcelona. Luis Su\u00e1rez and Lionel Messi will not be there but how well he fits with them will be crucial to his success at the Camp Nou. It is not entirely clear where he does fit \u2013 his natural playing position is the same as Messi\u2019s \u2013 and there have been some suggestions those two would prefer to see Neymar come back from Paris Saint\u2011Germain. There has been a sense of unease at Barcelona returning to a player who so publicly rejected them 13 months ago. After the ignominious Champions League defeat at Anfield, though, most of their followers will celebrate this signing. It is one they have chased for a while. Barcelona first approached Griezmann last year, aware that his buyout clause would temporarily drop to \u20ac100m. They were prepared to pay that sum, unilaterally releasing him from his contract, and reached an agreement on personal terms. That left Griezmann\u2019s future in his own hands and his deliberations became the focus of a documentary called La Decisi\u00f3n where \u2013 in soft focus and stylish shots \u2013 he can be seen agonising over what decision to make: stay or go? Over 30 minutes, the audience is given glimpses of Griezmann contemplating his future, looking pensive at the dinner table, pensive playing basketball, pensive in a plane and pensive on a horse. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he says often but at the end of the film, shown on 14 June, he finally announces his decision to stay at Atl\u00e9tico. He called Barcelona to apologise: their board did not know the documentary was being made, even though the production company belongs in part to Gerard Piqu\u00e9, their centre-half. Griezmann signed an improved deal at Atl\u00e9tico, worth \u20ac20m a year after tax, but that was far from definitive: the new contract included a \u20ac200m buyout clause but it would again drop on 1 July \u2013 explicitly allowing for an exit, should the player want one, and inviting suitors to line up once more. Once they had the signal, they did just that. Griezmann may not have regretted renewing, staying for another season, but he soon decided that he did want to depart and so the deal was picked up again, 12 months on, and for \u20ac20m more. The same amount Atl\u00e9tico had spent paying him last season. Ultimately, his season was a disappointing one, which plays its part in his leaving. Atl\u00e9tico had strengthened the team in an attempt to convince him to remain and they again finished ahead of Real Madrid in La Liga, but that was not enough. Legacy looms large in the documentary, Griezmann acutely aware that any history made at Atl\u00e9tico would be his, while success elsewhere would be shared. But that requires success in the first place and it did not come. He admitted that living in Messi\u2019s shadow had been a factor in choosing to stay then, but he has thought again. There is a parallel to Neymar\u2019s departure to PSG, the Brazilian\u2019s realisation that playing with Messi may cast more light than shadow. The season was defined above all by the Champions League: the primary focus of the documentary, Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s obsession and the competition whose final would be held at their Wanda Metropolitano. That became a target and, by extension, a kind of watershed, too \u2013 it is almost as if the Frenchman was convinced, like some kind of crime caper, to do one last job, their biggest yet. It did not work out and it does not feel like chance that, if Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s allegations are to be believed \u2013 and his new club will not recognise this \u2013 Griezmann had agreed to join Bar\u00e7a in the days after Atl\u00e9tico lost to Juventus in the last 16. There was still a long way to go and there may be arguments ahead even now, but essentially it was done. On 14 May, Griezmann recorded a video on a phone saying he was leaving, but he did not say where he was going. He could not and he did not tell them either, although Atl\u00e9tico claimed they knew. All that was left to do was wait for the buyout clause value to drop, the way it had been designed to do. Thirteen days later, cameras caught a man strolling into a building carrying \u20ac120m.",

      "body": "<p>Being the highest paid artist in Christendom is no guarantee of posterity. Who, baroque specialists aside, can name anything by the Venetian composer Antonio Caldara (1670-1736), a prolific employee of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI, with numerous stage works to his name? <a href=\"https://buxtonfestival.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Buxton international festival</a>, ever committed to presenting the unfamiliar, has surpassed its own recondite standards this 40th anniversary year with a staging of his <strong><a href=\"https://buxtonfestival.co.uk/whats-on/lucio-papirio-dittatore\" title=\"\">Lucio Papirio Dittatore</a></strong> (1719). An epic tale of love and strife in pre-imperial Rome, it was premiered in Vienna 300 years ago and probably hasn\u2019t been performed since. It may also be the first professional staging of any Caldara opera in the UK.</p> <p>The score was reconstructed \u2013 every instrumental and vocal part realised and made playable \u2013 by the violinist Adrian Chandler, director of the baroque ensemble <a href=\"https://www.laserenissima.co.uk/\" title=\"\">La Serenissima</a> and clearly a man of indefatigable energy. This is a long work.</p> <p>It\u2019s no surprise to find the plot turns on a people\u2019s vote that goes the wrong way, and a law-abiding dictator\u2019s wish to overturn it for the greater good. Sense prevails. All ends, after several potential endings, it must be said, with a hymn to benign dictatorship in general, and the superior powers of the Holy Roman Emperor in particular.</p> <p>In Buxton, a top cast tackled this work with enthusiastic commitment. As the army leader who offends the dictator, countertenor <a href=\"https://www.atholestill.com/artist/owen-willetts/\" title=\"\">Owen Willetts</a> (Quinto) has the best music and sang his showpiece arias with dazzling fervour. His love duet with the ever affecting <a href=\"http://www.grovesartists.com/artist/rowan-pierce/\" title=\"\">Rowan Pierce</a> (Papiria), when he faces death, was a heartfelt centrepiece. Robert Murray, William Towers, Elizabeth Karani, Eleanor Dennis and Gareth Brynmor John all shone, supported by a lean, lively chorus. Apparently Charles VI, and there\u2019s no accounting for taste, liked fugues. Caldara provides a couple, complete with lusty trumpets and drums.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"534da0ebfa8af18f02689e91c125f5f2fb0d93aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/534da0ebfa8af18f02689e91c125f5f2fb0d93aa/0_0_4912_7360/667.jpg\" alt=\"Owen Willetts and Rowan Pierce in Lucio Papirio Dittatore at Buxton Opera House.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Owen Willetts and Rowan Pierce in Lucio Papirio Dittatore at Buxton Opera House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Genevieve Girling</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The tireless musicians of La Serenissima, led by Chandler and positioned to the side of the stage, were on their feet throughout. Lucky continuo players \u2013 harpsichord, cello, theorbo \u2013 who got to sit. Chandler himself dispatched his many explosive violin solos with verve, his right arm in perpetual frenetic motion to deal with the fizzing scales and rapid bowing techniques. If there\u2019s a fair amount of thin, baroque-style padding and yards of \u201csecco\u201d recitative, the cascade of star arias for the seven soloists shows why Caldara could command a fortune. Director Mark Burns and designer Kitty Callister kept the production simple, the set consisting of allusions to antiquity \u2013 arches, statuary \u2013 wrapped up <a href=\"https://christojeanneclaude.net/projects/wrapped-monuments\" title=\"\">Christo-style</a>. They didn\u2019t find a way to deal with the challenges of da capo arias, with all their repeats, but let\u2019s leave that for another day, another stage. These singers deserve further chances to perform this rarity they\u2019ve worked so hard to master.</p> <p>Twenty new pieces played by different ensembles and a chance to hear each twice over in one sitting: this is the capacious aim of the <strong><a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/blog/new-music-biennial-southbank-centre-your-guide\" title=\"\">New Music Biennial</a></strong>, a free three-day collaboration between the PRS Foundation and London\u2019s Southbank (you can listen on Radio 3\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0006lym\" title=\"\">New Music Show</a></em>), <a href=\"https://www.newmusicbiennial.co.uk/tag/hull/\" title=\"\">repeated in Hull</a> this weekend.

      "bodyText": "Being the highest paid artist in Christendom is no guarantee of posterity. Who, baroque specialists aside, can name anything by the Venetian composer Antonio Caldara (1670-1736), a prolific employee of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI, with numerous stage works to his name? Buxton international festival, ever committed to presenting the unfamiliar, has surpassed its own recondite standards this 40th anniversary year with a staging of his Lucio Papirio Dittatore (1719). An epic tale of love and strife in pre-imperial Rome, it was premiered in Vienna 300 years ago and probably hasn\u2019t been performed since. It may also be the first professional staging of any Caldara opera in the UK. The score was reconstructed \u2013 every instrumental and vocal part realised and made playable \u2013 by the violinist Adrian Chandler, director of the baroque ensemble La Serenissima and clearly a man of indefatigable energy. This is a long work. It\u2019s no surprise to find the plot turns on a people\u2019s vote that goes the wrong way, and a law-abiding dictator\u2019s wish to overturn it for the greater good. Sense prevails. All ends, after several potential endings, it must be said, with a hymn to benign dictatorship in general, and the superior powers of the Holy Roman Emperor in particular. In Buxton, a top cast tackled this work with enthusiastic commitment. As the army leader who offends the dictator, countertenor Owen Willetts (Quinto) has the best music and sang his showpiece arias with dazzling fervour. His love duet with the ever affecting Rowan Pierce (Papiria), when he faces death, was a heartfelt centrepiece. Robert Murray, William Towers, Elizabeth Karani, Eleanor Dennis and Gareth Brynmor John all shone, supported by a lean, lively chorus. Apparently Charles VI, and there\u2019s no accounting for taste, liked fugues. Caldara provides a couple, complete with lusty trumpets and drums. The tireless musicians of La Serenissima, led by Chandler and positioned to the side of the stage, were on their feet throughout. Lucky continuo players \u2013 harpsichord, cello, theorbo \u2013 who got to sit. Chandler himself dispatched his many explosive violin solos with verve, his right arm in perpetual frenetic motion to deal with the fizzing scales and rapid bowing techniques. If there\u2019s a fair amount of thin, baroque-style padding and yards of \u201csecco\u201d recitative, the cascade of star arias for the seven soloists shows why Caldara could command a fortune. Director Mark Burns and designer Kitty Callister kept the production simple, the set consisting of allusions to antiquity \u2013 arches, statuary \u2013 wrapped up Christo-style. They didn\u2019t find a way to deal with the challenges of da capo arias, with all their repeats, but let\u2019s leave that for another day, another stage. These singers deserve further chances to perform this rarity they\u2019ve worked so hard to master. Twenty new pieces played by different ensembles and a chance to hear each twice over in one sitting: this is the capacious aim of the New Music Biennial, a free three-day collaboration between the PRS Foundation and London\u2019s Southbank (you can listen on Radio 3\u2019s New Music Show), repeated in Hull this weekend. Sampling five hours of this marathon, I heard works refreshingly diverse in scale and approach. The biennial may not define new music, as the tagline promised, but who can, or should? Openness is the imperative. Rolf Hind\u2019s Tiger\u2019s Nest, for percussion, two pianos and gamelan, takes its title from a cliffside Buddhist monastery in the mountains of Bhutan. The whispered, ethereal sounds of two prepared pianos and the ever delicate gongs, bells (some formidable work from percussionist Colin Currie) and gamelan chimes, created a sense of this precipitous edifice, and its sacred purpose. In noisy, upbeat contrast, Sam Eastmond\u2019s Brit-Ish, performed by the big band Spike Orchestra, drew on radical Jewish culture. Klezmer sounds tame in comparison. The video games composer Jessica Curry addressed female power in She Who, a radiant, catchy work for the National Youth Chamber Choir. Curry noted that, as a woman in the games industry, she had been subject to death and rape threats. Writing for these young singers was fruitful artistically, and a relief. Sona Jobarteh united the west African sounds of calabash, balafon and kora with amplified violin, cello, bass and electric guitar to exuberant, poetic effect. The baritone Roderick Williams found time in his busy singing career to write three jazzy, upbeat songs \u2013 setting poems from Chris Beckett\u2019s Ethiopia Boy \u2013 for Chineke! Orchestra, with himself as soloist. Two installations ran all weekend: in Requiem for the 21st Century, the Iraqi composer Khyam Allami suspended eight ouds in a circle, amplified to act as loudspeakers, transmitting gorgeous, unearthly sounds of plucked strings and fragmented voices (the chorus of Opera North): haunting and mesmeric. Music for Seven Ice Cream Vans by Dan Jones, merged the jingle-jangles of ice-cream vans into an aural, outdoor soundscape.

The easiest way to get round this is liquid feeding. Before sowing, I water the ground in either comfrey or organic tomato feed: something high in potash to get things growing. Then I sow into a thin layer of the best quality compost I have. Once the seedlings are up, I use a liquid seaweed feed, rich in trace minerals such as zinc, copper and boron. I keep this up till the seedlings are about 10cm high, and then I find they are usually happy to cope on their own. However, it is always worth sowing in dry weather.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/29/weed-wildlife-friendly-way\">How to weed in a wildlife-friendly way | Alys Fowler</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Make sure you thin them out early on.

It\u2019s a little too late to sow for overwintering, but it\u2019s always worth a gamble because if they don\u2019t fatten up you can eat them in early autumn as small and perfectly sweet. Beets take between 60-90 days to mature, but if you want them to sit over winter they need to be a decent size, and that\u2019s all about getting good, even growth at the beginning. Beets are notorious for sulking at seedling size, where they seem to almost refuse to grow, their tiny leaves turning bright red as if they are holding their breath in fury. The truth is, they are doing just that \u2013 sulking because the soil is not quite up to their standard. They like free-draining, mineral-rich soil that is roughly pH neutral, and they are very fussy about their micronutrients, particularly boron. If your soil lacks boron, boy do the beets let you know, with painfully slow growth. The easiest way to get round this is liquid feeding. Before sowing, I water the ground in either comfrey or organic tomato feed: something high in potash to get things growing. Then I sow into a thin layer of the best quality compost I have. Once the seedlings are up, I use a liquid seaweed feed, rich in trace minerals such as zinc, copper and boron. I keep this up till the seedlings are about 10cm high, and then I find they are usually happy to cope on their own. However, it is always worth sowing in dry weather. Make sure you thin them out early on. For tiny beets to eat in salads, you need roughly 7cm each way between plants. For larger beets you need 10cm each way, and for storage beets you need to increase that to 20cm. I grow \u2018Bull\u2019s Blood\u2019 for its dark magenta leaves for eating, \u2018Egyptian Turnip Rooted\u2019 that sits on top of the soil, like a turnip and has a good flavour, \u2018Golden\u2019 or \u2018Burpee\u2019s Golden\u2019 for the sweetest yellow roots, and the F1 \u2018Pablo\u2019 which is very fast growing so it\u2019s excellent for getting the quickest row of sweet baby beets.",

      "body": "<p>In March 2016 a shot at the Africa Cup of Nations title was the last of Youcef Belaili\u2019s concerns. To all intents and purposes his career appeared over. Fifa had confirmed a four-year global ban after a post-match doping test, taken seven months previously, came up positively for cocaine. He had just turned 24 but the best years of his career were to be taken away and, whatever the mitigation, he had only himself to blame.</p> <p>Yet Belaili will enter the Cairo International Stadium pitch for Sunday\u2019s semi-final against Nigeria as a player reborn; one who has served his time and is performing with a flair and confidence few have matched all summer. Belaili\u2019s suspension was eventually reduced to two years by the court of arbitration for sport, who judged he had ingested the drug unintentionally while smoking a shisha pipe, and he returned to action in September 2017, rather than September 2019. His displays for Algeria suggest the promise he once showed is being fulfilled and the marvel, in a team so long reliant on mainstays such as Riyad Mahrez and Sofiane Feghouli, is that he is doing it all alongside another late bloomer previously little known to a global audience.</p> <p>Spool back to the late 2000s and Belaili can be found in a team photo from one of the age-group sides of RCG Oran, a lower-division club from Algeria\u2019s second city, crouched a few places along from Baghdad Bounedjah. It was a tough place to start, one that had no significant history of talent development and one where, for two teenagers, playing pranks on their coaches was as satisfying as anything else. In an act of slapstick Bounedjah once locked the dressing room doors on one who had gone on the warpath after they defied his wishes and played in a street football tournament.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/11/nigeria-africa-cup-of-nations-semi-final-drama-quality\">Nigeria could claim glory in a Cup of Nations higher on drama than quality | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But now Belaili and Bounedjah are Algeria\u2019s in-form forwards and the players who look best placed to win them a first continental trophy since 1990. They are, in their different ways, mavericks who recall a different era, an antidote to the suggestion that, at this level of football, there are no real surprises any more.</p> <p>Bounedjah, with his upright stance and pencil moustache, has an air of the 1930s film star about him and risked being the story when, on Thursday night, he missed a penalty that would have put Algeria two goals up in their quarter-final with Ivory Coast. An equaliser followed; he was substituted and watched the rest of the match in tears, which abated only when those who remained on the field scraped a shootout win. \u201cIf we lost, I would be responsible,\u201d he said in a post-match interview during which he apologised three times; by most measures, though, he has some credit left in the bank.</p> <p>Last year Bounedjah scored 59 times for his club, the Qatari side Al-Sadd, putting him top of the global charts. He broke the league\u2019s goalscoring record with 39 from 22 games in 2018-19, six hat-tricks helping him along; some divergence from days when, aged 20, he was still playing in Algeria\u2019s amateur divisions for RCG. His record has earned him the centre-forward spot in Djamel Belmadi\u2019s side and he has proved to be a bad boy in his own way; one of those strikers you cannot take your eyes off; a snarling, niggly Diego Costa analogue who still courts attention when the ball is 80 yards away.</p> <p>\u201cIf I were a defender I would not want to play against him; he plays both the old and the modern way,\u201d was the verdict last week of El Hadji Diouf, who knows a few things about the dark arts. An over-reliance on them sometimes caused problems earlier in his career; these days a slightly toned-down act makes him the perfect leading man for a team that, while comfortably the most rounded unit left in this competition, can niggle and stall a game to a level almost beyond compare.</p> <p>It is remarkable to see Bounedjah thriving alongside Belaili, who was recalled by Belmadi last November for his first cap in three and a half years and was unsure of a spot in the final Cup of Nations squad until a relatively late stage. Some close observers of the Algeria team believe Belaili is the most talented player the country has produced in decades, better even than Mahrez; a lavish, spontaneous inside-forward capable of creating magic from nothing. He has certainly forged a fine partnership with his old academy friend, the pair playing a one-two from which Belaili opened the scoring in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/jul/07/algeria-v-guinea-africa-cup-of-nations-round-of-16-live\" title=\"\">round-of-16 win against Guinea</a>. They have roomed together this summer and there is a genuine sense that a degree of telepathy was honed on those pitches in Oran.</p> <p>\u201cWe know expectations are high and we will do our best not to go back [home] empty-handed,\u201d said Belaili, who these days plays his club football for the Tunisian side Esp\u00e9rance. The smart money is on Algeria facing Senegal in Friday\u2019s final and Belaili has already outdone them once, cracking in a brilliant winner when they met in the group stage. A more accurate contribution from Bounedjah, whether or not from the penalty spot, would enhance their chances and add to his sole strike of the tournament so far, against Kenya.</p> <p>Both men are 27 and the time for a career-changing move to one of Europe\u2019s big leagues has realistically passed. There will be no Premier League title like those won by Mahrez, and no distinguished La Liga stint as experienced by Feghouli with Valencia. The chances are growing, though, that these two rough diamonds will make up for lost time by taking their more feted colleagues to uncharted heights.</p>",

Belaili\u2019s suspension was eventually reduced to two years by the court of arbitration for sport, who judged he had ingested the drug unintentionally while smoking a shisha pipe, and he returned to action in September 2017, rather than September 2019. His displays for Algeria suggest the promise he once showed is being fulfilled and the marvel, in a team so long reliant on mainstays such as Riyad Mahrez and Sofiane Feghouli, is that he is doing it all alongside another late bloomer previously little known to a global audience. Spool back to the late 2000s and Belaili can be found in a team photo from one of the age-group sides of RCG Oran, a lower-division club from Algeria\u2019s second city, crouched a few places along from Baghdad Bounedjah. It was a tough place to start, one that had no significant history of talent development and one where, for two teenagers, playing pranks on their coaches was as satisfying as anything else. In an act of slapstick Bounedjah once locked the dressing room doors on one who had gone on the warpath after they defied his wishes and played in a street football tournament. But now Belaili and Bounedjah are Algeria\u2019s in-form forwards and the players who look best placed to win them a first continental trophy since 1990. They are, in their different ways, mavericks who recall a different era, an antidote to the suggestion that, at this level of football, there are no real surprises any more. Bounedjah, with his upright stance and pencil moustache, has an air of the 1930s film star about him and risked being the story when, on Thursday night, he missed a penalty that would have put Algeria two goals up in their quarter-final with Ivory Coast. An equaliser followed; he was substituted and watched the rest of the match in tears, which abated only when those who remained on the field scraped a shootout win. \u201cIf we lost, I would be responsible,\u201d he said in a post-match interview during which he apologised three times; by most measures, though, he has some credit left in the bank. Last year Bounedjah scored 59 times for his club, the Qatari side Al-Sadd, putting him top of the global charts. He broke the league\u2019s goalscoring record with 39 from 22 games in 2018-19, six hat-tricks helping him along; some divergence from days when, aged 20, he was still playing in Algeria\u2019s amateur divisions for RCG. His record has earned him the centre-forward spot in Djamel Belmadi\u2019s side and he has proved to be a bad boy in his own way; one of those strikers you cannot take your eyes off; a snarling, niggly Diego Costa analogue who still courts attention when the ball is 80 yards away. \u201cIf I were a defender I would not want to play against him; he plays both the old and the modern way,\u201d was the verdict last week of El Hadji Diouf, who knows a few things about the dark arts. An over-reliance on them sometimes caused problems earlier in his career; these days a slightly toned-down act makes him the perfect leading man for a team that, while comfortably the most rounded unit left in this competition, can niggle and stall a game to a level almost beyond compare. It is remarkable to see Bounedjah thriving alongside Belaili, who was recalled by Belmadi last November for his first cap in three and a half years and was unsure of a spot in the final Cup of Nations squad until a relatively late stage. Some close observers of the Algeria team believe Belaili is the most talented player the country has produced in decades, better even than Mahrez; a lavish, spontaneous inside-forward capable of creating magic from nothing. He has certainly forged a fine partnership with his old academy friend, the pair playing a one-two from which Belaili opened the scoring in the round-of-16 win against Guinea. They have roomed together this summer and there is a genuine sense that a degree of telepathy was honed on those pitches in Oran. \u201cWe know expectations are high and we will do our best not to go back [home] empty-handed,\u201d said Belaili, who these days plays his club football for the Tunisian side Esp\u00e9rance. The smart money is on Algeria facing Senegal in Friday\u2019s final and Belaili has already outdone them once, cracking in a brilliant winner when they met in the group stage. A more accurate contribution from Bounedjah, whether or not from the penalty spot, would enhance their chances and add to his sole strike of the tournament so far, against Kenya. Both men are 27 and the time for a career-changing move to one of Europe\u2019s big leagues has realistically passed. There will be no Premier League title like those won by Mahrez, and no distinguished La Liga stint as experienced by Feghouli with Valencia. The chances are growing, though, that these two rough diamonds will make up for lost time by taking their more feted colleagues to uncharted heights.",

I proffer them up, willingly and gratefully, to each needle and nasal spray, unwavering in my belief in the scientific consensus that they are safe, effective and essential public health tools.</p> <p>The vast majority of parents in the UK do the same, vaccinating their children in accordance with the NHS\u2019s schedule, which recommends routine immunisations at each stage of a child\u2019s development. So it is tempting to ignore the deniers and doubters, to write them off as extremists peddling conspiracies and disproved theories. Except this strategy appears to be failing \u2013 with potentially catastrophic consequences.</p> <p>Virulent opposition to vaccines is as old as vaccines themselves. In the 18th century, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/24/endless-hunt-for-the-perfect-influenza-vaccine-flu-jab\" title=\"\">Edward Jenner\u2019s smallpox vaccine</a> attracted wrath from religious groups, which fired up frightened parents. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/18/how-disgraced-anti-vaxxer-andrew-wakefield-was-embraced-by-trumps-america\" title=\"\">Andrew Wakefield\u2019s discredited 1998 paper</a>, spuriously linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism, provoked widespread, global panic, then in 2016, his film <a href=\"https://vaxxedthemovie.com/\" title=\"\">Vaxxed: </a><a href=\"https://vaxxedthemovie.com/\" title=\"\">From </a><a href=\"https://vaxxedthemovie.com/\" title=\"\">Cover-up to </a><a href=\"https://vaxxedthemovie.com/\" title=\"\">Catastrophe</a> raked it up again. \u201cAnti-vaxxers\u201d are now back on the scene, amplified by the wild west of social media.</p> <p>Yet it isn\u2019t this group that is causing most concern. Among the top <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/ten-threats-to-global-health-in-2019\" title=\"\">10 threats to global health outlined this year by the </a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/ten-threats-to-global-health-in-2019\" title=\"\">World Health Organi</a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/ten-threats-to-global-health-in-2019\" title=\"\">zation</a> (WHO) is \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d. This group \u2013 the undecided and the questioning \u2013 is far harder to pinpoint. They are not shrill on social media. In fact, many keep their concerns private, for fear of censure. But they have researchers and medical professionals very worried indeed.</p> <p>Last month, the biggest global study conducted into attitudes about immunisation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/19/survey-shows-crisis-of-confidence-in-vaccines-in-parts-of-europe\" title=\"\">identified a crisis of confidence</a> across Europe; <a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/reports/wellcome-global-monitor/2018/chapter-5-attitudes-vaccines\" title=\"\">the Wellcome Global Monitor survey</a>, looking at 2018 data, found that, in France, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/19/french-scepticism-over-vaccines-reflects-distrust-of-government\" title=\"\">one in three people</a> believe that vaccines are not safe. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-48668841\">In Ukraine</a>, just half of those surveyed trusted in their efficacy. Both countries have experienced recent measles outbreaks.</p> <p>In the UK, meanwhile, the proportion of children receiving both doses of the MMR jab by their fifth birthday has <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/mmr-vaccination-rates-london-uk-comparison-vaccine/\" title=\"\">fallen </a><a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/mmr-vaccination-rates-london-uk-comparison-vaccine/\" title=\"\">for four years in a row to 87.2%</a>, significantly below the 95% that the WHO says is necessary for population-wide protection. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/measles-outbreaks-across-england\" title=\"\">Last June, Public Health England (PHE) reported an almost </a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/measles-outbreaks-across-england\" title=\"\">fourfold rise in measles cases</a> compared with the previous year.</p> <p>What has provoked people to question a public health intervention described by <a href=\"https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2014/05/01/why-vaccinate/\" title=\"\">PHE as second only to clean water</a> in saving lives? Can listening to the growing number of \u201chestitant\u201d parents shed light on how to counter the trend?</p> <p>***</p> <p>\u201cI understand that there may be an increase in measles in the world. But weigh that up against somebody who\u2019s telling you their child was deeply affected by vaccinations,\u201d says Haru, a Londoner who works in the music industry. His one-year-old daughter would typically have had vaccinations at eight weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks and around her first birthday. These would have guarded against a list of diseases longer than her little arm: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), polio, haemophilus influenzae type B, hepatitis B, meningococcal group B, rotavirus gastroenteritis, 13 pneumococcal infections, meningitis, measles, mumps and rubella.</p> <p>However, Haru and his partner have decided against giving their daughter any vaccinations so far. \u201cI\u2019m getting a lot of pressure from my parents and it\u2019s quite difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut one thing that really clinched it for me was a friend\u2019s brother who said: \u2018My child went through all the vaccinations and has never been the same since \u2013 just far less alert.\u2019 You only need one first-hand experience like that and you\u2019re going to disregard everything else you\u2019ve heard. Because it\u2019s someone who has nothing to gain either way.\u201d</p> <p>Haru is far from alone in being swayed by anecdotes from his peer group. In 2017, the WHO published <a href=\"http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/315761/Best-practice-guidance-respond-vocal-vaccine-deniers-public.pdf\" title=\"\">a guide aimed at public health spokespeople</a> facing the daunting prospect of engaging \u201cvocal vaccine deniers\u201d in debate. \u201cThe more narratives about vaccine side-effects people read, the higher is their perception of the risk of side-effects, even if they know the statistical base rate,\u201d it says.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the success of immunisation programmes means that most parents in the developed world now hear few first-hand stories about the horrors of the diseases they protect against, leaving vaccination in a catch-22. \u201cI\u2019m sure if people started dying in big numbers, I\u2019d be a lot more concerned,\u201d admits Haru. \u201cI\u2019m far more worried about pollution.\u201d</p> <p>When he voiced his doubts to peers and family members, he says he was made to feel like an extremist. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019m worried about is my child being ostracised by other parents.\u201d But, tellingly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/05/anti-vaxx-propaganda-internet-tech\" title=\"\">he found endless material online to feed his fears</a>: videos of people claiming to be doctors and nurses who weren\u2019t vaccinating their children. On social media, of course, the loudest voices do not belong to public health bodies, or to the majority of parents who vaccinate quietly and contentedly. A 2010 study, published in the peer-reviewed academic <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20348365\" title=\"\">Journal of Health Psychology</a>, suggested that people need only view anti-vaccination websites for five to 10 minutes in order for their perception of the risks to be heightened, and their perception of the risks attached to avoiding vaccination to diminish.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u2019ll think I\u2019m mad, but I did convince myself, after my eldest had the MMR, that I saw changes in behaviour</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dr Stuart Blume, an anthropology professor at the University of Amsterdam and the author of <a href=\"http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/display.asp?ISB=9781780238371&amp;nat=false&amp;stem=true&amp;sf1=keyword&amp;st1=immunization&amp;m=1&amp;dc=1\" title=\"\">Immunization: How Vaccines Became Controversial</a>, argues that it\u2019s too convenient to blame vaccine hesitancy \u201con people\u2019s stupidity and anti-vaccination campaigners. Because it avoids any need on the part of the public health system to ask: are we doing something wrong? It avoids the need for any self-reflection.\u201d</p> <p>There was a time, Blume says, when people trusted what they were told and doctors could simply direct people to take vaccines. \u201cSince then, a whole lot of things have happened to undermine people\u2019s trust; some of these are in the vaccination system and some are broader and deeper.\u201d</p> <p>He points to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/27/vaccines-mmr-fears-anti-vaxxers\" title=\"\">the concurrent rise in populist politics</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the same discontents that lie behind Trump, Salvini and even Brexit. It\u2019s systemic dissatisfaction, loss of faith and trust.\u201d Vaccines, manufactured by big pharma and regulated by governments, are a prime target for those who mistrust people in power.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Annabel has two children, aged eight and four. Their artwork hangs on the walls of her sitting room, along with a certificate the eldest was recently awarded at school. He has had some of the routine vaccinations. His sister, however, has had fewer \u2013 and not the MMR.</p> <p>Annabel is highly educated and works in public health. She explains that, \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of me that wants to trust the public health authority and to play a role in the public health agenda by supporting the vaccination agenda.\u201d Yet, she adds, \u201cMMR didn\u2019t feel 100% right.\u201d</p> <p>Here were her concerns: in the 50s, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1383764/\" title=\"\">a licen</a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1383764/\" title=\"\">sed polio vaccine</a> proved to be defective and resulted in the deaths of several children in the US. \u201cEven though the methodology for making them has totally changed, that historical event, combined with knowing quite a bit about the harmful side-effects of a lot of medicines, have all fed in to my reluctance,\u201d she says. \u201cCombine all that with a fairly heavy distrust of the data, the MMR scare [in the late 90s] and the relatively low immediate disease-exposure risk and you have a very reluctant person.\u201d</p> <p>Annabel remembers the panic that spread in the aftermath of Wakefield\u2019s report in 1998. \u201cI was at an age when it really affected me,\u201d she said and, despite numerous subsequent studies robustly discrediting any link between the vaccination and autism, her suspicion remained. \u201cYou\u2019ll think I\u2019m mad, but I did convince myself, after my eldest had the MMR, that I saw changes in behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>He is now a healthy and lovely boy \u2013 precociously funny, clever and sporty. Yet, when it came to her second child, first-hand experiences with health professionals tipped the balance. \u201cA very austere nurse completely dismissed my concerns, refused to have any dialogue and frowned.\u201d Then a private paediatrician \u201cdidn\u2019t have the time or inclination for a discussion about risks, and spoke to me as though I was silly to consider any other option\u201d.</p> <p>She stalled for a while, then \u201ctried to get her MMR done, but the nurse couldn\u2019t say whether the dose would be appropriate because my child was, by this stage, older than the recommended age. I had no idea what to do.\u201d In the end, her daughter remained unvaccinated.</p> <p>***</p> <p>\u201cDoctors and health practitioners aren\u2019t having an easy time of this, either,\u201d says Dr Heidi Larson at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \u201cPopulation and economic pressures mean they have less time and more people. I\u2019ve had some mothers say to me: \u2018I feel like we\u2019re just a number.\u2019 I think we need to work on that, to build dialogues and conversations.\u201d</p> <p>Larson and I meet in her office where, for the past 10 years, she has been running the <a href=\"https://www.vaccineconfidence.org/\" title=\"\">Vaccine Confidence Project</a>. Here, she and her team have developed an index measuring people\u2019s attitudes towards vaccines\u2019 importance, safety, effectiveness and compatibility with religious beliefs, painting a picture of how opinions have shifted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ef5198d0f96fabd20e33e2a0fd818632fa0c99c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ef5198d0f96fabd20e33e2a0fd818632fa0c99c/0_1152_3744_2894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Head shot of Dr Heidi Larson from London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine London.

I\u2019ve had mothers say they feel they\u2019re just a number.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Lewis Dowse/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Across the world, Larson explains, the spectrum between those who say they \u201cstrongly agree\u201d with vaccines and those who \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d is vast, including \u201c70% to 80% who are questioning more and more\u201d.</p> <p>The breadth of this spectrum varies tremendously by country and region. The recent Wellcome report, which used Larson\u2019s index, made it clear that Europe is the world\u2019s most vaccine-sceptical region, with France its most sceptical country. The reasons differ on a local level. Sometimes, Larson explains, it stems from distrust in the system. Sometimes it has roots in a suspicion that one\u2019s liberty or dignity is not being respected. Sometimes it is about religious beliefs; nearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/13/new-york-vaccines-measles-religion\" title=\"\">three-quarters of New York\u2019s recent measles cases</a> have occurred among orthodox Jewish communities, for example.</p> <p>\u201cThen there\u2019s the group that didn\u2019t start as an anti-vaccine group, but is now part of that portfolio, intent on raising their children in the most natural, organic manner,\u201d says Larson, linking reluctance to vaccinate to segments of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/30/attachment-parenting-best-way-raise-child-or-maternal-masochism\" title=\"\">the \u201cnatural parenting\u201d </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/30/attachment-parenting-best-way-raise-child-or-maternal-masochism\" title=\"\">community</a>.

The NHS strongly advocates against it, describing them as significantly less safe. Jo, however, wonders whether it might lessen the impact on her son\u2019s immune system.</p> <p>Yet, even though Jo has a first-class maths degree, doing that research has proved difficult. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of hyperbole about the dangers, without any reference to supporting evidence. But then, on the pro-vaccination side, or the NHS websites, there was no real mention at all of any potential long-term risks. They mention the short-time side-effects: your baby might have an immediate fever. But I just don\u2019t believe there can\u2019t be any chance of long-term side-effects at all.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vaccine-safety\" title=\"\">Vaccine Knowledge Project</a>\u2019s website is designed to counter this mistrust of the data. Run by the University of Oxford and approved by the World Health Organization\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.vaccinesafetynet.org/\" title=\"\">Vaccine Safety Net</a> as an independent, authoritative and reliable source of information, it answers frequently asked questions from parents and doctors, and provides detailed lists of the ingredients in vaccines and their potential side-effects. \u201cNothing in life, including vaccination, can be completely risk-free,\u201d it says, \u201cbut, so far, all the evidence tells us that vaccinating is safer than not vaccinating.\u201d There is no evidence that immunisation weakens the immune system or triggers allergies, it adds.</p> <p>In the case of the MMR: \u201cThere are now a large number of studies that show no evidence at all of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\u201d It lists the side-effects, including that up to one in 10 people will get a raised temperature, loss of appetite and a measles-like rash for two to three days. Temporary joint inflammation is rare in children, but more common in adult women, while about one in 50 children will experience mumps-like symptoms.</p> <p>One in 1,000 people at each dose may experience fits, while one in every 24,000 doses will prompt \u201ca skin rash of small, bruise-like spots\u201d. As with any vaccine, medicine or food, the website points out, there is a very small chance of anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction): \u201cIn the UK between 1997 and 2003, there were a total of 130 reports of anaphylaxis following all immunisations. Around 117m doses of vaccines were given in the UK during this period. This means that the overall rate of anaphylaxis is around one in 900,000.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Manish Sadarangani, director of the Vaccine Evaluation Center at the University of British Columbia in Canada, tells me that there \u201care no long-term side-effects consistently linked with any of the routinely used vaccines.\u201d (His organisation\u2019s website is careful to point out that it is \u201cseparate from government and vaccine manufacturers and provides independent, expert vaccine evaluations\u201d.)</p> <p>Indeed, the long-term risks attached to the vaccines used today are, he says, \u201cas close to zero as you can say anything is\u201d because of the rigour of the trials and monitoring systems to which they are subjected. By the time vaccines have made it through lab trials, animal testing and three phases of increasingly large trials in order to be licensed for public use, \u201cthey\u2019ve been given to thousands, if not tens of thousands of people\u201d, usually in several countries.</p> <p>All the trial data \u2013 good and bad \u2013 has to be submitted to regulators, such as the Food and Drug Administration in the US, and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency or the European Medicines Agency. It is these, Sadarangani explains, that decide whether the drug will be licensed to use, not the big pharma companies that so many vaccine-hesitant parents distrust.</p> <p>And in the case of routine childhood vaccinations in the UK, there is another gatekeeper: the Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisation, which re-examines the data on the safety and efficacy of each vaccine when it is introduced to the schedule, not only in isolation but when put in the context of other inoculations. Even once children begin to use them, \u201cthere is what\u2019s called phase-four surveillance. Any adverse events that happen after a vaccine has been licensed are still reportable\u2026 That information is collected and collated,\u201d explains Sadarangani.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/24/wish-my-daughter-vaccinated\">Why I wish my daughter had been vaccinated | Sophie Heawood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I find myself breathing a sigh of relief.

      "bodyText": "My son had his first vaccination within hours of entering the world. In the London borough where he was born eight years ago, tuberculosis rates ran high. When a nurse appeared at my hospital bed bearing the BCG vaccine, I offered my red and roaring baby without a moment\u2019s hesitation. Since then, he and his sister have had every inoculation going. I proffer them up, willingly and gratefully, to each needle and nasal spray, unwavering in my belief in the scientific consensus that they are safe, effective and essential public health tools. The vast majority of parents in the UK do the same, vaccinating their children in accordance with the NHS\u2019s schedule, which recommends routine immunisations at each stage of a child\u2019s development. So it is tempting to ignore the deniers and doubters, to write them off as extremists peddling conspiracies and disproved theories. Except this strategy appears to be failing \u2013 with potentially catastrophic consequences. Virulent opposition to vaccines is as old as vaccines themselves. In the 18th century, Edward Jenner\u2019s smallpox vaccine attracted wrath from religious groups, which fired up frightened parents. Andrew Wakefield\u2019s discredited 1998 paper, spuriously linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism, provoked widespread, global panic, then in 2016, his film Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe raked it up again. \u201cAnti-vaxxers\u201d are now back on the scene, amplified by the wild west of social media. Yet it isn\u2019t this group that is causing most concern. Among the top 10 threats to global health outlined this year by the World Health Organization (WHO) is \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d. This group \u2013 the undecided and the questioning \u2013 is far harder to pinpoint. They are not shrill on social media. In fact, many keep their concerns private, for fear of censure. But they have researchers and medical professionals very worried indeed. Last month, the biggest global study conducted into attitudes about immunisation identified a crisis of confidence across Europe; the Wellcome Global Monitor survey, looking at 2018 data, found that, in France, one in three people believe that vaccines are not safe. In Ukraine, just half of those surveyed trusted in their efficacy. Both countries have experienced recent measles outbreaks. In the UK, meanwhile, the proportion of children receiving both doses of the MMR jab by their fifth birthday has fallen for four years in a row to 87.2%, significantly below the 95% that the WHO says is necessary for population-wide protection. Last June, Public Health England (PHE) reported an almost fourfold rise in measles cases compared with the previous year. What has provoked people to question a public health intervention described by PHE as second only to clean water in saving lives? Can listening to the growing number of \u201chestitant\u201d parents shed light on how to counter the trend? *** \u201cI understand that there may be an increase in measles in the world. But weigh that up against somebody who\u2019s telling you their child was deeply affected by vaccinations,\u201d says Haru, a Londoner who works in the music industry. His one-year-old daughter would typically have had vaccinations at eight weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks and around her first birthday. These would have guarded against a list of diseases longer than her little arm: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), polio, haemophilus influenzae type B, hepatitis B, meningococcal group B, rotavirus gastroenteritis, 13 pneumococcal infections, meningitis, measles, mumps and rubella. However, Haru and his partner have decided against giving their daughter any vaccinations so far. \u201cI\u2019m getting a lot of pressure from my parents and it\u2019s quite difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut one thing that really clinched it for me was a friend\u2019s brother who said: \u2018My child went through all the vaccinations and has never been the same since \u2013 just far less alert.\u2019 You only need one first-hand experience like that and you\u2019re going to disregard everything else you\u2019ve heard. Because it\u2019s someone who has nothing to gain either way.\u201d Haru is far from alone in being swayed by anecdotes from his peer group. In 2017, the WHO published a guide aimed at public health spokespeople facing the daunting prospect of engaging \u201cvocal vaccine deniers\u201d in debate. \u201cThe more narratives about vaccine side-effects people read, the higher is their perception of the risk of side-effects, even if they know the statistical base rate,\u201d it says. Meanwhile, the success of immunisation programmes means that most parents in the developed world now hear few first-hand stories about the horrors of the diseases they protect against, leaving vaccination in a catch-22. \u201cI\u2019m sure if people started dying in big numbers, I\u2019d be a lot more concerned,\u201d admits Haru. \u201cI\u2019m far more worried about pollution.\u201d When he voiced his doubts to peers and family members, he says he was made to feel like an extremist. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019m worried about is my child being ostracised by other parents.\u201d But, tellingly, he found endless material online to feed his fears: videos of people claiming to be doctors and nurses who weren\u2019t vaccinating their children. On social media, of course, the loudest voices do not belong to public health bodies, or to the majority of parents who vaccinate quietly and contentedly. A 2010 study, published in the peer-reviewed academic Journal of Health Psychology, suggested that people need only view anti-vaccination websites for five to 10 minutes in order for their perception of the risks to be heightened, and their perception of the risks attached to avoiding vaccination to diminish. Dr Stuart Blume, an anthropology professor at the University of Amsterdam and the author of Immunization: How Vaccines Became Controversial, argues that it\u2019s too convenient to blame vaccine hesitancy \u201con people\u2019s stupidity and anti-vaccination campaigners. Because it avoids any need on the part of the public health system to ask: are we doing something wrong? It avoids the need for any self-reflection.\u201d There was a time, Blume says, when people trusted what they were told and doctors could simply direct people to take vaccines. \u201cSince then, a whole lot of things have happened to undermine people\u2019s trust; some of these are in the vaccination system and some are broader and deeper.\u201d He points to the concurrent rise in populist politics. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the same discontents that lie behind Trump, Salvini and even Brexit. It\u2019s systemic dissatisfaction, loss of faith and trust.\u201d Vaccines, manufactured by big pharma and regulated by governments, are a prime target for those who mistrust people in power. *** Annabel has two children, aged eight and four. Their artwork hangs on the walls of her sitting room, along with a certificate the eldest was recently awarded at school. He has had some of the routine vaccinations. His sister, however, has had fewer \u2013 and not the MMR. Annabel is highly educated and works in public health. She explains that, \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of me that wants to trust the public health authority and to play a role in the public health agenda by supporting the vaccination agenda.\u201d Yet, she adds, \u201cMMR didn\u2019t feel 100% right.\u201d Here were her concerns: in the 50s, a licensed polio vaccine proved to be defective and resulted in the deaths of several children in the US. \u201cEven though the methodology for making them has totally changed, that historical event, combined with knowing quite a bit about the harmful side-effects of a lot of medicines, have all fed in to my reluctance,\u201d she says. \u201cCombine all that with a fairly heavy distrust of the data, the MMR scare [in the late 90s] and the relatively low immediate disease-exposure risk and you have a very reluctant person.\u201d Annabel remembers the panic that spread in the aftermath of Wakefield\u2019s report in 1998. \u201cI was at an age when it really affected me,\u201d she said and, despite numerous subsequent studies robustly discrediting any link between the vaccination and autism, her suspicion remained. \u201cYou\u2019ll think I\u2019m mad, but I did convince myself, after my eldest had the MMR, that I saw changes in behaviour.\u201d He is now a healthy and lovely boy \u2013 precociously funny, clever and sporty. Yet, when it came to her second child, first-hand experiences with health professionals tipped the balance. \u201cA very austere nurse completely dismissed my concerns, refused to have any dialogue and frowned.\u201d Then a private paediatrician \u201cdidn\u2019t have the time or inclination for a discussion about risks, and spoke to me as though I was silly to consider any other option\u201d. She stalled for a while, then \u201ctried to get her MMR done, but the nurse couldn\u2019t say whether the dose would be appropriate because my child was, by this stage, older than the recommended age. I had no idea what to do.\u201d In the end, her daughter remained unvaccinated. *** \u201cDoctors and health practitioners aren\u2019t having an easy time of this, either,\u201d says Dr Heidi Larson at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \u201cPopulation and economic pressures mean they have less time and more people. I\u2019ve had some mothers say to me: \u2018I feel like we\u2019re just a number.\u2019 I think we need to work on that, to build dialogues and conversations.\u201d Larson and I meet in her office where, for the past 10 years, she has been running the Vaccine Confidence Project. Here, she and her team have developed an index measuring people\u2019s attitudes towards vaccines\u2019 importance, safety, effectiveness and compatibility with religious beliefs, painting a picture of how opinions have shifted. Across the world, Larson explains, the spectrum between those who say they \u201cstrongly agree\u201d with vaccines and those who \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d is vast, including \u201c70% to 80% who are questioning more and more\u201d. The breadth of this spectrum varies tremendously by country and region. The recent Wellcome report, which used Larson\u2019s index, made it clear that Europe is the world\u2019s most vaccine-sceptical region, with France its most sceptical country. The reasons differ on a local level. Sometimes, Larson explains, it stems from distrust in the system. Sometimes it has roots in a suspicion that one\u2019s liberty or dignity is not being respected. Sometimes it is about religious beliefs; nearly three-quarters of New York\u2019s recent measles cases have occurred among orthodox Jewish communities, for example. \u201cThen there\u2019s the group that didn\u2019t start as an anti-vaccine group, but is now part of that portfolio, intent on raising their children in the most natural, organic manner,\u201d says Larson, linking reluctance to vaccinate to segments of the \u201cnatural parenting\u201d community. This movement encourages parents to question some forms of medical intervention even from pregnancy, with an emphasis on drug-free births. Larson stresses that the vast majority of these people go on to vaccinate, \u201cbut there are some who start with very genuine and responsible questions about safety. Then, when they\u2019re not getting answers, or they feel like they\u2019re being dismissed, they move to feeling alienated, that something\u2019s being hidden, and are much more open to some of the negative views.\u201d Addressing so many disparate concerns sounds daunting. But, says Larson, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable that in this environment we should make time to try to help parents and carers navigate this pretty confusing space.\u201d Parents often come into the GP surgery with questions about things they have seen online, she says: \u201cQuestions that are hard to anticipate and fall outside the scope of standard training.\u201d In January, a Royal Society for Public Health survey found that three-quarters of parents valued the advice of health visitors and midwives regarding vaccinations. Yet, it noted: \u201cA report by PHE indicated that, over time, significantly fewer parents have reported that health visitors are discussing immunisations with them.\u201d The following month, a review published in the Journal of Advanced Nursing examined practice nurses\u2019 influence on the uptake of the MMR. It found that training and annual updates were essential to keep them \u201cabreast of the evidence base underpinning national immunisation programmes\u201d, and pointed out that, historically, nurses had found it challenging to keep up to date. That may, however, be changing. PHE and the Royal College of Nursing publish training standards and a curriculum for all health practitioners involved in immunisation programmes in the UK. The latest version, updated in February 2018, acknowledges that doctors and nurses are crucial to parents\u2019 decisions: \u201cA parental attitudinal-tracking survey conducted in England in 2016 found that 71% of parents had a discussion with a healthcare professional before their child was due to be immunised. For those who were undecided... 60% said that they felt more confident about immunising their child following their discussion.\u201d The alternative, of course, is to make vaccinations mandatory. In May, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, told the BBC\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to reach the point of compulsory vaccination, but I will rule nothing out.\u201d He added: \u201cFailure to vaccinate when there isn\u2019t a good reason is wrong. Those people who campaign against vaccination are campaigning against science.\u201d Last month, the British Medical Journal published a blog post arguing that the UK should consider \u201crefusing to allow children to go to nursery or school unless and until all their vaccinations are up to date\u201d. It may seem a neat answer to those without doubts or, more compellingly, for parents of children whose compromised immunity means they cannot be vaccinated and thus rely on the so-called \u201cherd immunity\u201d provided when a critical mass of others are immunised. But, as Jo, the mother of a seven-month-old, tells me: \u201cTo those predisposed to conspiracy theories, mandating vaccines doesn\u2019t smell good.\u201d As we talk, Jo bounces her baby on her lap. She has a specific concern with vaccinations: \u201cI had really, really bad eczema all through my childhood.

The NHS strongly advocates against it, describing them as significantly less safe. Jo, however, wonders whether it might lessen the impact on her son\u2019s immune system. Yet, even though Jo has a first-class maths degree, doing that research has proved difficult. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of hyperbole about the dangers, without any reference to supporting evidence. But then, on the pro-vaccination side, or the NHS websites, there was no real mention at all of any potential long-term risks. They mention the short-time side-effects: your baby might have an immediate fever. But I just don\u2019t believe there can\u2019t be any chance of long-term side-effects at all.\u201d *** The Vaccine Knowledge Project\u2019s website is designed to counter this mistrust of the data. Run by the University of Oxford and approved by the World Health Organization\u2019s Vaccine Safety Net as an independent, authoritative and reliable source of information, it answers frequently asked questions from parents and doctors, and provides detailed lists of the ingredients in vaccines and their potential side-effects. \u201cNothing in life, including vaccination, can be completely risk-free,\u201d it says, \u201cbut, so far, all the evidence tells us that vaccinating is safer than not vaccinating.\u201d There is no evidence that immunisation weakens the immune system or triggers allergies, it adds. In the case of the MMR: \u201cThere are now a large number of studies that show no evidence at all of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\u201d It lists the side-effects, including that up to one in 10 people will get a raised temperature, loss of appetite and a measles-like rash for two to three days. Temporary joint inflammation is rare in children, but more common in adult women, while about one in 50 children will experience mumps-like symptoms. One in 1,000 people at each dose may experience fits, while one in every 24,000 doses will prompt \u201ca skin rash of small, bruise-like spots\u201d. As with any vaccine, medicine or food, the website points out, there is a very small chance of anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction): \u201cIn the UK between 1997 and 2003, there were a total of 130 reports of anaphylaxis following all immunisations. Around 117m doses of vaccines were given in the UK during this period. This means that the overall rate of anaphylaxis is around one in 900,000.\u201d Dr Manish Sadarangani, director of the Vaccine Evaluation Center at the University of British Columbia in Canada, tells me that there \u201care no long-term side-effects consistently linked with any of the routinely used vaccines.\u201d (His organisation\u2019s website is careful to point out that it is \u201cseparate from government and vaccine manufacturers and provides independent, expert vaccine evaluations\u201d.) Indeed, the long-term risks attached to the vaccines used today are, he says, \u201cas close to zero as you can say anything is\u201d because of the rigour of the trials and monitoring systems to which they are subjected. By the time vaccines have made it through lab trials, animal testing and three phases of increasingly large trials in order to be licensed for public use, \u201cthey\u2019ve been given to thousands, if not tens of thousands of people\u201d, usually in several countries. All the trial data \u2013 good and bad \u2013 has to be submitted to regulators, such as the Food and Drug Administration in the US, and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency or the European Medicines Agency. It is these, Sadarangani explains, that decide whether the drug will be licensed to use, not the big pharma companies that so many vaccine-hesitant parents distrust. And in the case of routine childhood vaccinations in the UK, there is another gatekeeper: the Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisation, which re-examines the data on the safety and efficacy of each vaccine when it is introduced to the schedule, not only in isolation but when put in the context of other inoculations. Even once children begin to use them, \u201cthere is what\u2019s called phase-four surveillance. Any adverse events that happen after a vaccine has been licensed are still reportable\u2026 That information is collected and collated,\u201d explains Sadarangani. I find myself breathing a sigh of relief. Worry is contagious, especially when it comes to children. Although I have not had my rational position on the issue shaken, after a week talking to vaccine-hesitant parents, I have found my nerves jangled nonetheless. How could the wealth of information be better communicated? \u201cHesitancy is a spectrum,\u201d Sadarangani says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of focus on the very small number of people, the hardcore anti-vaccine people who are never going to change their mind, no matter what. But I would say most of the rest just have questions that are reasonable and want answers. Those are the people that we need to try to speak to.\u201d Shortly after my conversation with Sadarangani, an email arrives. It is from Annabel. She has just read \u201ca story about the regret and devastation of parents who did not vaccinate and whose kids then got sick. Made me intent on getting them done. The GP surgery are calling me back today.\u201d A few hours later, she writes again: \u201cThis time, the nurse told me there were guidelines for children who need to catch up. She didn\u2019t give me a hard time, was very kind and made it easy. We\u2019re going in on Monday.\u201d \u2022 Some names have been changed.

When asked how different Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s career would have been had she been darker-skinned, Knowles was unequivocal: \u201cI think it would\u2019ve affected her success.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, Beyonc\u00e9 descends, via her mother\u2019s line, from Louisiana\u2019s \u201cCreoles of color\u201d or \u201cgens de couleur libres\u201d, a distinct ethnic group in 17th- and 18th-century America, who developed from unions between Europeans and Africans and held privileged positions in society, relative to enslaved Africans. Beyonc\u00e9 celebrated this heritage on her track Formation, and while Creoles of colour lost their favourable social status from the early 19th century onwards, a shade-based caste system, with whiteness at its apex, persists to this day.</p> <p>That historical context seems to have been lost, however, in some contemporary music industry conversations, which reframe the issue as the light-skinned star\u2019s struggle for acceptance. \u201cThere\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/09/dewanda-wise-how-i-conquered-hollywood-colorism-skin-tone\">colourism</a> involved in the black community, which is very apparent,\u201d said R&amp;B-pop singer Tinashe in 2017. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to find a balance where I\u2019m a mixed woman, and sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t fully fit into the black community; they don\u2019t fully accept me, even though I see myself as a black woman.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5b59e0008d34e0275c7546cd03012b419e9377e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b59e0008d34e0275c7546cd03012b419e9377e2/0_0_709_566/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jorja Smith\" width=\"500\" height=\"399\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Pretty privilege has worked all through history\u2019: Jorja Smith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Or there\u2019s a 2018 Beats 1 interview in which mixed-race Jorja Smith expresses the difficulty she has reconciling the notion that she may have benefited from \u201cpretty privilege\u201d in her career with her lived experience of being bullied in a \u201cmajority white\u201d school. \u201cThere was some \u2018Jorja Smith v Colourism\u2019 debate, and I understand, I get it, I\u2019m a conversation-starter. It\u2019s fine \u2026 Like I say, people are always going to say something \u2026 [At school] y\u2019know, my friends were blond and skinny and had long hair, I had these huge extensions because I just didn\u2019t think I fitted in. People picked on me about it all the time. But, y\u2019know, pretty privilege has worked all through history.\u201d</p> <p>So you\u2019d be forgiven for assuming that Identity Crisis, the new colourism-confronting pop single by light-skinned Dominican-Brazilian Jarina De Marco, would be more of the same. In fact, the song takes a step back to offer some structural analysis of the issue. With lyrics such as \u201cMarry fair / Stay out of the sun / Bleach your skin / Isn\u2019t this fun?\u201d, De Marco satirises how white supremacist beauty standards are passed down by the cosmetics industry and within our own families.</p> <p>\u201cLook at someone like Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d says Lao Ra, a Colombia-born, UK-based pop singer, who appears in Identity Crisis\u2019s accompanying short film, Conversations on Colourism. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, she\u2019s a talent like no other, but her physical appearance perhaps played a small role in her initial mainstream appeal.\u201d</p> <p>Like De Marco, Lao Ra also acknowledges her own light-skinned privilege. \u201cPerhaps I have the right amount of \u2018exoticism\u2019. It plays in my favour, I suppose, but in the major scheme of things it sucks that relatability comes from how light or dark you are rather than the music you\u2019re making.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a24ca9f58b57e0014d618cf6316d76cbdae8c3a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a24ca9f58b57e0014d618cf6316d76cbdae8c3a5/0_0_4500_2299/1000.jpg\" alt=\"EXO\" width=\"1000\" height=\"511\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beyond the pale?

And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/09/colorism-racism-why-black-people-discriminate-among-ourselves\">colourism</a> isn\u2019t only a thing within the African diaspora. This kind of intra-community discrimination is big in Korea too, says Aimee Allport, a British-born language tutor and K-pop fan, who lives in east Asia. \u201cThe everyday Korean is very interested in the beauty standards that are set by idols [K-pop stars], such as their weight and, of course, their skin colour.\u201d</p> <p>There are a handful of artists of mixed African-American and Korean heritage who have made Korean-language songs about racism, such as rapper <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DK-MPh7vKk\">Yoon Mi-rae\u2019s Black Happiness</a>, but colourism is much more widely practised and much less openly challenged.

      "bodyText": "It seems every conversation about colourism in pop music must come back to Beyonc\u00e9. So it was when Mathew Knowles, record exec, former Destiny\u2019s Child manager and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s father, appeared on SiriusXM radio to discuss research by Texas Southern University, where he is a visiting professor. Their study found that over a 15-year period it was lighter-skinned black women \u2013 the likes of Alicia Keys, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Mariah Carey and, of course, Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 who dominated Top 40 airplay. When asked how different Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s career would have been had she been darker-skinned, Knowles was unequivocal: \u201cI think it would\u2019ve affected her success.\u201d Indeed, Beyonc\u00e9 descends, via her mother\u2019s line, from Louisiana\u2019s \u201cCreoles of color\u201d or \u201cgens de couleur libres\u201d, a distinct ethnic group in 17th- and 18th-century America, who developed from unions between Europeans and Africans and held privileged positions in society, relative to enslaved Africans. Beyonc\u00e9 celebrated this heritage on her track Formation, and while Creoles of colour lost their favourable social status from the early 19th century onwards, a shade-based caste system, with whiteness at its apex, persists to this day. That historical context seems to have been lost, however, in some contemporary music industry conversations, which reframe the issue as the light-skinned star\u2019s struggle for acceptance. \u201cThere\u2019s colourism involved in the black community, which is very apparent,\u201d said R&amp;B-pop singer Tinashe in 2017. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to find a balance where I\u2019m a mixed woman, and sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t fully fit into the black community; they don\u2019t fully accept me, even though I see myself as a black woman.\u201d Or there\u2019s a 2018 Beats 1 interview in which mixed-race Jorja Smith expresses the difficulty she has reconciling the notion that she may have benefited from \u201cpretty privilege\u201d in her career with her lived experience of being bullied in a \u201cmajority white\u201d school. \u201cThere was some \u2018Jorja Smith v Colourism\u2019 debate, and I understand, I get it, I\u2019m a conversation-starter. It\u2019s fine \u2026 Like I say, people are always going to say something \u2026 [At school] y\u2019know, my friends were blond and skinny and had long hair, I had these huge extensions because I just didn\u2019t think I fitted in. People picked on me about it all the time. But, y\u2019know, pretty privilege has worked all through history.\u201d So you\u2019d be forgiven for assuming that Identity Crisis, the new colourism-confronting pop single by light-skinned Dominican-Brazilian Jarina De Marco, would be more of the same. In fact, the song takes a step back to offer some structural analysis of the issue. With lyrics such as \u201cMarry fair / Stay out of the sun / Bleach your skin / Isn\u2019t this fun?\u201d, De Marco satirises how white supremacist beauty standards are passed down by the cosmetics industry and within our own families. \u201cLook at someone like Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d says Lao Ra, a Colombia-born, UK-based pop singer, who appears in Identity Crisis\u2019s accompanying short film, Conversations on Colourism. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, she\u2019s a talent like no other, but her physical appearance perhaps played a small role in her initial mainstream appeal.\u201d Like De Marco, Lao Ra also acknowledges her own light-skinned privilege. \u201cPerhaps I have the right amount of \u2018exoticism\u2019. It plays in my favour, I suppose, but in the major scheme of things it sucks that relatability comes from how light or dark you are rather than the music you\u2019re making.\u201d This openness remains unusual in the music industry, where commercial considerations seem to make pop stars in particular prone to adopting society\u2019s prejudices. And colourism isn\u2019t only a thing within the African diaspora. This kind of intra-community discrimination is big in Korea too, says Aimee Allport, a British-born language tutor and K-pop fan, who lives in east Asia. \u201cThe everyday Korean is very interested in the beauty standards that are set by idols [K-pop stars], such as their weight and, of course, their skin colour.\u201d There are a handful of artists of mixed African-American and Korean heritage who have made Korean-language songs about racism, such as rapper Yoon Mi-rae\u2019s Black Happiness, but colourism is much more widely practised and much less openly challenged. Witness the numerous YouTube clips of boybands EXO and BTS teasing supposedly darker members or pointedly applying high-factor sun cream. Allport points out that darker-skinned K-pop stars are also often stereotyped as \u201csexy\u201d in comparison to their \u201ccute, doll-like\u201d paler counterparts, citing the example of Hyolyn from Sistar, who is known as \u201cthe Korean Beyonc\u00e9\u201d. One thing common to colourism in all these guises is a disproportionate impact on female artists and fans. The tradition of \u201clighties\u201d, \u201cyellowbones\u201d or \u201clight-skinned tings\u201d being objects of desire and status symbols in the music videos of male artists runs across pop genres \u2013 a situation that can be as demeaning for the fetishised as it is for the ignored. In a December 2006 interview with Essence magazine, Kanye West is quoted as saying: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for race mixing there\u2019d be no video girls.

When you do R&amp;D, there\u2019s this idea that you can cut corners and have the privacy team fix it later.\u201d Allowing free ethical rein for \u201cexperiments\u201d is dangerous, Poulson argues. For one thing, by the time a project is nearing completion, \u201cyou\u2019ve created an entire team whose entire career investment is to launch this thing. And, further, you\u2019ve normalised the behaviour to a bunch of engineers. There\u2019s something fundamental: The first time you see your company doing something, that\u2019s when you\u2019re going to speak out. After that, a switch flips for you, and you accept it.\u201d",

Its 18 modern rooms enjoy sea views (some with balconies) and are decorated in gentle neutral and maritime tones with sea-themed murals. The coastline here has a huge variety of seaweeds, and the hotel offers workshops and foraging coastal walks to collect them and understand how to cook and use them.

      "bodyText": "Deep in the Brazilian Amazon, an environmental activist meets with a journalist who warns that a mining company is responsible for a looming environmental disaster. \u201cPeople are already getting sick,\u201d he warns, before promising to bring her documentary proof the next day. But in the jungle, someone is watching. Driving to their next meeting, the activist hears a phone ringing in the back of her car. She opens the trunk \u2013 and finds the journalist\u2019s dead body. The gruesome discovery is the opening act of the latest blockbuster series from Brazil\u2019s telenovela powerhouse TV Globo: Aruanas. The series focuses on environmental journalists and activists in the country\u2019s vast, forested interior, where 57 environmental defenders were killed in 2017. Brazil\u2019s telenovelas have a history of shaping public opinion on current affairs \u2013 and this series tackles one of the country\u2019s most pressing issues: the high-stakes battle over the world\u2019s largest rainforest at a time when politics is dominated by the interests of agribusiness. The largest caucus in Brazil\u2019s congress \u2013 the ruralista bloc \u2013 represents agribusiness interests, and in January their longtime ally, Jair Bolsonaro, became president. Since then, Bolsonaro has launched an unprecedented attack on environmental protections, eliminating the post of secretary on climate change and stripping the environment ministry of authority. Bolsonaro argues that the environmental protections in the Amazon hinder economic development and has promised that \u201cnot one more centimeter\u201d of land would be allocated to indigenous tribes. Such rhetoric has emboldened loggers, ranchers and big business interests eager to make money in the Amazon. Deforestation rose 88% in June compared to the same time last year, 169 new pesticides have been approved for use this year and the minister of mines and energy said the government was planning to allow mining in indigenous reserves. But the vast majority of Brazil\u2019s people live in cities, and for many of them, the assault on the rainforest is a distant reality, said Marcos Nisti, the co-creator of Aruanas. \u201cWe want this show to make the environment a subject for the average family at the dinner table \u2013 to make it a more everyday topic for Brazilians,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not other people\u2019s problem \u2013 it\u2019s our problem. It\u2019s a problem for all human existence. \u201cWe want to enter people\u2019s hearts \u2026 it\u2019s not the normal way we get information about global warming, but it\u2019s a way to connect with people,\u201d he said. The series follows three female activists who search to find out the truth behind the mining company, which is illegally prospecting for gold on protected land. In one scene, an executive from the fictional company meets with lobbyists and ask them to remove the land\u2019s protected reserve status \u2013 a common political favor granted by ruralistas \u2014 so that he can build a goldmine. \u201cThe only people who like the rainforest are indigenous people and celebrities. The masses like money \u2013 and there will be plenty of money here,\u201d he says, looking out over the mine. One of the activists confronts a politician, who responds: \u201cWe need to generate employment and develop the area.\u201d Such sentiments are often expressed by Bolsonaro and his allies, who bemoan the amount of land allocated to Brazil\u2019s 1 million indigenous people and the activities of international NGOs. \u201cWe consulted many environmental organizations and journalists and tried to make the show close to reality while always considering entertainment,\u201d said co-director Estela Renner. Greenpeace served as consultants and gave lectures about their experience to the cast. Despite its torn-from-the-headlines plot, Aruanas stays true to many of the principles of a telenovela melodrama: one of the activists is having an affair with her colleague\u2019s husband, for example. \u201cBrazilian telenovelas have a long tradition of discussing themes the country lives in its day-to-day and changing the way people think. Fiction has the power to sensitize in a way that doesn\u2019t come from the newspapers, it comes from narratives,\u201d said Maria Immacolata Vassallo de Lopes, the coordinator of the Center for the Studies of Telenovela at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. Globo, Brazil\u2019s largest media company, reaches 100 million people a day (about half Brazil\u2019s population), but is trying to compete with the ever-powerful streaming market. Instead of a 160-episode novela on broadcast television, Aruanas is a modest 10-part series. Its first episode aired on Globo\u2019s main TV channel, but the remaining episodes are only available through their streaming service. TV dramas have long pushed the boundaries in Brazil: under strict censorship during the 1964 to 1985 military dictatorship, telenovelas used metaphors and parallels to rouse public criticism of the regime.

Thank you for the fact that the high street now sells jeans for bigger bums and each ad break on primetime ITV has women with plentiful hips dancing like no one\u2019s watching. Thank you for how my almost-teen niece, asked to describe someone, will never say the F word, daintily pirouetting around the topic with sensitive words, none of which sounds anything like \u201cfat-arsed cow\u201d, which felt like mild affection during a northern 1980s school day.</p> <p>And above all, thank you, Lizzo. \u201cHeard you say, I\u2019m not the baddest, bitch, you lie,\u201d she sang in front of hundreds of thousands of onlookers, on stage, on TV, across the globe on YouTube.

And back then, on the beach, any woman over a size 12, plus of course anyone flat-chested, knobbly-kneed, stretchmarked, dimply or in any other way \u201cdefected\u201d, would walk, nay run, that horrific final 15 metres from sun lounger to the sea at a breakneck pace. Now along comes the body positivity movement, saying \u201clet it all hang out\u201d. Let your boobs nestle under your armpits, Lycra-clad that paunch. Let your pubes grow from your belly button to behind your knees like knotweed if it pleases thee! Slip on a summer frock and step out into sunshine, exactly as you are: you\u2019re good to go! Well, this is a lovely idea, but it\u2019s just too late for me. Thank you, younger sisters, future leaders and Generation Z activists. Thank you for the fact that the high street now sells jeans for bigger bums and each ad break on primetime ITV has women with plentiful hips dancing like no one\u2019s watching. Thank you for how my almost-teen niece, asked to describe someone, will never say the F word, daintily pirouetting around the topic with sensitive words, none of which sounds anything like \u201cfat-arsed cow\u201d, which felt like mild affection during a northern 1980s school day. And above all, thank you, Lizzo. \u201cHeard you say, I\u2019m not the baddest, bitch, you lie,\u201d she sang in front of hundreds of thousands of onlookers, on stage, on TV, across the globe on YouTube. She wore the exact type of sequins I bought as a Christmas frock one year, that hung in my wardrobe for five seasons and was then given to a charity shop because, deep in my heart, I knew it made me look \u201ca bit wide-hipped\u201d. Lizzo wore it, but stripped from the waist down, parping on a jazz flute. Play on, player: I love you, but you\u2019ll need to do this show without me. \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.

      "body": "<p>The land to the north of the village of Foros de Vale Figueira in southern Portugal has been owned and farmed through the centuries by Romans, Moors, Christians, capitalists, far rightists, even the military. It has been part of a private fiefdom, worked by slaves as well as communists.</p> <p>Now this 100-hectare (247-acre) patch of land just looks exhausted \u2013 a great empty grassland without trees, people or animals, wilting under a baking Iberian sun.</p> <p>But look closely and you can just see the future: tips of thousands of tiny oak and nut trees following the contours and poking through thick mulches of grass and leaves.</p> <p>\u201cThis will be the new montado,\u201d says Alfredo Cunhal, referring to a pre-medieval Portuguese system of farming. He is an agricultural scientist whose great-grandfather cleared the cork and olive trees that were once scattered around, and whose family then overworked the land by dosing it with chemicals and growing monocultures of cereals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"331f0f4991f31517a1a62d4cb2014c7d57e727ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/331f0f4991f31517a1a62d4cb2014c7d57e727ca/0_0_4400_2934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alfredo Cunhal, the owner of Herdade Freixo do Meio\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alfredo Cunhal, the owner of Herdade do Freixo do Meio</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ricardo Lopes/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The montado system combines herds of animals with productive trees and shrubs. Cunhal\u2019s vision is to create an oasis-style abundance on land where there is often no rain for nine months of the year and where temperatures can reach 49C (120F).</p> <p>\u201cImagine tall trees, like 40-metre tall walnuts, putting down leaves, letting light through, drawing up water. Below them, cork oaks giving shade, and a line of citrus and olive trees; and then imagine vines climbing the trees. The fruit and nuts will provide the food for the pigs, chickens, cows and other animals who graze there,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cAnimals are the key,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are important for the whole ecosystem, as well as part of the food chain. They must be balanced with the tree system. Pigs provide digestion, and are good for the soil, they disturb the ground and fertilise the land. The natural fertility cycles work better with them. The pig is not a meat machine but a friend of nature.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cnew montado\u201d at Herdade do Freixo do Meio farm will take years to mature but will repay itself many times over with the variety of food produced and healthier soils, he says. \u201cIt offers resilience against fires and global heating and it soaks up the carbon,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"68fb75d91737573e288081626dc4e0b363ef421b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68fb75d91737573e288081626dc4e0b363ef421b/0_0_4400_2934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pigs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The pig is not a meat machine but a friend of nature,\u2019 says Cunhal</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ricardo Lopes/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe are aiming to go from zero to abundance in a few years. We can put chickens on the land soon, pigs and sheep will follow, cows come later. We invest now, and the next generation sees the real benefits,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Cunhal, who comes from a large landowning family related to Portugal\u2019s legendary communist leader \u00c1lvaro Cunhal, says he has had to reject much of what he was taught about farming at college.</p> <p>\u201cI spent five years studying agriculture and I never heard the word ecology. We were taking more and more from the land but we were farming monocultures. We were eating the system. I was managing 7,000 hectares for my family but I never noticed the trees. I really didn\u2019t know anything. I produced a lot but I needed so many inputs. I needed carbon, energy, chemicals. I could do nothing efficiently. The land was eroded, the soil damaged.\u201d</p> <p>Demoralised, he gave up managing the family estate in 1990, took a share of the land, and started to run 600 hectares on organic, co-operative lines with a collective of 35 people, many of whom had worked on the estate for years. Together, these \u201cpartners\u201d are converting the whole farm into a full montado system.</p> <p>The results are beginning to show. Wild boar, lynx and deer roam freely, while old varieties of pig, cattle, chickens and turkeys are rotated among the established oak and olive trees and in newly planted orchards. The farm grows almost every type of Mediterranean food among the trees, as well as 40 varieties of fruit and nut.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c4cf21051402a089d68dd80480697cc96ebac463\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4cf21051402a089d68dd80480697cc96ebac463/0_0_4400_2933/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farmland at Herdade Freixo do Meio\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the montado system a wide variety of animals and plants live in symbiosis with each other</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ricardo Lopes/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe can grow water,\u201d says Cunhal. \u201cBy planting trees whose roots go deep we are drawing moisture up and building soils, creating the possibility to grow even more.\u201d</p> <p>The complexity of the system baffles conventional farmers who mostly specialise in a handful of crops or products. But Cunhal dismisses monocultures as \u201cthe end of life\u201d and insists there is resilience and safety in diversity.</p> <p>The variety of food produced is astonishing. The farm grows dozens of fruit and vegetable crops and makes and sells 600 different products, ranging from eight kinds of oak flours and breads, to meats, wine and olive oils.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2019/jul/02/barter-amazon-rainforest-burgers-steaks-brazil\">We must not barter the Amazon rainforest for burgers and steaks | Jonathan Watts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s far more than any normal farm would ever consider. This used to be a cork oak farm. Now cork is just 5% of the turnover. Four years ago we were 100% dependent on the open market and wholesalers. Now nearly 50% of what we grow is sold directly to consumers. We have a butchery, bakery, olive oil press, smoker,\u201d he says.</p> <p>A montado system also demands a new social approach. \u201cIt\u2019s not right that a system of farming as complex as this should be run by one person. Far better that a whole community should propose how it works. Eventually we want consumers to be part of the farm, too,\u201d says Cunhal, who says he intends to eventually hand the land over to the co-operative.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"244dfd8684e13f58c2dcf21074b723adde600c1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/244dfd8684e13f58c2dcf21074b723adde600c1d/0_146_4400_2641/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Partners working at Herdade do Freixo do Meio\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The whole community at Herdade do Freixo do Meio have a say in how it is run</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ricardo Lopes/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt works because the risks and the benefits are shared. Together we are resilient to shocks. We employ more people. We produce variety. It\u2019s a different approach.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is very exciting. This is the meeting place of trees, crops and animals,\u201d says Ricardo Silva, a trained biologist who switched to forestry before coming to Herdade do Freixo do Meio. \u201cThe results are measured not just in profits, but in the social and ecological benefits created. We cannot say exactly, but our hypothesis is that we can double, even treble production without taking away from the land.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty years ago, an approach like this might have been dismissed as marginal, perhaps as an ecological experiment to be conducted by wealthy landowners. But that idea is changing fast as the needs of the environment are recognised, says Patrick Caron, chair of the UN\u2019s high-level panel of experts on food security and nutrition and a former head of Cirad, the French food research agency.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c51be4e2ef1cc36d24c7e3f2bdab9f4d870c2d25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c51be4e2ef1cc36d24c7e3f2bdab9f4d870c2d25/0_0_4400_2933/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers hang hand-made chorizos in the farm\u2019s traditional smoke room\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers hang hand-made chorizos in the farm\u2019s traditional smoke room</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ricardo Lopes/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe need a transformation of our food systems.

      "bodyText": "The land to the north of the village of Foros de Vale Figueira in southern Portugal has been owned and farmed through the centuries by Romans, Moors, Christians, capitalists, far rightists, even the military. It has been part of a private fiefdom, worked by slaves as well as communists. Now this 100-hectare (247-acre) patch of land just looks exhausted \u2013 a great empty grassland without trees, people or animals, wilting under a baking Iberian sun. But look closely and you can just see the future: tips of thousands of tiny oak and nut trees following the contours and poking through thick mulches of grass and leaves. \u201cThis will be the new montado,\u201d says Alfredo Cunhal, referring to a pre-medieval Portuguese system of farming. He is an agricultural scientist whose great-grandfather cleared the cork and olive trees that were once scattered around, and whose family then overworked the land by dosing it with chemicals and growing monocultures of cereals. The montado system combines herds of animals with productive trees and shrubs. Cunhal\u2019s vision is to create an oasis-style abundance on land where there is often no rain for nine months of the year and where temperatures can reach 49C (120F). \u201cImagine tall trees, like 40-metre tall walnuts, putting down leaves, letting light through, drawing up water. Below them, cork oaks giving shade, and a line of citrus and olive trees; and then imagine vines climbing the trees. The fruit and nuts will provide the food for the pigs, chickens, cows and other animals who graze there,\u201d he says. \u201cAnimals are the key,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are important for the whole ecosystem, as well as part of the food chain. They must be balanced with the tree system. Pigs provide digestion, and are good for the soil, they disturb the ground and fertilise the land. The natural fertility cycles work better with them. The pig is not a meat machine but a friend of nature.\u201d The \u201cnew montado\u201d at Herdade do Freixo do Meio farm will take years to mature but will repay itself many times over with the variety of food produced and healthier soils, he says. \u201cIt offers resilience against fires and global heating and it soaks up the carbon,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are aiming to go from zero to abundance in a few years. We can put chickens on the land soon, pigs and sheep will follow, cows come later. We invest now, and the next generation sees the real benefits,\u201d he says. Cunhal, who comes from a large landowning family related to Portugal\u2019s legendary communist leader \u00c1lvaro Cunhal, says he has had to reject much of what he was taught about farming at college. \u201cI spent five years studying agriculture and I never heard the word ecology. We were taking more and more from the land but we were farming monocultures. We were eating the system. I was managing 7,000 hectares for my family but I never noticed the trees. I really didn\u2019t know anything. I produced a lot but I needed so many inputs. I needed carbon, energy, chemicals. I could do nothing efficiently. The land was eroded, the soil damaged.\u201d Demoralised, he gave up managing the family estate in 1990, took a share of the land, and started to run 600 hectares on organic, co-operative lines with a collective of 35 people, many of whom had worked on the estate for years. Together, these \u201cpartners\u201d are converting the whole farm into a full montado system. The results are beginning to show. Wild boar, lynx and deer roam freely, while old varieties of pig, cattle, chickens and turkeys are rotated among the established oak and olive trees and in newly planted orchards. The farm grows almost every type of Mediterranean food among the trees, as well as 40 varieties of fruit and nut. \u201cWe can grow water,\u201d says Cunhal. \u201cBy planting trees whose roots go deep we are drawing moisture up and building soils, creating the possibility to grow even more.\u201d The complexity of the system baffles conventional farmers who mostly specialise in a handful of crops or products. But Cunhal dismisses monocultures as \u201cthe end of life\u201d and insists there is resilience and safety in diversity. The variety of food produced is astonishing. The farm grows dozens of fruit and vegetable crops and makes and sells 600 different products, ranging from eight kinds of oak flours and breads, to meats, wine and olive oils. \u201cIt\u2019s far more than any normal farm would ever consider. This used to be a cork oak farm. Now cork is just 5% of the turnover. Four years ago we were 100% dependent on the open market and wholesalers. Now nearly 50% of what we grow is sold directly to consumers. We have a butchery, bakery, olive oil press, smoker,\u201d he says. A montado system also demands a new social approach. \u201cIt\u2019s not right that a system of farming as complex as this should be run by one person. Far better that a whole community should propose how it works. Eventually we want consumers to be part of the farm, too,\u201d says Cunhal, who says he intends to eventually hand the land over to the co-operative. \u201cIt works because the risks and the benefits are shared. Together we are resilient to shocks. We employ more people. We produce variety. It\u2019s a different approach.\u201d \u201cIt is very exciting. This is the meeting place of trees, crops and animals,\u201d says Ricardo Silva, a trained biologist who switched to forestry before coming to Herdade do Freixo do Meio. \u201cThe results are measured not just in profits, but in the social and ecological benefits created. We cannot say exactly, but our hypothesis is that we can double, even treble production without taking away from the land.\u201d Twenty years ago, an approach like this might have been dismissed as marginal, perhaps as an ecological experiment to be conducted by wealthy landowners. But that idea is changing fast as the needs of the environment are recognised, says Patrick Caron, chair of the UN\u2019s high-level panel of experts on food security and nutrition and a former head of Cirad, the French food research agency. \u201cWe need a transformation of our food systems. It does not involve a return to the way our grandparents farmed \u2013 that would be a catastrophe. But we must take stock of the principles of what they were doing, and their knowledge. \u201cChange is happening. The big companies know it, too. The meat industry used to laugh, but now they are preparing for change. It is possible to move from mass production to quality.\u201d. \u201cFarmers became fascinated by the baubles of technology in the 1930s. They tried to simplify everything,\u201d says Patrick Worms, senior science policy advisor at the Nairobi-based World Agroforestry Centre. \u201cWhat Cunhal is doing is the opposite \u2013 using more animals, growing more crops, making everything more complex.

      "body": "<p>Miss Bingley greets you in the driveway to the house in upstate New York, surrounded by a tangle of knotted woodland. The Toyota Prius, named after the spiteful Caroline Bingley in Jane Austen\u2019s Pride And Prejudice, is an appropriate place to start \u2013 because without the car there would have been no road trip and without the road trip there would have been no reckoning with a list of hideous men, and without that reckoning Miss Bingley\u2019s owner would not today find herself at the centre of an almighty storm involving the most powerful person on Earth.</p> <p> E Jean Carroll\u2019s cabin in the woods is small \u2013 600 sq ft, she keeps reminding me \u2013 and engulfed in trees, which the New York media fixture and Elle magazine agony aunt has allowed to grow right up to the windowsills. \u201cWelcome to the Mouse House\u201d has been handpainted on the front of the cabin \u2013 a reference to the mice frequently dragged in by Carroll\u2019s cat, which goes by the name of Vagina T Fireballs.</p> <p>Inside, the turquoise walls are hung with fading photographs of Carroll, in her prom dress and with her pet goat, Pan, as well as deer skulls and yards of bookshelves \u2013 her collection includes six volumes of Jane Austen and a library of PG Wodehouse. The chimney stones are painted in blues, greens and yellows, and above the hearth is another handpainted motto: \u201cAlways aroused, never angry \u2013 Thackeray.\u201d</p> <p>Carroll meets me with a generous smile. She is as elegant and tidy as her home is dishevelled, with blond hair cut short, 60s-style, and dressed in a pink tweed jacket, riding breeches and boots. She gives me a tour and I\u2019m tempted to stop her every few feet to ask, \u201cWhy?\u201d Why is the phrase \u201cBurn, baby, burn\u201d scrawled on the door of the microwave? Why are there six sunhats hanging above the kitchen sink? (\u201cIt\u2019s a tiny house, 600 sq ft,\u201d she replies. \u201cWhere else would you put them?\u201d) More importantly, why is there a gun on her bedside table?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s loaded,\u201d Carroll says. She picks up the revolver, which has a fake pearl handle, and waves it around. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a gun,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing Skype calls with my friends, I like to pull it out. But I\u2019ve never had it loaded. Not until now.\u201d</p> <p>A loaded gun by the bed is one of the prices you pay if you are a woman who has just accused the president of the United States of raping you. Three weeks ago, in an excerpt from her new book What Do We Need Men For?, published in New York magazine, Carroll added her name to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/nov/30/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-full-list\" title=\"\">the growing </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/nov/30/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-full-list\" title=\"\">number of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/nov/30/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-full-list\" title=\"\">women</a> (which now stands at 16) who allege that they have been groped, forcibly kissed or worse by the current occupant of the Oval Office. Carroll went further in her allegations than almost everyone before her. She said she ran into Donald Trump, whom she had met a few years previously, in Bergdorf Goodman, the Manhattan department store; it was late 1995 or early 1996, and she was 52. They got to bantering about what gift Trump should buy a female friend. Lingerie was mentioned. He picked up a see-through bodysuit and told her to put it on. She fired back: \u201cYou try it on.\u201d Together they entered a dressing room. She was laughing, thinking it all a great hoot. But not for long.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1ebacefd0a567c9a88f65fc3a60a4ac2b7c66792\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ebacefd0a567c9a88f65fc3a60a4ac2b7c66792/0_0_2214_1586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Donald Trump, E Jean Carroll, her then husband, John Johnson, and Ivana Trump, at a party in 1987\" width=\"1000\" height=\"716\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Donald Trump, E Jean Carroll, her then husband, John Johnson, and Ivana Trump, at a party in 1987.

Jean Carroll</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Carroll alleges that Trump lunged at her, slamming her head and pinning her against the wall with his body as he penetrated her against her will. She prefers not to use the word rape, but agrees her description does meet the legal definition of the crime \u2013 something that has only once before been alleged against Trump: by his first wife, Ivana, in a divorce deposition; she later said she did not mean rape \u201cin a literal or criminal sense\u201d.</p> <p>In What Do We Need Men For?, Carroll writes that she always knew Trump would deny it \u2013 and this is precisely what he has done, repeatedly and in his Trumpian way. He doesn\u2019t know Carroll and never has, he told reporters, despite a photograph of the two of them and their then spouses talking happily at an NBC party, in about 1987. Trump also said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/25/donald-trump-says-assault-accuser-e-jean-carroll-not-my-type\" title=\"\">Carroll was \u201cnot my type\u201d</a>. \u201cIt was so dumb,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just laid it out in black and white: \u2018When I rape a woman, I don\u2019t rape a 52-year-old in Bergdorf. I rape a blond 28-year-old.\u2019 That\u2019s basically what he said.\u201d</p> <p>But if she fully anticipated the president\u2019s denials, she was less prepared for the commotion that followed, and other people\u2019s reactions. Since her story broke, she has received several death threats on social media and now stays offline to avoid the bile. Meanwhile, the mainstream media has been muted in its response. The initial reaction from the major US newspaper and television outlets was close to a shrug, as though this were just another item to add to the slush pile of Trump allegations. The New York Times relegated the story to its book pages. When I went to buy a copy of the book on its launch day, in a flagship New York branch of Barnes &amp; Noble, it had been placed in a corner of the fourth floor in the women\u2019s studies section. Shouldn\u2019t a book containing fresh allegations about a serious sex attack by a sitting US president be near the entrance, for everyone to read?</p> <p>I tell Carroll and she is livid. \u201cOh! That says more than anything I\u2019ve heard. The fourth floor women\u2019s studies section. You want to know how to bury a book? That\u2019s how you do it.\u201d There are no plans to publish the book in the UK.</p> <p>But after a lukewarm start, several TV channels and print outlets are pursuing her allegations. In hindsight, Carroll says, she didn\u2019t fully anticipate the impact of a rape allegation against the president, compared with the accusations that preceded hers. \u201cWe didn\u2019t weigh them or see it coming. I just wrote 11 pages about Trump. We don\u2019t even mention him on the cover of the book. I thought there might be a little brouhaha, but that was it. I didn\u2019t think it through.\u201d</p> <p>She has thought it through now, though. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid,\u201d she says. \u201cYou saw what\u2019s beside my bed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec9278ab4ed9f6896f9ab00e8b694ac5a5f054e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec9278ab4ed9f6896f9ab00e8b694ac5a5f054e8/0_99_985_1050/938.jpg\" alt=\"Advice columnist E Jean Carroll in March 1997\" width=\"938\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In New York in 1997, a year after the alleged assault.

She serves tea in cups without saucers (\u201cDon\u2019t tell the Queen!\u201d) and a plate of sliced tomatoes and cheese, chunks of which she periodically dispenses to her newly adopted rescue dog, Guffington von Fluke.</p> <p>Carroll tells me What Do We Need Men For? had been brewing in her mind for 26 years \u2013 ever since she began her Ask E Jean advice column in Elle magazine, at the age of 50. The column has a devoted fanbase of women drawn to her tart, funny, to-the-point writing. Sample advice to a correspondent who complains that her husband refuses to wash: \u201cSoak him down with the garden hose, tie him to the shower rod with Herm\u00e8s scarves.\u201d</p> <p>The column sent her on a particular path. \u201cVery early on, I realised that men were causing almost every problem sent in: the financial problems, the love-affair problems, the problems at work. I also noticed that I was repeatedly telling my correspondents to \u2018get rid of him\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>She decided to take a road trip that would allow her to test her hypothesis that men are more trouble than they are worth. As she writes in her new prologue: \u201cThe whole female sex seems to agree that men are becoming a nuisance with their lying, cheating, robbing, perjuring, assaulting, murdering.\u201d She has been twice married and twice divorced herself, first to Stephen Byers, with whom she lived in Montana before her journalism career took off; then, in the 80s, to former TV anchor John Johnson. She now lives in the Mouse House alone, but is close to her neighbours, with deep ties to New York medialand, and a life seemingly overflowing with friends.</p> <p>Her plan in 2017 was to drive through the heartlands of America, stopping only at towns named after women \u2013 Elnora, Indiana; Bonnieville, Kentucky; Pearl, Mississippi \u2013 and asking local women what, if anything, they needed men for. She was attracted to the idea of subverting a testosterone-fuelled literary genre (think Jack Kerouac\u2019s On The Road, or Tom Wolfe\u2019s The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test) and turning it into a treatise on the dispensability of men.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What he did to me is what he\u2019s doing to the country. And nobody is stopping him</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Carroll has a track record in subversion that dates back to her childhood in Fort Wayne, Indiana. She inherited her eccentricity from her father, an inventor whose proudest creations were disposable galoshes and goggles to protect the eyes from TV rays. \u201cI spent my childhood watching TV through Dad\u2019s goggles,\u201d she says. Her mother was a local politician and Republican campaigner. It was magazines, not books, that satisfied her young lust for reading \u2013 Austen and Wodehouse would have to wait. She got the itch to write, working freelance for years with scant success, until she got a piece accepted by Esquire at the age of 36. From there, she quickly developed a reputation, working for Rolling Stone, Vanity Fair and other heavyweight glossies. She moved to New York in the early 80s, a time when being a magazine writer was the pinnacle of cool.</p> <p>\u201cThose were the days!\u201d she says. \u201cIt was everything: you\u2019re running through the avenues at 4am, having a ball. I had no money, didn\u2019t know anybody, two outfits and a pair of cowgirl boots, and I just loved it. Living!\u201d</p> <p>Carroll began to frequent the writers\u2019 table at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/nyregion/reviving-elaines-without-elaine.html\" title=\"\">Elaine\u2019s restaurant</a>, the now defunct Upper East Side media hangout. This was a man\u2019s world and she was the only woman at the table. She became close to the gonzo journalist Hunter S Thompson, going on to write his biography. The Elle column led to a TV show, and a stint writing for Saturday Night Live in 1986. Carroll says she was a historically bad SNL writer, which fails to explain her Emmy nomination. \u201cI shone for one brief moment,\u201d she concedes. \u201cI wrote a sketch for [comedian] Sam Kinison about him getting dressed for a date and falling in love with himself in the mirror.\u201d</p> <p>There it was, even then: a forensic ability to precision-bomb men at their most abject. She further mined that theme with a book, The Loves Of My Life, in which she tracked down former boyfriends and moved in with them and their wives. \u201cOh God, I got on the wives\u2019 nerves,\u201d she recalls.</p> <p>The road trip that became What Do We Need Men For? began on 6 October 2017, nine months into Trump\u2019s presidency. By chance, hours earlier, one of the triggers of the #MeToo movement was pulled: the New York Times published the first major allegations of sexual misconduct against film producer Harvey Weinstein.</p> <p>It was a moment that changed her life, Carroll says. \u201cI had barely come out of the driveway and it hit. I kept pulling over to read Twitter \u2013 I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d In the days that followed, the tone of the letters sent to her advice column changed. \u201cI got way more questions about, \u2018Should I turn my husband in to the police?\u2019 Or, \u2018Shall I report my boss?\u2019 I started advising women: keep a log, get him on tape, go to the state.\u201d</p> <p>As #MeToo gathered pace, Carroll says it became clear that she could no longer sit on the sidelines, dishing out advice while failing to confront her own demons. She sat down to write what she calls \u201cthe most hideous men of my life list\u201d. She was stunned by what gushed up from her past. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t occurred to me that I had this unusual life. Any woman who starts making a list like this is going to think, \u2018What the hell!\u2019 Particularly women of my age, who were working in the 60s and 70s. There were so many! I was horrified.\u201d</p> <p>She whittled the list down to 21 men, not all of whom directly hurt her. Roger Ailes, the late disgraced chairman of Fox News, was a dear friend but is included because of what he did to other women. </p> <p>(As an aside, Carroll follows UK politics and says that were she ever to meet Boris Johnson, Britain\u2019s likely next prime minister, she would make him hideous man #22, given his track record of cheating on his wives.) </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f5bbcb3ffa6a8ed3ef4b9b0c77ab9c3c46d85d0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5bbcb3ffa6a8ed3ef4b9b0c77ab9c3c46d85d0e/0_2171_6732_6813/988.jpg\" alt=\"E Jean Carroll, who has accused Donald Trump of sexual assault\" width=\"988\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I have a crystal clear memory.

She thinks she must have been three when the babysitter\u2019s boyfriend pulled off her pyjama bottoms at bedtime and \u201cfondled my guinea\u201d. In her freshman year at university in Indiana, aged 17, she was held down at knifepoint by another student but managed to escape. In later life, she alleges that Les Moonves, the disgraced former head of CBS news, went at her in an elevator \u201clike an octopus\u201d after she interviewed him for Esquire. His representative \u201cemphatically denied\u201d the incident to New York magazine. Number 20 on that list is Donald Trump. It took considerable guts for her to include him. In 2016, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\" title=\"\">Access Hollywood tape emerged of the Republican nominee bragging about grabbing women</a> \u201cby the pussy\u201d, she bided her time. Several other women came forward to allege sexual misconduct. \u201cI watched the women closely. I noticed they were flanked by attorneys and that they were sober and sad. Many of them cried, for very good reasons.\u201d</p> <p>She decided not to join their ranks. \u201cWhy would I put my reputation on the line? I saw them dragged through the mud.\u201d</p> <p>But after the floodgates of #MeToo opened, she felt increasingly uncomfortable. \u201cI started to think I was the biggest fraud that walks \u2013 I\u2019m telling my correspondents what to do but haven\u2019t opened my own lips about anything, ever.\u201d</p> <p>She decided to include the president, but told almost no one. When New York magazine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/21/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegation-e-jean-carroll-new-york-latest-accusation\" title=\"\">published her story three weeks ago</a>, her family and most of her friends were stunned. She had confided in only two close friends, fellow New Yorkers both of whom are anonymous in her book but have since outed themselves, TV anchor Carol Martin and writer Lisa Birnbach. They have corroborated parts of Carroll\u2019s story, confirming that she called them soon after Trump\u2019s alleged assault and gave a fevered account of what had happened. The duo gave Carroll conflicting advice. Birnbach thought that what Carroll had described was clearly rape, and that she should go straight to the police. Martin said: \u201cTell no one. Forget it! He has 200 lawyers. He\u2019ll bury you.\u201d We know whose counsel she followed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We seem to crave powerful male leaders who grab what they desire without asking</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After so many years, how does that day replay in her mind; how clear is her memory? Carroll says her experience conforms closely to that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/sep/27/christine-blasey-ford-testimony-brett-kavanaugh-metoo\" title=\"c\">Christine Blasey Ford</a>, who last year testified that the now supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her. Some of the details were blurry, but the key facts were seared into her memory in perpetuity, the psychology professor told Congress.</p> <p>That chimes with Carroll. \u201cI have a crystal clear memory of most of it. A lot of it is etched into my brain.\u201d</p> <p>Could there have been any doubt, any confusion, that it was Trump? She looks at me with an expression that is part bafflement, part disgust, accompanied by a sound like the snort of a horse. \u201cNo. Donald Trump was the one and only. He knew everybody. He greeted everybody in the streets. He was charming. Recognising him was a big deal for me.\u201d So zero doubt? \u201cZero. ZERO.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Carroll whether she remembers particular physical sensations. In the book, she captures the brief minutes of the alleged attack in vivid detail, writing about becoming \u201caware of how large he is\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cI felt his shoulder against me,\u201d she says now. \u201cThat was the weight I felt. He was big, and he had one of his topcoats on, so he had that against me, too. I remember the feeling of being pressed by his shoulder, my head bouncing against the wall. That is clear. It was so surprising.\u201d</p> <p>Has she resisted calling it rape because she has conflicting feelings about the alleged attack? \u201cThe flirtation is great, I\u2019ll always do that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut going in the room \u2013 that was where I screwed up.\u201d</p> <p>She blames herself for that? \u201cOh yeah. If I hadn\u2019t gone into the dressing room, it wouldn\u2019t have happened. You and I wouldn\u2019t be here having this conversation.\u201d</p> <p>I want to be sure of what she\u2019s saying to me. A woman can go into a dressing room with a man and then walk out at will, I say. \u201cNo. No. I don\u2019t think a woman will ever be able to walk into a small enclosure with a man like that. Ever, ever, ever. I don\u2019t care if they infused every man\u2019s brain with #MeToo, you won\u2019t be safe. It\u2019s like you won\u2019t be safe shooting up heroin, you won\u2019t be safe driving at 120 miles per hour with the lights out.\u201d</p> <p>But rape is the man\u2019s responsibility. \u201cNo. It\u2019s the responsibility of the woman, too. It\u2019s equal. Men can\u2019t control themselves.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f53b1b8ee19401658fa77ddf7add165d0e026cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f53b1b8ee19401658fa77ddf7add165d0e026cc/0_2171_6732_4554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"E Jean Carroll outside her shed\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carroll\u2019s shed, inscribed with \u2018books, movies and dogs that inspired me\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Buck/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Carroll knows that what she is saying is contentious, and that a younger generation hold little truck with the idea of female complicity in sexual assault. But she is unapologetic, as she is about her choice to avoid the word \u201crape\u201d when it comes to Trump. She is convinced that rape is seen by many people \u2013 men and women \u2013 as \u201csexy\u201d, and that by using it we are playing Trump\u2019s game. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy. \u2018Rape\u2019 is very sexual and I just hate it. If a woman is raped and wants to report it to police, they should be free to use the word, that\u2019s their choice. But I\u2019ve always feared that Trump can be helped by these stories.\u201d</p> <p>How so? She points out that, unlike Weinstein, who is awaiting trial, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/09/les-moonves-cbs-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-new-ronan-farrow-report\" title=\"L\">Les Moonves, who resigned from CBS</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/27/lies-bill-cosby-sexual-assault-cases\" title=\"b\">Bill Cosby, who is behind bars</a>, Trump has emerged from a plethora of allegations apparently unscathed. \u201cI can\u2019t explain that,\u201d she says. \u201cExcept that we seem to want it in our leaders. We wanted it in Kennedy, in Clinton. We crave powerful male leaders who grab what they desire without asking.\u201d</p> <p>For Carroll, the most upsetting part of the alleged assault is political: it is a metaphor for what Trump is doing to America. \u201cWhat he did to me is what he\u2019s doing to the country. He\u2019s taking what he wants. And nobody is stopping him. Not his party, not the Democrats. Nobody is impeaching him, nobody is doing anything. Aren\u2019t you amazed?\u201d</p> <p>I tell her I am. But I also wonder whether there\u2019s an element of denial in the way that Carroll pushes any trauma away from herself and on to history. There\u2019s one line in the book that is stark and startling, and comes just after she describes kneeing Trump away from her and fleeing. She writes: \u201cI\u2019ve never had sex with anybody ever again.\u201d</p> <p>I read that sentence to her. Again, she demurs. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fact. I think it\u2019s because of my age, and that I haven\u2019t been lucky enough to meet somebody.\u201d</p> <p>But she wrote that line clearly implying that her celibacy was connected to Trump. She stops and thinks. \u201cYou make your own luck, it\u2019s true. I wasn\u2019t bold enough to say, yes, it was because of him.\u201d So will she say it now, in this wooded idyll where she is safe? \u201cI think it\u2019s half-and-half. I haven\u2019t met the guy, but meeting the guy is about being open to it.\u201d</p> <p>She is in reflective mode now, and I wonder if I have stirred up too many painful contradictions. But you can\u2019t get E Jean Carroll down for long. She starts to tell me about the enormous sackloads of correspondence she has received. \u201cThe mail bag is huge. Women are telling their stories again. That tells me we are not going to shut up. We will not be silenced by hideous men. We are going to tell our stories until change comes..\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong><a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250215437\" title=\"\">What Do We Need Men For?

      "bodyText": "Miss Bingley greets you in the driveway to the house in upstate New York, surrounded by a tangle of knotted woodland. The Toyota Prius, named after the spiteful Caroline Bingley in Jane Austen\u2019s Pride And Prejudice, is an appropriate place to start \u2013 because without the car there would have been no road trip and without the road trip there would have been no reckoning with a list of hideous men, and without that reckoning Miss Bingley\u2019s owner would not today find herself at the centre of an almighty storm involving the most powerful person on Earth. E Jean Carroll\u2019s cabin in the woods is small \u2013 600 sq ft, she keeps reminding me \u2013 and engulfed in trees, which the New York media fixture and Elle magazine agony aunt has allowed to grow right up to the windowsills. \u201cWelcome to the Mouse House\u201d has been handpainted on the front of the cabin \u2013 a reference to the mice frequently dragged in by Carroll\u2019s cat, which goes by the name of Vagina T Fireballs. Inside, the turquoise walls are hung with fading photographs of Carroll, in her prom dress and with her pet goat, Pan, as well as deer skulls and yards of bookshelves \u2013 her collection includes six volumes of Jane Austen and a library of PG Wodehouse. The chimney stones are painted in blues, greens and yellows, and above the hearth is another handpainted motto: \u201cAlways aroused, never angry \u2013 Thackeray.\u201d Carroll meets me with a generous smile. She is as elegant and tidy as her home is dishevelled, with blond hair cut short, 60s-style, and dressed in a pink tweed jacket, riding breeches and boots. She gives me a tour and I\u2019m tempted to stop her every few feet to ask, \u201cWhy?\u201d Why is the phrase \u201cBurn, baby, burn\u201d scrawled on the door of the microwave? Why are there six sunhats hanging above the kitchen sink? (\u201cIt\u2019s a tiny house, 600 sq ft,\u201d she replies. \u201cWhere else would you put them?\u201d) More importantly, why is there a gun on her bedside table? \u201cIt\u2019s loaded,\u201d Carroll says. She picks up the revolver, which has a fake pearl handle, and waves it around. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a gun,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing Skype calls with my friends, I like to pull it out. But I\u2019ve never had it loaded. Not until now.\u201d A loaded gun by the bed is one of the prices you pay if you are a woman who has just accused the president of the United States of raping you. Three weeks ago, in an excerpt from her new book What Do We Need Men For?, published in New York magazine, Carroll added her name to the growing number of women (which now stands at 16) who allege that they have been groped, forcibly kissed or worse by the current occupant of the Oval Office. Carroll went further in her allegations than almost everyone before her. She said she ran into Donald Trump, whom she had met a few years previously, in Bergdorf Goodman, the Manhattan department store; it was late 1995 or early 1996, and she was 52. They got to bantering about what gift Trump should buy a female friend. Lingerie was mentioned. He picked up a see-through bodysuit and told her to put it on. She fired back: \u201cYou try it on.\u201d Together they entered a dressing room. She was laughing, thinking it all a great hoot. But not for long. Carroll alleges that Trump lunged at her, slamming her head and pinning her against the wall with his body as he penetrated her against her will. She prefers not to use the word rape, but agrees her description does meet the legal definition of the crime \u2013 something that has only once before been alleged against Trump: by his first wife, Ivana, in a divorce deposition; she later said she did not mean rape \u201cin a literal or criminal sense\u201d. In What Do We Need Men For?, Carroll writes that she always knew Trump would deny it \u2013 and this is precisely what he has done, repeatedly and in his Trumpian way. He doesn\u2019t know Carroll and never has, he told reporters, despite a photograph of the two of them and their then spouses talking happily at an NBC party, in about 1987. Trump also said Carroll was \u201cnot my type\u201d. \u201cIt was so dumb,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just laid it out in black and white: \u2018When I rape a woman, I don\u2019t rape a 52-year-old in Bergdorf. I rape a blond 28-year-old.\u2019 That\u2019s basically what he said.\u201d But if she fully anticipated the president\u2019s denials, she was less prepared for the commotion that followed, and other people\u2019s reactions. Since her story broke, she has received several death threats on social media and now stays offline to avoid the bile. Meanwhile, the mainstream media has been muted in its response. The initial reaction from the major US newspaper and television outlets was close to a shrug, as though this were just another item to add to the slush pile of Trump allegations. The New York Times relegated the story to its book pages. When I went to buy a copy of the book on its launch day, in a flagship New York branch of Barnes &amp; Noble, it had been placed in a corner of the fourth floor in the women\u2019s studies section. Shouldn\u2019t a book containing fresh allegations about a serious sex attack by a sitting US president be near the entrance, for everyone to read? I tell Carroll and she is livid. \u201cOh! That says more than anything I\u2019ve heard. The fourth floor women\u2019s studies section. You want to know how to bury a book? That\u2019s how you do it.\u201d There are no plans to publish the book in the UK. But after a lukewarm start, several TV channels and print outlets are pursuing her allegations. In hindsight, Carroll says, she didn\u2019t fully anticipate the impact of a rape allegation against the president, compared with the accusations that preceded hers. \u201cWe didn\u2019t weigh them or see it coming. I just wrote 11 pages about Trump. We don\u2019t even mention him on the cover of the book. I thought there might be a little brouhaha, but that was it. I didn\u2019t think it through.\u201d She has thought it through now, though. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid,\u201d she says. \u201cYou saw what\u2019s beside my bed.\u201d We move outside to a table that looks like something from Miss Havisham\u2019s garden, gently rotting under a lush covering of moss that resembles a velvet tablecloth. She serves tea in cups without saucers (\u201cDon\u2019t tell the Queen!\u201d) and a plate of sliced tomatoes and cheese, chunks of which she periodically dispenses to her newly adopted rescue dog, Guffington von Fluke. Carroll tells me What Do We Need Men For? had been brewing in her mind for 26 years \u2013 ever since she began her Ask E Jean advice column in Elle magazine, at the age of 50. The column has a devoted fanbase of women drawn to her tart, funny, to-the-point writing. Sample advice to a correspondent who complains that her husband refuses to wash: \u201cSoak him down with the garden hose, tie him to the shower rod with Herm\u00e8s scarves.\u201d The column sent her on a particular path. \u201cVery early on, I realised that men were causing almost every problem sent in: the financial problems, the love-affair problems, the problems at work. I also noticed that I was repeatedly telling my correspondents to \u2018get rid of him\u2019.\u201d She decided to take a road trip that would allow her to test her hypothesis that men are more trouble than they are worth. As she writes in her new prologue: \u201cThe whole female sex seems to agree that men are becoming a nuisance with their lying, cheating, robbing, perjuring, assaulting, murdering.\u201d She has been twice married and twice divorced herself, first to Stephen Byers, with whom she lived in Montana before her journalism career took off; then, in the 80s, to former TV anchor John Johnson. She now lives in the Mouse House alone, but is close to her neighbours, with deep ties to New York medialand, and a life seemingly overflowing with friends. Her plan in 2017 was to drive through the heartlands of America, stopping only at towns named after women \u2013 Elnora, Indiana; Bonnieville, Kentucky; Pearl, Mississippi \u2013 and asking local women what, if anything, they needed men for. She was attracted to the idea of subverting a testosterone-fuelled literary genre (think Jack Kerouac\u2019s On The Road, or Tom Wolfe\u2019s The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test) and turning it into a treatise on the dispensability of men. Carroll has a track record in subversion that dates back to her childhood in Fort Wayne, Indiana. She inherited her eccentricity from her father, an inventor whose proudest creations were disposable galoshes and goggles to protect the eyes from TV rays. \u201cI spent my childhood watching TV through Dad\u2019s goggles,\u201d she says. Her mother was a local politician and Republican campaigner. It was magazines, not books, that satisfied her young lust for reading \u2013 Austen and Wodehouse would have to wait. She got the itch to write, working freelance for years with scant success, until she got a piece accepted by Esquire at the age of 36. From there, she quickly developed a reputation, working for Rolling Stone, Vanity Fair and other heavyweight glossies. She moved to New York in the early 80s, a time when being a magazine writer was the pinnacle of cool. \u201cThose were the days!\u201d she says. \u201cIt was everything: you\u2019re running through the avenues at 4am, having a ball. I had no money, didn\u2019t know anybody, two outfits and a pair of cowgirl boots, and I just loved it. Living!\u201d Carroll began to frequent the writers\u2019 table at Elaine\u2019s restaurant, the now defunct Upper East Side media hangout. This was a man\u2019s world and she was the only woman at the table. She became close to the gonzo journalist Hunter S Thompson, going on to write his biography. The Elle column led to a TV show, and a stint writing for Saturday Night Live in 1986. Carroll says she was a historically bad SNL writer, which fails to explain her Emmy nomination. \u201cI shone for one brief moment,\u201d she concedes. \u201cI wrote a sketch for [comedian] Sam Kinison about him getting dressed for a date and falling in love with himself in the mirror.\u201d There it was, even then: a forensic ability to precision-bomb men at their most abject. She further mined that theme with a book, The Loves Of My Life, in which she tracked down former boyfriends and moved in with them and their wives. \u201cOh God, I got on the wives\u2019 nerves,\u201d she recalls. The road trip that became What Do We Need Men For? began on 6 October 2017, nine months into Trump\u2019s presidency. By chance, hours earlier, one of the triggers of the #MeToo movement was pulled: the New York Times published the first major allegations of sexual misconduct against film producer Harvey Weinstein. It was a moment that changed her life, Carroll says. \u201cI had barely come out of the driveway and it hit. I kept pulling over to read Twitter \u2013 I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d In the days that followed, the tone of the letters sent to her advice column changed. \u201cI got way more questions about, \u2018Should I turn my husband in to the police?\u2019 Or, \u2018Shall I report my boss?\u2019 I started advising women: keep a log, get him on tape, go to the state.\u201d As #MeToo gathered pace, Carroll says it became clear that she could no longer sit on the sidelines, dishing out advice while failing to confront her own demons. She sat down to write what she calls \u201cthe most hideous men of my life list\u201d. She was stunned by what gushed up from her past. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t occurred to me that I had this unusual life. Any woman who starts making a list like this is going to think, \u2018What the hell!\u2019 Particularly women of my age, who were working in the 60s and 70s. There were so many! I was horrified.\u201d She whittled the list down to 21 men, not all of whom directly hurt her. Roger Ailes, the late disgraced chairman of Fox News, was a dear friend but is included because of what he did to other women. (As an aside, Carroll follows UK politics and says that were she ever to meet Boris Johnson, Britain\u2019s likely next prime minister, she would make him hideous man #22, given his track record of cheating on his wives.) Carroll says her own experience of abuse started very young. She thinks she must have been three when the babysitter\u2019s boyfriend pulled off her pyjama bottoms at bedtime and \u201cfondled my guinea\u201d. In her freshman year at university in Indiana, aged 17, she was held down at knifepoint by another student but managed to escape. In later life, she alleges that Les Moonves, the disgraced former head of CBS news, went at her in an elevator \u201clike an octopus\u201d after she interviewed him for Esquire. His representative \u201cemphatically denied\u201d the incident to New York magazine. Number 20 on that list is Donald Trump. It took considerable guts for her to include him. In 2016, when the Access Hollywood tape emerged of the Republican nominee bragging about grabbing women \u201cby the pussy\u201d, she bided her time. Several other women came forward to allege sexual misconduct. \u201cI watched the women closely. I noticed they were flanked by attorneys and that they were sober and sad. Many of them cried, for very good reasons.\u201d She decided not to join their ranks. \u201cWhy would I put my reputation on the line? I saw them dragged through the mud.\u201d But after the floodgates of #MeToo opened, she felt increasingly uncomfortable. \u201cI started to think I was the biggest fraud that walks \u2013 I\u2019m telling my correspondents what to do but haven\u2019t opened my own lips about anything, ever.\u201d She decided to include the president, but told almost no one. When New York magazine published her story three weeks ago, her family and most of her friends were stunned. She had confided in only two close friends, fellow New Yorkers both of whom are anonymous in her book but have since outed themselves, TV anchor Carol Martin and writer Lisa Birnbach. They have corroborated parts of Carroll\u2019s story, confirming that she called them soon after Trump\u2019s alleged assault and gave a fevered account of what had happened. The duo gave Carroll conflicting advice. Birnbach thought that what Carroll had described was clearly rape, and that she should go straight to the police. Martin said: \u201cTell no one. Forget it! He has 200 lawyers. He\u2019ll bury you.\u201d We know whose counsel she followed. After so many years, how does that day replay in her mind; how clear is her memory? Carroll says her experience conforms closely to that of Christine Blasey Ford, who last year testified that the now supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her. Some of the details were blurry, but the key facts were seared into her memory in perpetuity, the psychology professor told Congress. That chimes with Carroll. \u201cI have a crystal clear memory of most of it. A lot of it is etched into my brain.\u201d Could there have been any doubt, any confusion, that it was Trump? She looks at me with an expression that is part bafflement, part disgust, accompanied by a sound like the snort of a horse. \u201cNo. Donald Trump was the one and only. He knew everybody. He greeted everybody in the streets. He was charming. Recognising him was a big deal for me.\u201d So zero doubt? \u201cZero. ZERO.\u201d I ask Carroll whether she remembers particular physical sensations. In the book, she captures the brief minutes of the alleged attack in vivid detail, writing about becoming \u201caware of how large he is\u201d. \u201cI felt his shoulder against me,\u201d she says now. \u201cThat was the weight I felt. He was big, and he had one of his topcoats on, so he had that against me, too. I remember the feeling of being pressed by his shoulder, my head bouncing against the wall. That is clear. It was so surprising.\u201d Has she resisted calling it rape because she has conflicting feelings about the alleged attack? \u201cThe flirtation is great, I\u2019ll always do that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut going in the room \u2013 that was where I screwed up.\u201d She blames herself for that? \u201cOh yeah. If I hadn\u2019t gone into the dressing room, it wouldn\u2019t have happened. You and I wouldn\u2019t be here having this conversation.\u201d I want to be sure of what she\u2019s saying to me. A woman can go into a dressing room with a man and then walk out at will, I say. \u201cNo. No. I don\u2019t think a woman will ever be able to walk into a small enclosure with a man like that. Ever, ever, ever. I don\u2019t care if they infused every man\u2019s brain with #MeToo, you won\u2019t be safe. It\u2019s like you won\u2019t be safe shooting up heroin, you won\u2019t be safe driving at 120 miles per hour with the lights out.\u201d But rape is the man\u2019s responsibility. \u201cNo. It\u2019s the responsibility of the woman, too. It\u2019s equal. Men can\u2019t control themselves.\u201d Carroll knows that what she is saying is contentious, and that a younger generation hold little truck with the idea of female complicity in sexual assault. But she is unapologetic, as she is about her choice to avoid the word \u201crape\u201d when it comes to Trump. She is convinced that rape is seen by many people \u2013 men and women \u2013 as \u201csexy\u201d, and that by using it we are playing Trump\u2019s game. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy. \u2018Rape\u2019 is very sexual and I just hate it. If a woman is raped and wants to report it to police, they should be free to use the word, that\u2019s their choice. But I\u2019ve always feared that Trump can be helped by these stories.\u201d How so? She points out that, unlike Weinstein, who is awaiting trial, or Les Moonves, who resigned from CBS, or Bill Cosby, who is behind bars, Trump has emerged from a plethora of allegations apparently unscathed. \u201cI can\u2019t explain that,\u201d she says. \u201cExcept that we seem to want it in our leaders. We wanted it in Kennedy, in Clinton. We crave powerful male leaders who grab what they desire without asking.\u201d For Carroll, the most upsetting part of the alleged assault is political: it is a metaphor for what Trump is doing to America. \u201cWhat he did to me is what he\u2019s doing to the country. He\u2019s taking what he wants. And nobody is stopping him. Not his party, not the Democrats. Nobody is impeaching him, nobody is doing anything. Aren\u2019t you amazed?\u201d I tell her I am. But I also wonder whether there\u2019s an element of denial in the way that Carroll pushes any trauma away from herself and on to history. There\u2019s one line in the book that is stark and startling, and comes just after she describes kneeing Trump away from her and fleeing. She writes: \u201cI\u2019ve never had sex with anybody ever again.\u201d I read that sentence to her. Again, she demurs. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fact. I think it\u2019s because of my age, and that I haven\u2019t been lucky enough to meet somebody.\u201d But she wrote that line clearly implying that her celibacy was connected to Trump. She stops and thinks. \u201cYou make your own luck, it\u2019s true. I wasn\u2019t bold enough to say, yes, it was because of him.\u201d So will she say it now, in this wooded idyll where she is safe? \u201cI think it\u2019s half-and-half. I haven\u2019t met the guy, but meeting the guy is about being open to it.\u201d She is in reflective mode now, and I wonder if I have stirred up too many painful contradictions. But you can\u2019t get E Jean Carroll down for long. She starts to tell me about the enormous sackloads of correspondence she has received. \u201cThe mail bag is huge. Women are telling their stories again. That tells me we are not going to shut up. We will not be silenced by hideous men. We are going to tell our stories until change comes..\u201d \u2022 What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal, by E Jean Carroll, is published in the US by St Martin\u2019s Press. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

This runs from 11am until midnight each day, providing a constant stream of music reviews, photography and mini-features.

We also had the Guardian\u2019s senior fashion writer Lauren Cochrane picking out the best looks in the field, and food writer Felicity Cloake on a quest to find the tastiest food.

Again, this was planned weeks in advance, although the nature of newspaper production means that features were being swapped in and out just hours before our Sunday mid-afternoon deadline. This was the most ambitious and features-packed G2 yet, with star interviews (Mark Ronson, Lewis Capaldi, Nadine Shah) alongside stories that show off what a joyously bonkers place Glastonbury is. A personal favourite was from Elle Hunt, dispatched to find someone who hadn\u2019t watched any music all weekend and hear about their festival experience. I was worried she might not find anyone \u2013 in the end she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/30/we-stay-pure-in-our-little-bubble-the-glastonbury-couple-who-avoid-the-music\">found a couple who ran a gong bath tent in the Healing Fields</a> who had been going for 15 years and had seen just one performance that entire time: Leonard Cohen in 2008. Other highlights included<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/30/playing-the-field-can-dating-apps-find-you-love-at-glastonbury\"> testing out dating apps</a>, Michael Segalov\u2019s account of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/01/glastonbury-drag-queen-rocketman-nyc-downlow\">bringing his dad to Glastonbury</a> (replete with plenty of drag queens), and a Marie Kondo-inspired mission to find <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/30/pitch-perfect-glastonbury-tidiest-tents\">the site\u2019s tidiest tent</a>. Our multimedia team made a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2019/jul/01/owen-jones-goes-to-glastonbury-can-you-talk-politics-at-a-rave\">mini-documentary presented by Owen Jones</a>, as he sought to find out whether Glastonbury is really the activist hub its reputation suggests; they also produced daily stories for the Guardian\u2019s Instagram feed.</p> <p>Each evening, we handed the reins of the liveblog to Guardian writers in London \u2013 Tim Jonze and Michael Hann \u2013 giving me an opportunity to gawp at the sunset from the Park stage, and see some of the headliners. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/30/the-killers-at-glastonbury-2019-review\">brilliant as the Killers were</a> \u2013 in the sweetest of spots between rock\u2019n\u2019roll swagger and crooning Vegas showmanship \u2013 Stormzy was the moment of the weekend for me:<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/29/stormzy-glastonbury-review-pyramid-stage\"> a milestone in the progression of black British culture</a> from the margins to the mainstream.</p> <p>Then it\u2019s back to the cabin, to pick over the headliners with chief critic Alexis Petridis, who filed reviews with admirable speed. Once published, it\u2019s then time to take stock of the photography from the day with picture editor Karin Andreasson, and build beautiful immersive galleries to be launched first thing the following morning. It\u2019s gone 1am each day by the time this is all put to bed, but the exhilaration of bringing together the day\u2019s work is weirdly uplifting. The angel on your shoulder that tells you to go to bed and preserve yourself for the following day is dropkicked by the devil on the other. Sure enough, I end up in a cage dancing to propulsive disco-house.</p> <p>All in all, we published 79 stories across the entire week, plus a handful more in the aftermath, and broke our all-time Glastonbury traffic record set in 2017. Ideas are already being passed around for coverage of next year\u2019s festival, which is Glastonbury\u2019s 50th anniversary. We\u2019re expecting the starriest musical lineup yet \u2013 and another bout of extreme sleep deprivation.</p>",

This was the most ambitious and features-packed G2 yet, with star interviews (Mark Ronson, Lewis Capaldi, Nadine Shah) alongside stories that show off what a joyously bonkers place Glastonbury is. A personal favourite was from Elle Hunt, dispatched to find someone who hadn\u2019t watched any music all weekend and hear about their festival experience. I was worried she might not find anyone \u2013 in the end she found a couple who ran a gong bath tent in the Healing Fields who had been going for 15 years and had seen just one performance that entire time: Leonard Cohen in 2008. Other highlights included testing out dating apps, Michael Segalov\u2019s account of bringing his dad to Glastonbury (replete with plenty of drag queens), and a Marie Kondo-inspired mission to find the site\u2019s tidiest tent. Our multimedia team made a mini-documentary presented by Owen Jones, as he sought to find out whether Glastonbury is really the activist hub its reputation suggests; they also produced daily stories for the Guardian\u2019s Instagram feed. Each evening, we handed the reins of the liveblog to Guardian writers in London \u2013 Tim Jonze and Michael Hann \u2013 giving me an opportunity to gawp at the sunset from the Park stage, and see some of the headliners. As brilliant as the Killers were \u2013 in the sweetest of spots between rock\u2019n\u2019roll swagger and crooning Vegas showmanship \u2013 Stormzy was the moment of the weekend for me: a milestone in the progression of black British culture from the margins to the mainstream. Then it\u2019s back to the cabin, to pick over the headliners with chief critic Alexis Petridis, who filed reviews with admirable speed. Once published, it\u2019s then time to take stock of the photography from the day with picture editor Karin Andreasson, and build beautiful immersive galleries to be launched first thing the following morning. It\u2019s gone 1am each day by the time this is all put to bed, but the exhilaration of bringing together the day\u2019s work is weirdly uplifting. The angel on your shoulder that tells you to go to bed and preserve yourself for the following day is dropkicked by the devil on the other. Sure enough, I end up in a cage dancing to propulsive disco-house. All in all, we published 79 stories across the entire week, plus a handful more in the aftermath, and broke our all-time Glastonbury traffic record set in 2017. Ideas are already being passed around for coverage of next year\u2019s festival, which is Glastonbury\u2019s 50th anniversary. We\u2019re expecting the starriest musical lineup yet \u2013 and another bout of extreme sleep deprivation.",

It is, after all, Disney\u2019s third remake of one of its own properties this year \u2013 following flashy but instantly disposable spins on <em>Dumbo</em> and <em>Aladdin</em> \u2013 and not the last, either.</p> <p>But as we tut and sigh, it\u2019s worth remembering that the cinematic remake is not an inherently bad idea: many a great film-maker has revisited earlier work for inspiration, and the streaming realm is peppered with good examples. Some are obvious \u2013 we needn\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/08/a-star-is-born-streaming-guy-lodge\" title=\"\">trace the timeline</a> of all <em>A Star Is Born</em>\u2019s versions once more \u2013 while some are built on such obscure foundations that they are hardly remembered as remakes at all.

      "bodyText": "With next week\u2019s mainstream cinema calendar largely cleared for the presumed box-office colossus that is the \u201clive-action\u201d The Lion King remake, film critics once more have an opportunity to grumble about Hollywood\u2019s over-dependence on do-overs at the expense of original material. It is, after all, Disney\u2019s third remake of one of its own properties this year \u2013 following flashy but instantly disposable spins on Dumbo and Aladdin \u2013 and not the last, either. But as we tut and sigh, it\u2019s worth remembering that the cinematic remake is not an inherently bad idea: many a great film-maker has revisited earlier work for inspiration, and the streaming realm is peppered with good examples. Some are obvious \u2013 we needn\u2019t trace the timeline of all A Star Is Born\u2019s versions once more \u2013 while some are built on such obscure foundations that they are hardly remembered as remakes at all. How many people know that Billy Wilder\u2019s immortally hilarious Some Like It Hot (now streaming on Netflix \u2013 go on, delight yourself again) is actually the second reworking of the 1935 French farce Fanfare of Love? Perhaps the latter is every bit Wilder\u2019s equal, but good luck sourcing a copy to find out. Martin Scorsese, of course, is a dab hand at this game. His richly menacing, psychosexually layered Cape Fear runs slithery rings around J Lee Thompson\u2019s more squarely suspenseful original \u2013 both are at Amazon if you\u2019re in the mood to compare. And Scorsese finally won his Oscar for The Departed (streaming on Amazon), a rollicking riff of Andrew Lau and Alan Mak\u2019s steelier Hong Kong cop saga Infernal Affairs (Netflix). Both films, tonally disparate, are very fine, though I admit a guilty preference for the broadly Boston-ised remake. While I\u2019m committing such English-biased heresy, I think Steven Soderbergh, ever partial to a remake, can claim the superior version of Solaris (Amazon). His mournfully romantic sci-fi dream may lack the frosty, expansive grandeur of Andrei Tarkovsky\u2019s pristine Stanislaw Lem adaptation (Google Play), but I connect more to its lonesome, wounded soul. Meanwhile, William Friedkin\u2019s tremendous Sorcerer \u2013 a literally dynamite-packing road thriller riding roughshod across South America \u2013 is, if not necessarily better, a bit more ripely entertaining than Henri-Georges Clouzot\u2019s longer, more philosophical, Palme d\u2019Or-winning original The Wages of Fear. Either way, it\u2019s a mighty double feature: again, Amazon has the goods. Of course, this exchange between Hollywood and world cinema cuts both ways. I couldn\u2019t do without Ali: Fear Eats the Soul, Rainer Werner Fassbinder\u2019s more grittily heartsore German spin on Douglas Sirk\u2019s ravishing cross-class melodrama All That Heaven Allows, with its added racial and cultural divisions \u2013 a rare instance of both versions of a film being so complementary that it\u2019s now hard to treasure one without the other. (The BFI Player has both.) Sirk himself could hardly object: his own 1959 version of Imitation of Life may well be golden-age Hollywood\u2019s greatest and most essential remake, deepening the black characters and racial politics of John M Stahl\u2019s fascinating but more reserved 1934 original. (Find them on Google Play.) Even then, it\u2019s marked by certain pre-civil rights restrictions. If any classic film is ripe for 21st-century treatment, it\u2019s this one. These films hardly need defending, though I differ from most of my colleagues in my appreciation of Gus van Sant\u2019s shot-for-shot remake of Psycho (Amazon). Viewed as an avant-garde installation honouring Hitchcock\u2019s peerless original (a 90p steal at Chili) rather than as an update, it\u2019s brazen, audacious and oddly beautiful. Still, the safest course of action is always to make over an original with ample room for improvement, as David Lowery did in his inspired, empathetic Disney remake of Pete\u2019s Dragon (available only to buy at Amazon, per Disney regulations) \u2013 finding a spark of human feeling in it\u2019s child\u2019s-eye fantasy that the stiff, lumbering, song-laden 1977 original (streaming at DisneyLife, if you\u2019re curious) never managed. Why the Mouse House doesn\u2019t take this course of action more often, instead of endlessly replicating perfectly imagined animated classics, is something critics and fans alike can justly grouse about. New to streaming &amp; DVD this week Border (Mubi/Modern Films, 15) Ali Abbasi\u2019s wholly unique contemporary fairytale freely blends folklore, Scandi noir and social realism for a thrilling examination of outsider identity. Captain Marvel (Disney, 12) The first female-led adventure in the Marvel Cinematic Universe benefits from Brie Larson\u2019s doughty presence in the lead, but its haphazard storytelling is disappointingly shopworn. Mirai (Anime Ltd, PG) Mamoru Hosoda\u2019s enchanting, Oscar-nominated anime elegantly blends everyday detail with time-bending whimsy to explore the psyche of a young boy threatened by his baby sister\u2019s arrival. Buy Me a Gun (Mubi) Streaming exclusively at Mubi, Julio Hern\u00e1ndez Cord\u00f3n\u2019s eccentric Mexican fable bears the influence of both Huckleberry Finn and Mad Max in its story of a tomboy surviving a cartel-run dystopia.",

      "body": "<p>Are audiobooks the new\u2026 books? It was recently revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/26/new-chapter-uk-print-book-sales-fall-while-audiobooks-surge-43\" title=\"\">audiobook sales rocketed by 43% in 2018</a>, while those of print books declined (by 5%) for the first time in five years. Can people no longer be bothered to read for themselves? Is this, rather than the ebook, the harbinger of the slow death of print, about which we have been warned for so long? And if so, what does that mean for literary culture? Let us first retain some historical perspective by noting that Homer\u2019s<em> Iliad</em> was essentially an audiobook before it was ever written down. Oral literary culture long precedes the book and there are many reasons for its rising popularity. Some people I spoke to use audiobooks to send them to sleep after a stressful professional day; others listen while walking, or looking after a baby, or as an alternative to TV. Parents say they are great for keeping children occupied in the car, and commuters use them on their journeys. The time-pressed listen at 1.5x or 2x normal speed, or use websites such as <a href=\"https://www.blinkist.com/\" title=\"\">Blinkist</a>, which boil down non-fiction books to their \u201ckey takeaways\u201d in 15 minutes. One writer told me that he gets audiobooks \u201cfor research into stuff that I fear my pleasure-seeking brain would give up on if I had to read with my eyes\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>It may be that an actor\u2019s voice can provide musical information that helps longer-term recall, just as the visual information of a book can</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But is there really a measurable difference between reading with the eyes and \u201creading\u201d with the ears? According to an oft-cited 2016 study (<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2158244016669550\" title=\"\">Beth A Rogowsky et al</a>), 91 subjects were found to display no significant difference in either comprehension or recall after two weeks whether they had read a non\u2011fiction passage or listened to it, or done both simultaneously. However, this investigation used ebooks for the reading part, and other studies have suggested that reading comprehension and recall is lower for reading on screens versus print. Since the 1980s, cognitive psychology has consistently established that recall is indeed better after reading (printed) text instead of listening to it, a conclusion bolstered by a 2010 study (<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1080/00986283.2010.488542\" title=\"\">David B Daniel and William Douglas Woody</a>), which found that students did worse on a test if they had listened to a podcast of a scientific article on child cognition rather than reading it.</p> <p>Books have the advantage that you can rapidly re\u2011scan a sentence visually if you didn\u2019t take it in the first time; and you can mark passages in pencil or turn down page corners to mark specific places to return to. Audiobooks, by contrast, exploit our \u201cechoic memory\u201d, which is the process by which sound information is stored for up to four seconds while we wait for the next sounds to make sense of the whole. Nor can audiobooks reproduce one of the most thrilling features of print, which is its creative ambiguity: the line of poetry, or the sentence, that is exquisitely balanced between two possible meanings. The actor in the studio has to choose just one, and that is the one that is forced on the reader. In their favour, it might be that the particular cadences and timbre of an actor\u2019s voice in audiobooks provide musical information that helps longer-term recall, just as the visual and tactile information of where a passage lies in a printed book can.</p> <p>That voice is everything, says Jennifer Howard, founding director of the boutique audio studio <a href=\"https://www.soundunderstanding.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Sound Understanding</a>, whose recent productions include Samuel West reading astronomer royal Martin Rees\u2019s <em>On the Future</em> for Princeton University Press. \u201cCasting the right voice is crucial,\u201d she says. \u201cGet it wrong and you can really turn the listener off.\u201d And non-fiction is even more demanding than fiction. \u201cIn a non-fiction book, the reader must understand and be interested in what they are reading, because comprehension can\u2019t be disguised with vocal tricks and the light and shade of characterisation. So in addition to actors, we work with a lot of broadcasters. They understand complex political or socio-economic subjects and instinctively know when, where, and how much stress to place on a particular point.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fd2c8ca6a3ac91d6ecae55890972dac50037b96b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd2c8ca6a3ac91d6ecae55890972dac50037b96b/0_0_4096_1734/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Golden Compass\" width=\"1000\" height=\"423\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>The Golden Compass</em>, the 2007 film adaptation of Philip Pullman\u2019s <em>Northern Lights.</em> Pullman has written a 32-minute short story for Audible.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Snap Stills/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The UK\u2019s leading audiobook retailer, Audible, whose customers downloaded more than 3bn hours of material last year, is getting into the \u201coriginal audiobook\u201d game, having commissioned the likes of Michael Lewis and Jon Ronson to write exclusive direct-to-audiobook stories or \u201cshortform books\u201d. One of their earliest signings was Philip Pullman, who in 2015 wrote a 32-minute short story set in the universe of His Dark Materials, \u201cThe Collectors\u201d, saying that he was attracted by \u201cthe idea of writing for a voice\u201d instead of a reader. (Audible itself explained that the idea was \u201cnot only a way to please current members, but also to bring in new listeners\u201d.) But if an \u201caudiobook\u201d was never a book in the first place, can it really be called a book? Surely it is just a rebadged radio drama, documentary, or podcast, even if it goes on to be bookified. (Pullman\u2019s \u201cThe Collectors\u201d subsequently came out as a Kindle Single.)

      "bodyText": "Are audiobooks the new\u2026 books? It was recently revealed that audiobook sales rocketed by 43% in 2018, while those of print books declined (by 5%) for the first time in five years. Can people no longer be bothered to read for themselves? Is this, rather than the ebook, the harbinger of the slow death of print, about which we have been warned for so long? And if so, what does that mean for literary culture? Let us first retain some historical perspective by noting that Homer\u2019s Iliad was essentially an audiobook before it was ever written down. Oral literary culture long precedes the book and there are many reasons for its rising popularity. Some people I spoke to use audiobooks to send them to sleep after a stressful professional day; others listen while walking, or looking after a baby, or as an alternative to TV. Parents say they are great for keeping children occupied in the car, and commuters use them on their journeys. The time-pressed listen at 1.5x or 2x normal speed, or use websites such as Blinkist, which boil down non-fiction books to their \u201ckey takeaways\u201d in 15 minutes. One writer told me that he gets audiobooks \u201cfor research into stuff that I fear my pleasure-seeking brain would give up on if I had to read with my eyes\u201d. But is there really a measurable difference between reading with the eyes and \u201creading\u201d with the ears? According to an oft-cited 2016 study (Beth A Rogowsky et al), 91 subjects were found to display no significant difference in either comprehension or recall after two weeks whether they had read a non\u2011fiction passage or listened to it, or done both simultaneously. However, this investigation used ebooks for the reading part, and other studies have suggested that reading comprehension and recall is lower for reading on screens versus print. Since the 1980s, cognitive psychology has consistently established that recall is indeed better after reading (printed) text instead of listening to it, a conclusion bolstered by a 2010 study (David B Daniel and William Douglas Woody), which found that students did worse on a test if they had listened to a podcast of a scientific article on child cognition rather than reading it. Books have the advantage that you can rapidly re\u2011scan a sentence visually if you didn\u2019t take it in the first time; and you can mark passages in pencil or turn down page corners to mark specific places to return to. Audiobooks, by contrast, exploit our \u201cechoic memory\u201d, which is the process by which sound information is stored for up to four seconds while we wait for the next sounds to make sense of the whole. Nor can audiobooks reproduce one of the most thrilling features of print, which is its creative ambiguity: the line of poetry, or the sentence, that is exquisitely balanced between two possible meanings. The actor in the studio has to choose just one, and that is the one that is forced on the reader. In their favour, it might be that the particular cadences and timbre of an actor\u2019s voice in audiobooks provide musical information that helps longer-term recall, just as the visual and tactile information of where a passage lies in a printed book can. That voice is everything, says Jennifer Howard, founding director of the boutique audio studio Sound Understanding, whose recent productions include Samuel West reading astronomer royal Martin Rees\u2019s On the Future for Princeton University Press. \u201cCasting the right voice is crucial,\u201d she says. \u201cGet it wrong and you can really turn the listener off.\u201d And non-fiction is even more demanding than fiction. \u201cIn a non-fiction book, the reader must understand and be interested in what they are reading, because comprehension can\u2019t be disguised with vocal tricks and the light and shade of characterisation. So in addition to actors, we work with a lot of broadcasters. They understand complex political or socio-economic subjects and instinctively know when, where, and how much stress to place on a particular point.\u201d The UK\u2019s leading audiobook retailer, Audible, whose customers downloaded more than 3bn hours of material last year, is getting into the \u201coriginal audiobook\u201d game, having commissioned the likes of Michael Lewis and Jon Ronson to write exclusive direct-to-audiobook stories or \u201cshortform books\u201d. One of their earliest signings was Philip Pullman, who in 2015 wrote a 32-minute short story set in the universe of His Dark Materials, \u201cThe Collectors\u201d, saying that he was attracted by \u201cthe idea of writing for a voice\u201d instead of a reader. (Audible itself explained that the idea was \u201cnot only a way to please current members, but also to bring in new listeners\u201d.) But if an \u201caudiobook\u201d was never a book in the first place, can it really be called a book? Surely it is just a rebadged radio drama, documentary, or podcast, even if it goes on to be bookified. (Pullman\u2019s \u201cThe Collectors\u201d subsequently came out as a Kindle Single.) Indeed, the surge in audiobook sales seems very likely to be a halo effect of the huge popularity of podcasts, especially the single-theme longform series such as NPR\u2019s breakout Serial, first released in October 2014, or ABC\u2019s 2019 The Dropout, a jaw-dropping investigation into the story of Elizabeth Holmes and her blood-testing tech company Theranos. If audiobooks are now gaining ground on print, does that indicate we are trying to do more in less time? Although the data suggests that we do not actually feel any more rushed or hurried than a few decades ago, the increasingly fragmented nature of our media consumption, and the perceived mountain of tasks ahead of us in any given day, might be driving people to try to cram in more nutritious brain-fare by multitasking: \u201creading\u201d an audiobook while doing something else. \u201cThe pessimist in me says that in our \u2018always on\u2019 world, the disinclination to read is not due to lack of desire, but lack of time,\u201d Howard says. Unfortunately, the science is quite clear that, apart perhaps for a small minority of people, we simply can\u2019t \u201cmultitask\u201d at all: when we think we are multitasking, we are really just switching attention from one thing to another in short bursts, a process that is in itself exhausting.

We want to see fees increase by the consumer price index (CPI) \u2013 the same index state pensions are linked to,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Another controversial issue is that, under the current laws, residents have to pay their site owner a commission of up to 10% of the sale price when they sell their park home. This has been hotly debated for years, with residents calling for the commission to be reduced or abolished, and site owners arguing for it to be maintained.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s unreasonable,\u201d says Turner. \u201cIf you\u2019ve spent \u00a325,000 improving the home so it\u2019s worth more, you\u2019ll end up paying 10% of the inflated price to the site owner.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cAlso, by the time you\u2019ve paid estate agent fees and removal costs and solicitors, the only thing you can afford is another park home. So you\u2019re effectively trapped.\u201d</p> <p>Being trapped is bad news for anyone who has bought a park home but now wants out.</p> <p>Says O\u2019Kelly: \u201cPark homes are like leasehold, but with some serious menace added to the mix: such as burning down or stealing the park home, or men turning up in middle of the night to howl abuse at \u2018troublemakers\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>A key issue in both the leasehold and park home sectors is that residents don\u2019t own the land their home is situated on, and critics say contracts are written in a way that allows landowners to exploit this power imbalance.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the park site owner must have both planning permission and the correct licence from the local authority for the site to be legal. You will need to live on a \u201cprotected\u201d site with a residential licence in order to live in your park home all year round \u2013 otherwise you may have to move out for several weeks of the year.</p> <p>Anyone thinking of buying a park home obviously needs to do their homework about the site and its owners. But even if you find one that is run by a credible operator, bear in mind that it may be sold on later.</p> <p>\u201cThe issue is that a lot of sites fall into the hands of rogue owners,\u201d says Turner. In October 2018, however, the government said a fit and proper person test would help remove \u201cunscrupulous and criminal site owners\u201d from the sector. It will also amend and clarify the definition of a pitch fee and prevent the use of variable service charges; change the pitch fee index from RPI to CPI; and look at whether the 10% sale commission should be changed.</p>",

This has been hotly debated for years, with residents calling for the commission to be reduced or abolished, and site owners arguing for it to be maintained. \u201cI think it\u2019s unreasonable,\u201d says Turner. \u201cIf you\u2019ve spent \u00a325,000 improving the home so it\u2019s worth more, you\u2019ll end up paying 10% of the inflated price to the site owner.\u201d He adds: \u201cAlso, by the time you\u2019ve paid estate agent fees and removal costs and solicitors, the only thing you can afford is another park home. So you\u2019re effectively trapped.\u201d Being trapped is bad news for anyone who has bought a park home but now wants out. Says O\u2019Kelly: \u201cPark homes are like leasehold, but with some serious menace added to the mix: such as burning down or stealing the park home, or men turning up in middle of the night to howl abuse at \u2018troublemakers\u2019.\u201d A key issue in both the leasehold and park home sectors is that residents don\u2019t own the land their home is situated on, and critics say contracts are written in a way that allows landowners to exploit this power imbalance. Meanwhile, the park site owner must have both planning permission and the correct licence from the local authority for the site to be legal. You will need to live on a \u201cprotected\u201d site with a residential licence in order to live in your park home all year round \u2013 otherwise you may have to move out for several weeks of the year. Anyone thinking of buying a park home obviously needs to do their homework about the site and its owners. But even if you find one that is run by a credible operator, bear in mind that it may be sold on later. \u201cThe issue is that a lot of sites fall into the hands of rogue owners,\u201d says Turner. In October 2018, however, the government said a fit and proper person test would help remove \u201cunscrupulous and criminal site owners\u201d from the sector. It will also amend and clarify the definition of a pitch fee and prevent the use of variable service charges; change the pitch fee index from RPI to CPI; and look at whether the 10% sale commission should be changed.",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s National Crime Agency and the Financial Conduct Authority have been called on to investigate allegations that bank workers faked signatures on court documents to recover debts and repossess homes. MPs on the Commons Treasury select committee have written to the two bodies to request they review evidence gathered by campaigners. In February this year, Guardian Money revealed allegations from the Bank Signature Forgery Campaign, which alleges that a multibillion-dollar scandal that played out in the US is being repeated in the UK. The central allegation is that signatures on court documents have not been signed by the person whose printed name appears under the statement of truth. Banks are allegedly linked to documents with questionable signatures. In some cases, people were evicted as a result. It is claimed that some employees at law firms acting on behalf of banks or their representatives may have faked them to speed up the legal process. Last month, Treasury committee member Steve Baker MP said: \u201cI have been shown various signatures that demonstrate that it is clearly the case that within some institutions, processes are taking place where it appears that anyone is signing these documents. Whether or not the repossession is justified, it does seem that is therefore a fraudulent transaction.\u201d The committee chair, Nicky Morgan, wants the NCA and FCA to review evidence gathered by campaigners and carry out further probes if necessary.

      "body": "<p>When Zoey Goto drops her two-year-old daughter off at nursery in the morning, she has an enviable commute to work. For freelance journalist Goto is at her desk and opening up her laptop in under two minutes. The reason? Goto, 39, works from central London-based Cuckooz Nest, which doubles up as a co-working space and a creche, offering 36 desks for the adults and a nursery capacity of 18.</p> <p>Stocked up with toys and books and featuring a dress-up section and a breastfeeding room, Cuckooz Nest, located in Clerkenwell, opened in 2018 and allows parents to book desk space and qualified childcare on a flexible pay-as-you-go basis starting from \u00a314 an hour, or \u00a312 per hour as part of a monthly membership with a minimum commitment of eight hours a week.</p> <p>Goto visits the workspace three mornings a week through an eight-hour package which costs her \u00a38.64 an hour after applying a 10% Islington resident discount and a further 20% off through the government\u2019s tax-free childcare scheme (see right).</p> <p>For Goto, who also has a seven-year-old daughter, this hybrid model has provided a greater level of flexibility. \u201cIn the past I used traditional nurseries with set times, and it worked out fine as I was writing a book and was in charge of my own times. But now the bulk of my work is journalism, and I need to be able to respond to commissions that come in and be more flexible. Now I can accept writing commissions with short deadlines, which had always been a problem in the past.

For example, a single parent with a young child can spend up to half of their disposable income on childcare costs, even once they are claiming government support. Families are left with few choices if they can\u2019t find childcare they can afford: some rely on friends and family, but others will find they simply cannot afford to work. These costs are really hitting families.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, the rise of technology has led to a surge in the number of freelancers, with self-employed workers increasing from 3.3 million in 2001 to 4.8 million in 2017, according to the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/trendsinselfemploymentintheuk/2018-02-07.\">Office for National Statistics</a>. As a result, co-working has become increasingly popular - the number of global co-working spaces reached 14,411 in 2017 and is expected to jump to 30,000 by 2022, according to the <a href=\"http://usa.gcuc.co/2018-global-coworking-forecast-30432-spaces-5-1-million-members-2022/\">Global Coworking Unconference Conference</a>.

      "bodyText": "When Zoey Goto drops her two-year-old daughter off at nursery in the morning, she has an enviable commute to work. For freelance journalist Goto is at her desk and opening up her laptop in under two minutes. The reason? Goto, 39, works from central London-based Cuckooz Nest, which doubles up as a co-working space and a creche, offering 36 desks for the adults and a nursery capacity of 18. Stocked up with toys and books and featuring a dress-up section and a breastfeeding room, Cuckooz Nest, located in Clerkenwell, opened in 2018 and allows parents to book desk space and qualified childcare on a flexible pay-as-you-go basis starting from \u00a314 an hour, or \u00a312 per hour as part of a monthly membership with a minimum commitment of eight hours a week. Goto visits the workspace three mornings a week through an eight-hour package which costs her \u00a38.64 an hour after applying a 10% Islington resident discount and a further 20% off through the government\u2019s tax-free childcare scheme (see right). For Goto, who also has a seven-year-old daughter, this hybrid model has provided a greater level of flexibility. \u201cIn the past I used traditional nurseries with set times, and it worked out fine as I was writing a book and was in charge of my own times. But now the bulk of my work is journalism, and I need to be able to respond to commissions that come in and be more flexible. Now I can accept writing commissions with short deadlines, which had always been a problem in the past. If I get a commission with a deadline in two days\u2019 time, I can accept.\u201d On top of the flexibility - highly desirable for a freelancer - is the money it has saved her. \u201cIt\u2019s loads cheaper, as the going rate around here seems to be \u00a312 to \u00a314 an hour for a nursery space alone.

      "body": "<p>They\u2019re a classic British pub snack and a perfect pairing with a pint. Now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/14/pork-scratchings-nutritionally-worse-food\">pork scratchings</a> are the latest unlikely foodstuff to get a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/veganism\">vegan</a> makeover.</p> <p>The new-style snack \u2013 made by startup brand Vegan Pig in what it claims is a UK first \u2013 is made with soya and has what resembles crispy skin edged with softer fat, but without the ick factor of the occasional strand of hair poking out.</p> <p>The scratchings are expected to go on sale in independent pubs in the autumn.</p> <p>The product was devised by <a href=\"https://www.seanandjosh.co.uk/\">Josh Pearce and Sean Johnson</a>, whose backgrounds are in advertising and marketing.</p> <p>Pearce said: \u201cA couple of years ago, when we were in a pub sharing a particularly dirty pack of pork scratchings, we wondered how close we could get to a scratching using only plant-based ingredients.\u201d</p> <p>To make the vegan scratchings, soya pieces are flash fried and seasoned with a vegan spice mix.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a is dirty meat substitute that tastes like it\u2019s going to be bad for you, but isn\u2019t actually that bad at all,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cIt even has a dual texture so you have both the softer \u2018fat\u2019 bit you get in a scratching, as well as the crunchy \u2018skin\u2019 layer.\u201d</p> <p>The product differs from one on sale in the US, Rico\u2019s Vegetal Skins, which has a single texture, Johnson said.</p> <p>Neither he nor Pearce are vegan, but are among the UK\u2019s growing band of \u201cflexitarians\u201d who are trying to cut down on the amount of meat they eat, for a variety of reasons including concerns over their health, animal welfare and the environment. </p> <p>Luke McLaughlin, owner of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/14/spread-eagle-hackney-vegan-meat-free-food\">the vegan Spread Eagle pub</a> in Homerton in east London, said: \u201cTraditional bar snacks are essential in any good boozer. We currently serve nuts and specially sourced vegan crisps. Vegan pork scratchings would make an interesting offering \u2026 if the demand is there there\u2019s no reason not to stock them.\u201d</p> <p>The UK market has recently been flooded with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/13/shiitake-bacon-carrot-salmon-soya-calamari-vegan-meat-taste-test\">faux meat</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/13/shiitake-bacon-carrot-salmon-soya-calamari-vegan-meat-taste-test\"> products</a> such as vegan replicas of burgers, steaks, sausage rolls and chicken.</p> <p>This week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/morrisons\">Morrisons</a> launched a vegan version of a Cornish pasty. Created using a vegan mince which mimics the meaty taste and texture, the so-called \u201cCorn-ish\u201d pasty also contains the traditional seasoned mix of potato, swede and onion inside crimped rough-puff flaky pastry.</p> <h2>Taste test</h2> <p>Having once tasted vegan steaks made out of soy protein \u2013 like eating slabs of salty plasticine \u2013 my hopes were not high for these cracklings (\u201ccontains: soya, gluten and sulphites\u201d, says the packaging, deliciously). I\u2019m all for cutting down on meat intake, but there are some things that surely can\u2019t be replicated. Would it really be possible to reproduce the crackly exterior, the unsettling fatty ooze in the middle and that occasional bit of hair growing out of the side? </p> <p>And yet \u2026 these weren\u2019t too bad. Crispy, salty and with a flavouring similar to that pub standard Smiths Bacon Fries, they were more like wheaty crisps than actual pork but, hey, who doesn\u2019t like crisps? There was none of the meaty depth you get with real scratchings, nor the gooey fat \u2013 this wouldn\u2019t fool a connoisseur. But given that the only acceptable time to eat pork scratchings is around 10pm after at least four pints of beer, there\u2019s a good chance some of us would never even notice.<br><strong>Tim Jonze</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "They\u2019re a classic British pub snack and a perfect pairing with a pint. Now pork scratchings are the latest unlikely foodstuff to get a vegan makeover. The new-style snack \u2013 made by startup brand Vegan Pig in what it claims is a UK first \u2013 is made with soya and has what resembles crispy skin edged with softer fat, but without the ick factor of the occasional strand of hair poking out. The scratchings are expected to go on sale in independent pubs in the autumn. The product was devised by Josh Pearce and Sean Johnson, whose backgrounds are in advertising and marketing. Pearce said: \u201cA couple of years ago, when we were in a pub sharing a particularly dirty pack of pork scratchings, we wondered how close we could get to a scratching using only plant-based ingredients.\u201d To make the vegan scratchings, soya pieces are flash fried and seasoned with a vegan spice mix. \u201cIt is a is dirty meat substitute that tastes like it\u2019s going to be bad for you, but isn\u2019t actually that bad at all,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cIt even has a dual texture so you have both the softer \u2018fat\u2019 bit you get in a scratching, as well as the crunchy \u2018skin\u2019 layer.\u201d The product differs from one on sale in the US, Rico\u2019s Vegetal Skins, which has a single texture, Johnson said. Neither he nor Pearce are vegan, but are among the UK\u2019s growing band of \u201cflexitarians\u201d who are trying to cut down on the amount of meat they eat, for a variety of reasons including concerns over their health, animal welfare and the environment. Luke McLaughlin, owner of the vegan Spread Eagle pub in Homerton in east London, said: \u201cTraditional bar snacks are essential in any good boozer. We currently serve nuts and specially sourced vegan crisps. Vegan pork scratchings would make an interesting offering \u2026 if the demand is there there\u2019s no reason not to stock them.\u201d The UK market has recently been flooded with faux meat products such as vegan replicas of burgers, steaks, sausage rolls and chicken. This week Morrisons launched a vegan version of a Cornish pasty. Created using a vegan mince which mimics the meaty taste and texture, the so-called \u201cCorn-ish\u201d pasty also contains the traditional seasoned mix of potato, swede and onion inside crimped rough-puff flaky pastry. Taste test Having once tasted vegan steaks made out of soy protein \u2013 like eating slabs of salty plasticine \u2013 my hopes were not high for these cracklings (\u201ccontains: soya, gluten and sulphites\u201d, says the packaging, deliciously). I\u2019m all for cutting down on meat intake, but there are some things that surely can\u2019t be replicated. Would it really be possible to reproduce the crackly exterior, the unsettling fatty ooze in the middle and that occasional bit of hair growing out of the side? And yet \u2026 these weren\u2019t too bad. Crispy, salty and with a flavouring similar to that pub standard Smiths Bacon Fries, they were more like wheaty crisps than actual pork but, hey, who doesn\u2019t like crisps? There was none of the meaty depth you get with real scratchings, nor the gooey fat \u2013 this wouldn\u2019t fool a connoisseur. But given that the only acceptable time to eat pork scratchings is around 10pm after at least four pints of beer, there\u2019s a good chance some of us would never even notice. Tim Jonze",

Her buyers failed to order enough stock for a collection promoted by TV presenter Holly Willoughby, which meant it quickly sold out leaving the retailer with empty rails in its stores for almost a month. The mistake led to what M&amp;S\u2019s overall boss, Steve Rowe, damningly described as the poorest stock levels \u201cI have ever seen in my life\u201d.</p> <p>But there is likely to be more to it than that. Getting clothing stocks \u201cjust right\u201d is the Goldilocks\u2019 judgment retail buying teams are tasked with day-in, day out. Over the last decade M&amp;S\u2019s tastemakers appear to have lost their ability to tell clothing hits from misses with buyers instead spreading their bets on a large number of styles, rather than putting the chain\u2019s massive buying power behind potential blockbusters.</p> <p>Getting sums wrong often result in frank boardroom exchanges without people getting sacked though. As one former M&amp;S executive recalled of the retailer\u2019s former chief executive: \u201cStuart Rose used to say: \u2018Fantastic that it\u2019s sold out\u2026 Why the fuck is it sold out?\u2019\u201d The former M&amp;S staffer added: \u201cIt\u2019s about trading.

In this year\u2019s annual report, Norman pointed to \u201ca siloed, slow and hierarchical culture that has proved resistant to change\u201d.Until he arrived, he said, the chain had lost touch with what it stood for a generation ago and that had held back attempts to overhaul the business.</p> <p>M&amp;S remains the biggest seller of clothes in the UK but it is a title waiting to be snatched by either Next or Primark, which is biting at its heels. M&amp;S\u2019s share of the clothing market has fallen from 10.6% in 2004 to an estimated 7% this year, according to retail data firm GlobalData, as inertia within its management let in rivals to steal its shoppers.</p> <p>The appointment of McDonald always worried fashion experts. She had never worked in the clothing industry before but was chief executive at Halfords and before that at fast-food chain McDonald\u2019s.</p> <p>The former staffer suggested it would have been a \u201cmiracle\u201d if McDonald had succeeded: \u201cIt is a massive, 24/7 job and and you don\u2019t have time to learn it.

      "bodyText": "The sacking of Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s clothing supremo this week ensured Jill McDonald became the first high-profile casualty of a more ruthless regime determined to prevent oblivion for the 135-year-old chain. McDonald\u2019s departure was blamed on what was referred to as \u201cjeansgate\u201d within M&amp;S. Her buyers failed to order enough stock for a collection promoted by TV presenter Holly Willoughby, which meant it quickly sold out leaving the retailer with empty rails in its stores for almost a month. The mistake led to what M&amp;S\u2019s overall boss, Steve Rowe, damningly described as the poorest stock levels \u201cI have ever seen in my life\u201d. But there is likely to be more to it than that. Getting clothing stocks \u201cjust right\u201d is the Goldilocks\u2019 judgment retail buying teams are tasked with day-in, day out. Over the last decade M&amp;S\u2019s tastemakers appear to have lost their ability to tell clothing hits from misses with buyers instead spreading their bets on a large number of styles, rather than putting the chain\u2019s massive buying power behind potential blockbusters. Getting sums wrong often result in frank boardroom exchanges without people getting sacked though. As one former M&amp;S executive recalled of the retailer\u2019s former chief executive: \u201cStuart Rose used to say: \u2018Fantastic that it\u2019s sold out\u2026 Why the fuck is it sold out?\u2019\u201d The former M&amp;S staffer added: \u201cIt\u2019s about trading. You can be proud for about a second but then it\u2019s about how you get back in.\u201d McDonald\u2019s departure is a sign that the company\u2019s hands-on part-time chairman Archie Norman is taking no prisoners after staking his reputation on turning around the chain, where the share price has sunk so low it is at risk of being booted out of the FTSE 100. At this week\u2019s AGM he was notably more enthusiastic about the work being done by Stuart Machin \u2013 a former colleague of Norman\u2019s from Asda, who the chairman parachuted in to lead the food division \u2013 than by McDonald, for whom the writing was already on the wall. But with less than two years in the job, the odds were stacked against McDonald leading a revolution. In this year\u2019s annual report, Norman pointed to \u201ca siloed, slow and hierarchical culture that has proved resistant to change\u201d.Until he arrived, he said, the chain had lost touch with what it stood for a generation ago and that had held back attempts to overhaul the business. M&amp;S remains the biggest seller of clothes in the UK but it is a title waiting to be snatched by either Next or Primark, which is biting at its heels. M&amp;S\u2019s share of the clothing market has fallen from 10.6% in 2004 to an estimated 7% this year, according to retail data firm GlobalData, as inertia within its management let in rivals to steal its shoppers. The appointment of McDonald always worried fashion experts. She had never worked in the clothing industry before but was chief executive at Halfords and before that at fast-food chain McDonald\u2019s. The former staffer suggested it would have been a \u201cmiracle\u201d if McDonald had succeeded: \u201cIt is a massive, 24/7 job and and you don\u2019t have time to learn it. There\u2019s so much you have got to already know. I struggle to understand how you could put someone with no fashion experience into such a senior role which is a heavily exposed role when it comes to delivery.\u201d Buying, they add, is something that becomes instinctive: \u201cYou know if you have got something right. It\u2019s about being excited about a product before you put a number to it and then backing it.\u201d Maureen Hinton, global research director at GlobalData, said McDonald struck her as pragmatic and capable but \u201cto really get a clothing business off the ground takes an inspirational leader\u201d. The job was made harder, Hinton said, by M&amp;S\u2019s increasing focus on food \u2013 it is paying \u00a3750m for a 50% share in Ocado\u2019s retail arm \u2013 at a time when it is also retreating from the high street. \u201cM&amp;S is cutting down the space for clothing while it is very difficult on the high street,\u201d said Hinton, who suggested it was no longer a destination for middle-aged shoppers: \u201cIf you have got fewer stores there is less reason to go there.\u201d Hinton said that anyone in the clothing job faced the difficulty of working with its forthright chairman who appeared to have a \u201cvery strong opinion on everything\u201d. Rowe has now taken charge of running the clothing business, a role that will put him right under Norman\u2019s nose. When Norman joined back in 2017 he laid it on thick, stating the company had been \u201cdrifting\u201d for more than 15 years. Last year, he upped the ante by warning the business was \u201con a burning platform\u201d. He said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a God-given right to exist and unless we change \u2026 in decades to come there will be no M&amp;S.\u201d This existential threat perhaps explains why the board were unwilling to give McDonald more time. Simon Irwin, retail analyst at Credit Suisse, says M&amp;S\u2019s stock problems were linked to long-term difficulties with its supply chain. It is still heavily reliant on buying clothes many months in advance, making it hard to re-stock bestsellers or slot in high fashion items when needed: \u201cM&amp;S is never going to become Zara overnight but it does need to introduce more flexibility and reactivity into the business.\u201d The sharp decline in M&amp;S\u2019s clothing market share is a consequence of changes in shopping habits which mean that having a store in a local suburb or town can no longer guarantee market share. Shoppers have more choice, either through the internet or by travelling to big malls or city centres. \u201cThe whole point of bringing in someone like Jill McDonald was that she came from modern differentiated businesses which would help her say \u2018we can do this differently\u2019,\u201d added Irwin. \u201cShe was brought in to change business practice, not to be a great clothing guru, and probably where she has gone wrong is not being able to change those practices fast enough.\u201d",

But Glen Tooke, an analyst at market research firm Kantar, says it takes the general public a long time to embrace such out-there trends: \u201cIt\u2019s about people becoming brave enough to wear them.\u201d Kate Moss helped birth the skinny jeans phenomenon, being regularly snapped in a pair of faded grey skinnies in the early noughties. By 2005, Topshop, which was then at the height of its powers, was shifting nearly 20,000 pairs a week of its tight-fitting Baxter jeans. Jeans are big business for UK retailers: shoppers will buy around 87m pairs this year, shelling out close to \u00a31.6bn. And while Gucci commands nearly \u00a31,000 for a pair of printed denim skinnies, the average price paid is just \u00a318. Having the right styles, in the right size, is a cutthroat business. This week Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s clothing boss Jill McDonald lost her job in part for presiding over what has been dubbed \u201cJeansgate\u201d. M&amp;S sells more jeans than any other UK retailer, shifting 570 pairs an hour every day of the year \u2013 around 5m pairs in total. But McDonald failed to buy enough stock for a collection promoted by TV presenter Holly Willoughby, so it sold out \u2013 resulting in empty rails in store for almost a month. Lorna Hall, WGSN\u2019s retail director, said the sheer success of skinny jeans meant they had moved beyond being a trend: \u201cSomething as big as the skinny jeans is not a trend, it\u2019s a wardrobe staple. It will still exist in our wardrobes, but there are now a lot of people buying into other styles.\u201d The Lyst report also confirms that white jeans \u2013 famously the uniform of Liz Hurley in the 90s \u2013 are back. Sales of white denims almost surpassed those of blue jeans for the first time in the last week of May, with searches up 42% since the beginning of March. But a closer look at the actual shopping behaviour of Britons shows a reluctance to jettison the skinnies just yet. One in two pairs of jeans bought in the UK is still a skinny fit, according to Kantar analysis of the most popular jeans styles bought this spring, with just one in three slim or straight-legged. M&amp;S says its \u00a319.50 Ivy skinnies and \u00a315 super-skinny jeggings are still bestsellers. And it is not just a women thing: the ripped young men in this year\u2019s Love Island TV show \u2013 like Anton Danyluk and Michael Griffiths \u2013 have been sporting super-tight ankle-length skinnies, despite the midsummer Mediterranean heat. Tooke reckons it is tough to forecast whether the new looks will ever be as big as skinnies: \u201cThe jeans in the fashion pages make up just a third of all jeans bought \u2013 the rest are either regular or skinny,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are lots of micro-trends that never make it to the mainstream. It\u2019s hard to predict whether in two months no one will be talking about asymmetric jeans \u2013 or in two years if we will all be wearing them.\u201d",

Our two children don\u2019t seem to have noticed, thankfully; we\u2019ve got a kite, buckets and spades, a picnic and our very own beach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"986656284e52c6f8ab9a3e964bf0617d40579293\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/986656284e52c6f8ab9a3e964bf0617d40579293/0_0_1526_1048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brittany map\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is Brittany\u2019s Emerald Coast \u2013 so close to the UK, yet it feels a world away. Its chic belle \u00e9poque resorts provide a sophisticated seaside vibe, while further west the sweeping beaches and heather-strewn headlands offer a place to get closer to nature and admire the green water that gives this stretch of coastline its name. At Mont Saint-Michel, 50 miles to the east, the famously strong tides mean the sea retreats for huge distances and the same is true here. The spot in which I\u2019d paddled hours earlier is now just ripples of sand dotted with cockle shells, while the sea is fast disappearing towards the horizon.</p> <p>Taking this as our cue to explore, we wend our way up through timber-framed and turreted villas to Pointe de la Garde, the headland that juts out at the southern end of the beach. As we teeter along the narrow paths to a rocky outcrop, a superb panorama spreads out before us: to the northwest, a bird\u2019s eye view of our beach, the vast white sand below us in a soft haze; on the other side, mussel beds, their black poles standing neatly to attention, and more headlands jutting out into the sea \u2013 it\u2019s hard to tell if they\u2019re islands or mainland.

The walk there via a winding sandy path is busy with tourists (so this is where they all are) but the sight of the 700-year-old castle is worth sharing. After a few centuries and some starring roles in various wars, the fort fell into disrepair and in the 1930s was bought by the Jo\u00fcon des Longrais family, whose descendants still own it and live here seven months of the year (retreating to Rennes when the wild winter winds get too much). With its drawbridge, turreted tower and portcullis, it\u2019s the children\u2019s perfect specimen. We duck into the dark tower, then climb the precarious narrow steps up on to its roof.

The main street is buzzing to the soundtrack of an acoustic band playing an early evening set on a bar\u2019s terrace, and we walk past restaurants and vintage bric-a-brac shops towards the Plage du Bechet. Tucked under the hilltop town, the crescent-shaped beach is backed by blue-doored beach huts and overlooks neat lines of small boats resting on the mudflats, while a sinuous creek meanders through the sand past the Chateau de Nessay, a turreted red-stone castle hotel, surrounded by pines on its own little promontory.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re sitting on an empty beach, a wide sweep of white sand overlooking the emerald sea, and we can\u2019t quite believe we have it all to ourselves. Had we flown to far-flung shores and taken a boat to a remote island, it would be understandable, but all we\u2019ve done is disembark from the ferry at Saint-Malo and driven west for an hour. \u201cWhere is everybody?\u201d wonders my husband, digging his toes into fine sand. \u201cLooking for ice-cream, I expect,\u201d I reply quietly, so as not to draw the kids\u2019 attention to the fact that here at Saint-Cast-le-Guildo, there isn\u2019t a kiosk, souvenir shop or arcade to be seen on the sleepy seafront \u2013 just a line of elegant grey stone villas with a sensational view. Our two children don\u2019t seem to have noticed, thankfully; we\u2019ve got a kite, buckets and spades, a picnic and our very own beach. This is Brittany\u2019s Emerald Coast \u2013 so close to the UK, yet it feels a world away. Its chic belle \u00e9poque resorts provide a sophisticated seaside vibe, while further west the sweeping beaches and heather-strewn headlands offer a place to get closer to nature and admire the green water that gives this stretch of coastline its name. At Mont Saint-Michel, 50 miles to the east, the famously strong tides mean the sea retreats for huge distances and the same is true here. The spot in which I\u2019d paddled hours earlier is now just ripples of sand dotted with cockle shells, while the sea is fast disappearing towards the horizon. Taking this as our cue to explore, we wend our way up through timber-framed and turreted villas to Pointe de la Garde, the headland that juts out at the southern end of the beach. As we teeter along the narrow paths to a rocky outcrop, a superb panorama spreads out before us: to the northwest, a bird\u2019s eye view of our beach, the vast white sand below us in a soft haze; on the other side, mussel beds, their black poles standing neatly to attention, and more headlands jutting out into the sea \u2013 it\u2019s hard to tell if they\u2019re islands or mainland. Beyond are the elegant resorts of Saint-Briac-sur-Mer and Saint-Lunaire. The next day, we head northwest to Fort la Latte, a mighty medieval castle that clings to the cliffs of Cap Fr\u00e9hel. The walk there via a winding sandy path is busy with tourists (so this is where they all are) but the sight of the 700-year-old castle is worth sharing. After a few centuries and some starring roles in various wars, the fort fell into disrepair and in the 1930s was bought by the Jo\u00fcon des Longrais family, whose descendants still own it and live here seven months of the year (retreating to Rennes when the wild winter winds get too much). With its drawbridge, turreted tower and portcullis, it\u2019s the children\u2019s perfect specimen. We duck into the dark tower, then climb the precarious narrow steps up on to its roof. Castle locations don\u2019t come any better, especially if your enemy is English. On the way back to our hotel near Sables-d\u2019Or-les-Pins, we spot an alluring cove among the pine trees and pull in where a sign points to Plage de l\u2019Anse du Croc.

Others had to borrow money from the DfE\u2019s funding arm, throwing into question their long-term viability.</p> <p>Research by the Price Bailey accountancy firm disclosed to the Guardian reveals that 31 out of 40 UTCs with published accounts owe money to the DfE\u2019s education and skills funding agency (ESFA), including 25 schools owing a total of \u00a38.6m after educating fewer pupils than they received funding for through their general annual grant.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/oct/11/university-technical-colleges-schools-report-education-policy-institute\">Half of university technical college students drop out, report finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a result, UTCs face an uncertain future, despite many being housed in brand-new buildings, including modern science and engineering facilities intended for the surge of pupils who never arrived.</p> <p>\u201cEight UTCs have already closed and two further closures are imminent, so unless UTCs can boost pupil numbers and performance, more will follow,\u201d said Gary Miller, the head of education at Price Bailey.</p> <p>\u201cUTCs with tight cashflow could be seriously affected by these clawbacks. After salaries, which often make up 70%-80% of the budget, there isn\u2019t a lot left. \u00a3350,000 per school is the equivalent to seven or eight teachers, so in some cases cuts to staff numbers may be necessary, which could impact educational standards.\u201d</p> <p>Wigan UTC is the latest to announce its closure. Parents were told that the decision to shutter the school had been approved by DfE chiefs in June.</p> <p>\u201cThe decision to close Wigan UTC has been taken as the UTC is financially unviable. The UTC has been unable to recruit sufficient students to operate without a growing deficit, which will severely hamper the quality of education it can provide moving forward,\u201d the school told parents.</p> <p>Wigan\u2019s closure follows those of Black Country UTC, in Walsall, which attracted just 158 students out of a planned 480, and Burnley UTC, which was expecting 800 students but enrolled only 113 in the three years it was open. Analysis by Schools Week found that <a href=\"https://schoolsweek.co.uk/dfe-spent-115m-on-doomed-free-schools-utcs-and-studio-schools/\">\u00a364m was spent on eight UTCs</a> that have closed.</p> <p>The difficulties experienced by UTCs are part of a wider trend of schools having to return overpayments to the ESFA, usually because of lower than expected pupil numbers. In 2016-17, just three academies in England had to return funds to the DfE, but in 2017-18 that figure rose to 50 academies, including UTCs, with nearly \u00a34m returned, according to a freedom of information response.</p> <p>Price Bailey said it had analysed the accounts of 40 of the 50 UTCs operating last year and found that only nine were operating within their budgets, with 31 recording deficits and one or more outstanding debts to the DfE, including 10 owing nearly \u00a34.7m in general loans to cover running costs and three with working capital loans adding up to nearly \u00a31m.</p> <p>Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said she was concerned that the financial struggles of UTCs were \u201cbeing hidden in the government\u2019s opaque academies system, with figures concealed from parents and the public\u201d. She said: \u201cToo much money is being wasted on ministers\u2019 vanity projects, and the education system is being fragmented in the process. Labour will end the academy programme and ensure schools are properly accountable, and invest in an integrated education system through our national education service.\u201d</p> <p>As part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/10/gove-lunatic-raid-free-schools\">Michael Gove\u2019s free schools revolution,</a> UTCs were meant to provide specialist education in science, maths and technology subjects, and attract university and industry backing. But the decision to admit students only from the age of 14 meant that they struggled to compete with secondary schools taking pupils from the age of 12.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem with brand-new schools, particularly specialist UTCs, is that they are not tried and tested, which can make parents and pupils wary. Faced with a choice between a new UTC with little or no track record and the local school, which might have served a community for generations, the latter often wins out,\u201d said Miller.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://epi.org.uk/publications-and-research/utcs/\">report by the Education Policy Institute</a> (EPI) found that UTC pupils\u2019 GCSE results were almost a grade lower than similar students at mainstream schools, with the most able students doing even worse. The EPI also found that more than half of UTC students left after taking GCSEs.</p> <p>But while many have struggled, <a href=\"https://www.utcreading.co.uk/\">UTC Reading</a> has thrived and is now oversubscribed, having been given an outstanding rating by Ofsted in 2015 and boasting partnerships with Microsoft. Others have been less successful, with five rated as inadequate by Ofsted.</p> <p>A DfE spokesperson said UTCs remained a \u201ckey part\u201d of its efforts to improve educational standards. \u201cFunding that is provided to set up new university technical colleges is based on estimates of pupil numbers. Once the school or university technical opens, this funding is then adjusted to reflect actual figures and, where necessary, we work with the institutions to recover funding.<br><br>\u201cThe department continues to support UTCs to be educationally successful and financially viable,\u201d the DfE said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Part of the government\u2019s flagship free schools programme is facing mounting financial difficulties because of its unpopularity with parents and pupils, with schools forced to pay back millions of pounds to the Department for Education and cut staff after failing to attract and retain students. University technical colleges (UTCs), a type of free school in England that was launched in 2010, ran up debts of \u00a314m last year after many fell short of their forecasts for pupil numbers. Others had to borrow money from the DfE\u2019s funding arm, throwing into question their long-term viability. Research by the Price Bailey accountancy firm disclosed to the Guardian reveals that 31 out of 40 UTCs with published accounts owe money to the DfE\u2019s education and skills funding agency (ESFA), including 25 schools owing a total of \u00a38.6m after educating fewer pupils than they received funding for through their general annual grant. As a result, UTCs face an uncertain future, despite many being housed in brand-new buildings, including modern science and engineering facilities intended for the surge of pupils who never arrived. \u201cEight UTCs have already closed and two further closures are imminent, so unless UTCs can boost pupil numbers and performance, more will follow,\u201d said Gary Miller, the head of education at Price Bailey. \u201cUTCs with tight cashflow could be seriously affected by these clawbacks. After salaries, which often make up 70%-80% of the budget, there isn\u2019t a lot left. \u00a3350,000 per school is the equivalent to seven or eight teachers, so in some cases cuts to staff numbers may be necessary, which could impact educational standards.\u201d Wigan UTC is the latest to announce its closure. Parents were told that the decision to shutter the school had been approved by DfE chiefs in June. \u201cThe decision to close Wigan UTC has been taken as the UTC is financially unviable. The UTC has been unable to recruit sufficient students to operate without a growing deficit, which will severely hamper the quality of education it can provide moving forward,\u201d the school told parents. Wigan\u2019s closure follows those of Black Country UTC, in Walsall, which attracted just 158 students out of a planned 480, and Burnley UTC, which was expecting 800 students but enrolled only 113 in the three years it was open. Analysis by Schools Week found that \u00a364m was spent on eight UTCs that have closed. The difficulties experienced by UTCs are part of a wider trend of schools having to return overpayments to the ESFA, usually because of lower than expected pupil numbers. In 2016-17, just three academies in England had to return funds to the DfE, but in 2017-18 that figure rose to 50 academies, including UTCs, with nearly \u00a34m returned, according to a freedom of information response. Price Bailey said it had analysed the accounts of 40 of the 50 UTCs operating last year and found that only nine were operating within their budgets, with 31 recording deficits and one or more outstanding debts to the DfE, including 10 owing nearly \u00a34.7m in general loans to cover running costs and three with working capital loans adding up to nearly \u00a31m. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said she was concerned that the financial struggles of UTCs were \u201cbeing hidden in the government\u2019s opaque academies system, with figures concealed from parents and the public\u201d. She said: \u201cToo much money is being wasted on ministers\u2019 vanity projects, and the education system is being fragmented in the process. Labour will end the academy programme and ensure schools are properly accountable, and invest in an integrated education system through our national education service.\u201d As part of Michael Gove\u2019s free schools revolution, UTCs were meant to provide specialist education in science, maths and technology subjects, and attract university and industry backing. But the decision to admit students only from the age of 14 meant that they struggled to compete with secondary schools taking pupils from the age of 12. \u201cThe problem with brand-new schools, particularly specialist UTCs, is that they are not tried and tested, which can make parents and pupils wary. Faced with a choice between a new UTC with little or no track record and the local school, which might have served a community for generations, the latter often wins out,\u201d said Miller. A report by the Education Policy Institute (EPI) found that UTC pupils\u2019 GCSE results were almost a grade lower than similar students at mainstream schools, with the most able students doing even worse. The EPI also found that more than half of UTC students left after taking GCSEs. But while many have struggled, UTC Reading has thrived and is now oversubscribed, having been given an outstanding rating by Ofsted in 2015 and boasting partnerships with Microsoft. Others have been less successful, with five rated as inadequate by Ofsted. A DfE spokesperson said UTCs remained a \u201ckey part\u201d of its efforts to improve educational standards. \u201cFunding that is provided to set up new university technical colleges is based on estimates of pupil numbers. Once the school or university technical opens, this funding is then adjusted to reflect actual figures and, where necessary, we work with the institutions to recover funding. \u201cThe department continues to support UTCs to be educationally successful and financially viable,\u201d the DfE said.",

Don\u2019t you ever leave him alone, Trevor? \u201cDoes he ever leave <em>us</em> alone?\u201d Noah rejoinders.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve made many episodes that don\u2019t mention Trump at all. But we are a satirical news show, and satire works best when it has a target.\u201d Does he ever dream of making <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jun/18/late-night-hosts-trevor-noah-stephen-colbert-seth-meyers\">The Daily Show</a> in the Obama era? \u201cOh, definitely. But I don\u2019t know what that world would have been like. I came from South Africa, where our politics and some of our politicians are very reminiscent of Donald Trump. So in a weird way this is the only politics I know.\u201d</p> <p>Noah\u2019s backstory has been well rehearsed \u2013 not least because he made a standup show out of it, which toured globally, then turned it into a book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/25/born-a-crime-trevor-noah-south-africa-townships-daily-show\">Born a Crime</a>. (He\u2019s recently released a young adult version.) The son of a black African secretary and a white German Swiss expat, Noah was born in 1984 under apartheid, which criminalised interracial sex. On the one hand, his existence was a crime; on the other, he was technically a superior citizen to his own mother, and was called \u201cmaster\u201d \u2013 as a joke \u2013 by his grandfather.</p> <p>His childhood in Soweto sounds Dickensian in its violence and poverty. His mum was shot by her abusive partner (she survived); young Trevor ate caterpillars and dog food to survive. And yet, Noah emerged from it all an optimist \u2013 partly a function, he has said, of being treated as special because he was half-white. His breakthrough standup show, That\u2019s Racist, was striking for its lack of anger about the life he\u2019d been forced to lead. To this day, the criticism he attracts as The Daily Show\u2019s host is that he\u2019s insufficiently political \u2013 too blandly upbeat, not fuelled by Stewart-grade levels of righteous anger.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhudLaRgQtI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BhudLaRgQtI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Noah was a DJ and hawker of homemade CDs before he first saw standup, and \u2013 responding to a challenge \u2013 gave it a go himself. \u201cThe initial attitude towards him from other South African comedians was just confusion,\u201d says Schalk Bezuidenhout, a younger compatriot who has opened for Noah at homecoming gigs.</p> <p>\u201cHe was such a complete anomaly \u2013 and still is. He was able to do a one-man show really early in his career. Then he\u2019d write a brand new show annually and tour it nationwide. We hadn\u2019t seen that in this country: someone that writes at such a drastic pace and so well. He was just a natural, right from the beginning. Everyone was like: who is this guy, where has he come from, and how is this possible?\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just that Noah wrote fast and well, but that he wrote topically. \u201cWhere most comedians would have a few lines about \u2018this thing happened in the news\u2019, Trevor would do 10, 20 minutes on it, the night it happened,\u201d says Bezuidenhout. \u201cBut it would be so polished, like a gag he\u2019d been doing for years.\u201d</p> <p>Those who saw Noah\u2019s 2018 gig at London\u2019s O2 can back this up. It took place on the day of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/19/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-marry-as-millions-watch-on\">Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding to Prince Harry</a> \u2013 and Noah wrung a big-hitting 20 minutes out of the day\u2019s events, right at the top of his show.</p> <p>The more I talk to Noah, however, the more apparent is the difference between his agenda and (what was assumed to be) his predecessor\u2019s. \u201cWhat makes satire great,\u201d says Noah, \u201cis that you can speak about issues people don\u2019t want to engage in, because you\u2019re using comedy to get into their brains. It\u2019s an opportunity to spur conversations. That\u2019s what I look at The Daily Show as doing.\u201d</p> <p>He cites the show\u2019s material on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/04/joe-biden-touching-male-privilege-power\">Joe Biden\u2019s inappropriately handsy behaviour</a>, or on police brutality \u2013 \u201cnot easy subjects to talk about, and a lot of the time people would rather not. But in a weird way comedy helps you to tackle serious subjects. Because I\u2019m not trying to be an arbiter or a preacher, I\u2019m just trying to raise questions I feel should be addressed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e108fddb64966e74e76566463c6f9cfd40097bcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e108fddb64966e74e76566463c6f9cfd40097bcc/1207_50_2642_3302/800.jpg\" alt=\"Trevor Noah on a standup tour in North Carolina, 2017.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trevor Noah on a standup tour in North Carolina, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Noah makes clear that he seeks to be judged not by the force of his arguments, or by whose minds he changes, but by the quality of the conversation he fosters. That\u2019s partly in his nature: he\u2019s a bridge-builder. It\u2019s also because his predecessor advised him to keep things light. \u201cRelish the fact that you can make jokes about these things,\u201d Noah remembers Stewart telling him, \u201cbecause there will come a day when you are too angry to laugh.\u201d</p> <p>But this even-handedness is also related to Noah\u2019s nationality \u2013 to his un-Americanness, in effect. \u201cI come from a different place,\u201d he says, \u201cboth metaphorically and literally. I\u2019m not entitled to tell people what to do in their country. Jon could tell the audience what was happening in America and say: \u2018Is this who <em>we</em> are?\u2019 But I\u2019ll make it more of a global issue. I\u2019ll say: \u2018Hey \u2013 this is something that is happening all over the world.\u2019 If you just focus on America, you may not be able to solve the problem, because it\u2019s not an American one. It\u2019s something that\u2019s growing all over the globe.\u201d</p> <p>In this, Noah is following the teachings of his mentor Eddie Izzard, who helped bankroll the South African\u2019s first international gigs \u2013 including those at the Edinburgh fringe in 2012. \u201cEddie loved that idea of going round the world, using comedy to bring people together \u2013 and thinking of yourself as a global citizen.\u201d</p> <p>As opposed to Theresa May\u2019s \u201ccitizen of nowhere\u201d? \u201cThat was a depressing thing for her to say,\u201d says Noah. \u201cBecause there is no problem that is isolated to one place or people. All that happens is a problem stays in a place for longer or it comes to you sooner. But either way, it\u2019s gonna become your problem.\u201d</p> <p>Does Noah feel like a Trojan horse, smuggling internationalist thinking into a country not known for its openness to non-American perspectives? \u201cNot a Trojan horse,\u201d he demurs, \u201cbecause the Trojans were coming in to destroy the other people\u2019s city. Whereas I love America and am hugely influenced by America.\u201d</p> <p>Says Bezuidenhout: \u201cTrevor\u2019s actually like America\u2019s therapist. He\u2019s the outside person that can really give perspective on the issues, because he\u2019s not involved.\u201d</p> <p>To maintain a sense of neutrality, of course, Noah must avoid going native \u2013 a distant prospect, he argues, in a city as multicultural as New York. Add to that his regular trips back to South Africa, where he runs an educational foundation (and visits his mum). And a new transatlantic standup tour, Loud &amp; Clear, to keep that international perspective pin-sharp.</p> <p>The British dates are in April 2020, and here\u2019s hoping that Noah uses them to update his dusty ideas about UK politics. In response to my question about why late-night TV satire has never taken off in Britain, Noah proffers that \u201cyour politicians are really good at tempering their language. You don\u2019t have politicians who are as crazy or extreme\u201d.</p> <p>He does, however, credit the UK with helping make him the comic he is today: clued-up, \u201cculturally relevant\u201d and \u2013 a quick look at his watch \u2013 overdue back at The Daily Show studio.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I started doing comedy in America, it was just about the jokes,\u201d says Noah. \u201cThe UK was the first place I came to where audiences pushed me, almost saying: \u2018Hey, anyone can tell a joke, But what\u2019s behind the joke? Do you have an opinion? Can you make us think?\u2019 And I\u2019m eternally appreciative of that.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.trevornoah.com/shows\">Trevor Noah </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.trevornoah.com/shows\">plays O2 Arena, SE10, 3 &amp; 4 April 2020</a>; <a href=\"https://www.pleasance.co.uk/event/schalk-bezuidenhout-south-african-white-boy#overview\">Schalk Bezuidenhout is at the Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, 31 July to 26 August</a></em></p>",

His childhood in Soweto sounds Dickensian in its violence and poverty. His mum was shot by her abusive partner (she survived); young Trevor ate caterpillars and dog food to survive. And yet, Noah emerged from it all an optimist \u2013 partly a function, he has said, of being treated as special because he was half-white. His breakthrough standup show, That\u2019s Racist, was striking for its lack of anger about the life he\u2019d been forced to lead. To this day, the criticism he attracts as The Daily Show\u2019s host is that he\u2019s insufficiently political \u2013 too blandly upbeat, not fuelled by Stewart-grade levels of righteous anger. Noah was a DJ and hawker of homemade CDs before he first saw standup, and \u2013 responding to a challenge \u2013 gave it a go himself. \u201cThe initial attitude towards him from other South African comedians was just confusion,\u201d says Schalk Bezuidenhout, a younger compatriot who has opened for Noah at homecoming gigs. \u201cHe was such a complete anomaly \u2013 and still is. He was able to do a one-man show really early in his career. Then he\u2019d write a brand new show annually and tour it nationwide. We hadn\u2019t seen that in this country: someone that writes at such a drastic pace and so well. He was just a natural, right from the beginning. Everyone was like: who is this guy, where has he come from, and how is this possible?\u201d It wasn\u2019t just that Noah wrote fast and well, but that he wrote topically. \u201cWhere most comedians would have a few lines about \u2018this thing happened in the news\u2019, Trevor would do 10, 20 minutes on it, the night it happened,\u201d says Bezuidenhout. \u201cBut it would be so polished, like a gag he\u2019d been doing for years.\u201d Those who saw Noah\u2019s 2018 gig at London\u2019s O2 can back this up. It took place on the day of Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding to Prince Harry \u2013 and Noah wrung a big-hitting 20 minutes out of the day\u2019s events, right at the top of his show. The more I talk to Noah, however, the more apparent is the difference between his agenda and (what was assumed to be) his predecessor\u2019s. \u201cWhat makes satire great,\u201d says Noah, \u201cis that you can speak about issues people don\u2019t want to engage in, because you\u2019re using comedy to get into their brains. It\u2019s an opportunity to spur conversations. That\u2019s what I look at The Daily Show as doing.\u201d He cites the show\u2019s material on Joe Biden\u2019s inappropriately handsy behaviour, or on police brutality \u2013 \u201cnot easy subjects to talk about, and a lot of the time people would rather not. But in a weird way comedy helps you to tackle serious subjects. Because I\u2019m not trying to be an arbiter or a preacher, I\u2019m just trying to raise questions I feel should be addressed.\u201d Noah makes clear that he seeks to be judged not by the force of his arguments, or by whose minds he changes, but by the quality of the conversation he fosters. That\u2019s partly in his nature: he\u2019s a bridge-builder. It\u2019s also because his predecessor advised him to keep things light. \u201cRelish the fact that you can make jokes about these things,\u201d Noah remembers Stewart telling him, \u201cbecause there will come a day when you are too angry to laugh.\u201d But this even-handedness is also related to Noah\u2019s nationality \u2013 to his un-Americanness, in effect. \u201cI come from a different place,\u201d he says, \u201cboth metaphorically and literally. I\u2019m not entitled to tell people what to do in their country. Jon could tell the audience what was happening in America and say: \u2018Is this who we are?\u2019 But I\u2019ll make it more of a global issue. I\u2019ll say: \u2018Hey \u2013 this is something that is happening all over the world.\u2019 If you just focus on America, you may not be able to solve the problem, because it\u2019s not an American one. It\u2019s something that\u2019s growing all over the globe.\u201d In this, Noah is following the teachings of his mentor Eddie Izzard, who helped bankroll the South African\u2019s first international gigs \u2013 including those at the Edinburgh fringe in 2012. \u201cEddie loved that idea of going round the world, using comedy to bring people together \u2013 and thinking of yourself as a global citizen.\u201d As opposed to Theresa May\u2019s \u201ccitizen of nowhere\u201d? \u201cThat was a depressing thing for her to say,\u201d says Noah. \u201cBecause there is no problem that is isolated to one place or people. All that happens is a problem stays in a place for longer or it comes to you sooner. But either way, it\u2019s gonna become your problem.\u201d Does Noah feel like a Trojan horse, smuggling internationalist thinking into a country not known for its openness to non-American perspectives? \u201cNot a Trojan horse,\u201d he demurs, \u201cbecause the Trojans were coming in to destroy the other people\u2019s city. Whereas I love America and am hugely influenced by America.\u201d Says Bezuidenhout: \u201cTrevor\u2019s actually like America\u2019s therapist. He\u2019s the outside person that can really give perspective on the issues, because he\u2019s not involved.\u201d To maintain a sense of neutrality, of course, Noah must avoid going native \u2013 a distant prospect, he argues, in a city as multicultural as New York. Add to that his regular trips back to South Africa, where he runs an educational foundation (and visits his mum). And a new transatlantic standup tour, Loud &amp; Clear, to keep that international perspective pin-sharp. The British dates are in April 2020, and here\u2019s hoping that Noah uses them to update his dusty ideas about UK politics. In response to my question about why late-night TV satire has never taken off in Britain, Noah proffers that \u201cyour politicians are really good at tempering their language. You don\u2019t have politicians who are as crazy or extreme\u201d. He does, however, credit the UK with helping make him the comic he is today: clued-up, \u201cculturally relevant\u201d and \u2013 a quick look at his watch \u2013 overdue back at The Daily Show studio. \u201cWhen I started doing comedy in America, it was just about the jokes,\u201d says Noah. \u201cThe UK was the first place I came to where audiences pushed me, almost saying: \u2018Hey, anyone can tell a joke, But what\u2019s behind the joke? Do you have an opinion? Can you make us think?\u2019 And I\u2019m eternally appreciative of that.\u201d Trevor Noah plays O2 Arena, SE10, 3 &amp; 4 April 2020; Schalk Bezuidenhout is at the Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, 31 July to 26 August",

      "body": "<p>We were enjoying a final barbecue with our two younger children on the last night of a holiday in Cornwall. Earlier we had dropped Jake, our 16-year-old, at the station so he could go home for a party. What we didn\u2019t know, as we watched another dazzling sunset, was that the party was at our house. Jake was the host. And it had been flagged on social media for more than a week.</p> <p>Skip to the next day. We were driving home when we received an ominous phone call from Jake: \u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d he said, \u201cbut Josh broke the overhead light in the kitchen skateboarding round the table.\u201d</p> <p>There were several things wrong with this statement. But, most alarmingly, why were Jake and his friend in the house, which we had locked up and fully secured before going on holiday? Within five minutes of arriving home it became clear that he\u2019d had a Facebook party. A gathering for 25 mates \u2013 his story, anyway \u2013 had turned into a bacchanalian bash for 200.</p> <p>The carpets were ruined, almost turned black with footprints. There were alarming drops of blood on the walls, which were also filthy, and a cupboard door had been wrenched off its hinges. No room was left undamaged.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s slept in my bed,\u201d my 13-year-old daughter called from upstairs, furious.</p> <p>\u201cThere are cigarette burns on the sofa,\u201d said the eight-year-old, thrilled, as he ran from room to room inspecting the wreckage.</p> <p>There was worse to come. A precious Gurkha\u2019s knife belonging to my husband John\u2019s late father was missing, a bike had been stolen and surrounding the house was a sea of smashed beer bottles. We were picking up fragments of glass for weeks.</p> <p>We live in an ancient farmhouse. It\u2019s withstood centuries of pillaging and plundering, and can more than cope with a crowd of drunk teens. What bothered us \u2013 aside from the deceit \u2013 was what <em>could</em> have gone wrong, without any adults on hand to pick up the pieces. We have a thatched roof \u2013 no need to spell out the risks there. What if someone had needed to go to A&amp;E, a 45-minute drive away? Or a kid had fallen asleep and \u2013 my personal terror when teenagers are involved \u2013 choked on their vomit?</p> <p>To be fair, Jake was distraught. The party had quickly raged out of control. He\u2019d watched in horror as people he didn\u2019t know charged upstairs, ignoring his pleas that it was out of bounds. He said he\u2019d hated the whole night, and we believed him (although it must be said, his timing was immaculate; he started sixth form with street cred intact).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Beware the email from an unknown parent: it may well be a fake. Ban social media invites. Hide your valuables</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We confiscated his phone, which was humming with texts (\u201cSick party\u201d was the gist) and banned him from going out for a few weeks. But we couldn\u2019t gate him for ever and, eventually, we had to make a decision about what to do next.</p> <p>In the following weeks, we\u2019d overhear the odd phone call, along the chilling lines of \u201cso-and-so\u2019s got a free house\u201d. We knew Jake wouldn\u2019t put us through a Facebook party again, but how was he going to see his friends? When you live in the sticks, as we do, there are few places for teenagers to go. Chances are they are going to see their friends and get drunk anyway, and they need a safe place to do it.</p> <p>Taking a somewhat different approach, we decided to <em>be</em> the safe place. Full-on parties at home were off the agenda; instead we told our son he could have small gatherings, provided we were both present.</p> <p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d our friends said. \u201cLook what happened last time.\u201d</p> <p>But we went ahead, and here\u2019s the thing: over the next two years we got to know Jake\u2019s circle of friends pretty well. They would crash at our house after a party \u2013 six of them squeezed into his bedroom \u2013 and more often than not our house <em>was</em> the party. Weekends became a mishmash of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jun/02/butterflies-complete-collection-box-set-review\" title=\"\">Butterflies</a> meets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/25/skins-tv-teenage-life-truth-10-years-on\" title=\"\">Skins</a>.</p> <p>To help make it work, we established some unbreakable rules. The gathering must be banished to one room as far away from our bedroom as possible; no smoking inside; no drugs. (Oh yes, the thorny issue of drugs. I am grateful that John\u2019s job as a festival promoter gives him the inside track on the worst drugs doing the rounds \u2013 things with numbers rather than names: 2CB anyone? \u2013 so we aren\u2019t clueless, but having your teenager partying under your roof gives you an unrivalled opportunity to look into their eyes. If something was going on, we\u2019d have known about it.)</p> <p>And here\u2019s another thing you learn when you see your kids\u2019 friends slightly pissed, guard down: they really care for each other. If someone\u2019s throwing up, they will be looked after. If one of them is having a bad time, a friend will take them home. If there\u2019s a relationship trauma, they will not be crying alone.</p> <p>Jake is now at university and recently he invited the old crowd around for a reunion. We were genuinely thrilled to see them. They cooked and sat around the table drinking wine - how things change in the space of three years. Getting to know our children\u2019s friends has given us an insight into the modern teenager; they are kind, funny, intelligent and polite. And they are welcome any time. Here\u2019s six things we learned.</p> <h2>Dos and don\u2019ts of teenage gatherings<br></h2> <p><strong>1</strong><strong> Never leave your house empty</strong><br>Don\u2019t be tempted to allow your teenager to have a gathering while you\u2019re away, however small and \u201csafe\u201d he or she says it will be. I have friends with teenagers who book a housesitter rather than leave the place unguarded \u2013 some teenagers live for an empty house. Always remember that after a few beers, sense, logic and the moral compass tend to go out of the window (one friend had a new car smashed up at an illicit teenage party). And if you need to farm them out, make sure it\u2019s to an adult you genuinely know and can check in with. Beware the unknown parent\u2019s email: it may well be a fake.</p> <p><strong>2</strong><strong> Get to know your child\u2019s friends</strong><br>This might sound obvious, but it\u2019s surprisingly easy to lose sight of your kid\u2019s friends once they start at secondary school. Allowing your house to become the party place (with strict boundaries) once in a while means you see them in a much more relaxed setting. Without exception, we\u2019ve found them to be lovely. Plus, you get to prowl your terrain from time to time to see what\u2019s going down. Literally.</p> <p><strong>3</strong><strong> Ban social media invites</strong><br>Social media can get out of control fast, and if strangers or friends of friends begin to turn up, no amount of rule-setting will save you. Instead, set a limit of 10-15 friends, which is a manageable number.</p> <p><strong>4</strong><strong> Treat it as a giant sleepover</strong><br>It\u2019s easiest to allow everyone to stay, especially if transport links are weak (and few parents relish a 1am pick-up). They will happily crash on floors, sofas, chairs or the back of their car. And, talking of cars, if you have them to stay you don\u2019t have the worry of late-night dangerous driving.</p> <p><strong>5</strong><strong> Hide </strong><strong>valuables (booze included)</strong><br>I\u2019m still smarting from the loss of an unopened bottle of rhubarb gin, a birthday present, which was handed out freely as shots at one gathering. We move anything we care about, such as good glasses, put throws on sofas and cloths on tables. I learned the hard way that wet beer bottle tops leave nasty marks on surfaces.</p> <p><strong>6</strong><strong> The key ingredients are beer, pizza and bacon</strong><br>Mostly they want to drink beer and it does seem to be the best option: the time they drank J\u00e4germeister wasn\u2019t pretty. Pizza at any time of day or night goes down in industrial quantities. Same goes for breakfast the next morning. Get the bacon frying and hand out a few bin bags, you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised by how quickly order is restored.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/him-9781409177708.html\">Him</a>, by Clare Empson, is published by Orion Fiction.</p> <p>Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.

No, of course not: it was pizza \u2013 it was fine. Best thing about Mark? His self-awareness. He mentioned the communist manifesto, but not in a sixth-form kind of way. Would you introduce him to your friends? My friends are going to miss me when I move to Berlin, so it might be a little consolation prize for them. Describe Mark in three words. A natural blond. What do you think he made of you? I think he suspected I wasn\u2019t a natural blond. Did you go on somewhere? To a pub round the corner, where I had to dodge a few exes. And... did you kiss? Yeah, duh. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? Probably not showing up two pints deep. Marks out of 10? Rating an experience according to its perceived value is such a capitalist construct, but I\u2019d give it a solid 8. Would you meet again? Depends what he says about me in this column. Mark on Summer What were you hoping for? I didn\u2019t want to be paired up with one of those stuffy, shy-Tory types. First impressions? Relief. See above. What did you talk about? Wanting to move away from London. I talked a bit about hauntology, which probably came off a bit pretentious. We were both slightly trashed towards the end, but I think there was something about films. Any awkward moments? Summer said she\u2019d waited six months for a Blind Date because there\u2019s a dearth of applications from straight men, and I told her I wouldn\u2019t call myself straight. Good table manners? I\u2019m not really in the business of policing other people\u2019s behaviour. Best thing about Summer? She had a really interesting background. Also up for drinking on a school night. Would you introduce her to your friends? She\u2019s moving away in a fortnight, so I can\u2019t see it. Describe Summer in three words. Colourful, friendly, characterful. What do you think she made of you? She said I was more interesting than she\u2019d expected. Did you go on somewhere? To a pub on Columbia Road. And... did you kiss? Yeah, briefly. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? I wish I\u2019d had a few tinnies on the walk to the restaurant. Marks out of 10? 7.5. Would you meet again? Sure, why not? \u2022 Summer and Mark ate at Spelzini, London E1. Fancy a blind date?

This president takes personal pique and gives that priority.\u201d</p> <p>Other countries are thought likely to give ambassadors stronger backing. Gaspard said: \u201cIt was astounding to see Boris Johnson tripping over himself not to defend a career diplomat who, by all accounts, has served British interests really well. It speaks to the hyper-personalised nature of this.</p> <p>\u201cMost diplomats would have the expectation that there would be a robust defence of them. I served in South Africa when there was a president who invited his fair share of controversy. I needed to know I could send candid assessments back to Washington without a leak, or if it should leak, to know I would be backed by my government.\u201d</p> <p> Brooks Spector, formerly a US diplomat in South Africa, said: \u201cThe ambassadors are probably sending gentle notes to their governments to say, \u2018If this happens to me, we hope you\u2019ll come out and back me real quickly.\u2019 I hope they would.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/kim-darroch-effectively-sacked-by-johnson-on-the-orders-of-trump\">Kim Darroch: effectively sacked by Johnson on the orders of Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An ambassador in Washington from a European Union country, who did not wish to be named, confirmed that fellow diplomats express sentiments similar to Darroch\u2019s in their own cables.</p> <p>\u201cI talked to a number of them recently and those people all have exactly the same opinion,\u201d the ambassador said.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes we are very critical about this administration if it\u2019s needed and I think also what you see in the newspaper articles is they quote selectively.

The deputy ambassador, Michael Tatham, offered remarks, some of them lighthearted, from Darroch\u2019s usual position at a lectern under a framed Andy Warhol screenprint of the Queen. He was followed by Mark Ein, an American entrepreneur and investor in tennis, who paid tribute to Darroch and the transatlantic alliance. Unlike other events hosted by the grand 1920s residence, no White House officials were present. American guests standing under the crystal chandeliers expressed support for the ousted diplomat. John Arundel, the associate publisher of Washington Life magazine, said: \u201cConsummate professional, consummate diplomat. Everyone in Washington loved him. When you talk to Sir Kim, you\u2019re always the most important person in the room. He was a force of light and he made Great Britain great. I\u2019ve known four ambassadors and he was my favourite.\u201d Asked how he felt Darroch had been treated, Arundel replied: \u201cAwful. Unacceptable. I\u2019ve had a dozen conversations with him about President Trump over the years. He never spoke ill of him. Not once. Always a consummate professional.\u201d Arundel, who has known Trump for 31 years, warned that the Darroch affair is likely to make other diplomats nervous. \u201cEveryone\u2019s afraid of being lopped off by Trump\u2019s Twitter feed. I think most European and other countries are going towards very dry ambassadors who are not going to speak their opinions and not be candid and I think that\u2019s sad because you should be able to have a private conversation with your home office to take the current political temperature.\u201d Darroch resigned on Wednesday, saying: \u201cThe current situation is making it impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like.\u201d Trump had excoriated him on Twitter, calling the ambassador \u201ca pompous fool\u201d and \u201ca very stupid guy\u201d. Theresa May backed him but her likely successor, Boris Johnson, conspicuously failed to do so. In a peculiar U-turn on Friday, Trump told reporters: \u201cI wish the British ambassador well. Some people just told me \u2013 too bad \u2013 but they said he actually said very good things about me. He was sort of referring to other people.\u201d It is little secret that Darroch\u2019s observations were in line with those of many others. G\u00e9rard Araud, who recently retired as the French ambassador, told the New York Times: \u201cYes, yes, everyone does. But fortunately I knew that nothing would remain secret, so I sent them in a most confidential manner.\u201d Contacted by the Guardian, Araud declined to comment further. The saga has also struck a certain irony in the US diplomatic community. The 2010 publication by WikiLeaks of tens of thousands of classified and sensitive documents laid out frank and often unflattering impressions of foreign leaders and governments. Patrick Gaspard, president of the Open Society Foundations and a former US ambassador to South Africa, said: \u201cIt\u2019s obviously disconcerting for any diplomat when cables leak. \u201cWe had a similar situation with the Obama administration with the WikiLeaks dumps. But personal relations matter much less than mutual interests. There is so much hypersensitivity in this administration around personal relations that it seems to trump mutual interests.\u201d That is bound to affect other ambassadors, Gaspard said. \u201cI think certainly diplomats are on edge about personal attacks. This president takes personal pique and gives that priority.\u201d Other countries are thought likely to give ambassadors stronger backing. Gaspard said: \u201cIt was astounding to see Boris Johnson tripping over himself not to defend a career diplomat who, by all accounts, has served British interests really well. It speaks to the hyper-personalised nature of this. \u201cMost diplomats would have the expectation that there would be a robust defence of them. I served in South Africa when there was a president who invited his fair share of controversy. I needed to know I could send candid assessments back to Washington without a leak, or if it should leak, to know I would be backed by my government.\u201d Brooks Spector, formerly a US diplomat in South Africa, said: \u201cThe ambassadors are probably sending gentle notes to their governments to say, \u2018If this happens to me, we hope you\u2019ll come out and back me real quickly.\u2019 I hope they would.\u201d An ambassador in Washington from a European Union country, who did not wish to be named, confirmed that fellow diplomats express sentiments similar to Darroch\u2019s in their own cables. \u201cI talked to a number of them recently and those people all have exactly the same opinion,\u201d the ambassador said. \u201cSometimes we are very critical about this administration if it\u2019s needed and I think also what you see in the newspaper articles is they quote selectively. If you quote selectively from my cables, you can make an assessment that I am very critical of the Trump administration. If you leave out X and you highlight Y, that\u2019s what you get. \u201cIn general, I think that what [Darroch] writes down, maybe not in exactly the same words, you will find in all our cables.\u201d The diplomat expressed confidence his or her government would give stronger backing than Johnson offered Darroch. \u201cI would expect my minister to support me to the hilt and I have every confidence that he will,\u201d the ambassador said.",

But nonetheless, \u201cthis blog did not need to be written \u2013 here I am toeing the Vanity Fair party line\u201d. \u2018My journalism benefited from #MeToo\u2019 Fast forward to 2007, when Acosta reached his bizarrely lenient plea deal with Epstein. By then, investigators had identified 35 potential victims who said they had been lured into Epstein\u2019s Palm Beach mansion and sexually assaulted. Yet records obtained by the Miami Herald showed prosecutors led by Acosta actively worked with Epstein\u2019s attorneys to minimize media coverage. One of Acosta\u2019s prosecutors wrote in an email to Jay Lefkowitz, an Epstein lawyer: \u201cOn an \u2018avoid the press\u2019 note \u2026 I can file the charge in district court in Miami which will hopefully cut the press coverage significantly. Do you want to check that out?\u201d That Acosta felt that he had to resign on Friday was an indication that the collective failure of US media to grapple with a story of serial sex trafficking and abuse that had been hiding in plain sight for years no longer holds true. In the wake of Brown\u2019s exemplary reporting, the rest of the American media has fallen in line. Acosta paid the price. That may in part be thanks to the #MeToo movement that had not erupted when Brown began her investigation but did draw attention to her work when it was published. As she told MSNBC after Epstein\u2019s arrest last weekend: \u201cMy journalism benefited from #MeToo as we [started] giving these cases much more scrutiny.\u201d Mary Angela Bock, associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s school of journalism, said #MeToo had dented the prevailing patriarchy that has existed in newsrooms for decades and that had led to sexual crimes being overlooked as merely \u201cthe way of the world\u201d. \u201c#MeToo has led to greater awareness among journalists that this is not OK,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not \u2018boys being boys\u2019. This is rape and sexual exploitation of children.\u201d",

Assuming power on Monday, the New Democracy leader announced parliament would not be going into recess for the summer: there was no time to waste, and bills had to be drafted.</p> \n<p>By Wednesday, as his cabinet of established politicians, technocrats and ex-socialist reformers convened for the first time, the philosophy of his centre-right government became clearer still: ministers would not only set targets, they\u2019d be monitored too.

Their first post-bailout government is viewed as the beginning of a new era; the crossing of a psychological threshold after a decade of austerity-driven depression, bailouts, extremist splinter groups and near bankruptcy on the frontline of Europe\u2019s debt crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat we are seeing is a fresh generation of politician, Harvard-educated, result-oriented and with a more technocratic approach coming to the fore,\u201d Pantelis Kapsis, a prominent political journalist, says of Mitsotakis.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if he wants to run Greece as a business project, at the risk of offending some of the old guard in his own party.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cronyism, nepotism, political patronage and profligate spending have all been blamed for the nation\u2019s inexorable slide towards economic collapse. Aware of his own party\u2019s role in that drama \u2013 New Democracy and the social-democratic Pasok party alternated in power for decades \u2013 one of Mitsotakis\u2019s first acts this week was to ban the appointment by government officials of relatives to posts, a rule, he said, he would be the first to adhere to. Mitsotakis himself is the son another former prime minister and towering figure of the party, Konstantinos.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/08/kyriakos-mitsotakis-takes-over-greece-pm-new-democracy\">Mitsotakis takes over as Greece's PM with radical change of style</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As with several Greek leaders, the 51-year-old Kyriakos is part of a powerful political dynasty. But his political ascent was not preordained. The prospect that he would one day lead New Democracy, one of Europe\u2019s most socially conservative parties, to a landslide victory seemed improbable only a few years ago.</p> \n<p>Although raised in the shadow of his father and his older sister, Dora, who would go on to become mayor of Athens and foreign minister, politics was not his first call. Instead, the younger Mitsotakis continued his studies in the US before venturing into the world of finance.</p> \n<p>When a job with Chase Investment bank beckoned, he moved to London. It was there that he lived for years with his banker wife Mareva Grabowski \u2013 time that friends credit with shaping views considerably more progressive than most in New Democracy.</p> \n<p>It was not until 2004, several years after his return to Athens, that the then father-of-three became an MP but his ascendancy to the party\u2019s helm was unexpected. Throwing his hat into the ring for the leadership race in 2015, Mitsotakis was considered a rank outsider, a centrist whose liberal economic views chimed with neither nationalists nor populists in its ranks.</p> \n<p>\u201cInitially his poll ratings weren\u2019t high at all; he was held in suspicion by MPs,\u201d said Theodore Pelagidis, a professor of economics at Piraeus University who advised him at the time. \u201cNot more than three or four [out of 75] backed him. He only won because he was persistent, systematic and workaholic \u2013 qualities he has since brought to the party.\u201d</p> \n<p>As soon as he took over, New Democracy\u2019s headquarters were moved from a building on a central Athens boulevard that cost \u20ac98,000 (\u00a388,000) in rent per month to premises in a gritty neighbourhood that cost 9,800 euro monthly. In line with the politician\u2019s green sensitivities, the new offices were turned into an eco-friendly behemoth, where water saving and recycling has become the norm.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"92636970-d9f9-4208-9acb-12dcda4f0a66\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In style and background Greece\u2019s new leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis could not be more different to his predecessor Alexis Tsipras.</p>\n    <p>Born in 1968 into one of the country\u2019s powerful political dynasties, his father Konstantinos Mitsotakis also held the office of prime minister. As Mitsotakis\u2019 only son, Kyriakos seemed destined to go into politics too. After being educated at Greece\u2019s elite Athens College, he was sent to Harvard University where he graduated with a degree in social studies in 1990.</p>\n    <p>But after continuing his studies \u2013 earning an MA in international relations at Standford University and an MBA from Harvard's Business School - he took a different path. He went to London to work as a financial analyst with Chase Investment Bank, and then as a consultant with the business company McKinsey. It wasn\u2019t until 2004, seven years after returning to Greece to continue his financial career, that he ventured into politics and ran for parliament.</p>\n    <p>Like his father, Mitsotakis saw himself as a liberal centrist who cared about green issues and human rights. From 2013 to 2015 he served as minister for administrative reform in the coalition government headed by Antonis Samaras. During his tenure thousands of civil servants were laid off, igniting fierce criticism from political opponents.</p>\n    <p>In January 2016, when the New Democracy party had been riven by Greece\u2019s economic crisis, he decided to run for the leadership, but had little support and soon discovered his name was more of a hindrance than a help. He eventually won the post, but only after running what aides describe as a tough campaign. Once he assumed the leadership, his overhaul of New Democracy began, culminating with the party returning to power in 2019.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Aides say he will be using similar techniques to try and transform Greece, a country that despite being brought to the brink of expulsion from the eurozone, and still closely watched by foreign creditors almost a year after exiting its third bailout, remains deeply resistant to change.</p> \n<p>\u201cHis philosophy is one of progressive liberalism. He believes in the welfare state, universal health care for all, and in high quality public services but also in the creativity of the market economy,\u201d said Pavlos Eleftheriadis, professor of public law at the University of Oxford who ran as a candidate for the party in May\u2019s European parliament elections. \u201cHis thinking and his sensitivities belong more to the centre than the right. He is willing to experiment, innovate, take risks.\u201d</p> \n<p>Eleftheriadis, who helped found the centrist Potami party and describes himself as belonging to the centre left, says New Democracy would not normally be a natural home. But, like others, he was won over by Mitsotakis\u2019s anti-populist stance and reformist, pro-European, internationalist policies.</p> \n<p>He said no leader comes to the job as well prepared. While in opposition Mitsotakis had concentrated on planning ahead, preparing the party\u2019s manifesto, singling out foreign-based academics and business people who, when the time came, could fill government posts.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a strategic thinker \u2026 what he\u2019s pulled off in his government has been a very difficult balance,\u201d added Eleftheriadis. \u201cHe\u2019s had to mix established politicians, with wide popular appeal, with unknown technocrats whose expertise will allow them to be more effective and more focused on specific policy.</p> \n<p>But Mitsotakis also has his opponents. His new administration has been criticised for the under-representation of women \u2013 they hold just five positions out of a total of 51.</p> \n<p>Asked about this, Mitsotakis claimed there <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-48949395/new-greek-pm-mitsotakis-on-lack-of-women-in-government\">weren\u2019t many women \u201cinterested in stepping into politics\u201d</a> and said he had approached women but they \u201cwere much more hesitant\u201d to take up cabinet positions than men. He conceded that it was a \u201cdefinite area of improvement\u201d for his government and said he hoped to appoint more when he had his first cabinet reshuffle.</p> \n<p>His untrammelled belief in the private sector whose investors, he hopes, will help create jobs and reduce record rates of unemployment, has sparked fears that the country\u2019s public utilities and natural resources will be sold off to the highest bidder.</p> \n<p>Few have forgotten how as administrative reform minister he <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24085742\">dismissed around 5,000 people</a>, almost overnight, from jobs in the public sector at the behest of lenders keeping Athens afloat. There have also been charges of some New Democracy MPs holding stridently antisemitic, homophobic views<strong>, </strong>despite Mitsotakis having endorsed legislation in favour of same-sex civil unions.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s very neoliberal and he\u2019s been a hostage of rightwing nationalists in New Democracy over issues like Prespes,\u201d said the leftist writer Dimitris Psarras, referring to the historic accord Tsipras sealed ending the decades-long name row over Macedonia, Greece\u2019s northern neighbour, now called the Republic of North Macedonia.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe took a very tough stance on that even though his own views previously had been much more moderate. It was cynical and hypocritical. In my view he is weak. A lot of what he does is motivated by a desire to prove he is as good as his sister and father, both much bigger political personalities.\u201d</p> \n<p>Promises of tax reduction \u2013 a key vote drawer \u2013 could also prove challenging. Within hours of assuming office, the EU made clear that it would not be tolerating any fiscal derailments. Greece, it said, would have to keep to its commitment of producing budget surpluses of 3.5%, even if Mitsotakis has said his endgame is to renegotiate such straightjacket fiscal targets.</p> \n<p>And although out, at 45, Tsipras is by no means down. Instead his Syriza party has called its ability to pick up 31.5% of the vote, despite being the one forced to apply tough austerity measures, nothing short of a victory. Once the new government starts implementing unpopular measures opposition is likely to be formidable.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat Mitsotakis has done is risky. Politics is all about compromise and technocrats don\u2019t always know how to do that,\u201d said Kapsis. \u201cWhen reforms come up against resistance he will almost certainly run into trouble with his own MPs. Right now, we\u2019re in the honeymoon period but miracles in politics never last.\u201d</p>",

Their first post-bailout government is viewed as the beginning of a new era; the crossing of a psychological threshold after a decade of austerity-driven depression, bailouts, extremist splinter groups and near bankruptcy on the frontline of Europe\u2019s debt crisis. \u201cWhat we are seeing is a fresh generation of politician, Harvard-educated, result-oriented and with a more technocratic approach coming to the fore,\u201d Pantelis Kapsis, a prominent political journalist, says of Mitsotakis. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if he wants to run Greece as a business project, at the risk of offending some of the old guard in his own party.\u201d Cronyism, nepotism, political patronage and profligate spending have all been blamed for the nation\u2019s inexorable slide towards economic collapse. Aware of his own party\u2019s role in that drama \u2013 New Democracy and the social-democratic Pasok party alternated in power for decades \u2013 one of Mitsotakis\u2019s first acts this week was to ban the appointment by government officials of relatives to posts, a rule, he said, he would be the first to adhere to. Mitsotakis himself is the son another former prime minister and towering figure of the party, Konstantinos. As with several Greek leaders, the 51-year-old Kyriakos is part of a powerful political dynasty. But his political ascent was not preordained. The prospect that he would one day lead New Democracy, one of Europe\u2019s most socially conservative parties, to a landslide victory seemed improbable only a few years ago. Although raised in the shadow of his father and his older sister, Dora, who would go on to become mayor of Athens and foreign minister, politics was not his first call. Instead, the younger Mitsotakis continued his studies in the US before venturing into the world of finance. When a job with Chase Investment bank beckoned, he moved to London. It was there that he lived for years with his banker wife Mareva Grabowski \u2013 time that friends credit with shaping views considerably more progressive than most in New Democracy. It was not until 2004, several years after his return to Athens, that the then father-of-three became an MP but his ascendancy to the party\u2019s helm was unexpected. Throwing his hat into the ring for the leadership race in 2015, Mitsotakis was considered a rank outsider, a centrist whose liberal economic views chimed with neither nationalists nor populists in its ranks. \u201cInitially his poll ratings weren\u2019t high at all; he was held in suspicion by MPs,\u201d said Theodore Pelagidis, a professor of economics at Piraeus University who advised him at the time. \u201cNot more than three or four [out of 75] backed him. He only won because he was persistent, systematic and workaholic \u2013 qualities he has since brought to the party.\u201d As soon as he took over, New Democracy\u2019s headquarters were moved from a building on a central Athens boulevard that cost \u20ac98,000 (\u00a388,000) in rent per month to premises in a gritty neighbourhood that cost 9,800 euro monthly. In line with the politician\u2019s green sensitivities, the new offices were turned into an eco-friendly behemoth, where water saving and recycling has become the norm. Aides say he will be using similar techniques to try and transform Greece, a country that despite being brought to the brink of expulsion from the eurozone, and still closely watched by foreign creditors almost a year after exiting its third bailout, remains deeply resistant to change. \u201cHis philosophy is one of progressive liberalism. He believes in the welfare state, universal health care for all, and in high quality public services but also in the creativity of the market economy,\u201d said Pavlos Eleftheriadis, professor of public law at the University of Oxford who ran as a candidate for the party in May\u2019s European parliament elections. \u201cHis thinking and his sensitivities belong more to the centre than the right. He is willing to experiment, innovate, take risks.\u201d Eleftheriadis, who helped found the centrist Potami party and describes himself as belonging to the centre left, says New Democracy would not normally be a natural home. But, like others, he was won over by Mitsotakis\u2019s anti-populist stance and reformist, pro-European, internationalist policies. He said no leader comes to the job as well prepared. While in opposition Mitsotakis had concentrated on planning ahead, preparing the party\u2019s manifesto, singling out foreign-based academics and business people who, when the time came, could fill government posts. \u201cHe\u2019s a strategic thinker \u2026 what he\u2019s pulled off in his government has been a very difficult balance,\u201d added Eleftheriadis. \u201cHe\u2019s had to mix established politicians, with wide popular appeal, with unknown technocrats whose expertise will allow them to be more effective and more focused on specific policy. But Mitsotakis also has his opponents. His new administration has been criticised for the under-representation of women \u2013 they hold just five positions out of a total of 51. Asked about this, Mitsotakis claimed there weren\u2019t many women \u201cinterested in stepping into politics\u201d and said he had approached women but they \u201cwere much more hesitant\u201d to take up cabinet positions than men. He conceded that it was a \u201cdefinite area of improvement\u201d for his government and said he hoped to appoint more when he had his first cabinet reshuffle. His untrammelled belief in the private sector whose investors, he hopes, will help create jobs and reduce record rates of unemployment, has sparked fears that the country\u2019s public utilities and natural resources will be sold off to the highest bidder. Few have forgotten how as administrative reform minister he dismissed around 5,000 people, almost overnight, from jobs in the public sector at the behest of lenders keeping Athens afloat. There have also been charges of some New Democracy MPs holding stridently antisemitic, homophobic views, despite Mitsotakis having endorsed legislation in favour of same-sex civil unions. \u201cHe\u2019s very neoliberal and he\u2019s been a hostage of rightwing nationalists in New Democracy over issues like Prespes,\u201d said the leftist writer Dimitris Psarras, referring to the historic accord Tsipras sealed ending the decades-long name row over Macedonia, Greece\u2019s northern neighbour, now called the Republic of North Macedonia. \u201cHe took a very tough stance on that even though his own views previously had been much more moderate. It was cynical and hypocritical. In my view he is weak. A lot of what he does is motivated by a desire to prove he is as good as his sister and father, both much bigger political personalities.\u201d Promises of tax reduction \u2013 a key vote drawer \u2013 could also prove challenging. Within hours of assuming office, the EU made clear that it would not be tolerating any fiscal derailments. Greece, it said, would have to keep to its commitment of producing budget surpluses of 3.5%, even if Mitsotakis has said his endgame is to renegotiate such straightjacket fiscal targets. And although out, at 45, Tsipras is by no means down. Instead his Syriza party has called its ability to pick up 31.5% of the vote, despite being the one forced to apply tough austerity measures, nothing short of a victory. Once the new government starts implementing unpopular measures opposition is likely to be formidable. \u201cWhat Mitsotakis has done is risky. Politics is all about compromise and technocrats don\u2019t always know how to do that,\u201d said Kapsis. \u201cWhen reforms come up against resistance he will almost certainly run into trouble with his own MPs. Right now, we\u2019re in the honeymoon period but miracles in politics never last.\u201d",

At its annual convention, which is being held across three days this weekend, the party said it would institute the new membership scheme, which allows developers and others to pay a $990 special membership fee. The benefits of the new diamond membership appear mainly to relate to fundraising and social events, such as free entry to \u201ccocktail reception(s)\u201d and other functions. The LNP has a multi-level membership structure, with individual fees ranging from $110 to $1,300. The more expensive memberships under the existing structure entitle party faithful to attend peak policy forums such as the the state convention and state council. The LNP president, Dave Hutchinson, told the convention the new membership had been instigated because of the donations ban, the Australian reported. \u201cFor those wondering what this is all about, this is a class of membership that\u2019s allowed under current state legislation that effectively prohibits property developers from participating in our party,\u201d Hutchinson said. His predecessor, Gary Spence, was forced to resign in December because of the ban. Spence is the director of a civil engineering and development consultancy firm. He stood aside on advice that he could not be involved in raising funds for the party. Spence had launched a legal challenge to the state\u2019s donations ban, which was tossed out by the full bench of the high court in April. The ruling left the LNP at a distinct fundraising disadvantage against Labor just a month before the federal election \u2013 although some party members believe this might have also helped the federal Coalition, whose victory was won partly on the back of effective locally run campaigns in individual seats. The federal election has upended Queensland politics, forcing the Labor government to change its public language on the Carmichael coal project, in part to appease regional MPs worried about losing their seats at the 2020 election. The LNP convention always showcases the hardline nature of the party\u2019s conservative northern membership \u2013 such as debates where the ABC is labelled as \u201cenemies of the party\u201d, but in the lead-up to this one, the Queensland opposition leader, Deb Frecklington, sought to outflank Labor on the left. The LNP needs to win back a handful of city seats at the 2020 Queensland election \u2013 a tougher task in a state campaign, particularly when social issues are at the fore. LNP moderates have long been concerned that the party\u2019s hardline stance on abortion rights, for example, has the potential to alienate more progressive city voters. Labor has used a process of steady and methodical social reforms, in some cases winding back ultra-conservative legacy policies, to highlight the LNP\u2019s move to the fringes. Frecklington had announced in the Courier-Mail a week before the convention that the LNP would back reform of the state\u2019s rape consent laws, to remove the \u201cmistake of fact\u201d defence that has consistently prevented proper investigations and hindered prosecutions. Labor had been weighing the reform for months, and a few days later had announced that it would be reviewed by the state\u2019s Law Reform Commission. The LNP has raised donations worth $470,000 since the federal election in May.

      "bodyText": "The UK is stepping up its military presence in the Gulf by sending a second warship to the region to protect British commercial oil tankers, the Ministry of Defence has said. The HMS Duncan, a Type 45 destroyer, will be deployed within days after it completed a course of Nato exercises in the Black Sea with the aim to be in the Gulf region by next week. The ship will work alongside the Royal Navy\u2019s frigate HMS Montrose and US Gulf allies, but will not participate in Washington\u2019s proposed global maritime coalition to protect shipping in the area. HMS Duncan was due to have taken over from HMS Montrose, but for a fixed period the two ships will instead work alongside one another. The news comes after Theresa May said she would begin talks with US authorities on increasing a transatlantic presence in the region following two sets of attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, and an attempt by Iranian navy to push a British owned oil ship towards Iranian waters. The UK already has four mine-hunting vessels stationed in the region, and former naval commanders, including Admiral Lord West, have warned the UK only has eight frigates on patrol. West\u2019s fears have been echoed by Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, who has renewed his call for UK spending on defence to double. Hunt said the UK was not seeking to escalate the crisis with Iran and that it was a time for cool heads. \u201cWe take maritime security very seriously. It is our primary responsibility to protect British shipping. This is a situation that is changing every hour, but we are reacting to what is happening in a clear and very measured way,\u201d he added. The MoD said it was seeking to de-escalate the crisis, but conceded that with more than 15 British-owned tankers going through the Gulf each day it was not possible to protect all shipping. It said: \u201cAs part of our long-standing presence in the Gulf, HMS Duncan is deploying to the region to ensure we maintain a continuous maritime security presence while HMS Montrose comes off task for pre-planned maintenance and crew change over. \u201cThis will ensure that the UK alongside international partners can continue to support freedom of navigation for vessels transiting through this vital shipping lane.\u201d Britain\u2019s already poor relations with Iran deteriorated further last week when the UK seized an Iranian ship, Grace 1, carrying oil destined for Syria, a contract that the UK said was in breach of EU sanctions. Tehran has denied the ship was heading for Syria and threatened to seize a British oil tanker in retaliation, if Grace 1 was not released. The ship\u2019s captain and chief officer were arrested by the Gibraltarian authorities after the vessel was searched for more than a week. On Saturday the Royal Gibraltar police said the pair and two second officers had been conditionally bailed without charge, while the investigation was continuing and the vessel remained in detention. Iran has accused the UK of piracy summoning the British ambassador to Tehran, Robert Macaire, four times in the past week. It has suggested the tanker was seized \u201cat the behest of\u201d the US government \u201cin line with America\u2019s hostile policies\u201d. A spokesman for the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Mousavi, said: \u201cThis is a dangerous game and we advise them not get involved in this game under America\u2019s influence.\u201d He added: \u201cWe ask them again to release the tanker immediately, which will be in all countries\u2019 interest.\u201d A senior Iranian cleric, the Ayatollah Kazem Sedighi, was reported by state TV as saying: \u201cThe British will soon get a slap from the strong arms of our establishment for their daring, reckless and negligent act that will make them regret it for good.\u201d The UK is among the European supporters of the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal, from which Donald Trump withdrew the US last year, reimposing toughened sanctions on Tehran. When imposing the sanctions in May, the US ordered other countries and companies to halt imports of Iranian oil or face being excluded from the global financial system. In retaliation, Iran has decreased its commitments to the nuclear pact, in defiance of a warning by European countries. The US blames Iran for a series of attacks on shipping in the world\u2019s most important oil artery since mid-May, allegations that have been denied by Tehran. The US has also dispatched extra troops to the region to counter what it described as Iranian threats. Meanwhile Mohamed ElBaradei, a former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, asked the UK not to get involved in US plans for military convoys to protect oil tankers in the Gulf. Accusing the US of behaving like a \u201cbull in a china shop\u201d and taking the world down a dead-end street, he said the confrontational approach of the White House was not going to solve the threat posed to the nuclear deal by the US decision to withdraw from it. The UK claims it has not yet seen the details of the US proposal for coordinated international naval convoys through the Gulf. This is despite Trump having raised the proposal at the end of last month, before the G20 summit in Japan, emphasising that he wanted to see more Asian countries contributing to the cost of escorting tankers.

After the meeting Lim said: \u201c[My] primary concern is that merchant vessels, peaceably going about their business, should not be subjected to unprovoked attacks.\u201d The UK is increasingly caught in a vice, continuing to support the nuclear pact, while Iran slowly reduces its commitments under the deal in protest at Europe\u2019s failure to do more to circumvent the impact of US sanctions on EU firms that want to trade with Iran. Iran says the central agreement of the nuclear deal was that Tehran would permit close international oversight of its nuclear facilities in return for closer economic ties with the west. The tensions between the UK and Iran over the oil tankers has added another dimension. The UK does not have sufficient naval assets in the region to protect all British-owned shipping, but it would be wary if the US were effectively in sole command of any such operation. ElBaradei said: \u201cThey [the US] are applying a waterboarding method to Iran, drowning Iran and then saying to them: \u2018Let\u2019s have a dialogue without pre-conditions.\u2019\u201d He said he was horrified by the US policy on Iran. \u201cThe new crazies are going out of the way to look for confrontation.

It also came days before Trump-ordered nationwide raids targeting people in the US illegally are expected to begin, according to administration officials and immigrant activists, actions that would further inflame the issue.</p> <p>Before Friday\u2019s session began, the panel chairman Democrat Elijah Cummings of Maryland, released a report providing new details on 2,648 of the children the Trump administration separated from their families last year before abandoning that policy under widespread pressure. Unknown numbers of others were also separated.</p> <p>The report, using data the panel demanded from federal agencies, found that 18 children under age 2, half who were just months old, were kept from their parents up to half a year. Hundreds were held longer than previously revealed, including 25 kept over a year, and at least 30 remain apart from their parents.</p> <p>The figures reflect \u201ca deliberate, unnecessary and cruel choice by President Trump and his administration\u201d, the report said.</p> <p>Congress approved $4.6bn last month to help improve conditions. But that measure angered liberals who felt it lacked requirements forcing better treatment of migrants, prompting internal frictions that have yet to fully play out.</p> <p>New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 29-year-old progressive icon, was among the four Democrats who testified. After being sworn in at her request, she described migrant women telling her they had to sleep on the concrete floor and drink from the toilet because their cell\u2019s sink was broken.</p> <p>\u201cI believe these women,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat was worst about this was the fact that there were American flags hanging all over these facilities, that children were being separated from their parents in front of the American flag,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The Democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib of Michigan was near tears as she displayed a picture she said was of a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl the same age as her son who died in US custody. She criticized harsh policies \u201cintentionally and cruelly created by a Trump administration dead set on sending a hate-filled message that those seeking refuge are not welcome in America\u201d.</p> <p>Tlaib added, \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous ideology that rules our nation right now.\u201d</p> <p>Departing the White House, Trump told reporters without evidence that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019 account of women being told to drink from a toilet was \u201ca phony story she made it up\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e96061d53c66a048b2ae729dcf3e67775d866bd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e96061d53c66a048b2ae729dcf3e67775d866bd7/15_0_4866_2920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rashida Tlaib, center, wipes her eyes after testifying before the House oversight committee hearing on family separation and detention centers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rashida Tlaib, center, wipes her eyes after testifying before the House oversight committee hearing on family separation and detention centers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pablo Mart\u00ednez Monsiv\u00e1is/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Four border state Republicans sat at the same rectangular witness table as their Democratic counterparts and blamed Democrats for migrants\u2019 problems.</p> <p>Republican congressman Chip Roy of Texas mocked Democrats\u2019 border trip, accusing them of posing \u201cnext to an empty parking lot while making up hyperbole for clips, Twitter followers and cynical politics\u201d.

He responded, \u201cGod bless you\u201d in English and \u201cgracias\u201d in Spanish. \u201cEvery family I spoke to said they were being well-cared for,\u201d Pence said. The press was barred from speaking with any of the children or families to confirm Pence\u2019s account. Later Friday, Pence visited an outdoor portal at the McAllen border station, where 384 single men were being held in cages with no cots. Men in the portal told reporters that they had been detained for 40 days or more, that they were hungry and that they wanted to brush their teeth. \u201cI was not surprised by what I saw,\u201d Pence said. \u201cI knew we\u2019d see a system that was overwhelmed. This is tough stuff.\u201d Michael Banks, the border patrol agent in charge of the facility, said that the station was cleaned three times a day and air-conditioned \u2013 statements that the accompanying press corps questioned, given the sweltering heat and lack of cleanliness they witnessed. Earlier on Friday, a hearing of the House oversight and reform committee hearing offered a microcosm of the nation\u2019s red-blue chasm and, perhaps, a chance for each side to vent. The hearing came as the number of families, children and other migrants entering the US from Mexico has surged above 100,000 monthly since March, overwhelming federal agencies. It also came days before Trump-ordered nationwide raids targeting people in the US illegally are expected to begin, according to administration officials and immigrant activists, actions that would further inflame the issue. Before Friday\u2019s session began, the panel chairman Democrat Elijah Cummings of Maryland, released a report providing new details on 2,648 of the children the Trump administration separated from their families last year before abandoning that policy under widespread pressure. Unknown numbers of others were also separated. The report, using data the panel demanded from federal agencies, found that 18 children under age 2, half who were just months old, were kept from their parents up to half a year. Hundreds were held longer than previously revealed, including 25 kept over a year, and at least 30 remain apart from their parents. The figures reflect \u201ca deliberate, unnecessary and cruel choice by President Trump and his administration\u201d, the report said. Congress approved $4.6bn last month to help improve conditions. But that measure angered liberals who felt it lacked requirements forcing better treatment of migrants, prompting internal frictions that have yet to fully play out. New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 29-year-old progressive icon, was among the four Democrats who testified. After being sworn in at her request, she described migrant women telling her they had to sleep on the concrete floor and drink from the toilet because their cell\u2019s sink was broken. \u201cI believe these women,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat was worst about this was the fact that there were American flags hanging all over these facilities, that children were being separated from their parents in front of the American flag,\u201d she said. The Democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib of Michigan was near tears as she displayed a picture she said was of a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl the same age as her son who died in US custody. She criticized harsh policies \u201cintentionally and cruelly created by a Trump administration dead set on sending a hate-filled message that those seeking refuge are not welcome in America\u201d. Tlaib added, \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous ideology that rules our nation right now.\u201d Departing the White House, Trump told reporters without evidence that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019 account of women being told to drink from a toilet was \u201ca phony story she made it up\u201d. Four border state Republicans sat at the same rectangular witness table as their Democratic counterparts and blamed Democrats for migrants\u2019 problems. Republican congressman Chip Roy of Texas mocked Democrats\u2019 border trip, accusing them of posing \u201cnext to an empty parking lot while making up hyperbole for clips, Twitter followers and cynical politics\u201d. Ocasio-Cortez has 4.7 million Twitter followers. Roy said by not toughening immigration laws, Democrats have \u201ccreated the very magnet\u201d that attracts migrants to the US and said the House \u201ccowardly sits in the corner, doing nothing\u201d to address the problems that result. Last week a report by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general found children at some Texas border facilities who faced clothing shortages and lacked hot meals, while some adults were held for a week in a cell so crowded they had to stand.",

Protesters across the country demanded better treatment for migrants, as the Vice President and other GOP lawmakers visited a border patrol station in Texas where about 400 men were being held in abysmal conditions. Prosecutors accused financier Jeffrey Epstein of witness tampering, arguing that he should not be granted bail. The Federal Trade Commission to fine Facebook $5bn for Cambridge Analytica privacy violations Trump Labor secretary Alex Acosta resigned today, amid scrutiny of a lenient plea deal he approved for financier Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein is accused of sex trafficking. The House passed a bill to replenish the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund, a bill lobbied for by comedian and long-time ally of New York City first responders Jon Stewart. The House limited Trump\u2019s war powers after he said last month he does not need Congress\u2019s approval to launch a strike against Iran, which has had strained relations with the US since Trump pulled out of an Obama-era nuclear deal. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony could be delayed, although the change still appears \u201ctentative\u201d. Today, protesters across the country are holding vigils and marching, calling for an end to migrant detention centers. In Miami: In DC: And in Philly: Meanwhile, here are some dispatches from the Vice President and other GOP lawmakers\u2019 visit to a migrant detention center along the US-Mexico border in McAllen, Texas. According to a report from the press pool present at the visit, nearly 400 men were being \u201cin caged fences with no cots\u201d where \u201cthe stench was horrendous.\u201d The Trump administration filed a request asking the Supreme Court to unfreeze Pentagon funds to build parts of the border wall. Two lower courts last week blocked the government from using Defense Department counterdrug money to sections of the wall in Arizona, California and New Mexico. The AP explains: At stake is billions of dollars that would allow President Donald Trump to make progress on a major 2016 campaign promise heading into his race for a second term. Democratic lawmakers are thus far reacting with dismay to the reports of the FTC fining Facebook $5bn. Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon who has been a leader on privacy issues, released a statement comparing the fine to a \u201cmosquito bite\u201d, saying: Despite Republicans\u2019 promises to hold big tech accountable, the FTC appears to have failed miserably at its best opportunity to do so. No level of corporate fine can replace the necessity to hold Mark Zuckerberg personally responsible for the flagrant, repeated violations of Americans\u2019 privacy. That said, this reported fine is a mosquito bite to a corporation the size of Facebook. And I fear it will let Facebook off the hook for more recent abuses of Americans\u2019 data that may not have been factored in to this inadequate settlement. The only way to assure Americans that our private data will be protected is to pass a strong privacy bill, like the one I plan to introduce in the coming weeks. Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) was similarly unimpressed: Given Facebook\u2019s repeated privacy violations, it is clear that fundamental structural reforms are required. With the FTC either unable or unwilling to put in place reasonable guardrails to ensure that user privacy and data are protected, it\u2019s time for Congress to act. Congressman David Cicilline, who chairs the House subcommittee on antitrust, also criticized the settlement. Cicilline will have a chance to question a Facebook executive on Tuesday when representatives of several major Silicon Valley companies testify at a hearing of the antitrust committee. The Washington DC attorney general has issued subpoenas to the National Rifle Association as part of an investigation looking into financial misconduct allegations against the powerful gun lobbying organization. This adds to a growing mountain of troubles the NRA is facing, the AP reports: The NRA is involved in a number of legal tangles, some that threaten its very future. The New York attorney general\u2019s office is similarly investigating to determine if it has run afoul of laws that govern its nonprofit status. The NRA is chartered out of New York, while the NRA Foundation is chartered out of Washington. The U.S. Senate Finance Committee also has launched an investigation into the NRA\u2019s operations. At the same time, there is an ongoing factional war within the NRA, pitting some of its most ardent gun-rights supporters and loyalists against one another. The NRA has traded lawsuits with Ackerman McQueen, its longtime marketing firm that crafted some of its most prominent messages for decades. Months after filing its first lawsuit against the Oklahoma-based firm, the NRA officially severed ties last month. Another interesting tidbit: Prosecutors say they\u2019ve obtained documents indicating that he\u2019s worth more than $500,000, and earns at least $10,000,000 per year. The financier has been described (and has described himself) as a billionaire, but his true net worth has been somewhat mysterious. Because of his access to copious funds, the prosecutors argue that Epstein could be a flight risk. More from the letter: [E]ven were the defendant to sacrifice literally all of his current assets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or tens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States. He already earns at least $10,000,000 per year, according to records from Institution-1, while living in the U.S. Virgin Islands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be little to stop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknown assets abroad, and then continuing to do whatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of extradition The allegation that Jeffrey Epstein engaged in witness tampering was detailed in a letter that federal prosecutors filed today arguing that the financier should not be granted bail. They write that Epstein \u201cdemonstrated a willingness to use intimidation and aggressive tactics in connection with a criminal investigation.\u201d The document details that he transferred $250,000 an employee and $100,000 to another person -- both of whom were identified as possible \u201cco-conspirators.\u201d Here are some more selections from the document: Federal prosecutors say that Jeffrey Epstein, the financier charged with sex-trafficking in New York, wired $350,000 to two people who were potential witnesses against him. The New York Times is reporting: Mr. Epstein sent the money to the potential witnesses in late November and early December, 2018, shortly after the Miami Herald published an investigative report about a secret deal he had reached with the authorities in Florida to avoid federal prosecution, prosecutors said. The United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan made the new allegations in a court filing asking that Mr. Epstein be denied bail while he awaits trial, saying the payments were evidence that he might try to influence witnesses if he were not detained. The Trump administration is within its rights to punish so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d by withholding grants from police departments that refuse to work with federal immigration enforcement authorities, a federal appeals court decided. This means that the Justice Department is allowed to reward police departments that share records with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. LA Times reports: The decision by a panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals was a loss for the city of Los Angeles, which sued the federal government after it failed to win a \u201cCOPS\u201d community policing grant in 2017. A federal district judge ruled for the city, and the Trump administration appealed. In overturning the lower court, the 9th Circuit majority said nothing in the law that created the grant program prevents the Trump administration from giving extra points to agencies that focus on arresting immigrants in the U.S. without authorization. Julia Carrie Wong and Maanvi Singh, taking over here. Just in: The FTC has reported voted to fine Facebook $5bn to settle privacy violations. From The Guardian\u2019s story: The Federal Trade Commission has reportedly voted to approve fining Facebook roughly $5bn to settle an investigation into the company\u2019s privacy violations that was launched following the Cambridge Analytica revelations. The Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post, both citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter, reported Friday afternoon that the settlement was approved by a 3-2 vote that broke along party lines, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed. Trump Labor secretary Alex Acosta resigned today, amid scrutiny of a lenient plea deal he approved for financier Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein is accused of sex trafficking. Horrific conditions inside immigrant child detention centers were detailed in a Congressional hearing by attorneys who saw them firsthand. The House passed a bill to replenish the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund, a bill lobbied for by comedian and long-time ally of New York City first responders Jon Stewart. The House limited Trump\u2019s war powers after he said last month he does not need Congress\u2019s approval to launch a strike against Iran, which has had strained relations with the US since Trump pulled out of an Obama-era nuclear deal. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony could be delayed, although the change still appears \u201ctentative\u201d. Former Vice President Joe Biden has become a focus of immigrant rights activists, ahead of expected Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids on Sunday. Movimiento Cosecha, an immigrant rights group based in New Jersey, showed up to Biden\u2019s Philadelphia headquarters today protesting deportations under the Obama administration. This is from a Politico report on criticism of Biden: Biden needs to be accountable,\u201d said Joe Enriquez Henry, vice president of the Midwestern region of League of United Latin American Citizens, which is meeting for its annual convention in Milwaukee this week. \u201cBiden needs to make it clear, if he wants to be president, that he has compassion and understanding and he needs to ask for forgiveness.\u201d North Carolina\u2019s elections board wants to know who finances the companies that want to sell voting machines to the state. Apparently, those companies do not want to disclose that information. The questions come after Maryland discovered the company maintaining its election infrastructure was backed primarily by a Russian oligarch. North Carolina the country\u2019s ninth largest state by population is heating up as a market for voting equipment because the state has required touchscreen-only systems to be replaced after November with equipment that produces a paper record. The change will affect machines in about a third of the state\u2019s 100 counties. New voting systems purchased from approved companies could be in use for a decade. The three companies Omaha, Nebraska-based Election Systems &amp; Software; Boston-based Clear Ballot; and Austin, Texas-based Hart InterCivic were told to disclose anyone holding a 5% or greater stake, or in a parent company or any subsidiaries. All three private companies responded by listing their executives and equity funds as chief owners. And all three asked that even these responses be kept confidential. ... Turner says the back-and-forth shows that the federal government is better equipped than states are when it comes to trying to determine who really controls the handful of U.S. election-equipment makers. Washington should take on this task, to protect confidence in the country\u2019s voting system, Turner said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of many services that are of greater public importance than running our elections,\u201d said Lawrence Norden, an expert on voting machines with the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s law school. \u201cThe public should know who is doing that and who has control over the companies that are doing that.\u201d While Trump is promoting the agreement, it still must be approved by the US Congress. CNBC News, citing unnamed sources, said the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement is expected to be sent to Congress in September. President Trump is now delivering remarks on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (the new North American Free Trade Agreement) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He is delivering on the remarks the same day that he insulted former Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan. Here is a livestream where you can watch long with us. US women\u2019s national soccer team co-captain Megan Rapinoe has had an outspoken week sending some of her conservative critics into a tizzy. Here is a recap from Guardian US sports reporter Bryan Armen Graham\u2019s story. Ever since Trump seized on Kaepernick\u2019s anthem protest as a fountainhead of easy political points, the American right have been happy to co-opt US sports as not merely a proxy battle in the culture wars that reflect a country\u2019s deep divides but the primary theatre. And not since Kaepernick has a single athlete made them as uncomfortable as Rapinoe. She has only leaned into the criticism in the days since the team\u2019s World Cup triumph, doubling down on her refusal to visit the executive mansion in an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone on the team has any interest in lending the platform that we\u2019ve worked so hard to build and the things that we fight for and the way that we live our life, I don\u2019t think that we want that to be co-opted or corrupted by this administration.\u201d Police found three dozen cannabis plants in the flower beds of Vermont\u2019s statehouse after a visitor pointed out that the plants were in a walkway in front of the building. Police said the plants could either be hemp or marijuana, but they were not sure which. They removed 32 plants from the flower beds before finding another 2 plants. \u201cCapitol Police Chief Matthew Romei said he\u2019s fairly certain it was not part of the state\u2019s horticultural landscaping plan,\u201d reported local news station WIS10. Some of the best ways to beef up voting security and to fight off future cyber-attacks could have an unintended consequence: limiting access to the vote for people with disabilities, writes Jordan Wilkie: Voters want secure elections in 2020, and only moderate progress is being made at state and local levels, while Congress is deadlocked over elections security legislation. At the same time, voters with disabilities want to preserve and expand their access to the vote, a battle they have been fighting since at least the 1940s. It looks like an unsolvable dilemma: American elections will neither be fully secure nor fully accessible by 2020. But the debate over security versus accessibility presents a false dichotomy, according to Eddie Perez, the global director of technology development at the Open Source Election Technology Institute, a Silicon Valley not-for-profit working to increase the security and integrity of election technology. He believes a system can be worked out that pleases both sides. \u201cYou need to add in all of the variables including cost, operations, everything associated with implementations in all of their complexity, and only by looking at all of the tradeoffs in voting technology are we going to come to a reasonable assessment of which looks like a more or less optimal system,\u201d Perez said. Another big House vote this afternoon. With a 402-12 vote, Congress approved a bill that would ensure funding for the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund. The House voted in favor of the bill one month after comedian Jon Stewart chastised lawmakers for failing to pass the bill. Stewart said Friday that replenishing the victims fund was \u201cnecessary, urgent and morally right.\u201d The House has just voted to limit Trump\u2019s authority to make war in Iran as part of a bill which also restricts the president\u2019s budget request for the Pentagon. Republicans joined the majority Democrats for a 251-170 vote. The New York Times notes: Trump said last month he believes he does not need congressional approval to strike Iran. The vote Friday amounted to a pointed and bipartisan rebuttal \u2014 led by strange ideological bedfellows, Representatives Ro Khanna, a liberal Democrat from California, and Matt Gaetz of Florida, one of Trump\u2019s most strident Republican allies in Congress. \u201cWhen this passes, it will be a clear statement from members of Congress on both sides of the aisle that this country is tired of endless wars, that we do not want another war in the Middle East,\u201d Khanna said before the amendment vote. E Jean Carroll, the advice columnist who recently said Donald Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s, said for the first time in her life she had bullets loaded into the handgun in her bedroom. In an interview with the Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington, Carroll described the fallout of her decision to go public. Carroll told the Guardian she hesitated for years coming forward with her allegations because she was fearful, and because she suspected that branding Trump a sex attacker might paradoxically help him politically. \u201cIt\u2019s the image of a male leader \u2013 think Alexander the Great, think Genghis Khan. Think John F Kennedy. Great leaders take what they want without asking.\u201d Despite having raised rape allegations against the sitting US president, Carroll is convinced that Trump will win re-election in next year\u2019s presidential election. \u201cNo matter what anyone does, Trump will win. I think he\u2019s got it sewn up.\u201d Speaking of senior federal government positions that need permanent leaders, the Defense department has not had a confirmed defense chief for the longest stretch in Pentagon history. The Department of Defense is the largest employer in the world, including 1.3 million active-duty armed forces. There is not only no confirmed Secretary of Defense, there is also no confirmed deputy defense secretary, and other significant senior Pentagon positions are in flux. According to the AP: William Cohen, a former Republican senator who served as defense secretary during President Bill Clinton\u2019s second term, says U.S. allies \u2014 \u201cand even our foes\u201d \u2014 expect more stability than this within the US defense establishment. \u201cIt is needlessly disruptive to have a leadership vacuum for so long at the Department of Defense as the department prepares for its third acting secretary in less than a year,\u201d Cohen told the Associated Press. He said he worries about the cumulative effect of moving from one acting secretary to another while other key positions lack permanent officials. Alexander Acosta, the US labor secretary under fire for having granted Jeffrey Epstein immunity from federal prosecution in 2008, resigned this morning. Donald Trump told reporters Acosta called him this morning and that it was the secretary\u2019s decision. Acosta\u2019s resignation means yet another senior federal government position currently filled by a non-permanent or acting chief. The other positions in need of a permanent leader are: Defense secretary, Homeland Security secretary, Labor secretary and White House chief of staff. Special counsel Robert Mueller, who was due to testify in Congress on Wednesday, is not going to testify next week, according to Politico. Instead, he could testify on 24 July and would speak longer than originally planned. Lawmakers, advocates and government auditors described the inhumane conditions at border patrol facilities in a House oversight committee hearing, that will continue into the afternoon. An immigration lawyer who visited one of these facilities said she didn\u2019t have the words to describe what she saw to her own young children. Axios is reporting that Donald Trump is seeking to remove Dan Coats as director of national intelligence, citing five anonymous sources: Trump hasn\u2019t told our sources when he plans to make a move, but they say his discussions on the topic have been occurring for months \u2014 often unprompted \u2014 and the president has mentioned potential replacements since at least February. A source who spoke to Trump about Coats a week ago said the president gave them the impression that the move would happen \u201csooner rather than later.\u201d Among those speaking before the House oversight committee now is Elora Mukherjee, professor of law and director of Columbia Law School\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Clinic, and Jennifer Nagda, policy director at the Young Center for Immigrant Children\u2019s Rights. Both women spoke to the Guardian last week about the conditions at detention center\u2019s and what needed to be done to improve conditions. Mukherjee is one of six attorneys who visited the Clint detention facility, where she encountered an overwhelming stench from children who hadn\u2019t received a change of clothes. \u201cChildren were hungry, children were traumatized and some wept in their interviews with me,\u201d Mukherjee said. She said one little girl she spoke to could only say \u201cI\u2019m scared, I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m scared\u201d and couldn\u2019t even say her own name. \u201cNot being able to do anything for her, broke my heart,\u201d Mukherjee said. She said colleagues found a newborn had been detained for a week and an eight-month-old had been detained for weeks. The US government operates facilities meant to hold and care for migrant children on their own, run by the Health department, and also has the power to release families pending their court date. Mukherjee, near tears, tells the story of a six-year-old boy she said she can\u2019t forget. He was so inconsolable, he couldn\u2019t speak, so she just held him. She says Border Patrol agents eventually gave him a lollipop to get him to leave the conference room he was being interviewed in and to go back to his cell. Here was a boy the same age as my son, stuck in a hell hole. Mukherjee says she doesn\u2019t have the words to describe to her children, aged 3, 6 and 9, what she witnessed. The Guardian spoke with Mukherjee for the Today in Focus podcast, which you can listen to here: Alexander Acosta\u2019s resignation was spurred by criticism of his handling of a 2008 plea deal with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, who is awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking underage girls. Acosta\u2019s role in the Epstein case was subject to new scrutiny because of an investigation by the Miami Herald. Earlier this week, the New York Times did a fantastic profile of the Miami Herald investigative journalists who broke the story. Representative Veronica Escobar, a Democrat in El Paso, just testified before the House oversight committee about how her city was able to respond to an influx of migrants, while the government blames horrible conditions in detention centers on a lack of resources. \u201cThere is no doubt that the increasing number of migrants at our southern border has presented a challenge,\u201d Escobar said. \u201cUnfortunately, in the last two years, our country has failed to live up to our founding values when addressing that challenge.\u201d My community, with a fraction of the resources available to the federal government, has responded more strategically, thoughtfully, and compassionately than the federal government has. We have always known this is not a matter of resources, but a matter of will. El Paso has had to stand up shelters on a moment\u2019s notice, transport hundreds of migrants daily, using only volunteers, and we\u2019ve opened our wallets and our hearts to ensure every one of those vulnerable souls has a clean, safe place to stay once out of custody. Patrick Pizzella, the deputy labor secretary, will be acting labor secretary now that Alexander Acosta has resigned, said Donald Trump. \u201cHighly recommended by Alex,\u201d Trump said. \u201cGoing to be acting. He\u2019s already been told.\u201d On Acosta, Trump said: \u201cHe made a deal that people were happy with and then 12 years later, they\u2019re not happy with it. You\u2019ll have to figure that all out.\u201d He said Acosta called him in the morning to resign. Trump added: \u201cHe\u2019s a Hispanic man. He went to Harvard \u2013 a great student. And in so many ways I just hate what he\u2019s saying now because we\u2019re going to miss him.\u201d Special counsel Robert Mueller, who was due to testify in Congress on Wednesday, is not going to testify next week, according to Politico. Instead, he could testify on 24 July and would speak longer than originally planned. It\u2019s worth noting that both these reporters (Sherman from Politico; Beavers from the Hill) have used the words \u201cfluid\u201d and \u201ctentative\u201d to describe the change. For the second time this week, the House oversight committee is investigating the government\u2019s treatment of migrant children. The hearing just began and will focus on family separation - a policy that officially came to an end in June 2018 amid a cloud of secrecy about how families were being tracked and how children were being cared for. While mass family separations have come to an end, family separations happened at a smaller scale before the policy was announced in April 2018 and continue today. This hearing comes as the Trump administration faces heightened scrutiny because of reports about inhumane conditions for children in border detention centers. We\u2019ll be posting updates from that hearing through the morning, including testimony from human rights advocates who have met with children on the border and the former Trump official who helped oversee family separation, Thomas Homan. Speaking next to Alexander Acosta, Donald Trump said Acosta was a \u201cgreat labor secretary not a good one,\u201d according to the White House pool. Trump also said he did a \u201cvery good job.\u201d He said Acosta explained his decision about Epstein in an hour-long press conference this week. Alexander Acosta, the US labor secretary under fire for having granted Jeffrey Epstein immunity from federal prosecution in 2008, after the billionaire was investigated for having run a child sex trafficking ring, has resigned, according to the White House pool. The president told reporters Acosta called him this morning and that it was the secretary\u2019s decision. Some great background reading on the furore around Acosta here: To end the week, the Friday newsletter of Politico Playbook makes the case that Trump\u2019s leadership style is \u201cmore volatile than ever.\u201d This analysis appears inspired by Trump\u2019s recent reuse of his claim that he is a \u201cstable genius.\u201d WHAT\u2019S GOING ON? It\u2019s doubtful the president has changed much, and you can no longer say the Mueller investigation is weighing on him. Here\u2019s a theory: Past aides were skilled at reading his intentions, understanding what to ignore and knowing how to redirect his whims. But recently, the administration has been unable to keep up with a president whose unstructured decision-making process has him in different positions in a few hours. For White House reporters, just trying to pin down basic facts of what the administration is doing from day to day has become a funhouse of mirrors -- adding to the confusion. Here\u2019s the full look at Paul Ryan\u2019s comments in excerpts of American Carnage published Thursday in the Washington Post. As House speaker, Ryan pushed through Donald Trump\u2019s agenda in Congress. Before Trump was elected, Ryan was critical of Trump\u2019s fitness to be president. Now, Ryan, who doesn\u2019t hold political office, is back to being critical. Some excerpts shared by the Post: \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten so numbed by it all,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cNot in government, but where we live our lives, we have a responsibility to try and rebuild. Don\u2019t call a woman a \u2018horse face.\u2019 Don\u2019t cheat on your wife. Don\u2019t cheat on anything. Be a good person. Set a good example.\u201d \u201cI told myself I gotta have a relationship with this guy [Trump] to help him get his mind right,\u201d Ryan recalls. \u201cBecause, I\u2019m telling you, he didn\u2019t know anything about government . . . I wanted to scold him all the time.\u201d \u201cThose of us around him really helped to stop him from making bad decisions. All the time,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cWe helped him make much better decisions, which were contrary to kind of what his knee-jerk reaction was. Now I think he\u2019s making some of these knee-jerk reactions.\u201d Good morning and happy Friday Donald Trump, the first president to routinely bully critics on social media, followed up his social media summit last night by attacking former house speaker Paul Ryan on Twitter. Ryan said the nation had grown \u201cnumb\u201d to the president In a book excerpt from American Carnage published on Thursday. Ryan also said it was not good for a government official to call a woman \u201chorse face\u201d, as Trump, while president, has done. The president ignored it and let his record ... just kidding, the president of the United States responded by tweeting some insults about Ryan. Trump will be at a fundraiser today in Wisconsin, which Ryan represented in Congress. The president will then give a speech about a North American trade agreement, then off to Ohio for another fundraiser. Meanwhile in DC, the House oversight committee will hold a hearing this morning on family separation \u2013 two days after the same committee questioned migrants, advocates and government officials about conditions for children in migrant detention. We\u2019ll have rolling updates and analysis from that hearing today.",
