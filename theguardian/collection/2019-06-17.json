A group of queer and gender diverse teens learn to rely on each other, against a backdrop of a zombie apocalypse. Evans\u2019s first novel, Ida, won the Victorian Premier\u2019s People\u2019s Choice award in 2017, and it is clear both books have found their niche; bleak settings that capture the beauty and diversity in queer relationships and found family.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://marleejaneward.com/\">Prisoncorp by Marlee Jane Ward</a> (Brio Books)</strong><br><em>For fans of Veronica Roth\u2019s Divergent series</em></p> <p>This is the final instalment of Ward\u2019s dystopian series, following the prize-winning novella Welcome to Orphancorp and its sequel, Psynode. In the first installation, 17-year-old Mirii Mahoney is about to age out of the brutal orphanage Orphancorp, while in this one she is held in a harsh desert prison. The trilogy follows Mirii\u2019s experiences of escape and rebellion, and many of the characters in the book are queer and gender diverse.

While it includes writers of diverse sexualities and genders, including First Nations writers, writers who identity as people of colour, and disabled writers,it does not include intersex, asexual or aromantic narratives. However, it is undoubtedly the book that many will wish they had when they were younger as it portrays the diverse range of life experiences of young queer Australians without fixating on the traditional coming-out narrative.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/603833/how-it-feels-to-float-by-helena-fox/9780525554295/\">How it Feels to Float by Helena Fox</a> (Dial Books)</strong><br><em>For fans of Patrick Ness\u2019s The Rest of Us Just Live Here</em></p> <p>Fox\u2019s debut young adult fiction novel is a poignant look at grief, mental illness, love and friendship. Biz sees and converses with her late father, who died when she was seven, which contributes to her unravelling. The rich and poetic prose captures Biz\u2019s suffering, and those living with mental illness or caring for loved ones will find Fox\u2019s depiction powerful and realistic, if not excruciatingly accurate.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Morning mail\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.hardiegrant.com/au/publishing/bookfinder/book/amelia-westlake-by-erin-gough/9781760127152\">Amelia Westlake by Erin Gough</a> (Hardie Grant Egmont)</strong><br><em>For fans of Alice Pung\u2019s Laurinda, Erin Gough\u2019s debut The Flywheel, David Levithan\u2019s The Realm of Possibility</em></p> <p>This playful and gripping young adult novel is set in a sexist, racist and homophobic Sydney private school.

Frederick William Campbell was a CSIRO scientist involved in trials to create artificial rain for drought-stricken areas. After a thoughtful explanatory prologue, the book propels the reader into the action of past events and Campbell\u2019s attempts to grapple with the loss of her father with tremendous skill. Campbell\u2019s writing is both tightly controlled and experimental, while the personal stories are tenderly researched and interwoven with history.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s Pride month. To celebrate, we\u2019ve rounded up 10 Australian books that explore the many different aspects of queer identity and indicate the experimental, creative and analytical writing taking place in LGBT+ communities. In the current political climate, many people have questions about diverse gender identities and sexualities. The books on this list, including fiction, nonfiction, poetry, young adult books and a children\u2019s picture book, offer readers opportunities to be entertained, informed and moved. Children\u2019s and young adult fiction A House for Everyone: A Story to help Children learn about Gender Identity and Gender Expression by Jo Hirst (Jessica Kingsley Publishers) For fans of Jessica Walton\u2019s Introducing Teddy, Vivek Shraya\u2019s The Boy &amp; the Bindi A powerful follow-up to The Gender Fairy, this children\u2019s picture book breaks down gender stereotypes and identities in a relatable, inclusive story that is easy for children to understand. Set in a school playground, a group of children work to build a house together. The engaging story could be used as an educational resource to introduce the topic of gender identity, either individually or in a classroom. Highway Bodies by Alison Evans (Echo) For fans of The Walking Dead Regardless of how you feel about post-apocalyptic survival stories or zombies, this is a must-read. A group of queer and gender diverse teens learn to rely on each other, against a backdrop of a zombie apocalypse. Evans\u2019s first novel, Ida, won the Victorian Premier\u2019s People\u2019s Choice award in 2017, and it is clear both books have found their niche; bleak settings that capture the beauty and diversity in queer relationships and found family. Prisoncorp by Marlee Jane Ward (Brio Books) For fans of Veronica Roth\u2019s Divergent series This is the final instalment of Ward\u2019s dystopian series, following the prize-winning novella Welcome to Orphancorp and its sequel, Psynode. In the first installation, 17-year-old Mirii Mahoney is about to age out of the brutal orphanage Orphancorp, while in this one she is held in a harsh desert prison. The trilogy follows Mirii\u2019s experiences of escape and rebellion, and many of the characters in the book are queer and gender diverse. It is both an engaging story and a biting social commentary for young people and adults alike. Kindred: 12 Queer #LoveOzYA Stories edited by Michael Earp (Walker Books) For fans of Rebecca Lim\u2019s Meet Me at the Intersection Earp has brought together 12 LGBTQ+ authors to write young adult short stories for this remarkable collection, including Jax Jacki Brown, Christos Tsiolkas, Benjamin Law, Ellen van Neerven and Nevo Zisin. While it includes writers of diverse sexualities and genders, including First Nations writers, writers who identity as people of colour, and disabled writers,it does not include intersex, asexual or aromantic narratives. However, it is undoubtedly the book that many will wish they had when they were younger as it portrays the diverse range of life experiences of young queer Australians without fixating on the traditional coming-out narrative. How it Feels to Float by Helena Fox (Dial Books) For fans of Patrick Ness\u2019s The Rest of Us Just Live Here Fox\u2019s debut young adult fiction novel is a poignant look at grief, mental illness, love and friendship. Biz sees and converses with her late father, who died when she was seven, which contributes to her unravelling. The rich and poetic prose captures Biz\u2019s suffering, and those living with mental illness or caring for loved ones will find Fox\u2019s depiction powerful and realistic, if not excruciatingly accurate. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Amelia Westlake by Erin Gough (Hardie Grant Egmont) For fans of Alice Pung\u2019s Laurinda, Erin Gough\u2019s debut The Flywheel, David Levithan\u2019s The Realm of Possibility This playful and gripping young adult novel is set in a sexist, racist and homophobic Sydney private school. Bad girl Wilhelmina and preppy Harriet Price devise a plan to expose the inappropriate and misogynistic behaviour of their teacher through a series of pranks. Readers seeking representation of queer identities and feminism in a high school setting will be delighted by the twists and turns, the characters\u2019 activism and, more than likely, the budding romance. Adult fiction and nonfiction The Man on the Mantelpiece: A Memoir by Marion May Campbell (UWA Publishing) For fans of Jeanette Winterson\u2019s Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal? Marion May Campbell\u2019s must-read memoir is about the traumatic fallout from her father\u2019s death at the age of 37 when his aircraft came down during an electrical storm. Frederick William Campbell was a CSIRO scientist involved in trials to create artificial rain for drought-stricken areas. After a thoughtful explanatory prologue, the book propels the reader into the action of past events and Campbell\u2019s attempts to grapple with the loss of her father with tremendous skill. Campbell\u2019s writing is both tightly controlled and experimental, while the personal stories are tenderly researched and interwoven with history. An important addition to Australian historical, literary and queer biographies. The Lost Arabs by Omar Sakr (UQP) For fans of Ellen van Neerven\u2019s Comfort Food, Quinn Eades\u2019 Rallying Omar Sakr\u2019s latest poetry collection is as thrilling as it is accomplished. It is rare for such a collection to be a page-turner but his poetry demands to be read, digested and re-read soon after. Sakr\u2019s evident confidence as a poet allows him to deftly juggle themes around family, faith, sexuality, identity and belonging. The collection looks set to make its mark internationally with publisher UQP recently selling the English-language rights in the United States. Colouring the Rainbow: Blak Queer and Trans Perspectives edited by Dino Hodge (Wakefield Press) For fans of Ellen van Neerven\u2019s Heat and Light The essays by 22 First Nations writers in this vital collection range in tone, style and structure but the moving themes, ideas and experiences will resonate with many readers. The collection brings together ideas about gender, sexuality, race and identity that should be considered in contemporary debates and discussions about queer communities, especially in relation to future directions for policy, curriculum and inclusion practices. Queerstories: Reflections on Lives Well Lived from some of Australia\u2019s Finest LGBTQIA+ Writers edited by Maeve Marsden (Hachette Australia) For fans of Maria Pallotta-Chiarolli\u2019s anthology Living and Loving in Diversity This collection of essays lives up to its evocative title. Writers including Nayuka Gorrie, Candy Bowers, Kelly Azizi, Mama Alto, Rebecca Shaw and the late Candy Royalle share stories that vary from intimate confessions and personal reflections to politically charged and historically connected pieces exploring oppression. An excellent reflection of Australia\u2019s contemporary queer, transgender and gender diverse writing scene.",

The new signs bearing the silhouette of the animal in a red triangle will be placed in areas where the accident risk is highest and will also be used to warn about squirrels, badgers, otters and other small animals crossing. Ministers announced the proposed new signage on Monday as part of a scheme to reduce the number of animal road deaths and the number of accidents caused by people swerving to avoid animals or motorcyclists skidding on roadkill. Hedgehog numbers have fallen by more than half in the UK countryside since 2000, with roads a particular hazard for the mammals because they curl up into a ball in the face of danger.

      "bodyText": "A spectacular footbridge that will link the Cornish mainland with the island fortress of Tintagel is beginning to take shape thanks to technology usually employed for challenging construction projects in the Swiss Alps. Hefty sections of steel, each weighing up to 4.5 tonnes, have arrived in Tintagel village having been manufactured off-site and are being manoeuvred into place this week. The 70-metre-long bridge is to comprise of two cantilevers, one reaching out from the mainland to the island where according to legend King Arthur was conceived. The other stretches back towards the mainland but the two will not quite meet, creating a 40mm gap. For hundreds of years, since the collapse of a narrow natural land bridge that used to reach out to the rocky headland on which the castle sits, tourists, poets, hikers and Arthur enthusiasts have had to scramble up and down hundreds of steps and across a modest wooden bridge to visit the attraction. English Heritage, the custodian of the site, decided that a bridge would improve access, recreate the historical crossing between the mainland and island and help to conserve and protect the landscape. The bridge was designed by Ney &amp; Partners and William Matthews Associates, and English Heritage said the remote location and challenging landscape called for an innovative approach. The footbridge will be installed without scaffolding or free-standing supports and instead an unusual cable crane has been constructed for the task. Using technology pioneered in the Swiss Alps, the cable crane has already been used to deliver materials to the site, put in place the rock anchors and build the foundations for the bridge. Now it is being called into action to drop each of the 12 prefabricated sections of the bridge into place. \u201cThis is the moment we\u2019ve all been looking forward to,\u201d said Georgia Butters, English Heritage\u2019s head of historic properties in Cornwall. \u201cPreparation work for the bridge began in the autumn, with the installation of the rock anchors and foundations, but this is when we can start to see all that work really coming together. \u201cFollowing the arrival of the first pieces this week we will quickly see the bridge take shape. It will be a spectacular new addition to the site, and will hugely improve the experience and access for our visitors.\u201d English Heritage says the new footbridge will follow the path of the original land bridge, allowing visitors to experience the castle as its historic inhabitants once did. The original narrow access point gave rise to the stronghold\u2019s name, the Cornish Din Tagell, meaning \u201cthe fortress of the narrow entrance\u201d. Tintagel Castle attracts almost 250,000 visitors each year and English Heritage says the new footbridge will help to reduce congestion, especially at peak periods, and provide a step-free route to the island. The apparent progress will please local business people who say they have lost out because the castle has been closed to the public during the construction of the bridge. When the site reopens, timed ticketing will be introduced to manage the number of people visiting. The designers say the 40mm gap is designed to offer visitors a sense of transition between the mainland and the island. The design team was chosen in March 2016 following an international competition involving 137 architects and engineers.",

      "body": "<p>Reality TV shows such as Love Island are encouraging children and young people to smoke or drink under age by showing contestants regularly engaging in both pursuits, public health experts warn.</p> <p>An analysis of how often alcohol and tobacco were depicted or referenced in five popular reality series found they featured much more often in those programmes than on other primetime shows.</p> <p>The study, by researchers at Nottingham University, concluded: \u201cReality TV programmes are a major source of exposure to young people in the UK and is likely to be a contributor to smoking and alcohol uptake by young people.\u201d</p> <p>Ofcom\u2019s broadcasting code restricts the use of depictions of alcohol or tobacco in programmes aimed at children and discourages depiction of either substance in a way that would glamourise their consumption in any programme shown before the 9pm children\u2019s viewing \u201cwatershed\u201d.</p> <p>Despite this restriction, researchers led by Alexander Barker found: \u201cReality TV programmes, while usually broadcast after the 9pm watershed, are widely seen and accessed by young people and that this genre of programme is exposing young people to tobacco and alcohol content.\u201d</p> <p>The ease with which under-18s can watch such programmes on catch-up services make it hard to stop them seeing shows in which both substances feature often, the report said.</p> <p>The academics reached their findings after watching 112 episodes between January and August last year from the five shows Love Island, The Only Way is Essex, Geordie Shore, Made in Chelsea and Celebrity Big Brother. The latter was axed last September after 18 years on screen.</p> <p>The makers of Love Island stopped featuring smoking after its depiction in the 2017 series led to a backlash. There was no tobacco content in the 2018 series, according to the study <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdz043\">published in the Journal of Public Health</a>.</p> <p>Alcohol appeared in all 112 episodes and also in 2,212 one-minute clips, which made up 42% of all clips the researchers looked at.

      "bodyText": "Reality TV shows such as Love Island are encouraging children and young people to smoke or drink under age by showing contestants regularly engaging in both pursuits, public health experts warn. An analysis of how often alcohol and tobacco were depicted or referenced in five popular reality series found they featured much more often in those programmes than on other primetime shows. The study, by researchers at Nottingham University, concluded: \u201cReality TV programmes are a major source of exposure to young people in the UK and is likely to be a contributor to smoking and alcohol uptake by young people.\u201d Ofcom\u2019s broadcasting code restricts the use of depictions of alcohol or tobacco in programmes aimed at children and discourages depiction of either substance in a way that would glamourise their consumption in any programme shown before the 9pm children\u2019s viewing \u201cwatershed\u201d. Despite this restriction, researchers led by Alexander Barker found: \u201cReality TV programmes, while usually broadcast after the 9pm watershed, are widely seen and accessed by young people and that this genre of programme is exposing young people to tobacco and alcohol content.\u201d The ease with which under-18s can watch such programmes on catch-up services make it hard to stop them seeing shows in which both substances feature often, the report said. The academics reached their findings after watching 112 episodes between January and August last year from the five shows Love Island, The Only Way is Essex, Geordie Shore, Made in Chelsea and Celebrity Big Brother. The latter was axed last September after 18 years on screen. The makers of Love Island stopped featuring smoking after its depiction in the 2017 series led to a backlash. There was no tobacco content in the 2018 series, according to the study published in the Journal of Public Health. Alcohol appeared in all 112 episodes and also in 2,212 one-minute clips, which made up 42% of all clips the researchers looked at. Drink being consumed was featured in 18% of the one-minute clips, while inferred alcohol consumption \u2013 mainly characters holding drinks \u2013 was in 34% of clips. Love Island had the highest alcohol content, while Geordie Shore contained the most alcohol branding, showing it in 69% of episodes, and featuring 40 brands altogether. While tobacco featured in 20 of the 112 episodes, that was almost all in Celebrity Big Brother. Reality TV shows have also been accused of making people insecure about their appearance, and possibly resorting to cosmetic procedures, and of putting such strain on participants that they can develop mental health problems. Two former Love Island contestants took their own lives in 2018 and 2019. Toby Green, tobacco policy lead at the Royal Society for Public Health, said: \u201cThe new findings show completely unacceptable levels of exposure of these harmful products to our children and young people.\u201d Responsible broadcasters should regard the high alcohol and tobacco content of reality shows as \u201csurely unacceptable\u201d, Green added. The amount of smoking shown risks \u201crenormalising\u201d a habit that kills 100,000 Britons a year, he said. Given the number of viewers they attracted overall, the 112 episodes delivered what researchers estimated to be 4.9bn alcohol impressions in the UK, including 580m to under-16s, and 214m tobacco impressions, of which 47m were seen by the same age group. Barker said: \u201cGiven that seeing alcohol or tobacco imagery in the media promotes use among young people, our study therefore identifies reality television shows as a major potential driver of alcohol and tobacco consumption in young people in the UK. \u201cTighter scheduling rules, such as restricting the amount of content and branding shown in these programmes, could prevent children and adolescents from being exposed to the tobacco and alcohol content.\u201d",

Waiting times will keep getting worse, hospitals will remain overstretched and efforts to reduce ill-health will falter without a further major injection of cash, they claim in a new analysis. The department of health and social care\u2019s (DHSC) budget is due to rise to \u00a3155bn in 2023/24 as a result of the \u00a320.5bn extra a year Theresa May promised last year to mark the NHS\u2019s 70th birthday.

The warning and plea for extra cash are contained in a new analysis by the Health Foundation thinktank published on Tuesday and endorsed by the NHS Confederation, which represents hospital bosses. Despite May\u2019s pledge, ministers must realise that NHS funding remains \u201cunfinished business\u201d if it is to expand and improve the care it provides, said Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation.

The other \u00a31.2bn that makes up the \u00a38bn would go on the budgets of the DHSC itself, the Care Quality Commission and NHS Blood and Transplant.

      "bodyText": "The big question for punters on day one at this Royal Ascot is: how many excuses do you make for a horse who was brilliant last year but has yet to show it this season? Too Darn Hot is the relevant animal and he probably still has bundles of talent, despite being winless since autumn. But Phoenix Of Spain (4.20) beat him fair and square in the Irish Guineas and I hope to see Charlie Hills\u2019s grey confirm the form of that three-length success in the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes. Reportedly, he had a troubled preparation for that outing and may well be better again here. He got within two lengths of Too Darn Hot in September, looking very much like a horse who would do better with time, so there surely was no fluke about his Classic win. The progressive King Of Comedy could be a threat and his trainer pinched this race with an animal of modest talent last year but this renewal looks stronger. 2.30 Queen Anne Stakes It is surprising that Sir Michael Stoute has won this race only three times, and not for 17 years, especially as he has a record eight wins in the Lockinge Stakes, the most obvious trial. That thought is something of a brake on enthusiasm for his most recent Lockinge winner, Mustashry, but it is hard to forget the powerful finish he produced at Newbury and this steady improver is fairly priced at 5-1. Le Brivido is finally drifting to a reasonable price but has not won for two years. 3.05 Coventry Stakes This race was immediately named as the target when Threat was an impressive winner on Guineas weekend, showing professionalism to beat an odds-on favourite and proving hard to pull up. There should be plenty more to come from Richard Hannon\u2019s chestnut.

If the builder goes bankrupt, dies or disappears, your warranty could become impossible to enforce.</p> <p>Philip Gall, the chairman of the Owners Corporation Network, says the current warranty is too short and too imprecise.</p> <p>\u201cWhat often happens is the builder or developer, to avoid their warranty obligations, wind up the companies,\u201d he says. \u201cThen there is nobody for the owners to pursue for defects.</p> <p>\u201cAnd there is always an argument as to what a \u2018defect\u2019 is.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d be able to do that with a fridge but you can\u2019t do that with an apartment. That is just appalling.\u201d</p> <p>For the residents of Mascot Towers, built 10 years ago, they are no longer covered by warranty.</p> <h2><strong>What about insurance?</strong></h2> <p>This has changed a lot over the years, and gone through various names and reforms.</p> <p>If your warranty is over, some buildings can access an insurance scheme that will pay for repairs, known as <a href=\"https://www.sira.nsw.gov.au/insurance-coverage/home-building-compensation-insurance/advice-for-homeowners/how-youre-protected\">home building compensation (HBC)</a>.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.sira.nsw.gov.au/insurance-coverage/home-building-compensation-insurance/getting-home-building-compensation-insurance/hbc-exemptions\">a 2002 change to NSW legislation</a> means you are only covered if your apartment building is shorter than three storeys.</p> <p>Previously, it was known as compulsory homeowner warranty insurance, and applied to all buildings, regardless of height.</p> <p>\u201cMany years ago, I had this experience myself [where the builder disappeared],\u201d Gall says. \u201cIn the days when the homeowner warranty insurance was still around, we were able to get a large proportion of the cost of the defect paid for. You can\u2019t do that any more.\u201d</p> <p>To fill that gap, in January 2018, the NSW government created a version of insurance for taller buildings, known as <a href=\"https://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/housing-and-property/strata-building-bond-and-inspections-scheme\">the strata building bond</a>.</p> <p>Under these rules, the developer pays 2% of the building contract price into a fund, held by the government, to repair any defects that are discovered within two years. After two years, the money is given back to the developer.</p> <p>But Gall also criticised this as too little. \u201cThe problem is that two years is too short for these defects to become apparent, and 2% is way too small.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>If I\u2019m buying an apartment now, what can I do to protect myself?</strong></h2> <p>Gall is blunt. \u201cDon\u2019t buy a new apartment over three storeys. Don\u2019t do it.\u201d</p> <p>His advice is to aim for buildings that are older than 10 years, to inspect the strata minutes, and, if you have the money, get an independent certifier to check the building.</p> <p>Buyers are entitled to look at the minutes of strata meetings to get a glimpse of the condition of the building.</p> <p>\u201cSee whether they have had to deal with issues in those buildings,\u201d Gall says. \u201cYou can get a pretty good idea in a 10-year-old building whether there are problems.\u201d</p> <p>If you have thousands of dollars spare, you can also pay for someone to inspect the building but it\u2019s not a guarantee.</p> <p>\u201cYou can get an independent certifier,\u201d Gall says. \u201cThere are quite an industry of building consultants who will go and have a really good look at the building.</p> <p>\u201cBut it is expensive. And almost all of these folk won\u2019t do what is called destructive inspection \u2013 it\u2019s just visual. If a crack has been filled in and painted over, they won\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>For example, Gall says he doubts the fault in Mascot Tower could be picked up with an independent inspection.</p> <p>\u201cOnce a building is built, to get a 100% reassurance from an independent expert is impossible,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThere are good developers and good builders out there but you don\u2019t know who they are anymore.

      "bodyText": "With faults and cracks discovered over the weekend in Sydney\u2019s Mascot Towers apartment complex \u2013 and similar cracks in Opal Tower six months ago \u2013 the spotlight is back on the quality of New South Wales apartment buildings. Research from the University of NSW in 2015 found that 85% of new apartment buildings had defects at completion \u2013 mostly with waterproofing and fire detection systems \u2013 and the certification system had \u201cbroken down\u201d. With renewed debate around certification and building quality, Guardian Australia looked at the current consumer protections available in the state for those who recently bought an apartment, or are about to. What warranties do I have if I buy a new apartment in NSW? Six years for major defects, two years for other issues. If you buy an apartment, you have a a statutory warranty under NSW law \u2013 but it starts from when the building is finished, not when the apartment was purchased. And it only applies between the buyer and the builder \u2013 not the developer or architect. If the builder goes bankrupt, dies or disappears, your warranty could become impossible to enforce. Philip Gall, the chairman of the Owners Corporation Network, says the current warranty is too short and too imprecise. \u201cWhat often happens is the builder or developer, to avoid their warranty obligations, wind up the companies,\u201d he says. \u201cThen there is nobody for the owners to pursue for defects. \u201cAnd there is always an argument as to what a \u2018defect\u2019 is. \u201cYou\u2019d be able to do that with a fridge but you can\u2019t do that with an apartment. That is just appalling.\u201d For the residents of Mascot Towers, built 10 years ago, they are no longer covered by warranty. What about insurance? This has changed a lot over the years, and gone through various names and reforms. If your warranty is over, some buildings can access an insurance scheme that will pay for repairs, known as home building compensation (HBC). But a 2002 change to NSW legislation means you are only covered if your apartment building is shorter than three storeys. Previously, it was known as compulsory homeowner warranty insurance, and applied to all buildings, regardless of height. \u201cMany years ago, I had this experience myself [where the builder disappeared],\u201d Gall says. \u201cIn the days when the homeowner warranty insurance was still around, we were able to get a large proportion of the cost of the defect paid for. You can\u2019t do that any more.\u201d To fill that gap, in January 2018, the NSW government created a version of insurance for taller buildings, known as the strata building bond. Under these rules, the developer pays 2% of the building contract price into a fund, held by the government, to repair any defects that are discovered within two years. After two years, the money is given back to the developer. But Gall also criticised this as too little. \u201cThe problem is that two years is too short for these defects to become apparent, and 2% is way too small.\u201d If I\u2019m buying an apartment now, what can I do to protect myself? Gall is blunt. \u201cDon\u2019t buy a new apartment over three storeys. Don\u2019t do it.\u201d His advice is to aim for buildings that are older than 10 years, to inspect the strata minutes, and, if you have the money, get an independent certifier to check the building. Buyers are entitled to look at the minutes of strata meetings to get a glimpse of the condition of the building. \u201cSee whether they have had to deal with issues in those buildings,\u201d Gall says. \u201cYou can get a pretty good idea in a 10-year-old building whether there are problems.\u201d If you have thousands of dollars spare, you can also pay for someone to inspect the building but it\u2019s not a guarantee. \u201cYou can get an independent certifier,\u201d Gall says. \u201cThere are quite an industry of building consultants who will go and have a really good look at the building. \u201cBut it is expensive. And almost all of these folk won\u2019t do what is called destructive inspection \u2013 it\u2019s just visual. If a crack has been filled in and painted over, they won\u2019t know.\u201d For example, Gall says he doubts the fault in Mascot Tower could be picked up with an independent inspection. \u201cOnce a building is built, to get a 100% reassurance from an independent expert is impossible,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are good developers and good builders out there but you don\u2019t know who they are anymore. Some of the good ones are now producing worse quality. You simply don\u2019t know if the builder you are dealing with is going to close down tomorrow, whether they are on the edge and cutting corners. \u201cMy advice to people in the market for a new apartment is don\u2019t. Don\u2019t buy until it is six, seven, 10 years old. \u201cMy advice to my kids is stick to the three-level walk-ups. If they are new, don\u2019t go over three storeys. If they are old, check the strata records with someone who knows what they are looking at. And never buy off the plan.\u201d Are stronger protections possible? There are two options for reform that would make consumer rights stronger, Gall says. The first would be to create a statutory duty of care for apartment buyers. This means buyers could more easily sue builders, developers and architects for negligent work. Currently, under NSW tort law, negligence requires a person prove there was a duty of care between themselves and the negligent party. \u201cThe problem with building is that it is not always clear who owes a duty of care to who,\u201d Gall says. \u201cThe people who buy, buy from the developer, the developer has a contract with the builder, they have a contract with the architect. Who is it who owes a duty of care to the end purchaser?\u201d A statutory duty of care would make it clearer which parties could sue, and in the words of Gall, \u201cput them all on the hook\u201d. \u201cIf an architect for example puts in a design inconsistent with the building code, and something fails, the architect can be on the hook.\u201d Gall and the Owners Corporation Network are also pushing for the creation of a special commission of inquiry, or a royal commission, into the issue of consumer protection for housing \u2013 looking at the changes to insurance, the three-storey rule and other issues.",

The runners-up play the second-placed team in Group C, which looks likely to be Brazil. A draw would probably be good enough for both Nigeria and Norway. They could even lose and go through. Confused? You probably will be. It\u2019s times like this that are an argument for a 32-team (or even 16) tournament. What we do know is that only a win will be good enough for the Koreans. <br><br>It might be expected that Corinne Diacre, the France manager, might make some rotations for tonight. The hosts have looked decent so far and have caught the public\u2019s imagination. <br><br><strong>Kick-offs, 8pm UK time. </strong><br><br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-17T17:04:37.028Z\">at 6.04pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "And a report from South Korea 1-2 Norway. Nigeria are currently third-ranked of the third-placed teams, with two more days to sit tight through. Only four go through. Next up, Norway face the runners-up of Group C - Brazil or Australia - in the round-of-16 on Saturday. Here\u2019s the Nigeria 0-1 France report. The feedback on that VAR is not positive. In fact, it\u2019s insurrectional. Evan Crocker: \u201cIt seems a bit absurd to punish a keeper for being two inches off the line when the penalty taker is allowed to dance, jump rope, and even stop for a phone call in the run up to the kick.\u201d Luke Jones: \u201cPlease say something that will make me feel like tedious VAR-check penalties and decisions like the Nigeria goalkeeper moving a foot off the line is not the future of football.\u201d Jon Collins: \u201cA prime example of why I dislike VAR a lot in the absolutely inevitable awarding of that penalty there; a good three momentum-killing minutes (that won\u2019t be added on) of pissing about because the ref is reluctant to give an obvious pen without the advice of a video assistant. Not a fan.\u201d Soluna Mar: \u201cI understood the guidance of VAR use was a clear and obvious error. If it takes several minutes for an official to review and take a decision doesn\u2019t that make it inherently not obvious?\u201d Dave Seare: \u201cBut she moved in front of the goal line on the re-take too! I\u2019d have just sat down for the second one.\u201d VAR is the story - again - and Nigeria\u2019s World Cup hangs on that infringement by Nnadozie that meant a weak penalty could be taken again. The Nigerian goalkeeper is utterly devastated and has to be helped up by her teammates. France break through Henry, but Chikwelu delivers a most tactical of foul on Geoyoro. She accepts the yellow card, her second of the World Cup. Should Nigeria get through, she will miss the next match. An injury to Geoyoro only prolongs the match, which nears its 100th minute. Norway are through in second, but can Nigeria find a goal that might cement a third-placed qualification for the last 16? They have a free-kick in a dangerous position, but one easily cleared. Oh! South Korea go so close to an equaliser. Yeo\u2019s header just goes wide when at last, the Norway defence had been breached....but that\u2019s that. Norway are through. South Korea have been granted just three extra minutes to find two goals. It seems unlikely. Not surprisingly, there will be eight minutes added on in the Nigeria-France game. That\u2019s VAR for you. Norway are hanging on so grimly that substitute Saevik is the lone player up front when the ball is cleared. She manages, to her credit, to force a corner. They now indulge in a bit of corner-hogging, keeping the ball down by the corner flag. France make a final change. Off comes Thiney, who blew a couple of decent chances, for Geyoro, the 21-year-old. South Korea chance! Ji\u2019s quick thinking steals the ball and Lee has the space to fire a shot at goal that was heading in had goalkeeper Hjelmseth not got her hands to it. Nigeria, who may be heading out after conceding that goal (they might have to get the abacus out), have made a double change. Ordega limps off with what looks a hamstring injury, while Oshoala also goes off. On come Nwabuoku and Imo. Clare Lawrence emails in, and I have to agree: \u201cThis VAR review of minor penalty infringements by goalkeepers is over governing the game. Poor use of the VAR given that the early movement had no impact on the miskick. Agreed with the penalty, disagreed with the redo.\u201d By the way, that France penalty farrago took a full six minutes. Renard can count herself very lucky that she got a second bite of the cherry. The goalkeeper was even booked for her movement. That\u2019s to the letter of the law, of course, but bloody harsh with it. Well hello there, a lovely flick from Lee in midfield and then Ji slots home. It\u2019s the least they have deserved. This time, Reynard roofs it, and the goalkeeper cannot move to save it. Oh no! Nnadozie has been shown to have moved before the penalty was taken and missed. Oh, that\u2019s harsh. Two goals in their first game, an own-goal in the next game, and now a dreadfully casual penalty. She hit the post. And all while Le Sommer was on the field... Another Renard header drifts over for France, but an infringement goes against her...what\u2019s this? France want a penalty and VAR is in session. Asseyi is baulked by Ebere. The ref missed it, but now she gets a look at the screen. As the last man/woman, Ebere has to receive a second yellow. Roger Wallace emails in: \u201cI\u2019ve been following your world cup coverage and just had a thought: in the (admittedly unlikely) scenario in which Nigeria not only continue to hold off France but actually score one on them, how would the group winner be decided, as Norway and France would be even on points and GD? Obviously away goals is not a thing.\u201d From wiki: The ranking of teams in the group stage is determined as follows:[37] Points obtained in all group matches (three points for a win, one for a draw, none for a defeat); Goal difference in all group matches; Number of goals scored in all group matches; Points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question; Goal difference in the matches played between the teams in question; Number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question; Fair play points in all group matches (only one deduction could be applied to a player in a single match): Yellow card: \u22121 point; Indirect red card (second yellow card): \u22123 points; Direct red card: \u22124 points; Yellow card and direct red card: \u22125 points; 8 Drawing of lots. Much of South Korea\u2019s life seems to have drained from them. A Norway goal looks more likely but they have just missed a big chance through Saevik, on as a substitute. France subs: Cascarino off for Le Sommer and Gauvin off for Diani. With Nigeria pinned back and needing to score five goals, it looks as if Norway are dead set for second place in Group A. What a miss from France! Cascarino gets down the right-hand side, and her vision allows her to find Thiney in open space. The finish is poor, with the shot drifting well wide of the post. Wasteful again. Over in Rennes, France continue to mount pressure without looking capable of scoring. They seem to lose the run of themselves once the goal nears. And meanwhile, Graham Hansen will not be risked any further. She looks in some pain and there look to be tears in her eyes. Norway\u2019s injury list is piling up. Graham Hansen can\u2019t take the penalty herself, as she is getting her sore ankle iced off the field. Up steps Herlovsen to take and she hits it low. The goalkeeper gets two hands to it, but the ball squeaks into the back of the net. Korea\u2019s World Cup looks to be over. Graham Hansen is fouled by Kang and that looks a plum penalty. Peter Campbell emails in: \u201cIn the replays I saw, I didn\u2019t see any contact between Gauvin\u2019s foot and the Nigeria player\u2019s face. Did you see any contact? If not, the defender seemed to have sold the ref on the card and I wonder whether VAR would get involved in such decisions?\u201d It did look a harsh yellow, but I wonder whether yellow cards can be overturned. A high kick is still dangerous play even if it doesn\u2019t count. Three teams here don\u2019t mind matters finishing as you were, while it is South Korea who need things to change. They have 45 minutes to save themselves. France almost begin their second half with another Renard goal, but this time her header is wide. The hosts have gone at it from the whistle. We are back underway... That early penalty separates the teams, but it is Korea, who need a win and for other results to go their way, who have been the team in the ascendancy. France have been unconvincing, it has to be said. France\u2019s Valerie Gauvin is booked for a high kick when trying to get perform an overhead in the Nigerian box. The crowd boo that one, but it was a little wild. Korea\u2019s Ji has another sighter for a free-kick, and again, it\u2019s over the bar. A clash of knees between Chikwelu and Bibault, with both players high in the challenge, but both will be OK to carry on. A drop-ball is awarded as neither was worse than the other. Oof, close for France! Cascarino wins the ball in midfield, surges on, and then whips a pass into the box. Gauvin, who had to improvise, got her heel to the ball but not on target. China and Spain both made it through after a game the Spanish might have won. Oof, nasty clash of head in Reims where Norway keeper Hjelmseth took out teammate Mjelde when reaching for one of those high Nigerian balls. Thankfully, after a bit of treatment, Mjelde is OK to carry on. Justin Kavanagh emails in: \u201cThe game is Rennes is a fine clash of couture between the African chic arrowheads and neon green shirts of the Nigerian strip and the classic French unadorned navy elegance of Les Bleus. BTW Neither Delphine (nor her twin sister Estelle\u2014also a player) Cascarino are related to Tony Cascarino, despite being born at the time when the Ice Cream Man (as forgetful Jack Charlton used to call him) was a player in France.\u201d When \u2018Cas\u2019 used to play for Gillingham, I used to think it highly exotic that they had an Italian playing in the Third Division. When Marseille flopped after their corruption scandal, it was Cas replacing Jean-Pierre Papin and the like. France have not been too impressive here, but their corner count is mounting. Okeke has been the pick of Nigeria\u2019s defenders on these set pieces and gets the ball clear. Sadly, Nigeria\u2019s chance of a break fails after a poor cross to the back post. Yet another Korean corner after Ji, of Chelsea, forces some evasive action from the Norwegians, who have been weathering the storm. The ball makes its way to Moon, the striker, but her shot is seemingly aimed at her namesake and flies way over the bar. Yellow card for Nigeria after Ebere is booked for a foul on Cascarino. Yet more pressure from the Koreans, who force another corner. Yet again, it comes to little. Nice flipped ball by France\u2019s Bibault just evades Thiney. The French really pushing for the win that would give them maximum points. And with those rotations, some will be looking to impress manager Corinne Diacre for the latter stages. South Korea win a free-kick in a decent position, but Ji\u2019s somewhat weak attempt - straight into the wall - was a waste. Norway under some pressure but the Koreans yet to find the last pass or shot to get back into the game. Germany cruised through to the next round and looked menacing in one of today\u2019s earlier games. Another chance for France as Henry makes the time and space to flash in a shot. It goes wide. Lovely skill to make the chance, less so the finish. They have been..excitable in front of goal. Yes, a Norway chance soon comes on the counter, and Herlovsen looked likely to score, only for a decent save from the foot of Nnadozie in the Nigerian goal. Gauvin flashes a header over for France. They have created plenty of chances this tournament, but are blowing far too many of them. The Koreans are playing for their lives here, keeping up the pressure though are in danger of leaving too much space at the back. France are making heavier weather of the first ten minutes, but the momentum is with them. Cascarino forces a corner, their second of the match. Renard is the target after those two goals in the opening match, but this time the ball goes back to Asseyi, who fails to get much purchase on her shot. Norway are chasing another in quick succession, forcing another corner. Thorisdottir comes up for it again, having been manhandled for the penalty. It reaches Mjelde this time but she heads over. As it stands, Norway will take second in the group, and the French will top the group. Four points should be enough for the Nigerians to go through in third, too. Hansen steps up and slots home, but only just. That\u2019s the earliest penalty in tournament history, and the earliest goal of this tournament. A mountain to climb for the Koreans. From a corner, Thorisdottir is fouled in the box, the ref has no hestitation in awarding it. As might be expected in Rennes, France begin on the front foot, with plenty of noise behind them, too. Nigeria, though, force an early corner. They take their time over it, and the French goalkeeper, Bouhhadi, flaps at it. With only France assured of their destiny, and even then not quite sure of winning their group, there is plenty to play for. All four teams are in the tunnel and it has to be said that the Nigerians\u2019 sing-song entry to the stadium took the eye. It\u2019s very loud in Rennes, perhaps a bit less so in Reims but that\u2019s always the way when the hosts are playing. The Marseillaise is pretty damned loud. Those teams from Reims in more readable fashion. South Korea: Kim, Lee, Shin, Kim, Jang, Kang, Ji, Cho, Lee, Yeo, Moon Subs: Kang, Jeong, Hwang, Lim, Lee, Jung, Kang, Lee, Lee, Kim, Jung, Son Norway: Hjelmseth, Wold, Mjelde, Thorisdottir, Minde, Hansen, Risa, Engen, Reiten, Utland, Herlovsen Subs: Hovland, Hansen, Thorsnes, Fiskerstrand, Asland, Eikeland, Maanum, Redisch Kvamme, Haavi, Saevik, Nautnes, Bogstad Referee: Marie-Soleil Beaudoin As expected and predicted, France have shuffled the pack, with four changes, including leading striker Eugenie le Sommer dropping to the bench along with Marion Torrent, Kadidiatou Diani and Elise Bussaglia. Eve Perisset, Charlotte Bilbault, Delphine Cascarino and Viviane Asseyi come in. Nigeria have made just one change, and that\u2019s midfielder Halimatu Ayinde, replacing Chinaza Uchendu. The Nigeria v France team news in more readable fashion. Nigeria (4-3-3): Nnadozie, Okeke, Ohale, Ebi, Ebere, Ayinde, Okobi, Chikwelu, Ordega, Oparanozie, Oshoala Subs: Oluehi, Okoronkwo, Nwabuoku, Imo, Uchendu, Kanu, Ajibade, Ihezuo, Jonathan, Ogebe, Chukwudi France (4-4-2): Bouhaddi, P\u00e9risset, Mbock Bathy, Renard, Majri, Cascarino, Henry, Asseyi, Bilbault, Gauvin, Thiney Sub: Durand, Torrent, Tounkara, Karchaoui, Geyoro, Le Sommer, Diani, Laurent, Bussaglia, Peyraud-Magnin, Debever, Clemaron Referee: Melissa Borjas And the teams for Nigeria v France. Here\u2019s the teams for South Korea v Norway. And for the match in Rennes. While we wait for the teams, here\u2019s the team guides for tonight\u2019s match in Reims. After Group B went first, it\u2019s Group A\u2019s turn to face the final curtain. With the hosts France already through, their task is gain a draw from Nigeria in Rennes to make sure they top the group and that they face one of the third-placed teams in the last 16. Nigeria are third in the group, and having lost to Norway last time out, need a result to force themselves into that third-place picture, with their goal difference being three goals inferior to the Norwegians, who must be expected to beat South Korea in Reims. The runners-up play the second-placed team in Group C, which looks likely to be Brazil. A draw would probably be good enough for both Nigeria and Norway. They could even lose and go through. Confused? You probably will be. It\u2019s times like this that are an argument for a 32-team (or even 16) tournament. What we do know is that only a win will be good enough for the Koreans. It might be expected that Corinne Diacre, the France manager, might make some rotations for tonight. The hosts have looked decent so far and have caught the public\u2019s imagination.

      "body": "<p>James Maddison can pin-point the moment England enthralled him as accurately as a set piece for Leicester. It was almost 15 years ago to the day when, sitting at home in Coventry in a kit bearing the name Rooney, he watched the teenage sensation lead England into the European Championship quarter-finals with two goals against Croatia. The long wait to make his own mark on the international stage is just about over.</p> <p>There is a genuine, giddy excitement about Maddison as he prepares to face France in England\u2019s opening game of the European Under-21 Championship on Tuesday. At 22 he is one of the most senior members of Aidy Boothroyd\u2019s squad and has Premier League pedigree to support that status. Yet in terms of international competition he is a novice; four years older than Wayne Rooney was at Euro 2004 but still waiting for the opportunity to emulate a boyhood hero.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/17/england-france-under-21-euros-boothroyd\">Under-21 Euros are \u2018knockout from day one\u2019 Boothroyd warns England players</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maddison\u2019s pathway to the top has been forged via League One with Coventry, the Championship with Norwich and the Scottish Premiership on loan at Aberdeen rather than the academy route and England youth teams.</p> <p>There was some surprise that a fine debut season in the top flight with Leicester was not rewarded with a place in Gareth Southgate\u2019s senior squad for the Nations League finals.

The challenge we face trying to win it drives me on that extra few per cent. You are playing for your country. You can never take that for granted at any level.

      "bodyText": "James Maddison can pin-point the moment England enthralled him as accurately as a set piece for Leicester. It was almost 15 years ago to the day when, sitting at home in Coventry in a kit bearing the name Rooney, he watched the teenage sensation lead England into the European Championship quarter-finals with two goals against Croatia. The long wait to make his own mark on the international stage is just about over. There is a genuine, giddy excitement about Maddison as he prepares to face France in England\u2019s opening game of the European Under-21 Championship on Tuesday. At 22 he is one of the most senior members of Aidy Boothroyd\u2019s squad and has Premier League pedigree to support that status. Yet in terms of international competition he is a novice; four years older than Wayne Rooney was at Euro 2004 but still waiting for the opportunity to emulate a boyhood hero. Maddison\u2019s pathway to the top has been forged via League One with Coventry, the Championship with Norwich and the Scottish Premiership on loan at Aberdeen rather than the academy route and England youth teams. There was some surprise that a fine debut season in the top flight with Leicester was not rewarded with a place in Gareth Southgate\u2019s senior squad for the Nations League finals. The creative midfielder, however, is exactly where he wants to be right now. \u201cI have been looking forward to this for ages,\u201d he says. \u201cI have never played an international tournament before. I have played in qualifying and international friendlies but not a tournament at this level. It is new to me and I am raring. The challenge we face trying to win it drives me on that extra few per cent. You are playing for your country. You can never take that for granted at any level. People ask: \u2018What do you think about not getting called to the seniors?\u2019 I don\u2019t care. When I put that badge on I want to go and win this tournament.\u201d Cold ambition accompanies Maddison\u2019s natural enthusiasm for the Euros. While Phil Foden and Morgan Gibbs-White have won a World Cup at under-17 level with England, and nine other teammates are under-20s world champions, Maddison is still striving for that first winner\u2019s medal. It is how he expects his career to be judged. \u201cI want to be a winner,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the end of your career you can look back and think: \u2018Yeah, OK, a few man of the matches here and a player of the season there\u2019 but football is a team game, not like tennis or golf when it\u2019s for you only. It is a team game and I want to have winner\u2019s medals at the end of it. \u201cThe other lads have had success in tournaments. My trophy cabinet is empty at the minute.

He adds: \u201cThe format changes things. We know we have a good squad with good players who are regulars in the Premier League but that doesn\u2019t mean anything in tournament football.

Further afield, the showdown with Hong Kong citizens has given ammunition to critics in the West, at a time when China is hovering on the brink of a trade war with the US and under fierce attack for issues including a network of concentration camps for Uighurs in Xinjiang and its aggressive policy in the South China Sea.

It is still unclear whether the idea for the law originated in Beijing or Hong Kong, but once on the table, Xi and the ruling Communist party embraced it enthusiastically. It would have been a useful tool, allowing the government in Beijing to legally pursue critics and fugitives who have set up shop in Hong Kong (it has occasionally kidnapped them in defiance of the law). It would also have expedited political and legal integration of the two countries, a key goal for China ahead of the 2047 expiry date for Hong Kong autonomy.

Renard\u2019s stuttering run and tame effort pinged off the post but after another VAR check Chiamaka Nnadozie was adjudged to have moved off her line before the ball was hit and Renard had a shot at redemption, this time making no mistake. \u201cEugenie came to me and said: \u2018No, you\u2019re going to be the one to take the spot kick,\u2019\u201d said Renard of her second attempt. \u201cI was lucky enough to take it the second time and it was very good for the team and me as well.\u201d \u201cOf course, I\u2019m disappointed with the result,\u201d said Dennerby, before throwing down his earpiece at the conclusion of the press conference. \u201cFrance is a really good team and they don\u2019t need support to win games. So I feel so sorry because the girls were fighting so well and they followed the match plan and it\u2019s getting destroyed by people that we are not happy with.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 18 June 2019 to correct a misspelling of Les Bleues as Les Bleus.",

Cowen can lay claim to one of the most continuously successful coaching careers in Britain, which for some time has covered both sides of the Atlantic. Earlier he focused mainly on the European Tour as Lee Westwood, Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowell and Henrik Stenson started to make their name. \u201cThey started playing more and more in America and I got exposed to the American players and they got exposed to me,\u201d Cowen said. \u201cThey like hearing it in simple terms. \u201cI was going to retire a while ago but I can\u2019t retire now with this chapter going on, can I? I was looking down the leaderboard thinking, \u2018I coach him, him, him and I\u2019ve worked with him, him, him in the past.\u2019 In the top 15 I think I\u2019ve worked at one stage or the other with about 12 of them and nine of the top 11. \u201cI don\u2019t really care about the recognition thing. It\u2019s about the players, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s brilliant helping someone like Gary reach his ambitions. \u201cThe US Open is like the Open to us. Pebble is a good place for me; my first major was with Graeme in 2010 there and now my most recent major is at Pebble. It\u2019s been a hell of a decade.\u201d",

Nineteen countries, including Australia, will gather on 24 and 25 June for a multilateral assessment of progress made under international climate commitments, and countries have submitted a range of questions about the performance of signatories in meeting their targets. As well as questions about rising emissions, the EU and Canada have also queried the government\u2019s decision to use carryover credits from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/kyoto-protocol\">Kyoto protocol</a> in its latest carbon budget. Meanwhile, among Australians, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/18/australians-support-for-nuclear-plants-rising-but-most-dont-want-to-live-near-one\">support for nuclear plants is rising</a> \u2013 but most don\u2019t want to live near one.</p> <p><strong>A major new report has found that Australia is at a crossroads, facing a choice between slow economic and social decline \u2013 or prosperity.</strong> The report brings together the thinking of more than 50 leaders in business, academia, NGOs and the community sector, working with the CSIRO <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/18/call-to-arms-how-can-australia-avoid-a-slow-and-painful-decline\">to model alternative futures for Australia</a>. The report is described as a \u201cclarion call\u201d for the nation: it concludes that while Australia has enjoyed almost three decades of economic growth, with enviable social cohesion and strong institutions, it risks \u201cdrifting into the future\u201d if it fails to respond to challenges in a fast-changing world. Those identified are the rise of Asia, rapid technological change, climate change and the environment, changing demographics, declining trust in institutions and business, and strains on social cohesion.</p> <p><strong>The Human Rights Commission says the Australian onshore immigration detention system is unlike similar operations in any other liberal democracy</strong> and is becoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/18/australias-onshore-immigration-detention-unlike-any-other-liberal-democracy\">\u201cmore and more like prison\u201d</a>.

The consequences for public health and the environment are grim. A team of Guardian reporters in 11 countries working on a new Guardian series, the United States of Plastic, has found that last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/17/recycled-plastic-america-global-crisis\">the equivalent of 68,000 shipping containers </a>of US plastic recycling were exported to developing countries that mismanage more than 70% of their own plastic waste.

Just how in need of stimulus is the economy? Consider that the day before the Reserve Bank cut the cash rate to 1.25% the market was predicting there was a strong chance of further cuts to 0.75% to occur sometimes late next year. Now, just two weeks later, the market is fully pricing in a cut to 0.75% to occur by the end of this year and around a 30% chance of a cut to 0.5% to occur next year.\u201d</p> <h2>Sport</h2> <p><strong>Germany sealed top spot in Group B of the Women\u2019s World Cup as they eased past South Africa with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/17/south-africa-germany-womens-world-cup-match-report\">4-0 victory</a> in Montpellier on Monday. </strong>Spain and China, meanwhile, played out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/17/china-spain-womens-world-cup-match-report\">a goalless draw</a> in Le Havre \u2013 meaning that both sides secured progression into the last 16 as a result.</p> <p><strong>There are calls for Australia to cut another Super Rugby team after only one side, the Brumbies, reached the playoffs this season. </strong>This comes just two years after the axing of the Western Force, but it appears Australia does not have sufficient depth to support even four Super Rugby teams \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/18/calls-for-super-rugby-cull-as-australian-teams-fail-to-fire-again\">let alone five</a>.</p> <h2>Thinking time: A national plan to save wombats from mange</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03fc08a55f3dc074af695fef53e25b37956c7c65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03fc08a55f3dc074af695fef53e25b37956c7c65/0_39_2911_1747/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grasso\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grasso the wombat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Guarracino</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last month Grasso wasn\u2019t doing well. The bare-nosed wombat, dubbed Fatso in Italian, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/18/significant-suffering-experts-call-for-national-plan-to-save-wombats-from-mange\">was infected with mange</a>. The devastating skin disease caused by parasitic mites had left his skin crusted, bleeding and constantly irritated. His eyes and ears were so affected he could barely see, hear or even smell. The nocturnal animal was out grazing during the day, desperate for nutrients because of his raised metabolic rate, but he was gradually wasting away. Untreated, he faced a certain and agonising death.</p> <p>A volunteer wildlife carer, Elena Guarracino, from the <a href=\"https://laokosmwr.org/\">Looking after our Kosciuszko orphans </a>mange management group, was alerted to Grasso\u2019s plight in early May. She set off to find him, somewhere on a property at Avonside, NSW. He was in such poor condition that euthanising him could have been considered the kindest option.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 18 June. Top stories The Australian government has been challenged by the EU and by China about whether it can meet its Paris commitments given rising emissions, and about growing pollution from vehicles, before a progress meeting about climate commitments in Bonn next week. Nineteen countries, including Australia, will gather on 24 and 25 June for a multilateral assessment of progress made under international climate commitments, and countries have submitted a range of questions about the performance of signatories in meeting their targets. As well as questions about rising emissions, the EU and Canada have also queried the government\u2019s decision to use carryover credits from the Kyoto protocol in its latest carbon budget. Meanwhile, among Australians, support for nuclear plants is rising \u2013 but most don\u2019t want to live near one. A major new report has found that Australia is at a crossroads, facing a choice between slow economic and social decline \u2013 or prosperity. The report brings together the thinking of more than 50 leaders in business, academia, NGOs and the community sector, working with the CSIRO to model alternative futures for Australia. The report is described as a \u201cclarion call\u201d for the nation: it concludes that while Australia has enjoyed almost three decades of economic growth, with enviable social cohesion and strong institutions, it risks \u201cdrifting into the future\u201d if it fails to respond to challenges in a fast-changing world. Those identified are the rise of Asia, rapid technological change, climate change and the environment, changing demographics, declining trust in institutions and business, and strains on social cohesion. The Human Rights Commission says the Australian onshore immigration detention system is unlike similar operations in any other liberal democracy and is becoming \u201cmore and more like prison\u201d. It is also now holding people for an average of about 500 days \u2013 far longer than any comparable jurisdiction, and is increasingly using restraints. The commission urged the government to \u201ctake very seriously\u201d its latest report, which examined risk management in detention and found that amid a growing proportion of people being detained on \u201ccharacter grounds\u201d and corresponding structural changes to make centres more secure, all detainees, including young female asylum seekers, were being subject to harsher treatment. World Egypt\u2019s ousted president Mohamed Morsi has collapsed during a court session and died, almost six years after he was forced from power in a bloody coup. Morsi, 67, was attending a session in his trial on espionage charges on Monday when he blacked out and then died, according to state media. Morsi was Egypt\u2019s first democratically elected president: read his obituary here. Thirteen journalists who were investigating damage to the environment have been killed in recent years, with many more suffering violence, harassment, intimidation and lawsuits. The Committee to Protect Journalists, which produced the tally, is investigating a further 16 deaths. Thirty people were killed when three people blew themselves up on Sunday night in a busy market in north-east Nigeria, which has seen an increase in attacks by militant groups. Communication issues resulted in police and members of the public being left to treat victims of the London Bridge terrorist attacks \u2013 and not knowing why paramedics were not coming to their aid, an ambulance service boss has told the inquest. Ireland has unveiled an ambitious plan to tackle the climate emergency by weaning the state, businesses, farms and households off fossil fuels. The government published a long-awaited report that sets a path for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Opinion and analysis A Guardian investigation has found that hundreds of thousands of tons of US plastic are being shipped every year to poorly regulated developing countries \u2013 for the dirty, labor-intensive process of recycling. The consequences for public health and the environment are grim. A team of Guardian reporters in 11 countries working on a new Guardian series, the United States of Plastic, has found that last year, the equivalent of 68,000 shipping containers of US plastic recycling were exported to developing countries that mismanage more than 70% of their own plastic waste. The newest hotspots for handling US plastic recycling are some of the world\u2019s poorest countries, including Bangladesh, Laos, Ethiopia and Senegal, offering cheap labor and limited environmental regulation. \u201cThe latest labour force figures released last week made it clear that hopes for an increase in wages growth is a long way off,\u201d writes Greg Jericho, \u201cand the government\u2019s predictions in its budget are absurdly optimistic. Just how in need of stimulus is the economy? Consider that the day before the Reserve Bank cut the cash rate to 1.25% the market was predicting there was a strong chance of further cuts to 0.75% to occur sometimes late next year. Now, just two weeks later, the market is fully pricing in a cut to 0.75% to occur by the end of this year and around a 30% chance of a cut to 0.5% to occur next year.\u201d Sport Germany sealed top spot in Group B of the Women\u2019s World Cup as they eased past South Africa with a 4-0 victory in Montpellier on Monday. Spain and China, meanwhile, played out a goalless draw in Le Havre \u2013 meaning that both sides secured progression into the last 16 as a result. There are calls for Australia to cut another Super Rugby team after only one side, the Brumbies, reached the playoffs this season. This comes just two years after the axing of the Western Force, but it appears Australia does not have sufficient depth to support even four Super Rugby teams \u2013 let alone five. Thinking time: A national plan to save wombats from mange Last month Grasso wasn\u2019t doing well. The bare-nosed wombat, dubbed Fatso in Italian, was infected with mange. The devastating skin disease caused by parasitic mites had left his skin crusted, bleeding and constantly irritated. His eyes and ears were so affected he could barely see, hear or even smell. The nocturnal animal was out grazing during the day, desperate for nutrients because of his raised metabolic rate, but he was gradually wasting away. Untreated, he faced a certain and agonising death. A volunteer wildlife carer, Elena Guarracino, from the Looking after our Kosciuszko orphans mange management group, was alerted to Grasso\u2019s plight in early May. She set off to find him, somewhere on a property at Avonside, NSW. He was in such poor condition that euthanising him could have been considered the kindest option. But Guarracino thought he was plump enough to survive for a while, and so, despite a 120km round trip, she treated him four times over the next 25 days. When she last saw him at the beginning of June, Grasso was much improved. And now, there are calls for a national plan to tackle mange \u2013 and the incoming environment minister, Sussan Ley, has a clear opportunity to improve the situation for wombats and for their carers \u2013 if she makes it a priority. Media roundup The ABC reveals that the \u201cdetails of costly blowouts and delays on troubled military projects are being kept hidden from public view by the Defence department\u201d. The Australian Financial Review\u2019s front page bears the headline \u201cTax cuts no handout to the rich\u201d. Australian universities are split over free speech, the Australian reports. Coming up The Reserve Bank should shed more light on its reasoning behind this month\u2019s cut to the cash rate when it releases the minutes of its last meeting. The 25th National General Assembly of Local Government will be held in Canberra, featuring an address from deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack. Recycling, drought, climate change and electric vehicles will dominate the event.",

The good weather was especially welcome in London, where the septuagenarian monarch led a six-mile royal procession through the city\u2019s streets, surrounded by adoring crowds, who had, after years of scepticism, finally taken her to their hearts. Yet as the fine weather continued, and the temperature rose even higher \u2013 into the 90s, in the old Fahrenheit measure (more than 32.2C) \u2013 conditions began to turn more humid. Two days later, on 24 June, thunderstorms broke over south-east England. These were caused by a bulge of very warm air moving rapidly northwards from the Mediterranean, which then met a depression over northern France. At first, a few showers were reported around midday. But within an hour, there were violent hailstorms to the west of London, including hailstones measuring almost 40mm across and weighing over an ounce (28 grams). As the storms grew in intensity, major destruction occurred over a wide swathe of London and the home counties, though fortunately no one was killed.",

He has died at the age of 67 after collapsing in court during a retrial of charges of espionage for the Palestinian Hamas organisation.</p> <p>In 2011 a revolution had ousted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hosni-mubarak\" title=\"\">Hosni Mubarak</a>, Egypt\u2019s president since 1981. Elections in June the following year brought the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/muslim-brotherhood\" title=\"\">Muslim Brotherhood</a> to power. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2012/jun/24/egypt-election-results-live\" title=\"\">new president</a> was the Brotherhood\u2019s Morsi, who defeated the former prime minister, Ahmed Shafiq, with 51.7% of the vote, vowing that he would be inclusive and maintain Egypt\u2019s 1979 accord with Israel. Morsi was actually the Brotherhood\u2019s second choice; their first, Khairat al-Shati, was disqualified by the election commission for having served a prison term under Mubarak.</p> <p>Once he was in power, Morsi\u2019s stubborn Islamist policies brought protesters back into the streets in such huge numbers that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/03/mohamed-morsi-egypt-second-revolution\" title=\"\">in July 2013 the army sacked the government, arresting Morsi and fellow Muslim Brothers</a>. Three senior officers marched into Morsi\u2019s office, where he was holding a crisis meeting. Told he was no longer president, he burst into uncontrollable laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable what\u2019s going on. This is a coup,\u201d he shouted. He was taken to the headquarters of the Republican Guard in eastern Cairo, where many of his supporters were later gunned down by the army.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d23f673846870e575f9b9a540c85e67cc2a67b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d23f673846870e575f9b9a540c85e67cc2a67b1/0_75_3161_1897/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mohamed Morsi during his trial in Cairo, Egypt, in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mohamed Morsi during his trial in Cairo, Egypt, in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As president, Morsi had had no clear plan for economic recovery in Egypt, apart from cash injections from Qatar and other allies. He failed to clean up the notorious security apparatus, which continued to torture and kill protesters, and appealed to his electorate by maintaining expensive food and fuel subsidies, thereby critically reducing reserves. His followers attacked Egypt\u2019s Coptic and Shia minorities and upset liberals by threatening to close shops by 10pm, in a country that lives by night, to help citizens attend the dawn prayer. He imposed a Muslim Brother as culture minister. His one foreign affairs achievement was to help broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.</p> <p>In August 2012, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/12/egyptian-defence-chief-ousted-shakeup\" title=\"\">Morsi replaced </a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/12/egyptian-defence-chief-ousted-shakeup\" title=\"\">Hussein Tantawi, the army chief-of-staff</a>. He stripped the military of its say in drafting the new constitution and in December the Islamist-dominated constituent assembly approved a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/02/egypt-mohamed-morsi-referendum-constitution\" title=\"\">draft constitution</a> that boosted the role of Islam and restricted freedom of speech and assembly. Protesters were particularly outraged by a constitutional decree that placed Morsi\u2019s decisions beyond judicial review. Although he later cancelled the decree, the die was cast. He seemed unable to deal with the breakdown of law and order, or to listen to critics who feared that the Brotherhood was using its democratic honeymoon to impose an Islamist constitution, in place of the existing, secular \u201cdeep state\u201d.</p> <p>Worst of all, he appointed seven regional governors from the Brotherhood, and one, for Luxor, from Gamaa Islamiya, the extremist Islamist group responsible for the massacre of tourists at Luxor in 1997. After inter-religious killings, the Coptic pope, Tawadros II, accused Morsi of reneging on his promise to protect Christians. By June 2013 Morsi was at loggerheads with Muslim and Christian clerics, the judiciary, the police, the intelligence services and, crucially, the army.</p> <p>As protesters lined the streets demanding an end to Morsi\u2019s presidency, on 1 July the army delivered an ultimatum that required Morsi to resolve the political crisis within 48 hours. When he failed, on 3 July it overthrew Morsi, installing Adly Mansour as the interim head of state in his place until the installation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/08/egypt-sisi-sworn-in-president\" title=\"\">Abdel Fatah el-Sisi</a> in 2014, and ordering the arrest of many members of the Muslim Brotherhood.</p> <p>The eldest of five brothers, Morsi was born in the village of El-Adwah in northern Egypt. His father was a poor farmer; Morsi remembered being taken to school on the back of a donkey. He graduated with a BA in engineering from Cairo University in 1975 and an MA in metallurgy in 1978.</p> <p>That year, he married his 17-year-old cousin Naglaa Mahmoud. She later told a magazine that he helped with household chores and cooked for her. \u201cI like everything about him,\u201d she said. \u201cOur fights never lasted for more than a few minutes.\u201d Morsi told an Egyptian television channel that marrying her was \u201cthe biggest personal achievement of my life\u201d. </p> <p>He joined the Muslim Brotherhood in 1979. Morsi lived in the US for several years: he studied for a doctorate in materials science at the University of Southern California and then joined the California State University, Northridge, where he was an assistant professor of engineering from 1982 until his return to Egypt in 1985. Then he served as head of the materials engineering department of Zagazig University, where he remained a professor until 2010.</p> <p>Morsi was a member of Egypt\u2019s parliament from 2000 to 2005, standing as an independent, since candidates were forbidden to run under the Brotherhood banner. The Brotherhood\u2019s political wing, the Freedom and Justice party, was founded in the wake of the 2011 revolution, and Morsi became its first president. </p> <p>In November 2013 Morsi was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/04/mohamed-morsi-egypt-trial-chaos-muslim-brotherhood\" title=\"\">put on trial</a>, charged with incitement to murder, and at a preliminary hearing questioned the validity of the court, saying, \u201cWhat is happening now is a military coup. I am furious that the Egyptian judiciary should serve as cover for this criminal military coup.\u201d</p> <p>In April 2015, Morsi was sentenced to 20 years over deaths during clashes between opposition protesters and Brotherhood supporters outside the presidential palace in Cairo in December 2012. He was cleared of inciting the Brotherhood to kill two protesters and a journalist \u2013 a charge that could have carried the death penalty.</p> <p>A month later, he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/16/mohammed-morsi-sentenced-death-egyptian-court-former-president\" title=\"\">sentenced to death</a> after being convicted of colluding with Hamas and Hezbollah militants to organise a mass prison break during the uprising against Mubarak, and in June the sentence was upheld after consultations with Egypt\u2019s grand mufti. In November 2016 the court of cassation ordered a retrial of that charge and others relating to foreign organisations.</p> <p>Morsi also faced charges of endangering national security by leaking state secrets to Qatar, fraud and insulting the judiciary. After being accused of disrupting his first trial by shouting protests, Morsi was compelled to sit in a soundproof glass cage in court.</p> <p>He suffered from diabetes, and the Muslim Brotherhood condemned his poor medical treatment and the almost complete ban on visits to him. <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/mohamed-morsi-egypt-tora-prison-treatment-early-death-health-diabetes-latest-a8287856.html\" title=\"\">According to a report by British MPs</a>, the poor conditions at Tora fell far below international standards. </p> <p>Shortly before his collapse <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/d8cd2185ee7a40cb9eae735c1c2797db\" title=\"\">Morsi is reported to have told the court that he knew \u201cmany secrets\u201d</a> that, if revealed, would enable him to be released, though would not disclose them because doing so would harm Egypt\u2019s security. He insisted that he was still the country\u2019s legitimate president.</p> <p>Morsi and his wife had four sons, Ahmed, Omar, Osama and Abdullah, and a daughter, Shaimaa.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Mohamed Morsi Issa al-Ayyat, politician, born 20 August 1951; died 17 June 2019</p> <p> \u2022 This article was amended on 20 June 2019.

      "bodyText": "Although in 2012 Mohamed Morsi became Egypt\u2019s first democratically elected president, a year later he was overthrown by the military and held in prison on a series of convictions. In 2016 he was moved to the notorious Tora prison, near Cairo. He has died at the age of 67 after collapsing in court during a retrial of charges of espionage for the Palestinian Hamas organisation. In 2011 a revolution had ousted Hosni Mubarak, Egypt\u2019s president since 1981. Elections in June the following year brought the Muslim Brotherhood to power. The new president was the Brotherhood\u2019s Morsi, who defeated the former prime minister, Ahmed Shafiq, with 51.7% of the vote, vowing that he would be inclusive and maintain Egypt\u2019s 1979 accord with Israel. Morsi was actually the Brotherhood\u2019s second choice; their first, Khairat al-Shati, was disqualified by the election commission for having served a prison term under Mubarak. Once he was in power, Morsi\u2019s stubborn Islamist policies brought protesters back into the streets in such huge numbers that in July 2013 the army sacked the government, arresting Morsi and fellow Muslim Brothers. Three senior officers marched into Morsi\u2019s office, where he was holding a crisis meeting. Told he was no longer president, he burst into uncontrollable laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable what\u2019s going on. This is a coup,\u201d he shouted. He was taken to the headquarters of the Republican Guard in eastern Cairo, where many of his supporters were later gunned down by the army. As president, Morsi had had no clear plan for economic recovery in Egypt, apart from cash injections from Qatar and other allies. He failed to clean up the notorious security apparatus, which continued to torture and kill protesters, and appealed to his electorate by maintaining expensive food and fuel subsidies, thereby critically reducing reserves. His followers attacked Egypt\u2019s Coptic and Shia minorities and upset liberals by threatening to close shops by 10pm, in a country that lives by night, to help citizens attend the dawn prayer. He imposed a Muslim Brother as culture minister. His one foreign affairs achievement was to help broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. In August 2012, Morsi replaced Hussein Tantawi, the army chief-of-staff. He stripped the military of its say in drafting the new constitution and in December the Islamist-dominated constituent assembly approved a draft constitution that boosted the role of Islam and restricted freedom of speech and assembly. Protesters were particularly outraged by a constitutional decree that placed Morsi\u2019s decisions beyond judicial review. Although he later cancelled the decree, the die was cast. He seemed unable to deal with the breakdown of law and order, or to listen to critics who feared that the Brotherhood was using its democratic honeymoon to impose an Islamist constitution, in place of the existing, secular \u201cdeep state\u201d. Worst of all, he appointed seven regional governors from the Brotherhood, and one, for Luxor, from Gamaa Islamiya, the extremist Islamist group responsible for the massacre of tourists at Luxor in 1997. After inter-religious killings, the Coptic pope, Tawadros II, accused Morsi of reneging on his promise to protect Christians. By June 2013 Morsi was at loggerheads with Muslim and Christian clerics, the judiciary, the police, the intelligence services and, crucially, the army. As protesters lined the streets demanding an end to Morsi\u2019s presidency, on 1 July the army delivered an ultimatum that required Morsi to resolve the political crisis within 48 hours. When he failed, on 3 July it overthrew Morsi, installing Adly Mansour as the interim head of state in his place until the installation of Abdel Fatah el-Sisi in 2014, and ordering the arrest of many members of the Muslim Brotherhood. The eldest of five brothers, Morsi was born in the village of El-Adwah in northern Egypt. His father was a poor farmer; Morsi remembered being taken to school on the back of a donkey. He graduated with a BA in engineering from Cairo University in 1975 and an MA in metallurgy in 1978. That year, he married his 17-year-old cousin Naglaa Mahmoud. She later told a magazine that he helped with household chores and cooked for her. \u201cI like everything about him,\u201d she said. \u201cOur fights never lasted for more than a few minutes.\u201d Morsi told an Egyptian television channel that marrying her was \u201cthe biggest personal achievement of my life\u201d. He joined the Muslim Brotherhood in 1979. Morsi lived in the US for several years: he studied for a doctorate in materials science at the University of Southern California and then joined the California State University, Northridge, where he was an assistant professor of engineering from 1982 until his return to Egypt in 1985. Then he served as head of the materials engineering department of Zagazig University, where he remained a professor until 2010. Morsi was a member of Egypt\u2019s parliament from 2000 to 2005, standing as an independent, since candidates were forbidden to run under the Brotherhood banner. The Brotherhood\u2019s political wing, the Freedom and Justice party, was founded in the wake of the 2011 revolution, and Morsi became its first president. In November 2013 Morsi was put on trial, charged with incitement to murder, and at a preliminary hearing questioned the validity of the court, saying, \u201cWhat is happening now is a military coup. I am furious that the Egyptian judiciary should serve as cover for this criminal military coup.\u201d In April 2015, Morsi was sentenced to 20 years over deaths during clashes between opposition protesters and Brotherhood supporters outside the presidential palace in Cairo in December 2012. He was cleared of inciting the Brotherhood to kill two protesters and a journalist \u2013 a charge that could have carried the death penalty. A month later, he was sentenced to death after being convicted of colluding with Hamas and Hezbollah militants to organise a mass prison break during the uprising against Mubarak, and in June the sentence was upheld after consultations with Egypt\u2019s grand mufti. In November 2016 the court of cassation ordered a retrial of that charge and others relating to foreign organisations. Morsi also faced charges of endangering national security by leaking state secrets to Qatar, fraud and insulting the judiciary. After being accused of disrupting his first trial by shouting protests, Morsi was compelled to sit in a soundproof glass cage in court. He suffered from diabetes, and the Muslim Brotherhood condemned his poor medical treatment and the almost complete ban on visits to him. According to a report by British MPs, the poor conditions at Tora fell far below international standards. Shortly before his collapse Morsi is reported to have told the court that he knew \u201cmany secrets\u201d that, if revealed, would enable him to be released, though would not disclose them because doing so would harm Egypt\u2019s security. He insisted that he was still the country\u2019s legitimate president. Morsi and his wife had four sons, Ahmed, Omar, Osama and Abdullah, and a daughter, Shaimaa. \u2022 Mohamed Morsi Issa al-Ayyat, politician, born 20 August 1951; died 17 June 2019 \u2022 This article was amended on 20 June 2019. Morsi gained his PhD from the University of Southern California, not California State University, Northridge, as originally stated.",

Eight players made four or less as Simon Harmer, brought on in the fourth over after an injury to Sam Cook, finished with seven for 38, and 12 for 61 in the match, to become the leading wicket-taker in Division One with 42. Essex themselves had been bowled out before lunch thanks to tireless efforts from Kyle Abbott, but that was but a bean compared with what was to come.</p> <p><strong>Yorkshire</strong>\u2019s middle order suffered against <strong>Warwickshire</strong> at the first County Championship match at York since 1890, losing five for eight in 10 overs. There were ducks for Tom Kohler-Cadmore, Jack Leaning and Jordan Thompson, as Gary Ballance yet again propped up the batting with 54. Craig Miles took four for 32, Oliver Hannon-Dalby three for 60.</p> <p>Zak Crawley\u2019s 111 was the shining light around which <strong>Kent</strong>\u2019s tail were drawn, after five of their top six were out in single figures against <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong>. Four days after being bowled out for 59 by Somerset, Kent were 119 for six at Tunbridge Wells. But Crawley found backup from Grant Stewart and Harry Podmore, and they cobbled together a third batting point. James Pattinson did the damage with six for 73. Notts were 30 for 0 at the close.</p> <p>In Division Two, Sam Robson and Paul Stirling made hundreds as <strong>Middlesex</strong> passed 400. In reply, <strong>Glamorgan</strong> recovered from a second-ball run-out, with a Marnus Labuschagne 50.</p> <p>At Derby play did not start until after lunch, but that was plenty of time for <strong>Lancashire</strong>\u2019s Jimmy Anderson (five for 18), and Graham Onions (three for 19) to take a scythe to <strong>Derbyshire</strong>\u2019s batting. From 24 for five, the tail wagged to 153 all out. Keaton Jennings was out lbw for a duck before the close.</p> <p>A partnership of 320 between Neil Dexter and Hasan Azad, a first-class record for <strong>Leicestershire</strong>\u2019s second wicket, put them firmly on top against <strong>Gloucestershire</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Worcestershire</strong>\u2019s scheduled game against <strong>S</strong><strong>ussex</strong> was moved to Kidderminster and now starts today after flood water swamped New Road.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-17T20:23:56.331Z\">at 9.23pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d07dc6c8f08374cc578fe6c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-17T18:36:20.199Z\">7.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A ridiculous day\u2019s cricket at Chelmsford,</strong> and plenty more collapses from York to Canterbury, with a bit of Derby on the side.

      "bodyText": "It was day two, over and out at Chelmsford after Hampshire\u2019s batting subsided to 88 all out and defeat by an innings and eight runs against Essex. Eight players made four or less as Simon Harmer, brought on in the fourth over after an injury to Sam Cook, finished with seven for 38, and 12 for 61 in the match, to become the leading wicket-taker in Division One with 42. Essex themselves had been bowled out before lunch thanks to tireless efforts from Kyle Abbott, but that was but a bean compared with what was to come. Yorkshire\u2019s middle order suffered against Warwickshire at the first County Championship match at York since 1890, losing five for eight in 10 overs. There were ducks for Tom Kohler-Cadmore, Jack Leaning and Jordan Thompson, as Gary Ballance yet again propped up the batting with 54. Craig Miles took four for 32, Oliver Hannon-Dalby three for 60. Zak Crawley\u2019s 111 was the shining light around which Kent\u2019s tail were drawn, after five of their top six were out in single figures against Nottinghamshire. Four days after being bowled out for 59 by Somerset, Kent were 119 for six at Tunbridge Wells. But Crawley found backup from Grant Stewart and Harry Podmore, and they cobbled together a third batting point. James Pattinson did the damage with six for 73. Notts were 30 for 0 at the close. In Division Two, Sam Robson and Paul Stirling made hundreds as Middlesex passed 400. In reply, Glamorgan recovered from a second-ball run-out, with a Marnus Labuschagne 50. At Derby play did not start until after lunch, but that was plenty of time for Lancashire\u2019s Jimmy Anderson (five for 18), and Graham Onions (three for 19) to take a scythe to Derbyshire\u2019s batting. From 24 for five, the tail wagged to 153 all out. Keaton Jennings was out lbw for a duck before the close. A partnership of 320 between Neil Dexter and Hasan Azad, a first-class record for Leicestershire\u2019s second wicket, put them firmly on top against Gloucestershire. Worcestershire\u2019s scheduled game against Sussex was moved to Kidderminster and now starts today after flood water swamped New Road. A ridiculous day\u2019s cricket at Chelmsford, and plenty more collapses from York to Canterbury, with a bit of Derby on the side. Thanks for all your comments, looking forward to reading about Lancashire\u2019s batting tomorrow - Graham\u2019s classy and knowledgeable hands take over from the front row of the probably very cold press tent in York. Have a lovely evening, good night! A few final thoughts before I write up - Glamorgan recovering, as we\u2019ve now come to expect, 78 for one. And Notts starting well - four for 0. Hampshire\u2019s head coach Adi Birrell is still shaking his head at Chelmsford. \u201cWe had four overs to bat before lunch and lost a wicket straight away, Ajinkya got a first baller, so we were on the back foot right from the start. \u201cHarmer bowls fairly well but the ball wasn\u2019t turning square, it wasn\u2019t impossible to bat. \u201cJoe Weatherley batted through. He applied himself and needed someone to bat through with him. \u201cIt is a painful and hurtful result. We have had a talk in the dressing room and we have to take it on the chin. Hopefully it is a defeat in isolation. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to let this affect us. It was a very bad two days. \u201cWe had three wins and a couple of draws and it had been okay up until now. We need to get back onto the horse. \u201cWe are not proud of what happened but we can\u2019t fall in a heap. We need to get off the floor and dust ourselves down.\u201d Derbyshire 96 for 8 - If Anderson (5-14) don\u2019t get you Onions (3-17) must. Has anyone else seen the big bus advert with Rashid Khan advertising money exchange or some such? A career-best at Grace Road and I see that a Notts-up is imminent at Tunbridge Wells with Kent 288 for nine. Just checked out the Nottinghamshire team - Peter Moores has stuck with Joe Clarke, though his place must be hanging by a thread. Canterbury last week, Chelmsford this week. That little corner of south-east England is a bowlers\u2019 paradise. Two hundreds at Grace Road! Neil Dexter 159 not out and Hasan Azad 110 not out. Record breaking too -comfortably beating Leicestershire\u2019s previous highest second-wicket partnership against Gloucestershire, 153 by Barry Dudleston and Chris Balderstone at Bristol in 1979. I just hope there\u2019s a few people there to see it. David Willey having fun at York - six fours in his 35 not out. Yorks 169 for seven. James Pattinson\u2019s marvellous day getting better after he bowls Zak Crawley for 111. He now has 6 for 73. Crawley catching the eye again with runs while the others fall about him. I\u2019m not sure quite how they managed it but Glamorgan are 0-1. Selman run out. Right, back now till write-up time. Daniel\u2019s done an amazing job! Killed off Essex and overseen a resurgent Yorkshire. Derbyshire must be happyish with 86 for five from the ruins of their start. Glamorgan are nearly through Middlesex, De Lange having Sowter caught by Cullen for 24. The last pair are together with the score 409-9. Leicestershire are piling them on at Grace Road and Hasan Azad is nearing a century, 93 not out; his team are 243-1. After a flurry of wickets up and down the country, we\u2019re now consolidating. At 82-5, Derbyshire are literally flying. At Taunton, Sheldon Cottrell has just nailed a ludicrous run out, off his own bowling, to send Tamim Iqbal back to the pavilion. Make sure to look it up. Derbyshire are fighting back against Lancashire, now 72-5. Hughes and Critchley have made 22 and 26 respectively, their partnership 48. It\u2019s on. They\u2019re taking tea at Canterbury with Kent at 236-8. Notts will be the happier side, I\u2019d say. Uge wicket at haitch cue! Labuschagne has bowled Stirling for 138, and Middlesex are 394-8. Yorkshire have taken tea on 139-6. At the crease are Ballance and Willey, 52 not out and 22 not out respectively, so Warwickshire still have plenty of work to do. At Grace Road, Leicestershire have taken tea in a pleasant spot; they\u2019re 210-1 against Gloucestershire, with Azad 73 not out and Dexter unbeaten on 128. At Canterbury, Kent have lost a couple of wickets, Pattinson knocking over both Stewart and Rayner for 59 and 0 respectively. Crawley is still there but, 100 not out, and the score now is 226-8. That win for Essex puts them third in the division one table, on 85 points. They\u2019re six ahead of Yorkshire, seven behind Hants and 30 off Somerset. Test cricket\u2019s lowest bat-carrying score is 26* \u2013 recorded at Newlands by Bernard Tancred of South Africa, against England in 1889, What am I saying! Crane has gone for 20 and Edwards for a duck, both to Harmer who finishes with 7-38! Weatherley carries his bat for the aforementioned 29. Hants, 88-8 in their second innings, now trail Essex, who have batted only once, by eight runs. Weatherley, who opened is 29 not out, and I\u2019m guessing that people have carried bats for less but nonetheless that\u2019s a decently meagre total. Derbyshire 28 for five... Onions 3-9, Anderson 2-9...while Yorkshire recover to 111 for six, thanks once again to Gary Ballance (45 and counting) At Lord\u2019s, Middlesex are 362-7 against Glamorgan; Labuschagne has just trapped Helm for 8. All this must be great preparation for the flat tracks you find in Test cricket. Yorkshire have also lost a wicket against Warwickshire, Hannon-Dalby getting his third to see Thompson away for a duck. The score is now 107-6. When you\u2019re 21-4 what you really need is England\u2019s greatest-ever bowler running in, and that\u2019s exactly what Derby have got. And guess what? James Anderson has bowled Harvey Hosein, whose boys are now 26-5. Wicket! Graham Onions has a third, trapping Tom Lace leg before. He made 4, and his team are now 21-4. Hants are in all sorts, but I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ve seen the shine off now and have arrived at the shining uplands. Derbyshire are rebuilding, now 15-3. Where\u2019s Kim Barnett when you need him? Hi everyone - Daniel Harris stepping in until Tanya\u2019s return. I\u2019m going to be slightly distracted for the next hour, and oh my , Derbyshire are 14 for 3. .. Yorkies, Yorkies! 94 for four as they lose three for one. Ducks for Kohler-Cadmore and Leaning. Weatherley hanging on, 19 not out at the top of the Hampshire order and Abbott\u2019s thwacked three fours and a six in his 18 - not surprised he\u2019s a little mad with his batsmen... Harmer 5-11.... Hampshire 32 for 6 and looking likely to be all out, game over, before a three o\u2019clock old-school ciggie break. Harmer now 4 for 11. A third for Pattinson at Tunbridge Wells, Kent 151 for 6. Yorkshire off to a flyer, Fraine and Ballance whipping them along to 81 for one. And Paul Stirling 94 not out at Radlett. Derbyshire currently 0-0, it could be as good as it gets. Soap on a rope Hampshire! Porter 2-11, Harmer 2-7, Hampshire 26 for four. Derby will bat first when the teams finally get out - nasty line up for the batsman to contemplate over hot-pot. Arjun Tendulkar, 19 year old son of Sachin, in action against that powerful Surrey second XI this morning. Interesting things afoot at Chelmsford - it looks like the game will be over in two days. Hampshire now 5-2 in their second innings -those 91 runs for parity seem a long, long, way away. Good news! They\u2019ll be able to start the match at 2.30 at Derby, where a South African batting great has appeared. And some of KP\u2019s best work tonight on National Geographic at 9pm. Division One day two Chelmsford: Essex 214 (Bopara 59, Lawrence 57; Abbott 4-54) v Hampshire 118 all out (Harmer 5-23) &amp; 5-1. Tunbridge Wells: Kent 105-5 (Crawley 54 not out) v Nottinghamshire lunch will be taken at 1.30 -York: Yorkshire 47-1 v Warwickshire Division Two Radlett: Middlesex 272-4 (Robson 107) v Glamorgan Derby: Derby v Lancashire. No play yet today. Grace Road: Leicestershire 89-1 (Dexter 63 not out) v Gloucestershire A cat picture from Taunton before lunch - scores to follow. Bit of news: Sussex have signed former Warwickshire all-rounder Aaron Thomason. And a fourth has just fallen at Tunbridge Wells - Kent 89 for four. Fletcher now has two for 27. Robson out for 107 at Radlett, Middx 259/4 and Neil Dexter - 62 off 72 balls - making batting look easy at Grace Road, Leicestershire 86/1. Oh, Essex have had rather a collapse. They\u2019ve just lost five for 18 - Abbot a spell of three in nine balls, Edwards two in two. Essex 212/9. It\u2019s always lovely to get an email. Finbar writes from Milan: \u201cMorning Tanya, just reflecting on what a great moment it is to be a Somerset fan; The Royal London already under our belt, a 26 point lead in the championship and no stress today as we\u2019re not even playing but our nearest rivals are (and they\u2019re struggling). Feels a bit weird for things to be going so well ...... a bit like England going into the World Cup as favourites. By the way sounds like quite an atmosphere at Old Trafford yesterday.\u201d It all is looking rather fabulous for Somerset. I\u2019ve glanced at their fixture list. The last three games are v Yorkshire at Taunton, v Hampshire at the Ageas and v Essex at Taunton. Would it be terrible jinxing to hope they don\u2019t clinch it at Southampton? And it was an amazing atmosphere at Old Trafford - just a joy to see so many people totally in love with the game, or even with that game - it didn\u2019t matter. Great stat from Nick Hoult, and I may have fallen off the biscuit wagon. They were a lot better than custard creams though - big fat shortbreads in whacking great fingers and tetrahedrons. They\u2019re due to restart at 12.45 at York, with 13 overs lost to the rain; and at Derby the day is slipping away - a further inspection at 1.30. Lyth didn\u2019t last long at York, and nor did play. Off for rain, with Yorkshire 9 for one. And congratulations to Sam Robson, 101 not out, his first first-class hundred this season - against Glamorgan. Delving into cricinfo\u2019s archive of goodies, he made 37 in the last of his seven Tests, against India in 2014. Since then England have tried Adam Lyth, Keaton Jennings, Haseeb Hameed, Rory Burns and Mark Stoneman up the order alongside Alastair Cook. Have I missed anyone? Sensational picture from York - squint hard and look at all those hardy souls in the stand. Defiance in the face of the elements. Wishing you seasonable warmth. Bit of a nasty shock for the MCC Young Cricketers: Ravi Bopara has been dismissed for 59 at Chelmsford, Essex 174-4; a second for Pattinson at Tunbridge Wells, Denly lbw; Yorkshire are batting at York - so far, so good. And in division two, Sam Robson is on the brink - 98 not out. One thing: here they come at York for the time since Vincent van Gogh died and the Forth bridge was opened to trains. Enough now before I fall down a wormhole. Second thing: look, LOOK!, at these shadows at Radlett. An excellent round-up of the current Championship situation by Gary Naylor. Ball six is slam in the slot - and I learnt a new word: \u201dautochthonous.\u201d At Derby, there will be no play before lunch, with a further inspection at 12.20, and at York the pitter patter of raindrops has ended and play will start in five minutes. Thanks for the kick BTL. Here is Moeen Ali\u2019s latest column, and rather lovely it is too. World Cup news update: Jason Roy will miss England\u2019s next two World Cup matches, but Eoin Morgan might be fit for England\u2019s game against Afghanistan tomorrow. And Chadd Sayers makes a breakthrough at Grace Road, having Paul Horton caught behind for nothing at all . Leicestershire 6/1. And Kent lose a wicket to the third ball of the match: Sean Dickson caught behind off James Pattinson for four. Kent 4 for one. Alas poor York, where it has just started raining again. Wise, kind and measured words from Nasser Hussain. And at Taunton for Bangladesh v West Indies, it is not raining and no rain is forecast! It\u2019s a must win game for both sides - follow it here with John Ashdown and later Geoff Lemon. Rain watch: things are looking up. All certainly more cheery than for my 13 year old, who was delighted to be missing school today with a game, only for the match to be called off and him to have to go to school unprepared for a geography exam. I want it on record that I had pointed out that this was a possibility. Anyway: Division One Chelmsford: no word yet. Tunbridge Wells: play due to start on time. No rain expected today York: play due to start on time. Grey. Division Two Radlett: I see sunshine via twitter. Play will start on time. Derby: delayed start with an inspection at 11am. Wet outfield. Grace Road: play is due to start at 11am. Cloudy. The last time first-class cricket was played in York was 1890, when Lord Hawke ruled the roost. At York, where the skies look, um, slate Duanne Olivier is rested after the hip strain he picked up at Guildford. Tim Bresnan, Matthew Waite and Jared Warner are also injured, but David Willey returns. Henry Brookes and Ryan Sidebottom miss out for Warwickshire. Kent are strengthened by Wiaan Mulder but Sam Billings (shoulder), Calum Haggett (elbow) and Ivan Thomas (knee) are all out with injury. Notts are resting Stuart Broad at the ECB\u2019s request , as Notts return to Tunbridge Wells for the first time since they won the title in 2010. Division Two Derbyshire have named an unchanged squad to face the leaders. Richard Gleeson makes the Lancashire squad after being rested last week but there is no space for leg-spinner Matt Parkinson . Wicketkeeper Lewis Hill returns for Leicestershire and Will Davis and Callum Parkinson are also included in a 13-man squad. Gloucestershire are unchanged. And a New Road update - there was supposed to be a game there - Worcestershire v Sussex starting today. But because of the flooding, the game has been switched to Kidderminster and will start tomorrow. Just been reading up on yesterday. Essex rested Peter Siddle who is suffering from a twinge and brought back Adam Wheater, who has missed ten weeks with a thumb injury. Simon Harmer\u2019s five wicket haul was his fourth in five CC games. He now has 35 first-class wickets at 19.4 -the same number as Lewis Gregory and Jeetan Patel, annointed kings of the Div One ball. And Radlett is a happy hunting ground for Sam Robson. His 85 is his highest first-class score of the season, his only century of the season came in a RL Cup game there against Somerset. Welcome back to the county circuit, where life goes on behind the bombast and brilliance, and rain, relentless rain, of the World Cup. Here is the soggy scene at New Road, where Worcester were due to play Sussex. Lots of counties have scheduled this week for festival games - Radlett is holding its first ever Championship game, Kent entertain at Tunbridge Wells and York holds its first game of first-class cricket for 129 years. Four games start today, two - Middlesex v Glamorgan and Essex v Hampshire -started yesterday. At Chelmsford Simon Harmer decimated Hampshire and Sam Robson batted out two soggy sessions against Glamorgan. Division One day two Chelmsford: Essex 147-3 (Bopara 50 not out) v Hampshire 118 all out (Harmer 5-23) Tunbridge Wells: Kent v Nottinghamshire York: Yorkshire v Warwickshire Division Two Radlett: Middlesex 151-3 (Robson 85 not out) v Glamorgan Derby: Derby v Lancashire Grace Road: Leicestershire v Gloucestershire",

Froome crashed into a wall at 37mph in the French town of Roanne last Wednesday, leaving him with multiple broken bones including a fractured neck, a fractured right femur, a broken hip and fractured ribs. Thomas, who will lead Team Ineos into the Tour de France in Froome\u2019s absence, said the accident \u201ccould have been a hell of a lot worse\u201d and admitted the absence of the 34-year-old will be a \u201cbig blow\u201d to the team. \u201cIt\u2019s scary. It\u2019s never nice to hear, especially when it\u2019s a close friend. It sounds horrific really,\u201d Thomas told the BBC. \u201cIt sounds like he was lucky to come away with the damage he\u2019s done. It could\u2019ve been a hell of a lot worse, which I guess is a positive in a bad scenario. \u201cHe\u2019s got the best care around him so hopefully he can get back on the bike soon. I\u2019ve sent him a couple of messages but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s got a few to get through. The whole team\u2019s behind him.\u201d Last year Thomas became the third Briton, after Bradley Wiggins and Froome, to win the Tour de France. The question of who would lead the new Team Ineos into this year\u2019s race was subsequently a hot topic \u2013 now rendered academic by Froome\u2019s injuries. Thomas said he is excited to be taking charge, though he accepts the team face challenges if they are to succeed. \u201cEvery interview I\u2019ve done this year, they\u2019ve asked about [team leadership]. That\u2019s one thing everyone can stop asking me now. Being the leader of the team, I\u2019ve led the team numerous times now and I\u2019ve got used to that role. We\u2019ve got Egan [Bernal] as well, who\u2019s going to be there by my side, so it\u2019s going to be exciting. \u201cWhen it comes to the actual race, [Froome] is one of the greatest Grand Tour riders ever, so not having him in the team is a big blow. It gives us one less option when it comes to the last few kilometres of the big mountain stages but that\u2019s sport and you\u2019ve got to deal with it. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a strong squad anyway and whoever comes in, OK they\u2019re not Chris Froome but they\u2019ll still add to the team.\u201d",

Thanks to sound economic policy and the hard work of the British people, our deficit is down to a more manageable level of 1.1%. However, the years of high deficits have taken a toll on our national debt, which rose from around 35% of GDP before the financial crisis to a peak of over 85% in 2016-17, its highest level in fifty years. Thankfully, our debt is now falling sustainably for the first time in a generation. As we look forward, it is vital that we do not undo these achievements by making unfunded commitments that would mean debt rising again; leave the economy vulnerable to shocks; burden future generations and waste billions on additional interest payments.</p> <p>If we do not commit to getting our debt down after a nine-year run of uninterrupted economic growth, how can we demonstrate a dividing line between the fiscal responsibility of our party and the reckless promises of John McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn?</p> <p>I therefore ask you, as a candidate for the leadership of the Conservative party, to pledge that if you are the next prime minister your government will, at a minimum, have a clear commitment to keeping our national debt falling every year, and to maintain the current limit of the deficit at 2% of GDP at least through 2021-22.</p> </blockquote> <p>In his letter Hammond also said that, if candidates did make this pledge, they would lose the chance to raise spending or cut taxes. He explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This pledge does not mean that there is no extra money to spend. As I said at the spring statement, if we can avoid major economic shocks and if we leave the EU in a smooth and orderly way, an incoming prime minister will have genuine choices about how to use the available borrowing capacity implied by these fiscal commitments: increased spending on public services, capital investment in Britain\u2019s future prosperity, cutting taxes or more rapidly reducing the national debt. On the current OBR forecast, these commitments would mean, after allowing for the expected reclassification by the ONS of student debt, around \u00a315bn of headroom available in 2020-21; \u00a319bn in 2021-22; \u00a321bn in 2022-23; and \u00a325bn in 2023-24, though a prudent administration would not use all the available borrowing capacity given the potential for forecast revisions.</p> </blockquote> <p>Today, at an event in the City of London, Hammond said said the Tory leadership candidates were at risk of squandering the party\u2019s reputation for fiscal responsibility. Only Rory Stewart had agreed to honour the pledge, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is a disappointment to me that only one of the candidates remaining in the race, Rory Stewart, has actually signed up to that pledge. </p> <p>I would urge the other candidates to do so, to reassure the public that our hard-won reputation for fiscal responsibility is not going to be squandered during the course of this competition.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hammond\u2019s comment seemed to be aimed at Boris Johnson, the clear favourite, in particular<strong>. David Gauke</strong>, the justice secretary, made a similar point on Twitter this morning.

The 80-odd journalists did not emerge with a strong, collective sense that any single candidate had performed particularly well or badly, and the entire event was off-camera anyway, and so you are not going to see it on TV. But here\u2019s a summary of how each candidate performed, in order of their appearance.</p> <p><strong>Rory Stewart:</strong> Stewart has emerged as the best candidate in the contest for non-Tories (a category that probably includes a majority of lobby journalists) and he got good reviews from the Channel 4 debate last night. But today he may have lost ground with that constituency a bit. His greatest strength has been his willingness to point out the transparent flaws in the Brexit plans proposed by all his rivals, but today his own Brexit plan (try again for Theresa May\u2019s deal, and if not use a citizens\u2019 assembly to find a solution) sounded almost as flaky. His refusal to say if he would vote remain or leave in another referendum sounded feeble (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/17/tory-leadership-boost-for-boris-johnson-as-gove-tones-down-his-criticism-of-his-candidature-live-news?page=with:block-5d0769ef8f08532f138d318c#block-5d0769ef8f08532f138d318c\"> 11.25am)</a>, and he seems to have gone back on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/13/conservative-leadership-tory-mps-start-voting-for-new-leader-live-news?page=with:block-5d024b4a8f080adae4897642#block-5d024b4a8f080adae4897642\">what he said last week about being willing to \u201cbring down\u201d a Boris Johnson government committed to no-deal</a>. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/17/tory-leadership-boost-for-boris-johnson-as-gove-tones-down-his-criticism-of-his-candidature-live-news?page=with:block-5d076b518f08263b930f1024#block-5d076b518f08263b930f1024\"> 11.29am.) </a>He has also had to clear up what he said about President Trump. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/17/tory-leadership-boost-for-boris-johnson-as-gove-tones-down-his-criticism-of-his-candidature-live-news?page=with:block-5d0793558f08374cc578fabd#block-5d0793558f08374cc578fabd\">2.24pm.) </a>However, on reducing the north/south divide, he was the most plausible of all the candidates, stressing the importance of transport above all else.</p> <p><strong>Sajid Javid: </strong>In terms of background, if not in terms of politics, Javid is easily the most distinctive candidate in the contest and his account of why he went into banking (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/17/tory-leadership-boost-for-boris-johnson-as-gove-tones-down-his-criticism-of-his-candidature-live-news?page=with:block-5d078be18f08532f138d3322#block-5d078be18f08532f138d3322\"> 2.06pm) </a>was easily one of the most memorable moments of the hustings. </p> <p><strong>Jeremy Hunt: </strong>Hunt is supposed to be one of the moderate contenders in the campaign, and so it was surprising that, of all the five candidates, he was most willing to endorse what President Trump said about Sadiq Khan. Like Rory Stewart, he has been in retreat on this since the hustings were over. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/17/tory-leadership-boost-for-boris-johnson-as-gove-tones-down-his-criticism-of-his-candidature-live-news?page=with:block-5d0797dc8f08532f138d33b2#block-5d0797dc8f08532f138d33b2\">2.43pm.)</a> This may make him look like a bit of an idiot to the media, although Tory MPs, and party members, may well take a different view about Khan-bashing. Hunt was particularly unconvincing in the hustings when asked about the impact of Brexit on the UK\u2019s standing in the world, and the reaction of EU leaders to his speech at the Tory conference comparing the EU to the USSR, but he did demonstrate how to perform an effective clean-hands tackle when he was asked if he blamed Boris Johnson for the continuing incarceration of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. He did not want to reply, he said - because everyone makes mistakes.</p> <p><strong>Dominic Raab:</strong> Raab was not particularly convincing when trying to defend his record as Brexit secretary (see <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesCrisp6/status/1140538590629416960\">this Twitter thread</a> from the Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp for the counter view) and Raab\u2019s claim that citizens\u2019 assemblies are some sort of Venezuelan anti-democratic abomination (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/17/tory-leadership-boost-for-boris-johnson-as-gove-tones-down-his-criticism-of-his-candidature-live-news?page=with:block-5d077a988f08374cc578f98a#block-5d077a988f08374cc578f98a\"> 12.38pm)</a> is just bizarre. (They have used them in Ireland too.) But he was the only candidate firmly promising tax cuts in an emergency Brexit budget, regardless of whether or not the UK was heading for a no-deal.

He was reluctant to say any more about his use of drugs, his account of his critique of the Good Friday agreement was partial (in fact, <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/michael-gove-a-fanatic-who-would-damage-peace-process-1.2710224\">he was so hostile to the GFA he compared it to appeasement),</a> but he provided one of the smartest answers to the Trump question.

But I think what people want to see is someone who is genuine, who is honest, who has answers and experience of life, real life, life in business.</p> <p>The reason I got into banking, one of the reasons, is because for a young Asian like me, most Asians, they go into jobs that you need to take an exam for, like chartered accountant, dentist - it\u2019s not because that\u2019s what their parents think is the only thing open to them - the reason that happens is because their parents feel that discrimination is so inevitable in professions where you don\u2019t have to take exams that the best way to get in is to have a piece of paper [showing you are qualified for the job]. So I did banking because it\u2019s much more meritocratic.</p> </blockquote> <p>Javid also said he thought Stewart\u2019s problem was that he was spending too much time appealing to Labour voters rather than Conservative votes. He also said the public did not want to see a competition between Boris Johnson and Stewart, two people who both went to the country\u2019s most elite school (Eton).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"114b118e00ddca6d5e89d681b75bcb99ddd48ad6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/114b118e00ddca6d5e89d681b75bcb99ddd48ad6/0_139_4115_2469/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sajid Javid leaving his London home this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sajid Javid leaving his London home this morning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Dray/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-17T14:35:27.878Z\">at 3.35pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d07885e8f08374cc578fa4f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-17T12:37:21.721Z\">1.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Rory Stewart, Sajid Javid and Dominic Raab all say they think they have enough votes to stay in Tory leadership contest</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here\u2019s another story from the hustings, filed by the Press Association.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Tory leadership hopefuls <strong>Rory Stewart </strong>and <strong>Sajid Javid </strong>believe they have the required number of supporters to survive Tuesday\u2019s second round of voting. </p> <p>Stewart managed to secure just 19 votes in the first ballot and Javid had 23 - both short of the 33 required to stay in the race after the second vote. </p> <p>But the pair told journalists at a special hustings in Westminster that they were confident of remaining in the contest to be the next prime minister. </p> <p>They are a long way short of frontrunner Boris Johnson, who picked up 114 votes last week and has since been boosted by the support of former leadership contender Matt Hancock. </p> <p>At the hustings, Stewart said he had the necessary 33 backers to make it through the second round of voting in the contest \u201cif they do what they say\u201d. <br></p> <p>The international development secretary suggested he was the one to beat Johnson - and accused the former foreign secretary of making different promises to different MPs. </p> <p>\u201cWho is going to be nimble enough, who has the style, who has the approach, who has the way of dealing with the public...

Was Gove concerned about these issues? Gove replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you want to put those questions direct to Boris himself, I know that he will answer them.

We have seen two developments that should firm up his chances of becoming the next prime minister; or perhaps more accurately, two developments that suggest that his rivals have given up hope of beating him.</p> <p>First, <strong>Matt Hancock,</strong> the health secretary who withdraw from the contest on Friday, has announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/17/matt-hancock-backs-boris-johnson-in-tory-leadership-race\">he is backing Johnson.</a> He explains why<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/matt-hancock-boris-and-i-have-had-our-differences-but-he-s-the-one-to-unite-us-mzhqrbvnd\"> in an article in the Times (paywall). </a>Here is an extract from his article:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I said when I withdrew from the contest that I\u2019d consider the best way to advance those values. I\u2019ve now spoken to all the candidates. They are all inspirational people, with many and varied strengths, and I would be proud to serve any of them as my prime minister. I have reflected on what is needed in the national interest, and how the approaches of the candidates fit with my values. Having considered all the options, I\u2019m backing Boris Johnson as the best candidate to unite the Conservative party, so we can deliver Brexit and then unite the country behind an open, ambitious, forward-looking agenda, delivered with the energy that gets stuff done.</p> <p>Boris has run a disciplined campaign and is almost certainly going to be our next prime minister. We need to unite behind him with a strong team that can bring the party together and then bring the country together. After any debate like this, people need to put aside their differences for a greater purpose. My view is that we need to start coming together sooner rather than later.</p> </blockquote> <p>Second, and perhaps more surprisingly, <strong>Michael Gove</strong>, who is still in the contest and who hopes to make it into the final two for the ballot of party members alongside Johnson, has dialled down his criticism of the former foreign secretary. A week ago, at his campaign launch,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jun/10/tory-leadership-boris-johnsons-tax-cut-plan-would-never-get-through-commons-says-leadsom-live-news?page=with:block-5cfe6fcd8f0880dcae93bd88#block-5cfe6fcd8f0880dcae93bd88\"> Gove went for Johnson quite aggressively,</a> condemning his proposed tax cut for the wealthy, implicitly questioning his seriousness and his commitment to Brexit, and at one point even appearing to make a joke about his sexual promiscuity (although he denied this was the intention, so perhaps it was just a case of us reporters thinking dirty). </p> <p>But this morning, in an interview on the Today programme, \u2018Gove, the Johnson slayer\u2019 had disappeared. Instead we heard a Gove who spent half the interview robustly defending his rival (much more convincingly, by the way, than James Cleverly, the Johnson supporter who was on the programme earlier speaking as a Team Johnson representative.) Gove rejected the idea that Johnson was anti-business (the<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44618154\"> \u201cfuck business\u201d</a> was taken out of context, Gove insisted) and he refused to accept that there were any moral reasons why Johnson was not suited to be prime minister. He even at one stage seemed to imply that Johnson was bound to win and that the only reason he (Gove) should be on the ballot for party members was to ensure that Johnson got stretched a bit before his inevitable victory. Gove said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the moment, yes, of course it is the case that Boris is the front-runner.</p> <p>But we need to make sure that he is tested and that we have two candidates who go forward - if Boris is one of them - who we know are capable of being prime minister from day one. </p> </blockquote> <p>I will post more from the interview shortly.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>10.30am:</em> Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, gives a speech on Brexit.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the days\u2019 events. The Tory leadership candidates \u2013 with the exception of Boris Johnson \u2013 faced lobby journalists at a hustings. You can read a comprehensive summary of that here. Rory Stewart secured the backing of the de facto deputy prime minister, David Lidington. The move was a major boost to Stewart\u2019s campaign and suggests he may remain in the running beyond the next vote. The other leadership candidates were warned that they risk squandering the Tories reputation for fiscal responsibility. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said he was disappointed that only Rory Stewart had signed his pledge to commit to keeping the national debt falling every year if they become prime minister. David Gauke, who is backing Rory Stewart, also said some of the policy promises made by Boris Johnson could cause public borrowing to soar. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, accused his party of being afraid to make the case for remaining in the EU. \u201cWe talk about the evils of no-deal till we\u2019re blue in the face, because we\u2019re still scared to tell the truth about Europe,\u201d he said. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Rowena Mason and Jessica Elgot have the full story: Alyn Smith, the Scottish National party MEP, has apologised unreservedly to the chairman of the Brexit party and donated an undisclosed sum to the military charity, Help for Heroes, after claiming the Brexit party was \u201ca shell company that\u2019s a money laundering front\u201d. Richard Tice, the chairman and co-founder of the Brexit party, demanded a retraction after Smith made the remarks live on Sky News following the European election earlier this month, in which the Brexit party won a Scottish regional seat. Smith initially refused to back down, leading Tice to threaten libel action. Smith has now withdrawn his remarks and paid \u201csignificantly\u201d towards Tice\u2019s legal costs, according to the Brexit party. In a statement issued by his solicitors, Smith said: On 27 May 2019, I was interviewed by Sky News. In that interview, I stated in the context of political donations that the Brexit party is a \u2018shell company that\u2019s a money laundering front\u2019. Its chairman, Richard Tice, is concerned by implication this allegation related to him, although that was not my intention. Having reflected upon this following a complaint from Mr Tice, I apologise unreservedly to him and withdraw my allegation. I am happy to state clearly that I do not have any evidence to support such an allegation. I spoke in the heat of the moment and I am happy to set the record straight. I have agreed to pay a sum in damages to the Help for Heroes charity and I have agreed to pay legal costs. Tice said he was pleased Smith had withdrawn his \u201cwholly unfounded and damaging allegations\u201d, adding: People are entitled to take a different view of Brexit and I respect their right to do so. But I will not hesitate to take action against those who make false claims about the Brexit party and, by implication, those of us who run it. Writing for the Guardian this evening, the Labour MP Stella Creasy has launched a vehement attack on the Parliamentary authorities, saying they are forcing her to choose between being an MP and being a mother. Stewart ends on a question about prison reform. He calls prisons \u201cone of the great hidden scars on our country\u201d. He says that, compared to other state institutions \u2013 such as schools and hospitals, relatively few people have any experience of prisons. He says you \u201cprotect the public by running a decent, safe and humane prison\u201d in which people can receive the necessary education and mental health treatment they need to prevent recidivism. Asked about a citizens\u2019 assembly, Stewart says Parliament is sovereign. But, if it gets stuck again, a \u201cgrand jury of citizens\u201d could be given three weeks to look at the task and bring back recommendations to Parliament. Addressing a question about potentially changing the constitution of the Tory party, Stewart says the membership is its lifeblood and declares himself jealous of Jeremy Corbyn because he has increased the Labour party\u2019s membership. He says there was an assumption the major parties were in a managed decline but that Corbyn \u201cturned it all around\u201d by talking about things he believed in. He says he wants to rebuild the Tory party by being \u201cproud to be Conservatives\u201d. Stewart is asked to condemn the exclusion of Sajid Javid from the state dinner with Donald Trump, as well as Jeremy Hunt for his support for the US president\u2019s racially charged criticism of Sadiq Khan. He refers to a previous question from a young man who had said he didn\u2019t feel Stewart was able to engage with him in a meaningful way. Stewart says he needs to get better at connecting with people who do not speak the same way he does. Earlier, Stewart had tweeted about the tweet at the heart of the Hunt issue: Stewart is asked about calling a second Brexit referendum on the basis that the first was run in a fundamentally dishonest fashion. He says he was one of the many who was surprised by the result and recognises that, since then, many people have come to support a second vote. This would not achieve what its proponents believe it would, he says. Asked about honesty in the campaign, he says it\u2019s important but this the \u201csea in which we swim\u201d as politicians. Stewart says that, regardless of the information people are given, each of them has an equal right to choose how they vote. Stewart says that means compromise is necessary \u2013 and such cannot be achieved by either the remain or hard Brexit camps. Asked what he\u2019d to do bring back into the fold those Tory supporters who have voted for the Brexit party. He says 70% of those people didn\u2019t vote that way because they supported the party but because they wanted to signal that they wanted the Brexit process to be over with. The delays, he says, suit the pro-remain and pro-hard Brexit camps because they strengthen the possibility of one or the other coming about eventually. The Brexit deal on the table, he says, is the \u201conly one out there\u201d. He says the candidates who believe they\u2019ll go back to the EU and get a better one will only bring about further delay. He also says it\u2019s pointless to consider whether any route other than the parliamentary one would be legal or constitutional way of pushing through Brexit. Stewart is asked what he would do to restore the UK\u2019s prestige on the world stage. He says, if the country wants it, it has to demonstrate it and that it has fallen into the trap of assuming that asserting greatness achieves it. We\u2019ve got to be a serious country ... [that] means conducting yourself with realism, with humility and doing what you say. Asked about his position on adult social care, Stewart tells the audience there are certain issues about which candidates are advised not to talk. One of those is adult social care, for which he has proposed greater funding. Every time he does so, he says, he gains more support. Addressing the question directly, he says that how we look after the most vulnerable in society is the measure by which we will be judged. Stewart is now taking questions from the audience. He\u2019s asked if he\u2019ll commit to gender-parity in his government. \u201cIt\u2019s a really good challenge,\u201d he says, but adds he cannot totally agree. He says the cabinet should have more women but that they need to be the right people. First, he says, he needs to get more women elected as members of parliament so that he has the pool of talent from which to choose. Stewart is acknowledging the backing of both Lidington and Gauke and has described the positive effect the latter has had on his career in government. He also points out the MP for East Renfrewshire, Paul Masterton, who is present in the audience. Stewart tells the audience occupying the centre ground is nothing to be ashamed of and that the country needs a politician who\u2019ll speak honestly to them about the difficulties ahead. And he tells them the Tory party needs to address issues such as the environment. Lidington says Stewart\u2019s campaigning style has demonstrated there are \u201cno no-go areas\u201d for the Conservative party. Then he hands over to Stewart, who says he was beginning to get depressed about British politics. He says that, until recently, hefelt powerless and that nothing he tried to achieve in government ever got done. David Lidington is on stage at Rory Stewart\u2019s rally in London. He tells the audience he thinks there\u2019s a \u201cyearning in this country for political leaders who tell it straight to people\u201d and who are honest about the difficulties ahead. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office secretary and Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, has switched to backing Rory Stewart for the Conservative party leadership. He had previously supported Matt Hancock, who pulled out of the race last week. Stewart\u2019s spokesman says: Rory is incredibly proud to have the support of David Lidington \u2013 the deputy prime minister. A huge vote of confidence not just in Rory\u2019s campaign, but in his ability to deliver as prime minister Tom Watson\u2019s Brexit speech this morning, which we previewed yesterday, was overshadowed by the Tory leadership hustings. But I\u2019ve now had a chance to read the text, and here are three extracts. Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, said his party had been afraid to make the case for remaining in the EU. He said: We talk about the evils of no-deal till we\u2019re blue in the face, because we\u2019re still scared to tell the truth about Europe. We\u2019re more comfortable warning of an ineffable catastrophe, because we\u2019re hard-wired to be unable to say the words that I\u2019ve come here this morning to say: The European Union is not something to apologise for. It is a good thing. It is Good with a capital G. An enduring, deep, benevolent collaboration between sovereign states unique in the history of the world. It produced a lasting peace from the ashes of war. It produced prosperity where there had been deprivation. It produced transnational partnership where once there was suspicion and division. It\u2019s not perfect, but what large institution is? The core values of the EU are internationalism. Solidarity. Freedom. Those are British values. And they\u2019re Labour values. I\u2019m a European democratic socialist. I don\u2019t go along with the EU despite being a socialist, I embrace the EU because I am a socialist. Democratic socialism is achieving common causes by the strength of collective endeavour. That\u2019s what Europe is. He cited Shakespeare as an example of someone who was profoundly English and European. Probably the most important Englishman who ever lived was William Shakespeare. A man of the Midlands, like me, whose transcendent imagination was as broadly and deeply European as it was English ... One only needs look at where the plays took place: Rome, Athens, Venice, Padua, Milan, Cyprus, Navarra, Messina, Vienna, Denmark, the Balkans, Sicily. And he wasn\u2019t just using places he\u2019d visited as handy material. He never left the UK. He conceived and realised these settings because being European was central to his sense of who he was, and what it meant to be English. Erasmus and Plutarch loomed as large in his imagination as did Chaucer and Sidney. Mediaeval London was a bustling melting pot of migrants from all over the world. The greatest Englishman, 400 years ago, was wholly, deeply European. He said Labour should champion the idea of holding a second referendum. The notion that it\u2019s in some way undemocractic to let the people put an end to this crisis because, after three years, parliament and government cannot, is absurd. And if you want Brexit, and you believe there is still a majority for it in the UK, then a public vote will break the deadlock and deliver the Brexit you want. Whereas if many people have changed their minds and no longer want Brexit now that they have more information about what it means, how is it undemocratic to give them the chance to express that three years on and with the country in limbo? Labour is the party of democracy - so we must ask the people ... Only a public vote can break this deadlock, but we will only achieve this if Labour fights for it and champions it. We must do that \u2013 in Parliament and around the country. Labour must make the positive case. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. At the press gallery hustings this morning Robert Peston, ITV\u2019s political editor, asked all of the Tory leadership candidates who were there if they would accept the definition of a hard border in Ireland (which the government has promised to avoid) set out in the joint report of December 2017. Dominic Raab said he probably would not accept it, Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt and Rory Stewart generally said they would accept it, and Sajid Javid was evasive. In a blog Peston explains why he thinks this matters. For what it is worth, I assume [Boris] Johnson - if he had deigned to turn up - would have agreed with Raab. What flows from all this? That in substance Gove, Hunt and Stewart would struggle to get Brexit approved by MPs, because the DUP and ERG Brexiters will struggle to understand why the backstop isn\u2019t as toxic as it ever was. And Johnson and Raab would probably be told by Whitehall if they want to change the hard border definition they can whistle for it - and that what they really want is a no-deal Brexit. And Javid is yet to make this ultimate Hobson\u2019s Choice. Oh the toxic legacy bequeathed by May to her successor, party and country. Steve Baker, the Tory Brexiter, deputy chairman of the European Research Group, and a supporter of Boris Johnson\u2019s, has posted a Twitter thread saying that it is not just the backstop that is unacceptable to him, but the entire withdrawal agreement (WA). It starts here. And here are two of his key tweets. This illustrates just how hard it will be for Johnson to preserve a coalition that satisfies both Baker and remain-voting supporters of Theresa May\u2019s deal like Matt Hancock. Several readers have been asking below the lines what happens if two candidates come joint last in the Tory leadership ballot tomorrow. This did happen on the first ballot in 2001, when Michael Ancram and David Davis were joint last in the first ballot. There was no provision for this in the rules, and so the ballot was rerun two days later, when Davis beat Ancram by one vote. But, according to this Commons library note (pdf) on Conservative leadership elections (more helpful than the CCHQ press office, which could not give me an answer), rule 26 now makes provision for this event. It says that if there is a tie, the ballot will be rerun. If there is another tie among the candidates with the least votes, they are both/all eliminated. The Conservative 1922 Committee has also introduced, for this contest, a 33-vote threshold for the second ballot. Not just the candidate coming last, but any candidate getting fewer than 33 votes will be eliminated. That increases the chances of candidates being eliminated tomorrow without the need for a rerun. In the editor\u2019s reply slot in today\u2019s Evening Standard, George Osborne, the Tory former chancellor, said that if Boris Johnson became PM, he would need to reach out to socially liberal voters. Osborne explained: I remember as a young Tory aide attending a post-mortem about the 1997 general election landslide defeat. To my amazement, the Conservatives MPs decided that they\u2019d lost because too many people had voted for the then Referendum party (a precursor to today\u2019s Brexit party). I gingerly raised my hand, and observed that I thought the Tories had lost because too many people had voted for Tony Blair. The biggest threat to Conservative MPs comes from Labour and the Liberal Democrats \u2014 the loss of just a handful of seats to the latter would eject them from office. Boris Johnson (assuming he wins the leadership campaign) will need to reach out and reassure millions of socially liberal, urban voters who backed remain. If he doesn\u2019t he\u2019ll have even less time in Downing Street than Theresa May. Philip Hammond has said he held extensive talks over the protests in Hong Kong with Chinese vice premier Hu Chunhua, as part of discussions over economic ties between Britain and China. Although not going into detail on the nature of the talks, the chancellor said the \u201cdifficult subject\u201d had been broached after protests in the former British colony continued into a second week. He told journalists: This dialogue today is primarily about trade and investment but of course the point of having a close partnership is that we can also talk about more difficult subjects, we had a negotiating meeting last night, I\u2019ve already raised the issue of Hong Kong and we\u2019ve had an extensive discussion about it. We\u2019re pleased that the Hong Kong authorities have paused their proposed legislative changes and are going to take time to talk to people, to consult more widely, and to try to build a consensus around the changes that they\u2019re proposing and to ensure that the confidence of business and citizens in Hong Kong is maintained. Speaking at a joint summit with vice premier Hu in the City of London, he also warned that Britain was \u201cvery vulnerable\u201d in the US-China trade war currently raging between Washington and Beijing. Britain is a very open trading economy. We\u2019re very vulnerable to anything that impacts on global trade, global economic growth. I hope that when the two presidents [Donald Trump and Xi Jinping] meet in Japan in a few days time we may hopefully see some significant progress. Dame Caroline Spelman, the Conservative MP who backed Matt Hancock last week, is now supporting Rory Stewart. Downing Street told journalists this afternoon that Theresa May would not have retweeted Katy Hopkins\u2019 comments about \u201cLondonistan\u201d, as President Donald Trump has done. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: The prime minister would not retweet Katy Hopkins, nor use that language. The prime minister agrees with the mayor that knife violence should have no place in London or anywhere else in our country. Asked whether May watched the Channel 4 leadership debate last night, the spokesman added \u201cshe did not, she was doing box work\u201d. Last week Philip Hammond, the chancellor, wrote an open letter to all the Conservative leadership candidates challenging them all to commit to keeping the national debt falling every year if they become PM. Here is the key extract from the letter. When we took office in 2010, we inherited the largest deficit in peacetime history, at 9.9% of GDP. Thanks to sound economic policy and the hard work of the British people, our deficit is down to a more manageable level of 1.1%. However, the years of high deficits have taken a toll on our national debt, which rose from around 35% of GDP before the financial crisis to a peak of over 85% in 2016-17, its highest level in fifty years. Thankfully, our debt is now falling sustainably for the first time in a generation. As we look forward, it is vital that we do not undo these achievements by making unfunded commitments that would mean debt rising again; leave the economy vulnerable to shocks; burden future generations and waste billions on additional interest payments. If we do not commit to getting our debt down after a nine-year run of uninterrupted economic growth, how can we demonstrate a dividing line between the fiscal responsibility of our party and the reckless promises of John McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn? I therefore ask you, as a candidate for the leadership of the Conservative party, to pledge that if you are the next prime minister your government will, at a minimum, have a clear commitment to keeping our national debt falling every year, and to maintain the current limit of the deficit at 2% of GDP at least through 2021-22. In his letter Hammond also said that, if candidates did make this pledge, they would lose the chance to raise spending or cut taxes. He explained: This pledge does not mean that there is no extra money to spend. As I said at the spring statement, if we can avoid major economic shocks and if we leave the EU in a smooth and orderly way, an incoming prime minister will have genuine choices about how to use the available borrowing capacity implied by these fiscal commitments: increased spending on public services, capital investment in Britain\u2019s future prosperity, cutting taxes or more rapidly reducing the national debt. On the current OBR forecast, these commitments would mean, after allowing for the expected reclassification by the ONS of student debt, around \u00a315bn of headroom available in 2020-21; \u00a319bn in 2021-22; \u00a321bn in 2022-23; and \u00a325bn in 2023-24, though a prudent administration would not use all the available borrowing capacity given the potential for forecast revisions. Today, at an event in the City of London, Hammond said said the Tory leadership candidates were at risk of squandering the party\u2019s reputation for fiscal responsibility. Only Rory Stewart had agreed to honour the pledge, he said. It is a disappointment to me that only one of the candidates remaining in the race, Rory Stewart, has actually signed up to that pledge. I would urge the other candidates to do so, to reassure the public that our hard-won reputation for fiscal responsibility is not going to be squandered during the course of this competition. Hammond\u2019s comment seemed to be aimed at Boris Johnson, the clear favourite, in particular. David Gauke, the justice secretary, made a similar point on Twitter this morning. (See 10.33am.) The subject did come up at the hustings. Michael Gove said he would sign the pledge. (See 12.53pm.) But Jeremy Hunt refused. Hunt said he did want debt to fall as a a proportion of GDP over the economic cycle, but he said he would not commit to reducing it every year in case he needed to increase borrowing in a recession. The press gallery hustings this morning were lively and interesting, and covered a very wide range of topics, but it is hard to see them making any impact on the campaign. The 80-odd journalists did not emerge with a strong, collective sense that any single candidate had performed particularly well or badly, and the entire event was off-camera anyway, and so you are not going to see it on TV. But here\u2019s a summary of how each candidate performed, in order of their appearance. Rory Stewart: Stewart has emerged as the best candidate in the contest for non-Tories (a category that probably includes a majority of lobby journalists) and he got good reviews from the Channel 4 debate last night. But today he may have lost ground with that constituency a bit. His greatest strength has been his willingness to point out the transparent flaws in the Brexit plans proposed by all his rivals, but today his own Brexit plan (try again for Theresa May\u2019s deal, and if not use a citizens\u2019 assembly to find a solution) sounded almost as flaky. His refusal to say if he would vote remain or leave in another referendum sounded feeble (see 11.25am), and he seems to have gone back on what he said last week about being willing to \u201cbring down\u201d a Boris Johnson government committed to no-deal. (See 11.29am.) He has also had to clear up what he said about President Trump. (See 2.24pm.) However, on reducing the north/south divide, he was the most plausible of all the candidates, stressing the importance of transport above all else. Sajid Javid: In terms of background, if not in terms of politics, Javid is easily the most distinctive candidate in the contest and his account of why he went into banking (see 2.06pm) was easily one of the most memorable moments of the hustings. Jeremy Hunt: Hunt is supposed to be one of the moderate contenders in the campaign, and so it was surprising that, of all the five candidates, he was most willing to endorse what President Trump said about Sadiq Khan. Like Rory Stewart, he has been in retreat on this since the hustings were over. (See 2.43pm.) This may make him look like a bit of an idiot to the media, although Tory MPs, and party members, may well take a different view about Khan-bashing. Hunt was particularly unconvincing in the hustings when asked about the impact of Brexit on the UK\u2019s standing in the world, and the reaction of EU leaders to his speech at the Tory conference comparing the EU to the USSR, but he did demonstrate how to perform an effective clean-hands tackle when he was asked if he blamed Boris Johnson for the continuing incarceration of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. He did not want to reply, he said - because everyone makes mistakes. Dominic Raab: Raab was not particularly convincing when trying to defend his record as Brexit secretary (see this Twitter thread from the Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp for the counter view) and Raab\u2019s claim that citizens\u2019 assemblies are some sort of Venezuelan anti-democratic abomination (see 12.38pm) is just bizarre. (They have used them in Ireland too.) But he was the only candidate firmly promising tax cuts in an emergency Brexit budget, regardless of whether or not the UK was heading for a no-deal. (See 12.32pm.) That may go down well with Tory voters. Michael Gove: Gove was the only candidate who managed to get a laugh at the hustings, and his treatment of Owen Bennett, the journalist who has written the biography with the cocaine revelation that nearly derailed his campaign, was gracious. He was reluctant to say any more about his use of drugs, his account of his critique of the Good Friday agreement was partial (in fact, he was so hostile to the GFA he compared it to appeasement), but he provided one of the smartest answers to the Trump question. (See 12.54pm.) Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, is also having to clarify the response he gave at the press gallery hustings to a question about President Trump\u2019s tweet attacking the London mayor Sadiq Khan. These are from Sayeeda Warsi, the former chair of the Conservative party. To be fair to Hunt, the answer he gave at the hustings sounded like an endorsement of Trump\u2019s Twitter message (that London needed a new mayor because Khan was a \u201cdisaster) not Katie Hopkins\u2019s \u201cLondonistan\u201d reference. At the Tory leadership hustings all the candidates were asked about President Trump\u2019s decision to retweet a Katie Hopkins tweet approvingly, adding a message saying Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, has been a disaster. In his reply Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, said that as a former diplomat he thought it was best to make criticisms of your allies in private. He implied that he agreed with Trump\u2019s criticisms of Khan\u2019s record as London mayor, but thought he was wrong to tweet about it. (See 11.34am.) But after the hustings Stewart posted this on Twitter - disowning the \u201cKhan\u2019s Londonistan\u201d line used by Hopkins. One of the most interesting lines in the hustings came when Sajid Javid, the home secretary, said that he went into banking because it was more meritocratic than other professions open to him. Javid was responding a question about why Rory Stewart seemed to be the candidate with the most momentum. Javid started by saying that he did not have an elite education, like Rory Stewart. He was not a member of a debating society at Oxford. But he was getting better as a communicator, he said. He went on: I might not be the most confident debater, I might not be the most confident speaker. But I think what people want to see is someone who is genuine, who is honest, who has answers and experience of life, real life, life in business. The reason I got into banking, one of the reasons, is because for a young Asian like me, most Asians, they go into jobs that you need to take an exam for, like chartered accountant, dentist - it\u2019s not because that\u2019s what their parents think is the only thing open to them - the reason that happens is because their parents feel that discrimination is so inevitable in professions where you don\u2019t have to take exams that the best way to get in is to have a piece of paper [showing you are qualified for the job]. So I did banking because it\u2019s much more meritocratic. Javid also said he thought Stewart\u2019s problem was that he was spending too much time appealing to Labour voters rather than Conservative votes. He also said the public did not want to see a competition between Boris Johnson and Stewart, two people who both went to the country\u2019s most elite school (Eton). And here\u2019s another story from the hustings, filed by the Press Association. Tory leadership hopefuls Rory Stewart and Sajid Javid believe they have the required number of supporters to survive Tuesday\u2019s second round of voting. Stewart managed to secure just 19 votes in the first ballot and Javid had 23 - both short of the 33 required to stay in the race after the second vote. But the pair told journalists at a special hustings in Westminster that they were confident of remaining in the contest to be the next prime minister. They are a long way short of frontrunner Boris Johnson, who picked up 114 votes last week and has since been boosted by the support of former leadership contender Matt Hancock. At the hustings, Stewart said he had the necessary 33 backers to make it through the second round of voting in the contest \u201cif they do what they say\u201d. The international development secretary suggested he was the one to beat Johnson - and accused the former foreign secretary of making different promises to different MPs. \u201cWho is going to be nimble enough, who has the style, who has the approach, who has the way of dealing with the public... I don\u2019t think the answer is going to be pre-scripted answers,\u201d he said. Javid, the home secretary, said he was \u201cextremely confident\u201d of getting the required 33 votes. \u201cI think there is a growing feeling in the party that when we get to the final two we should have a robust debate between two credible change candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get change, people will vote for change in the form of Jeremy Corbyn.\u201d Dominic Raab also said he thought he would have enough votes to stay in the contest. Any candidate getting fewer than 33 votes in the ballot tomorrow will have to drop out. But even if they all hit this threshold, the candidate who comes last will be eliminated anyway. Here is my colleague Peter Walker\u2019s story about what the Tory election candidates had to say at the press gallery hustings about Donald Trump. And here is how is story starts. Jeremy Hunt has vigorously defended Donald Trump for quoting the far-right commentator Katie Hopkins in an attack on the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, as Downing Street declined to condemn the US president\u2019s words. The foreign secretary said that while he would not have used the same words as Trump he would \u201c150% agree\u201d with the overall sentiment. In contrast, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, said the US president should \u201cstick to domestic politics\u201d. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said the stance of Hunt and No 10 were \u201cshocking\u201d and showed the Conservative party had a serious problem of Islamophobia. Q: Do you have any regrets about how Brexit has unfolded, and your role in it? Gove says triggering article 50 without a clear plan was a mistake. During the referendum campaign he said the UK should not trigger article 50 prematurely. He says he urged Theresa May to adopt a different view of Brexit. She disagreed. But all the leadership candidates who resigned over May\u2019s deal ended up voting for it on 29 March (the third vote on the agreement). He says his department is the best prepared for no-deal. Gove ends by joking that he looks forward to seeing us all weekly (ie, at his prime ministerial press conferences). And that\u2019s it. I will post reaction and a summary soon. Q: How would you respond to claims you are not popular with the uncommitted voters the Tories need to win over? Gove says when he took charge of Vote Leave he was behind. But he led the campaign, took on the arguments and won. And he says Robert Hayward, the Tory pollster, has highlighted polling showing he and Jeremy Hunt could win over Lib Dem voters. Q: Do you think dirty tricks were involved in the cocaine story? Gove says a brilliant journalist got a story. Q: Are you on speaking terms with David Cameron? Gove says Cameron is in private life now. He says he will not comment on their relationship. But he is looking forward to reading Cameron\u2019s book. He says the public needs to hear more from Cameron. Q: Would you have monthly press conferences as PM? Why so few, says Gove. Q: Weekly? Why not? Q; What would you do about Jeremy Corbyn? Gove says he would fight against Corbyn on behalf of the dispossessed. He says Corbyn is more happy speaking up on behalf of Iran than on behalf of the working class. Q: Given how Brexit has turned out, do you think it would have been better if you had lost? Gove says he never thinks it is good to lose a campaign he is involved in. Q: What do you think of the fact you are not now seen as proper Brexiter by some? Gove says he discussed this with his mum recently. She said, given all he has done, of course he was a proper Brexiter. He thinks his mum knows best. Q: How would you reduce the wealth gap between the north and the south? Gove says he would improve transport infrastructure in the north, midlands and south west. And he would also ensure that people can retrain in mid-career. Q: Apart from cocaine, have you taken any other illegal drugs? Gove says he has already answered questions on this. Q: Three years ago you thought Boris Johnson was not fit to be PM. What has he done in the last three years to change your mind? Gove says he thinks Johnson would be a good PM, but that he would be a better one. Q: What did you think of President Trump\u2019s anti-Khan tweet? Gove says it is always a mistake to retweet something from Katie Hopkins. Gove says one of his first trips as PM would be a visit to Angela Merkel in Berlin. Q: [From Owen Bennett, who has written the Gove biography with the cocaine revelation] What do you say to the allegation that, in pursuing Brexit, you are putting the interests of the Aberdeen fishing industry above the interests of the City? Gove congratulates Bennett on his book. He jokes about getting a share of the royalties. He says it is not just Aberdeen that is opposed to the CFP; it is the whole country. Q: Will you sign up to Philip Hammond\u2019s pledge to keep debt falling if you become PM? Yes, says Gove. Q: What do you think of the suggestion that Johnson supporters might vote to keep you off the final ballot? Gove says the idea that Tory MPs are duplicitous is wholly new one to him. This gets probably the first laugh of the session. Q: Do you still think the Good Friday agreement was a mistake? Gove says he was critical of the way the Blair government approached the peace process. But he is glad for what the peace process has achieved. Q: What do you say to Brexiter who think Brexit must happen by 31 October because the referendum trumps parliament? Gove says we live in a parliamentary democracy, and we must accept that. Q: Would you attempt to change the definition of a hard border in the joint report of December 2017? No, says Gove. He says he would look for other ways of avoiding the backstop. He thinks there is no candidate in the race who understands the politics of Ireland better than he does. Q: Why have you changed your approach to Boris Johnson? Gove says he has won increased support over this weekend. The Tories need someone who can be PM from day one. He thinks he is pre-eminently qualified, he says. Michael Gove is now speaking. He starts by saying how nice it is to address the 1922 Committee - only more handsome, and better dressed. He says the party needs someone who believes in Brexit and who can deliver it. And he says whoever wins will face Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs every Wednesday. He is the one best placed to \u201cstrike fear\u201d into Corbyn\u2019s heart. Q: Will you commit to monthly press conferences if you become PM? Absolutely, says Raab. What could be more fun than this? Q: You says Michel Barnier said you were brave enough to go to the EU and tell them things that they had never heard before. But the documentary you refer to shows Barnier saying you were saying something that was not UK policy, and you then backed down. Raab says people should not take Barnier\u2019s account of this at face value. Q: How would you stop MPs stopping no-deal? And if they wanted to meet in another venue, how would you stop them - with the police or the army? Raab says the Institute for Government report shows it would be hard for MPs to block no-deal. And he says there is only one candidate in the contest who favours prorogation. He says Rory Stewart wants MPs to vote again on Theresa May\u2019s deal. Because of the Commons rule banning repeat votes on the same issue, Stewart would have to prorogue parliaement, he claims. And he says Stewart\u2019s citizens\u2019 assembly idea is similar to the constitutional assembly tactic used by Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela. Q: Is it fair universal credit claimants have to wait five weeks for their benefit? Raab says two things are crucial. The system must be changed so it is adapted to the \u201cfluid\u201d circumstances of claimants. And he wants to help the low paid, he says. That is why he is proposing raising the tax threshold. Q: Would you slash corporation tax in the event of a no-deal Brexit? Raab says he would take a range of measures to help business, whether or not there was no-deal. But he is not sure whether slashing corporation tax would be the best way of doing this. Q: What do you think of President Trump\u2019s anti-Khan tweet? Raab says he does not think that is constructive. He is proud to live in a multi-identity city. He is proud to have a Muslim mayor, and proud to have a Muslim home secretary. Q: Would you commit to giving half your ministerial jobs to women? Raab says he wants to bring forward talented women, but he won\u2019t set a quota. Q: Are you confident you will get the 33 votes you need tomorrow? And why is Boris Johnson, the other candidate proposing what is called a \u201cclean Brexit\u201d, so far ahead? Raab says he is not proposing going straight to a WTO Brexit. He says some YouGov polling today shows he is the only candidate who can beat Johnson amongst the membership. And he is quietly confident of getting the 33 votes, he says. Q: With recognition to your bigots comment about feminist, do you accept that there is systemic bias against women in society? Raab says as a laywer he took cases defending women\u2019s rights. And as a war crimes law, he prosecuted people of some of the worse crimes against women. He says he is championing equality. His actions speak for themselves. The quote, from a column in 2012, was about double standards. Q: Theresa May failed to get her deal through because of the definition of a hard border in the joint report of December 2017. Do you accept that definition? Raab says that was a mistake. The wording was ambiguous, so he would not accept it, he says. He says technology can address the border issue. If all the options are used, there is no need for any \u201cstate presence\u201d at the border. He says Dublin has over-emphasised this issue because the Irish government want to keep the UK in the customs union. Q: Has Brexit damaged the Tories\u2019 reputation as a party of Brexit? Raab says he would hold an early budget, and bring the \u201cfiscal horsepower\u201d of the Treasury into play to help business. We need more \u201ccan-do spirit\u201d, he says. Q: Isn\u2019t it the truth that people in the EU don\u2019t trust you? Raab says people in Brussels are briefing against him because they fear him. He says Simon Coveney\u2019s office briefed that Raab wanted a three-month time limit to the extension. No one who knows him believes this. Dominic Raab starts by praising the media. We have the finest media in the world, he tells us. (I don\u2019t think we will fall for that.) Raab says what he stands for his not just an opportunity society, but a second chance society. He mentions mentoring a boy at a boxing club. And he says his father, a refugee, effectively had a second chance too. Q: Will you honour the Tory manifesto pledge to protect free TV licences for the over-75s? Yes, says Hunt. Q: How disappointed were you to come so far behind Boris Johnson last week? Hunt says he was pleased to come second. And that\u2019s all from Hunt. Q: Do you think Boris Johnson is partly to blame for the continuing incarceration of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe? Hunt says he does not want to comment. Everyone makes mistake. He is sure he will make mistakes too. Q: What job did you offer Matt Hancock? No comment, says Hunt. Q: Do you believe in God? Yes, says Hunt. Q: Has Brexit damage the UK\u2019s standing in the world? The vote to leave the EU didn\u2019t, says Hunt. But the failure to deliver it has. Q: What do you think of John Bercow? Hunt says Bercow\u2019s record is mixed. He suggests he has not been impartial, but he says he has done well to open up parliament. Q: When you were health secretary you said that was likely to be your last job in politics? What has changed? Hunt says he said that during the doctors\u2019 strike. He was determined not to blink, and he wanted to show he would not back down, even if that were he last job. Q: What did you think of President Trump\u2019s anti-Khan tweet? Hunt says Trump has his own style. But he agrees 150% that Khan should be focusing more on knife crime, and less on politicking. Q: What do you meant when you say you broadly agree with what Theresa May said about the hard border in Ireland? Hunt says, when he said he broadly agreed, he meant he broadly agreed. He says he would not allow physical infrastructure on the border. Q: An MP told me that Boris Johnson can win over wavering Tory supporters, but you can\u2019t. Why is that? Hunt says Johnson comes top in those polls, but he comes second. But the Tories must deliver Brexit, he says. And he is the only person who can deliver for Brexiters, and for Tories now leaning to the Lib Dems. Q: Would you halt the roll-out of universal credit? Hunt says the principle of universal credit is right. But you always must be compassionate in the way you roll these things out. Q: Do you think your Tory conference speech comparing the EU to the USSR damaged your standing in the EU? No, says Hunt. He says he thinks international partners respect people who say tough things, even if they do not like them. Hunt says there would be real risks to the union and to manufacturing from a no-deal Brexit. But Brexit must be delivered, he says. The democratic risks of no Brexit would be worse, he says. Q: Would you stop Scotland holding a second independence referendum, even if the SNP led a majority government? Hunt says he is a unionist to his core. He would not do anything to put the union at risk. Q: Do you accept that the Malthouse compromise alternative arrangements plan will not knock out the need for a backstop? Hunt says you have to look at where we are now. He says Rory Stewart\u2019s plan to get the threat of a citizens\u2019 assembly to force MPs to back the deal won\u2019t work. He says he thinks the EU would be flexible if a new leader came along with new ideas. Q: Do you accept the definition of a hard border in Ireland drawn up by Theresa May in December 2017? Broadly, yes, says Hunt. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, is here now. He says in a negotiation you need someone you can trust, someone who will not blink and someone willing to walk away. He is that person. Q: Do you think a no-deal Brexit would undermine UK security? Javid says, under a no-deal, there would be no security agreement with the EU. But the UK would still be one of the safest countries in the world. He says the UK would still try to cooperate with the EU through things like Interpol. And he says he has been pursuing bilateral agreements with EU countries like Germany on law and order, despite people advising him against this. Q: Do you support drug safety rooms? Javid says he is hesitant about this. Call him the odd one out, but he did not take drugs when he young. He grew up somewhere where drug dealing was prevalent. He would not want to encourage that. Javid says he did not go to elite schools, like some of his rivals. He might not be as good a debate as them. But he thinks he is getting better as a communicator. He speaks as someone with life experience. He says Asian parents want their children to go into professions like dentistry because these are professions where you have to pass exams. You get judged on merit. And that was partly why he went into banking, he says. He says Asians gravitate towards professions like that because they are more meritocratic. Q: Will you hold monthly press conferences if you become PM? That\u2019s an excellent idea, says Javid. Q; What do you think about President Trump\u2019s anti-Khan tweet? Javid says Trump should focus on domestic politics. Knife crime is a serious problem. But it is 10 times worse in the US than in the UK. Q: If there were another referendum, would you vote leave or remain? Javid says he would vote leave. Q; How confident are you of getting the 33 votes you need tomorrow? \u201cExtremely confident\u201d, Javid says. He says there is a growing feeling in the party that the final two candidates should both be \u201ccredible change candidates\u201d. He is a good person to put Boris Johnson through his paces, he says. This is similar to the argument used by Michael Gove this morning, which sounded a bit like: \u2018Vote for me, and I will give Johnson some useful debate practice before his inevitable victory.\u2019 See 9.18am. Javid ends with a bizarre line about how, if Labour win an early election, he does not know if Tories will be \u201cup against the wall\u201d first or if it will be journalists. Q: Would you stop universal credit claimants having to wait five weeks for their money? Javid says he supports universal credit. But he would look at aspects of how it works. It takes too long to make a claim, and he would review the appeals procedure too. Q: Do you accept the definition of a hard border in Ireland negotiated by Theresa May in December 2017? Javid says he does not have that definition in front of him. But he is clear he would not agree to anything that would lead to infrastructure being put on that border. Q: You were a banker before the crash. You must have known about the selling of dodgy products. What did you do to stop the crash? Javid says he was working in Asia. There was a different business model in that market, he suggests. It was less affected by the crash. He says there was a failure of regulation before the crash. As a Treasury minister, he took the banking bill through the Commons. Sajdi Javid, the home secretary, is here. Q: You talk about your backstory in very eloquent terms. But you have not said much about how you would help other people from your kind of background succeed. Do you regret, for example, the closure of Sure Start centres? Javid says education was the big thing for him. He does not think that is unusual in Asian families. It is clear that his vision has been formed by his upbringing and experiences. He wants a society where, if people work hard, they can succeed. He would focus on schools and further education. We need a multi-billion pound investment programme, as we have for the NHS. Q: Did you work for MI6? No, says Stewart. And that\u2019s all from Stewart. Q: What do you make of President Trump\u2019s latest tweet attacking Sadiq Khan? Stewart says he has been a professional diplomat. You make your points forcefully - but in private. Q; What would you do to close the wealth gap between the north and south? Stewart says the fundamental problem is the productivity gap. He says you need infrastructure to address this. It currently takes one hour 47 minutes to get from Leeds to Wigan. Q: You claim to be different. But you voting record is that of a normal Conservative. Stewart says he is proud of being a Conservative. He has only rebelled on Conservative issues - because he did not want an elected House of Lords. Stewart says Johnson has got Matt Hancock supporting him, but also Mark Francois. He suggests he finds it hard to see how he has won them both over. It is as if Johnson thinks the MPs supporting him do not talk to each other, he says. Q: Are there any circumstance in which you would vote with Labour in a no confidence motion to stop a no-deal Brexit? Stewart says there are easier ways to stop no-deal Brexit. He says he won\u2019t commit to bringing down a Tory government. He says he thinks there are around 100 of his colleagues who would also vote to stop a no-deal Brexit. Q: Would you hold an early election? No, says Stewart. Q: Are you confident you will get the 33 votes you need tomorrow? And how have you been so successful? Stewart says he does not know. He says Quentin Letts wrote a column saying it was like the film the Producers - as if Stewart had set out to run a deliberately bad campaign. Q: And will you get the 33 votes? Stewart says he will if people \u201cdo what they say\u201d. But it is a struggle. Lots of MPs say they like his message, but cite other reasons why they must vote for someone else. Q: Do you trust your fellow MPs? \u201cIn the voting lobbies?\u201d Stewart says. The clear implication is - no. Q: If there were another referendum, would you vote leave or remain? Stewart says he voted remain in 2016, but he is now working for a pragmatic Brexit. He does not want a second referendum. If there were one, he would have failed. He would go into that voting booth conscious of this failure. He does not answer the question. Stewart refuses to say if he would vote leave or remain in a second referendum. Asked again how he would vote, he still refuses to answer. But he says people do not appreciate how damaging a second referendum would be. Q: What happens if by 31 October you don\u2019t have a deal? Stewart says his \u201cfundamental hypothesis is we live in a parliamentary democracy\u201d. If parliament won\u2019t accept it, it won\u2019t get done. In the debate last night a lot of his colleagues were \u201cboasting\u201d about how because they were an entrepreneur, or a hard man, they would get something better from Brussels. But it is not like that, he says. He says 31 October is only the default because parliament made it so. He says parliament could unmake it the default. Stewart says parliament could prevent a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Q: What if the citizens\u2019 assembly comes up with a plan the EU rejects? Stewart says, in that case, it would not happen. But he would expect the assembly to take evidence from people like Michel Barnier. He would not expect it to come up with a unicorn. Q: Do you accept you would have to get this deal through on the back of Labour and opposition votes? Stewart says he thinks he could unlock some more Tory colleagues, maybe a dozen or so. If he were elected on this mandate, he would persuade some Tory MPs. But not all - he would not get John Redwood over the line. But he says he would then reach out to people like Lisa Nandy. And, if he had to resort to a citizens\u2019 assembly, that would be an option favoured by people like Nandy. Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, starts by saying he wants to take questions, so he does not want to make an opening pitch. Q: In Ireland citizens\u2019 assemblies have taken years to find policy solutions to problems. So why do you think one could be used in the UK to get a Brexit solution quickly? Stewart says any solution will have to be achieved through parliament. He says he will focus on getting the deal through parliament. He needs another 45 votes to do that. The citizens\u2019 assembly plan would be a threat to encourage parliament to compromise. But if he fails to get the deal through parliament, he will need an alternative - something that forces MPs to think outside party political boundaries. He says a citizens\u2019 assembly could be run like jury service. It could sit at weekends, and reach an agreement quite quickly. He says, if the citizens\u2019 assembly comes up with something parliament does not want, parliament could reject it. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, was the candidate who criticised Boris Johnson last night in the Channel 4 debate most directly for not turning up to the debate. Today he has criticised Johnson again for dodging the press gallery hustings. Christopher Hope, the chairman of the lobby, is now introducing the event. He says every candidate will get the chance to make a brief opening statement. Then there will be 10 minutes of questions on Brexit, and nine minutes on everything else. Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, has meanwhile been delivering his Brexit speech, which we previewed this morning. I\u2019ll post more on it later, when I have read the full text, but here are some lines from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. Gordon Brown has also tried running the \u201cShakespeare was a remainer\u201d line in the past. Normally I blog from my desk in the Guardian office in the press gallery in the House of Commons, but now I\u2019m in committee room 14 - the biggest committee room in the Commons, where the 1922 Committee and the PLP meet - for the press gallery hustings - basically, a series of press conference with all the Tory leadership hustings, except Boris Johnson, whose team say he is too busy doing debate prep to be able to attend. Here is the running order. The proceedings are on the record, but off camera - because the Commons authorities have strict rules about filming in these rooms. I will be covering the proceedings in full. In his Daily Telegraph column today (paywall) Boris Johnson, the favourite in the Tory leadership contest, says he wants to give every home in the country access to superfast broadband by 2025. He says it is a \u201cdisgrace\u201d that rural areas have such poor broadband. It is therefore a disgrace that this country should suffer from a deep digital divide, so that many rural areas and towns are simply left behind. They can\u2019t rely on teleconferencing. They can\u2019t skype properly. Sometimes the coverage is so bad that they can\u2019t even email properly. This is 21st century Britain \u2013 the country that helped to pioneer the very idea of the world wide web \u2013 and yet we have only seven per cent coverage of full fibre broadband. In Spain there are now 85 per cent of households that have full fibre-optic broadband, with its almost limitless capacity to pump data to and from your home. There are remote Galician pueblos that have speed-of-light access to all the commercial and cultural glories of the web. There are whole towns in Britain where people are still being driven wild with frustration as they stare at the slowly revolving pizza wheel of doom. However, Johnson does not explain how much this cost, or where he would find the money. All he says about funding is: This will cost some public money, but the productivity gains are immense. The Telegraph has splashed on the story. This is not the first time Johnson has used his Telegraph column to make an expensive and unfunded spending commitment. Last week he was proposing tax cuts for higher rate taxpayers. This morning David Gauke, the justice secretary and a former Treasury minister, has said Johnson\u2019s promises could force up government borrowing by billions of pounds. Gauke is backing Rory Stewart for Tory leader. He has also, presumably, given up hope of keeping his cabinet job in the event of Johnson becoming PM. Turning back to Matt Hancock\u2019s decision to endorse Boris Johnson, Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge had a very good take on Twitter last night ... Here are some more excerpts from the Michael Gove interview with John Humphrys on the Today programme. Gove, the environment secretary and leadership candidate, rejected suggestions that Boris Johnson was anti-business, saying Johnson\u2019s \u201cfuck business\u201d comment had been taken out of context. Asked about it, Gove said: I think those words were taken out of context ... I think that, in context, someone was trying to suggest that because a particular business organisation took a particular view, that Boris was wrong. Actually, as we know, in some of the big questions that this country has faced, business has had a wide spectrum of views. I think, to be fair to London, he was emphatically pro-enterprise, and he supported financial services, and he made sure there was investment in infrastructure and in the support that our financial services, and that our other businesses, needed in our capital. He dismissed suggestions that there were any moral grounds for rejecting Johnson as a candidate for PM. When it was put to him that moral probity might be a problem for Johson, Gove replied: I would dismiss that altogether ... Moral probity does matter. But I think that all of the candidates who are standing to be leader, in my view, are capable of being prime minister. I personally think that Boris and all the other candidates are people who on every ground have what it takes to be a potentially good prime minister. Later Humphrys returned to the theme, referring to Johnson\u2019s history of telling lies and his incompetence as foreign secretary. Was Gove concerned about these issues? Gove replied: If you want to put those questions direct to Boris himself, I know that he will answer them. But let me defend him ... I will happily defend Boris on this. There have been various attempts to to mount personal attacks against him and against some other candidates. I think that is wrong. Look, in the past, I have had my criticisms and differences with Boris. But I believe he is somebody who is capable of being prime minister. But the key question is - who do we believe is the person with the best record in office, and the clearest vision for the future. When pressed again, Gove said he did not share the doubts Humphrys had raised about Johnson. Gove said he did not want to criticise any of the other candidates because they all needed to work together. He said: I am not going to criticise other candidates because, in essence, we are all on the same time. I might play for Manchester City, you might play for Manchester United, we might have friendly rivalry, but when we are playing for our country together, we have got to make sure that we unite in order to do best for our country. Gove highlighted one difference between himself and Johnson, saying that if he was close to getting a Brexit deal at the end of October, he would be willing to delay Brexit again to get it over the line. Johnson says he will leave the EU by 31 October come what may. But Gove argued that this approach could lead to MPs triggering a general election, which would put Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street by Christmas. And here is some comment on the interview. The Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges said he wrote up then new Gove approach in his column. My colleague Peter Walker has an alternative theory for Gove\u2019s stance. This is from my former Guardian colleague Jane Martinson. This is from the BBC\u2019s Emma Barnett. And this is from the BBC\u2019s Rachel Byrne. The Scottish Conservative MP Paul Masterton, who Matt Hancock for the leadership last week, has said that he will now be voting for Rory Stewart. Masterton explained: With Matt out, I\u2019m still looking for the same things: energy, intelligence and enthusiasm with a clear vision for delivering Brexit and for the country beyond it. Someone who really gets the Union, with ideas to strengthen and secure it. Stewart got just 19 votes in the ballot of MPs last week, making him last of all the candidates left in the race. To avoid being eliminated in the next vote, on Tuesday, he will need not just to avoid coming last, but to get at least 33 votes (because candidates who do not hit this threshold will fall out, as well as the one who comes last). It is a good morning for Boris Johnson. We have seen two developments that should firm up his chances of becoming the next prime minister; or perhaps more accurately, two developments that suggest that his rivals have given up hope of beating him. First, Matt Hancock, the health secretary who withdraw from the contest on Friday, has announced that he is backing Johnson. He explains why in an article in the Times (paywall). Here is an extract from his article: I said when I withdrew from the contest that I\u2019d consider the best way to advance those values. I\u2019ve now spoken to all the candidates. They are all inspirational people, with many and varied strengths, and I would be proud to serve any of them as my prime minister. I have reflected on what is needed in the national interest, and how the approaches of the candidates fit with my values. Having considered all the options, I\u2019m backing Boris Johnson as the best candidate to unite the Conservative party, so we can deliver Brexit and then unite the country behind an open, ambitious, forward-looking agenda, delivered with the energy that gets stuff done. Boris has run a disciplined campaign and is almost certainly going to be our next prime minister. We need to unite behind him with a strong team that can bring the party together and then bring the country together. After any debate like this, people need to put aside their differences for a greater purpose. My view is that we need to start coming together sooner rather than later. Second, and perhaps more surprisingly, Michael Gove, who is still in the contest and who hopes to make it into the final two for the ballot of party members alongside Johnson, has dialled down his criticism of the former foreign secretary. A week ago, at his campaign launch, Gove went for Johnson quite aggressively, condemning his proposed tax cut for the wealthy, implicitly questioning his seriousness and his commitment to Brexit, and at one point even appearing to make a joke about his sexual promiscuity (although he denied this was the intention, so perhaps it was just a case of us reporters thinking dirty). But this morning, in an interview on the Today programme, \u2018Gove, the Johnson slayer\u2019 had disappeared. Instead we heard a Gove who spent half the interview robustly defending his rival (much more convincingly, by the way, than James Cleverly, the Johnson supporter who was on the programme earlier speaking as a Team Johnson representative.) Gove rejected the idea that Johnson was anti-business (the \u201cfuck business\u201d was taken out of context, Gove insisted) and he refused to accept that there were any moral reasons why Johnson was not suited to be prime minister. He even at one stage seemed to imply that Johnson was bound to win and that the only reason he (Gove) should be on the ballot for party members was to ensure that Johnson got stretched a bit before his inevitable victory. Gove said: At the moment, yes, of course it is the case that Boris is the front-runner. But we need to make sure that he is tested and that we have two candidates who go forward - if Boris is one of them - who we know are capable of being prime minister from day one. I will post more from the interview shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.30am: Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, gives a speech on Brexit. As Heather Stewart reports, he will say Labour should be at the forefront of the campaign to stop Brexit. 11am: All the Tory leadership candidates except Boris Johnson are due to take questions from press gallery journalists at Westminster. It is being described as a hustings, but effectively it is a series of on-the-record, but off-camera press conferences. These are from Christopher Hope, the Telegraph\u2019s chief pol0itical correspondent who has organised the event in his capacity as chairman of the lobby. 2pm: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, holds a press conference with his Chinese counterpart, the vice-premier Hu Chunhua, after talks in London. 3pm: The Conservative 1922 Committee holds a private leadership hustings for Tory MPs. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on the Tory leadership contest. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "The Evening Standard and Independent have asked the government not to investigate the news outlets\u2019 Saudi Arabian investors, saying the UK media industry could become financially unsustainable if officials probe the source of the offshore investments. Last week the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, raised concerns that the investments, made through Cayman Islands companies controlled by a previously unknown Saudi banker, could hide a financial backer with \u201cstrong links to the Saudi Arabian state\u201d. The government also said this sale of 30% stakes in the free London newspaper and its online-only sister title \u201cmay have an effect on the Evening Standard and the Independent\u2019s news agendas\u201d. Both outlets are controlled by Evgeny Lebedev, son of the Russian oligarch Alexander Lebedev, while the Evening Standard is edited by the former Conservative chancellor George Osborne. ESI Media, which operates both titles, responded to the government on Monday. It did not dispute the government\u2019s claim that its investors had close ties to the Saudi state, but said it remained editorially independent. It said there was no justification for the government to investigate the deals, and claimed such action could harm its financial future. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe have explained why there is no proper legal basis for an investigation into these transactions, which we believe would be counterproductive and detrimental to the health and stability of the UK media landscape. \u201cWe have nothing to fear from an investigation, but regard it as an unnecessary and expensive distraction, which could have a devastating effect on any future investment needed for the wider industry\u2019s sustainability and growth. \u201cOur media outlets are firmly committed to the accurate presentation of news and freedom of expression. Our editorial record speaks for itself. We uphold these values proudly, reflecting the trust the public places in us. We know that this trust is important \u2013 and all the more so in the current political climate. Our editorial policies, guidelines and reporting reflect these standards, as we have again reiterated to the secretary of state today. We have no further comment to make at this point.\u201d The government will make a final decision on whether to a launch a full investigation into the Saudi investment by the end of the month. The dire financial state of the UK media industry has raised concerns that prestigious British news brands could be influenced by the availability of money from overseas, especially from Gulf states involved in a Middle Eastern proxy war, spending millions on lobbyists and soft power campaigns. Last year Lebedev accompanied an Evening Standard reporter on a tour of war-torn Yemen along with Saudi-backed troops, posing for pictures on his personal Instagram account. The Independent has already launched a series of foreign-language sites using its brand, which are controlled and operated by Saudi Arabian journalists and aimed at readers in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia has a historically poor record for journalism and freedom of speech. It was ranked 169th out of 180 countries in the 2018 World Press Freedom Index, while last year the Saudi government was implicated in the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in its own consulate.",

      "bodyText": "Middle-class cocaine users are inconsistent hypocrites if they fail to recognise the environmental and social damage their drug use is inflicting on producer countries, the Colombian president has said during a visit to London. In an interview with the Guardian on Monday, Iv\u00e1n Duque said that cocaine\u2019s social acceptability had to end. \u201cThere are many people who present themselves as environmentalists, and if they want to be coherent, they must understand all the environmental damage that is caused by the production of cocaine \u2013 not just destroying tropical forests, [but] spreading chemicals in protected areas and destroying human capital,\u201d he said. Duque said that cocaine production leads to the destruction of thousands of hectares of tropical forest. \u201cIt\u2019s not just big social damage, but environmental damage. How can you present yourself as a defender of the environment when you are creating so much harm? There needs to be an end to hypocrisy and inconsistency,\u201d he said. Asked what he thought of admissions by prominent British politicians \u2013 including the Conservative leadership candidates Michael Gove and Boris Johnson \u2013 that they have used cocaine, Duque said: \u201cThe issue with illegal drugs is, they not only have a bad effect on your health, but potentially on third parties. It\u2019s not advice to candidates. Its advice to human beings.\u201d However, Duque also pledged to relaunch the aerial spraying of coca crops with herbicides within weeks \u2013 a process that has been widely criticised by farmers for devastating legal crops alongside illicit plantations. Colombia suspended the aerial fumigation of coca, the raw ingredient in cocaine, in 2015 after the World Health Organization linked the herbicide glyphosate to cancer. The decision was later backed by the country\u2019s constitutional court. The US, frustrated by surging cocaine exports, has pressured Duque to resume aerial spraying and threatened to decertify Columbia as a partner in its war on drugs. Duque said he was considering tougher measures against coca growers \u2013 not to please any third country, but because it was his country\u2019s \u201cmoral responsibility to act\u201d. Colombia remains the world\u2019s largest producer of cocaine exports, and a recent UN report said the total acreage under production was an estimated 17% higher in 2017 than 2016. The drug trade has flourished despite the 2016 peace deal with the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). That accord was supposed to usher in a peaceful new chapter, but violence still rages as dissident rebel factions and rightwing paramilitaries battle for control of coca-growing territory once controlled by Farc. Activists and social leaders have been targeted at unprecedented levels: 702 have been murdered since the peace deal was signed, while 135 ex-combatants have also been killed. As Duque met potential investors in the City of London, protesters nearby laid the names of hundreds of murdered social leaders, human rights defenders and trade unionists along the pavement of Threadneedle Street. Miriam Ojeda, originally from Cali, Colombia, who now lives in Denmark Hill, said Duque had betrayed the terms of the peace deal with the Farc. \u201cAll the institutions for peace have been sabotaged systematically,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government is telling the business community that everything is good in Colombia, but in fact these people have been killed since the peace agreement has been signed \u2026 Communities in Colombia are facing violence on a daily basis.\u201d Duque was relatively unknown until he won the presidency in Colombia last year after spending most of his adult life in Washington DC, working at the Inter-American Development Bank. A rightwinger naturally allied to Washington, Duque has played a prominent role in the international effort to oust Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, as the deepening crisis in neighbouring Venezuela has sent at least a million migrants across the border between the two countries. Duque was one of the first Latin American leaders to recognise the opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3, who declared himself Venezuela\u2019s rightful ruler in January. In March Duque declared that Maduro was \u201cfacing his last days\u201d, but since then the opposition campaign has faltered. \u201cThe current dictatorship has been in power for almost two decades and will not end overnight, but I think this time the diplomatic blockade has made the dictatorship the weakest it has ever been,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cIt could take a day, a week, a month. [Maduro\u2019s] military forces are broken, and day by day more of the military want to be on the right side of history. He is surrounded by people that any moment can turn their back on him. The three conditions are clear. We need an end to the dictatorship, a transitional government, and free and fair elections.\u201d Donald Trump and his hawkish national security adviser, John Bolton, have repeatedly warned that military intervention remains an option in Venezuela, but Duque warned against such measures. \u201cA foreign military option [would be] very costly and very complex. The only viable way to put pressure on Maduro to step down and end this is for the military to put itself on the right side of history,\u201d he said.",

Johnson is said to have told leading Eurosceptics in a private meeting that May\u2019s deal was \u201cdead\u201d.</p> \n<p>But at the same time, Johnson has publicly said there would only be a very small chance of a no-deal Brexit under his premiership and has been reinforcing those assurances in meetings with moderate Conservatives.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b146305d-32c1-4dc9-9f4d-b60ce025264f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal it would by default, become a \u201cthird country\u201d, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been accused of giving MPs contradictory promises on Brexit to win their votes, as one of his highly Eurosceptic backers warned that hardliners want to see him effectively tear up Theresa May\u2019s deal with the EU. The Conservative leadership frontrunner will face questions on his Brexit stance in a television grilling for the first time in the campaign on Tuesday, amid frustration among his rivals that he is getting away with pledging to be \u201call things to all MPs\u201d on issues from Brexit to HS2 in one-on-one meetings with them. His backers currently include most of parliament\u2019s hardline Eurosceptics, as well as moderates including Matt Hancock, Robert Buckland and Damian Collins, raising questions about how he has won support across the spectrum. Steve Baker, one of his hardline Eurosceptic backers, set out his belief that \u201ctoo many leadership candidates think the backstop is the only problem with the withdrawal agreement\u201d, arguing that it would also continue an unacceptable supremacy of EU law over UK law. The implication was that his preferred choice, Johnson, had told Eurosceptics that he would attempt a more thorough rewriting of the withdrawal agreement as well as meeting his strict deadline of leaving the EU by the end of October. Johnson is said to have told leading Eurosceptics in a private meeting that May\u2019s deal was \u201cdead\u201d. But at the same time, Johnson has publicly said there would only be a very small chance of a no-deal Brexit under his premiership and has been reinforcing those assurances in meetings with moderate Conservatives. Dominic Raab\u2019s backers believe their chances of securing Eurosceptic votes have been stunted by his unwillingness to tell them he would entirely rip up the withdrawal agreement \u2013 something he has told would-be backers he believes would be impossible to achieve by 31 October. \u201cBoris has been telling colleagues, of course, \u2018I\u2019ll rip up the whole thing,\u2019 yet he\u2019s also securing the votes of centrists like Oliver Dowden,\u201d one MP said. \u201cYou could say some of us have been naive not to campaign that way, but also that can really come back to haunt you.\u201d One rival camp also claimed Johnson had been leaving some MPs with the impression that he was in favour of the HS2 rail project, while others believed that he was against it. Johnson announced in the Birmingham Post on Monday that he would set up a review to \u201clook at the business case for HS2 and to think about whether and how we proceed\u201d. Johnson has been able to avoid questions about the detail of his Brexit plan as he declined to take part in Channel 4\u2019s debate on Sunday and has only done one newspaper interview since the contest began, plus private hustings for party members and MPs. At a hustings for journalists in Westminster where Johnson did not turn up, Rory Stewart, one of his rivals, criticised him for seeming to face both ways on Brexit. \u201cSomehow he\u2019s convinced Matt Hancock that he agrees with every word that Matt says, that he\u2019s in favour of the softest of soft Brexits; he\u2019s convinced Robert Buckland that he would never go for a no-deal; and at the same time he\u2019s got Mark Francois roaring: \u2018This man looked me in the eyes and promised we\u2019re going out on the hardest of no-deal Brexits,\u2019\u201d Stewart said. With Johnson absent from the airwaves, his supporters, including Johnny Mercer and James Cleverly, have been dispatched to defend his positions. BBC 5 Live\u2019s Emma Barnett even asked Mercer how many children Johnson had, which he batted away as an intrusion into the frontrunner\u2019s private life. Johnson is expected to cement his position as the favourite in another round of voting on Tuesday, while Sajid Javid, Stewart and Raab are all battling to get 33 votes from fellow MPs in order to stay in the race. Each of the three camps suggested they were quietly confident of getting the number if all MPs who had promised to vote for their candidate followed through on their pledge. If all reach that number, the lowest-scoring candidate will drop out. Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove are already past that threshold so are likely to stay in the contest, but sources in their camps said they were not expecting a great increase in supporters on the last round. MPs from all camps said Stewart appeared to have some momentum behind him, as he unveiled David Lidington, Theresa May\u2019s deputy, as his newest high-profile backer, and also gained the support of former chairman Dame Caroline Spelman. Gove attempted to halt the flow of former remain-supporting Tories to Stewart by writing in the Times that it would be \u201ca mistake to put forward two candidates into the final round who will polarise our party\u201d. A source in the Stewart campaign said it would be \u201ctight\u201d as to whether he would make the jump from 19 supporters in the first round to 33 in the second, but they believed they had just about enough pledges. His colourful past also came under scrutiny as he denied in a hustings ever having worked for the MI6 intelligence agency. However, the Telegraph quoted security sources claiming that Stewart had been employed as a spy for about seven years in his 20s. MPs will vote on their favoured candidates on Tuesday afternoon and then those left in the race will compete in a BBC debate at 8pm \u2013 the first television appearance by Johnson since the race kicked off. All the other candidates have been critical of his low profile in the contest so far, but some have toned down their attacks in recent days as MPs are increasingly seeing his path to victory as unstoppable.",

That\u2019s how it is.\u201d</p> <p>Kyrgios, who said in a recent podcast that Djokovic\u2019s cup-of-love victory celebrations were cringeworthy, was nevertheless happy to laud Nadal for his 12th Roland Garros triumph, adding that Wimbledon, which starts on 1 July, could be a shootout between Djokovic and Federer. \u201cOver five sets I don\u2019t think anyone will ever beat Rafa at the French Open,\u201d Kyrgios said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too hard physically. But at Wimbledon it\u2019s going to be tough to beat Novak or Federer, five sets.\u201d</p> <p>Kyrgios, who faces the Frenchman Adrian Mannarino on Tuesday, is not intimidated by anyone. He won all four sets against Djokovic in their only two matches, back-to-back two years ago in Acapulco and Indian Wells, and has promised to imitate his love-to-the-crowd gesture if he beats him again. He said of his fractious relationship with the spiritual Serb, \u201cIf I play Novak, he\u2019d just be determined to get one win against me.</p> <p>\u201cI have played Rafa a bunch of times. We have beaten each other, as well. I think they are motivated to beat me in general. I don\u2019t think before those comments they were, like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t really care.\u2019 They wanted to beat me, regardless. But my opinions won\u2019t change. I don\u2019t mind. When we go out there and we battle, that\u2019s what it is.\u201d</p> <p>Kyrgios had a mixed message for his friend Murray, however, two days before the Scot returns to the game in doubles with Feliciano L\u00f3pez: \u201cJust to see him back healthy and seeing him happy on court is all that matters. He\u2019s the first person I saw here on the court, doing doubles drills, and I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing. It\u2019s just good to see him back \u2013 but I don\u2019t think I want to carry him for Wimbledon dubs.\u201d</p> <p>Cameron Norrie, one of five British players in the Queen\u2019s draw, found the two-times grand slam finalist, Kevin Anderson, too strong over two hours and 20 minutes and the South African won 4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-4.</p> <p>In two and a half hours of late-evening drama the British qualifier James Ward came agonisingly close to going through to the second round but in the end Gilles Simon saw him off 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (2).</p> <p>Kyle Edmund, Dan Evans and Jay Clarke play on Tuesday. Evans, coming off 10 straight wins and two grass-court titles, plays the three-times major champion Stan Wawrinka for the third time, having taken a set off him in Indian Wells this year and nearly beaten him in five high-quality sets in the third round of the US Open three years ago.</p> <h2><strong>Konta eases through on return from French Open semi-finals</strong></h2> <p>Johanna Konta impressed in her first match since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/07/johanna-konta-errors-hands-french-open-tennis-semi-final-marketa-vondrousova\" title=\"\">reaching the French Open semi-finals</a> to ease into the second round of the Nature Valley Classic in Birmingham.</p> <p>The British No 1 made a seamless transition from clay to grass, beating Anett Kontaveit 6-4, 6-2.

      "bodyText": "Nick Kyrgios says he is happy to keep his feud with Novak Djokovic ticking over at Wimbledon next month \u2013 while Daniil Medvedev, another of the sport\u2019s young rebels, uttered the ultimate heresy on Monday when he revealed he always wanted Roger Federer to lose. For the first time since 2013, when the Latvian loose cannon Ernests Gulbis accused Federer, Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray of being \u201cboring\u201d, there is insurrection in the air and boredom seems the underlying cause of the latest unrest. Stefanos Tsitsipas, the 20-year-old Greek who is top seed here, is impatient for other young players to challenge harder against the elite. Kyrgios, who has already upset his betters, thinks the stars do have a hold over the next generation \u2013 but shouldn\u2019t. \u201cI probably don\u2019t show them respect,\u201d the Australian admitted. \u201cThey\u2019re just good at tennis. I just don\u2019t know if the younger guys are good enough to beat them over five sets.\u201d Meanwhile Medvedev, one of the game\u2019s bright hopes, says that growing up in an era when the Big Three have won nearly all the important trophies had never sat well with him. Shortly after dismissing the 35-year-old Spaniard Fernando Verdasco 6-2, 6-4 in 70 minutes on day one of the Fever-Tree championships, the 23-year-old Russian said: \u201cWhen I was 10, I hated Roger. I just couldn\u2019t see him win again. I was cheering from the first round for other guys, because that\u2019s the way I was. When Barcelona was winning everything in football, I wanted them to lose badly. If I lose first round, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s Nadal, Roger or Novak who wins the French Open. I\u2019m just upset about myself losing in the first round.

In two and a half hours of late-evening drama the British qualifier James Ward came agonisingly close to going through to the second round but in the end Gilles Simon saw him off 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (2). Kyle Edmund, Dan Evans and Jay Clarke play on Tuesday. Evans, coming off 10 straight wins and two grass-court titles, plays the three-times major champion Stan Wawrinka for the third time, having taken a set off him in Indian Wells this year and nearly beaten him in five high-quality sets in the third round of the US Open three years ago. Konta eases through on return from French Open semi-finals Johanna Konta impressed in her first match since reaching the French Open semi-finals to ease into the second round of the Nature Valley Classic in Birmingham. The British No 1 made a seamless transition from clay to grass, beating Anett Kontaveit 6-4, 6-2. The Estonian is only ranked two places lower than Konta but the No 7 seed played at a high level throughout and wrapped up victory in an hour and 12 minutes. The only blip came when she dropped serve at 4-3 in the opening set but she re-established her advantage straight away and the second set was particularly impressive, with Konta displaying her more rounded game to great effect. There was disappointment, though, for British No 2 Heather Watson, who let a lead slip in a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 defeat to Barbora Strycova. Watson was unhappy with a number of line calls and declined to shake the umpire\u2019s hand at the end of the match. Russia\u2019s Margarita Gasparyan pulled off an upset in the opening contest of the day, defeating the fourth seed Elina Svitolina 6-3, 3-6, 6-4. Svitolina had been struggling with a knee injury and, despite ending a four-match losing streak by reaching the third round of the French Open, she admitted she may be forced to skip the grass-court season.

China have gone to at least the quarter-finals every time in all six of their appearances. Whoever lies in wait, both will be desperate to make it through. <strong>Kick-offs: 5pm BST.</strong></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Germany earned their third win out of three in Group B after beating South Africa 4-0 in Montpellier. Melanie Leupolz opened the scoring inside 15 minutes, heading home from a corner. Sara D\u00e4britz added a second after goalkeeper Andile Dlamini could only parry Alexandra Popp\u2019s cross into her path. Popp, who had missed a golden opportunity soon after Leupolz\u2019s opener, added a third before half time. Dlamini atoned for her error in the second half with a fine save from Leubolz\u2019s header, and was unlucky when her fingertip save from Marina Hegering bounced off the far post, turned in by Lina Magull. Thembi Kgatlana missed an opportunity to add a consolation for eliminated South Africa, while Germany had two late goals disallowed for offside. In the other Group B game, China got the point they needed to secure qualification in third place, despite being dominated by Spain. Peng Shimeng produced a string of late saves to deny Spain victory, but a point was enough for both sides to progress. That\u2019s about all from me, but we will have match reports from both games online shortly. Thanks for joining me, and please join my esteemed colleague, John Brewin, for tonight\u2019s late games: So, Germany\u2019s next game will be in Grenoble on Saturday. They will play one of the third-placed sides \u2013 most likely from Group A, which will probably be Nigeria. Spain will play Group F\u2019s winners (probably USA) in Reims on Monday, and China are likely to face the Group C winners, who will probably be Italy, in Montpellier next Tuesday. Hope that\u2019s cleared things up for you. The World Cup action doesn\u2019t end here \u2013 join John Brewin for live coverage of the Group A finale, with hosts France facing Nigeria, and Norway v South Korea. Here\u2019s how Group B finished. Just to clarify \u2013 China are definitely through, as they are guaranteed to finish among the top four third-placed sides. Spain run out of time, but they are into the World Cup knockout stages for the first time ever. The bad news is they\u2019ll probably face the USA in the last 16. China are also through, largely thanks to goalkeeper Peng Shimeng. It\u2019s farewell to South Africa, and three wins from three for Germany, who win Group B. Dabritz, Popp, Leupolz and Magull got the goals. Time\u2019s almost up in Montpellier. Germany are winning handsomely, but a quick word for South Africa. They\u2019ve had their moments here, gave Spain a scare and went toe-to-toe with China. This is their first World Cup, and many of their players don\u2019t have professional contracts. They have plenty to be proud of. My speech is almost spoiled by a late German break, but Dlamani makes a fine save with her legs. Peng clatters into the post, and is hurt. She needs treatment on her knee. China don\u2019t have any subs left \u2013 but she looks OK to see out stoppage time, of which there will be four minutes. Late change for Spain: Seattle Reign\u2019s Celia Jimenez replaces Lucia Garcia. China bring on Yao Wei for Gu Yasha, who has had limited chances to show what she can do in attack. Can China hang on here? They look exhausted, and Peng has to rescue them again, turning Hermoso\u2019s header over the bar. In Montpellier, Mulaudzi breaks the German offside trap, but can\u2019t get her shot on target. Peng keeps China level! This is a brilliant save. Patri Guijarro, some 20 yards out, fires a shot towards the bottom corner \u2013 but the keeper gets down low to turn it around the post! Another goal chalked off for Germany! Giulia Gwinn gets forward from right-back and slots home, but the flag is up. South Africa operating a decent high line, even at 4-0 down. Putellas gets a header on target, but it\u2019s easy enough for Peng. \u201cSpain v China \u2013 the battle to avoid USA by not winning,\u201d notes Tony Reekie. \u201cSpain appear resigned to actually going forward while China are employing Scotland\u2019s first-half tactics throughout.\u201d Agreed; China are working hard for the point they need, but have shown no ambition at all. If they get an \u201ceasier\u201d draw while knackered and short of goals, will it have been worth it? Hermoso sends a header wide after Falcon cuts back inside and crosses from the left with her right. A nice moment in the other game \u2013 Germany see a goal ruled out for offside, with Van Wyk racing back and looking puffed. When the flag goes up, the defender jokingly berates the referee for making her run all the way back. What a chance for South Africa! Kgatlana gets a yard on her marker, which is frankly more than she needs. She speeds through on goal, but Schult stands tall and pushes her shot away! Almost a fifth for Germany! South Africa have been edging upfield and Germany strike on the break, substitute Schuller squaring for Sara Dabritz \u2013 who is denied by Dlamini! Spain keep pushing for the winner, with Putellas the latest to test Peng with a free-kick that\u2019s well struck, but lacks power. South Africa go close! Captain and centre-back Janine van Wyk decides to have a go from 30 yards out. Hey, why not? And it\u2019s a fine effort, staying low and zipping a foot over Schult\u2019s bar! China break upfield, Gu Yasha delivering an early cross towards Yang, who can\u2019t bring it under control under pressure. Change for Spain: Nahikari Garcia is replaced by Alexia Putellas of Barcelona. They have 25 minutes or so to secure what would be their second-ever World Cup win. Shot count: Spain 14, China 1. Right-back Marta Corradera is the latest to have a go, if a rather optimistic one from some 30 yards out. China living dangerously here \u2013 one goal for Spain would leave them nervously hoping to sneak through with three points. Lucia Garcia almost breaks the deadlock here, but her low shot is turned away by Peng! Lina Magull gets on the scoresheet after Dlamini tips Hegering\u2019s header onto the post. That\u2019s harsh on the goalkeeper, although admittedly a fair reflection of the game so far. Another change for China, with Wang Shuang replaced by Li Wen. As China try to reorganise, Garcia has a half-chance from a free kick \u2013 but a red shirt is there to block once again. Fine save from Dlamini! The goalkeeper atones for her earlier error, getting a hand to turn Leubolz\u2019s close-range header over the bar! Ramalepe goes into the book, after another agricultural challenge, this time on Huth. Magull is booked, apparently for dissent, then takes the free kick. It\u2019s cleared for a corner... Chance for Spain! Guijarro turns sharply in the area, and sees her snap-shot deflected behind for a corner \u2013 from which the midfielder gets a header on goal that Peng collects underneath her crossbar. Ramalepe is lucky not to concede a penalty, scything Popp down in the penalty area. The full-back then brings down Magull outside the area, conceding a free kick. Magull is taking a while to get up. Half-time changes in both games: For China, Yang Li comes on for Wang Shanshan. For Spain, Mariona Caldentey is replaced by Andrea Sanchez Falcon. South Africa have brought on Thembi Kgatlana and Rhoda Mulaudzi, while Carolin Simon replaces Schweers at left-back for Germany. Back under way in both games. Half-time listening: China create their best chance just beyond the break, with Li just unable to connect with Wang\u2019s cross to the far post. But it\u2019s 0-0 at half-time. Germany have located their scoring boots, putting three past South Africa in the first half. Drifting towards half-time in Le Havre, although Spain have a free kick in the China half. It\u2019s hoiked into the area in rather un-Spanish fashion, but Peng comes off her line and does enough to clear away. It\u2019s three in Montpellier, and Alexandra Popp has her first goal of this World Cup! She\u2019s missed a couple of chances, but made no mistake here, powering a header home from Gwinn\u2019s cross. Hermoso denied by Peng! Li Ying gets forward down the right flank, but her cross is easy for Pa\u00f1os. Spain get back on the front foot and Hermoso gets a header on target, but Peng makes a fine stop, and gathers at the second attempt. Almost a third for Germany! Buhl\u2019s low cross finds Huth, who can\u2019t get a touch to turn it in! Moments later, a crafty dummy plays Magull in \u2013 but the midfielder skews her shot over the bar! It looks a case of how many for Germany. An injury break in Le Havre, with Wang Shanshan taking a boot to the knee. Yang Li warms up, but Wang is able to continue for now. Popp had the chance to play Dabritz in, but completely overhit the cross, and turned away in disgust \u2013 only for Dlamini to parry the ball across goal rather than hold it. Dabritz got there first, and tucked it away. Ah, that\u2019s a shame. South Africa had held steady since that first goal, but a goalkeeping error allows Germany to double their lead. Spain continue to threaten, but from Ouahabi\u2019s cross, Hermoso is closed down by roughly half the Chinese team. They look happy to settle for a point already. Halfway through the first halves, and still goalless in Le Havre. Spain win a free kick and it\u2019s lifted into the area, but Victoria Torrecilla\u2019s hopeful header drifts wide. Spain have had 70% possession, with China happy to sit back and try to break. Jenni Hermoso gets frustrated and concedes a free kick with a heavy challenge. Spain\u2019s next attack ends with Caldentey hitting an undercooked pass. It works better if you say it out loud, alright? What a miss! Vilakazi has an effort from distance for South Africa, but Germany go straight back upfield and Dabritz gets in on goal. Her shot is well saved but the rebound lands at the feet of Popp. She can\u2019t sort her feet out, and blazes over! It felt like a matter of time, and Germany get on the scoresheet from a corner. Melanie Leupolz is given the freedom of the penalty area, and heads home tidily. In Montpellier, it\u2019s one-way traffic. South Africa keeping Germany at bay so far, but they\u2019ve barely left their half. Another chance for Spain! China get forward and send a couple of testing crosses in, before Spain do the same \u2013 Hermoso squaring for Lucia Garcia, who gets there ahead of Peng but prods the ball wide! That\u2019s two missed chances for the Athletic Bilbao forward. Chance for Spain! A lovely slide-rule pass sets Lucia Garcia up one-on-one with Peng Shimeng. The Chinese keeper races a mile off her line, and Garcia gets round her \u2013 but the angle is tight, and she delays the shot, allowing a defender to get back. Germany earn a free kick on the edge of the box, which Magull whips into a dangerous area. Popp connects with it but her shot is tame, and Dlamini gathers. South Africa v Germany is go! As is China v Spain, just under a minute behind. In Montpellier, the teams are out for the anthems. In Le Havre, China and Spain are on their way out of the tunnel. Five minutes to go!

Welcome to the World Cup\u2019s second act \u2013 a frantic bottleneck of 12 fixtures in four days, breaking the reassuring rhythm of the early group games and drawing up each team\u2019s road map to the final. In Group B at least, things appear straightforward. Germany are through, and will secure top spot unless South Africa pull off a monumental upset (25-1, since you ask). That\u2019s also the only way the debutants can claw their way off the bottom of the group. It\u2019s not going to happen. That leaves China and Spain shooting it out in Le Havre, where the winners will secure second place. A draw would send both sides through \u2013 Spain in second, China guaranteed to be one the best third-placed sides. Should either side lose, they face four days of uncertainty. The twist is that in this group, it might be better to avoid second place. The runners-up will face the Group F winners (probably the USA) in the last 16, while the third-placed team\u2019s most likely opponents will be Italy. Spain, despite their obvious potential, have never reached the World Cup knockouts. China have gone to at least the quarter-finals every time in all six of their appearances. Whoever lies in wait, both will be desperate to make it through. Kick-offs: 5pm BST.",

      "body": "<p>A row recently erupted over workers\u2019 conditions in the restaurant group Wahaca that turned out to be a little more complicated than it looked. Some diners had done a runner; another, law-abiding punter, Sarah Hayward, overheard the ensuing row and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sarah_Hayward/status/1139976719551647744\" title=\"\">took to Twitter to complain</a>: \u201cPpl next to us left without paying and their server is made to foot the bill from his wages. Apparently company policy. Utterly shameful employment practice.\u201d</p> <p>After some social media to-ing and fro-ing, it turned out the server had been docked \u00a33 on the \u00a340 bill, then reimbursed as it did not amount to \u201cgross negligence\u201d. The company\u2019s founder, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thomasinamiers/status/1140254177773461504\" title=\"\">Thomasina Miers, concluded:</a> \u201cIt is a crazy world where one is hung before even being asked a question \u2026 it really saddens me that people are so quick to presume the worst.\u201d</p> <p>It is a bruising experience to be monstered on Twitter; and most people who saw the fight kick off will not hang around to watch its resolution. That\u2019s half the point of the site, the social media director of a fashion brand once explained to me, people buy your stuff on Instagram, talk about it on Facebook and complain on Twitter.</p> <p>Wahaca\u2019s policy, though, is muddy. The staff handbook states: \u201cIf through your negligence a customer leaves the restaurant without paying you will be liable to pay the full bill including service to the company or it will be deducted from your wages.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine what negligence could possibly make it the waiter\u2019s fault that a customer commits an act of theft. Might they collude with the diner in a complicated scam, someone suggested? Hard to see the profit of such an enterprise when someone other than the waiter has already eaten it.</p> <p>But the killer detail is \u201cincluding service\u201d; if someone steals a sum from this restaurant that includes an amount specifically meant for the waiter, the waiter still has to reimburse the restaurant. There is no decent response to that beyond: \u201cYou what?\u201d</p> <p>It is impossible to imagine such a policy \u2013 which is by no means confined to Wahaca \u2013 surviving a robust and equitable negotiation between employer and employee.</p> <p>Odd details about workplaces frequently fire up the bystander\u2019s imagination. When an Amazon employee has to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/31/amazon-warehouse-wristband-tracking\" title=\"\">wear a tag to monitor their pace</a>, or an AA call centre (going back 15 years) times its workers\u2019 loo breaks, there is this collective, audible unease about what it means. You can see any number of statistics about the division of profit between capital and labour, you can familiarise yourself very well with the extent and reality of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/zero-hours-contracts\" title=\"\">zero-hours contract</a>, but nothing reaches that particular bit of your brain circuitry \u2013 let\u2019s call it the perception of justice \u2013 quite like a simple, even mundane, human interaction in which one side holds all the cards. Whether it\u2019s hyper-surveillance in the workplace or financial penalties for circumstances beyond your control, these measures speak of a relationship in which the parties are not equal.</p> <p>We\u2019re right to feel disquieted. The presumption of parity \u2013 the worker\u2019s time being of comparable value to the employer\u2019s pay, and their voices and interests being, if not always perfectly aligned, at least of equal importance \u2013 is the fundamental principle of dignity at work. This is what unions established; and everything that makes gainful employment bearable \u2013 from weekends to sick pay \u2013 spiralled from it. Whenever we hear a story of the workplace that doesn\u2019t sound fair, the thought should end: \u201cThat person should join a union.\u201d</p> <p>Some years ago, Neil Foster, now at the GMB and one of the most inspiring thinkers of the modern trade union movement, had an idea to reinvigorate it. All the large sectoral unions were seeing declining numbers and low engagement; but more to the point, the rise of insecurity at work was having a corrosive effect on union influence. Employees who didn\u2019t know how many shifts they would get from one week to the next simply couldn\u2019t afford the jeopardy of picking a fight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jun/17/wahaca-ends-policy-of-making-staff-pay-for-customers-unpaid-bills\">Wahaca ends policy on making staff pay for customers' unpaid bills</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Foster\u2019s idea was a broad-based online union not limited to any particular sector, which anyone could join. It would have the institutional knowledge and skills of a traditional union, but the ease of use and prospect of mass mobilisation you find in modern online campaigning organisations like Avaaz and 38 Degrees. Collective demands could be made that didn\u2019t hang on individual workers whose positions were precarious.</p> <p>While that has yet to happen, there is significant creativity in this field: university lecturers have started pop-up unions to fight on single issues. Unite set up a community union for the unemployed and low-paid to fight the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/27/the-bedroom-tax-explained\" title=\"\">bedroom tax</a>. The GMB, defending three groundsmen who were fired from Brighton football club this month, had a surge of solidarity support.</p> <p>Today everyone from Marxists to Rory Stewart seems broadly to agree that a new world is struggling to be born. These spontaneous explosions at injustice on Twitter suggest something a little more specific and practical is waiting to find its voice: a mass movement, similar in scope and ambition to the earliest days of unionisation, with the wholly new tools of the connected workforce. Online outrage is edging towards online solidarity. Less an echo chamber, more a muster point.</p> <p>\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "A row recently erupted over workers\u2019 conditions in the restaurant group Wahaca that turned out to be a little more complicated than it looked. Some diners had done a runner; another, law-abiding punter, Sarah Hayward, overheard the ensuing row and took to Twitter to complain: \u201cPpl next to us left without paying and their server is made to foot the bill from his wages. Apparently company policy. Utterly shameful employment practice.\u201d After some social media to-ing and fro-ing, it turned out the server had been docked \u00a33 on the \u00a340 bill, then reimbursed as it did not amount to \u201cgross negligence\u201d. The company\u2019s founder, Thomasina Miers, concluded: \u201cIt is a crazy world where one is hung before even being asked a question \u2026 it really saddens me that people are so quick to presume the worst.\u201d It is a bruising experience to be monstered on Twitter; and most people who saw the fight kick off will not hang around to watch its resolution. That\u2019s half the point of the site, the social media director of a fashion brand once explained to me, people buy your stuff on Instagram, talk about it on Facebook and complain on Twitter. Wahaca\u2019s policy, though, is muddy. The staff handbook states: \u201cIf through your negligence a customer leaves the restaurant without paying you will be liable to pay the full bill including service to the company or it will be deducted from your wages.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine what negligence could possibly make it the waiter\u2019s fault that a customer commits an act of theft. Might they collude with the diner in a complicated scam, someone suggested? Hard to see the profit of such an enterprise when someone other than the waiter has already eaten it. But the killer detail is \u201cincluding service\u201d; if someone steals a sum from this restaurant that includes an amount specifically meant for the waiter, the waiter still has to reimburse the restaurant. There is no decent response to that beyond: \u201cYou what?\u201d It is impossible to imagine such a policy \u2013 which is by no means confined to Wahaca \u2013 surviving a robust and equitable negotiation between employer and employee. Odd details about workplaces frequently fire up the bystander\u2019s imagination. When an Amazon employee has to wear a tag to monitor their pace, or an AA call centre (going back 15 years) times its workers\u2019 loo breaks, there is this collective, audible unease about what it means. You can see any number of statistics about the division of profit between capital and labour, you can familiarise yourself very well with the extent and reality of the zero-hours contract, but nothing reaches that particular bit of your brain circuitry \u2013 let\u2019s call it the perception of justice \u2013 quite like a simple, even mundane, human interaction in which one side holds all the cards. Whether it\u2019s hyper-surveillance in the workplace or financial penalties for circumstances beyond your control, these measures speak of a relationship in which the parties are not equal. We\u2019re right to feel disquieted. The presumption of parity \u2013 the worker\u2019s time being of comparable value to the employer\u2019s pay, and their voices and interests being, if not always perfectly aligned, at least of equal importance \u2013 is the fundamental principle of dignity at work. This is what unions established; and everything that makes gainful employment bearable \u2013 from weekends to sick pay \u2013 spiralled from it. Whenever we hear a story of the workplace that doesn\u2019t sound fair, the thought should end: \u201cThat person should join a union.\u201d Some years ago, Neil Foster, now at the GMB and one of the most inspiring thinkers of the modern trade union movement, had an idea to reinvigorate it. All the large sectoral unions were seeing declining numbers and low engagement; but more to the point, the rise of insecurity at work was having a corrosive effect on union influence. Employees who didn\u2019t know how many shifts they would get from one week to the next simply couldn\u2019t afford the jeopardy of picking a fight. Foster\u2019s idea was a broad-based online union not limited to any particular sector, which anyone could join. It would have the institutional knowledge and skills of a traditional union, but the ease of use and prospect of mass mobilisation you find in modern online campaigning organisations like Avaaz and 38 Degrees. Collective demands could be made that didn\u2019t hang on individual workers whose positions were precarious. While that has yet to happen, there is significant creativity in this field: university lecturers have started pop-up unions to fight on single issues. Unite set up a community union for the unemployed and low-paid to fight the bedroom tax. The GMB, defending three groundsmen who were fired from Brighton football club this month, had a surge of solidarity support. Today everyone from Marxists to Rory Stewart seems broadly to agree that a new world is struggling to be born. These spontaneous explosions at injustice on Twitter suggest something a little more specific and practical is waiting to find its voice: a mass movement, similar in scope and ambition to the earliest days of unionisation, with the wholly new tools of the connected workforce. Online outrage is edging towards online solidarity. Less an echo chamber, more a muster point. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>Two Italian greats came together on Monday morning in Milan as the fashion house Fendi unveiled the Oscar-winning director Luca Guadagnino as the guest artist for its spring/summer 2010 men\u2019s collection.</p> <p>Seating guests on wicker chairs in the garden of Fendi\u2019s headquarters, which lined the meandering gravelled catwalk, Fendi effectively invited the audience on to one of Guadagnino\u2019s sets for the show. It evoked the spellbinding summers he depicted in 2009\u2019s I Am Love and 2017\u2019s box-office hit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/22/luca-guadagnino-call-me-by-your-name-step-inside-teenage-dreams\">Call Me By Your Name</a> \u2013 both set in and not too far from Milan, and which are on the unofficial fashion curriculum. A heatwave and the music \u2013 which featured excerpts of piano by the Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto, who worked on the soundtrack of Call Me By Your Name \u2013 only helped.</p> <p>Guadagnino has reinterpreted the concept of La Dolce Vita for a 21st-century audience through his achingly beautiful films. He is the undisputed modern master of painting Italy in its most beguiling light. A long-term friend of Fendi\u2019s creative director, Silvia Venturini Fendi, his collaboration with the fashion house brought with it the ardent desire cinemagoers are usually left with after watching one of his films.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"15a207a60727278a49216637fec5d0e37c7d7a1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15a207a60727278a49216637fec5d0e37c7d7a1c/0_0_2667_4000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Milan men\u2019s fashion week spring/summer 2020.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Garden accessories and horticultural themes heavily suggested the garden aesthetic chosen by the fashion house for its spring/summer 2020 collection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victor Boyko/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bucking the brand\u2019s habit of showing in a dark inside venue, Fendi was keen that the collection was presented \u201c<em>en plein air</em> [outdoors] \u2026 drawing upon the idea of the garden as a symbol of man\u2019s most sophisticated relationship with nature\u201d, read the show notes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jun/17/donatella-versace-pays-homage-to-the-prodigy-keith-flint-in-milan\">Donatella Versace pays homage to the Prodigy's Keith Flint in Milan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Such sophistication was enhanced by the painterly floral prints that splayed out on to relaxed tailoring and shirts in silk and organza, layered as if to resemble the distant blur of sun-dappled blooms in a Lombardy garden. These originated from sketches Guadagnino made during \u201cmoments of ideleness\u201d on the set of his latest film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/01/suspiria-review-luca-guadagninos-horror-remake-has-sex-and-style-but-fails-to-bewitch\">Suspiria</a>, on which Fendi served as associate producer. So too, in the super-fine knitwear that came waffled and in open weave \u2013 a lattice effect akin to a garden trellis. Fabrics, such as hessian and raffia, contributed to the back-to-nature ambience.</p> <p>Statements came via twill boilersuits, wax jackets \u2013 long and short with plenty of practical pockets for tools \u2013 and excellent true-blue denim, while accessories worked with the horticultural theme. Gardening gloves with the house\u2019s logo printed on the ribbed cuffs just needed a pair of secateurs to be complete; bucket hats came with sun shields. Elsewhere, plaid picnic baskets and a leather-bound watering can enhanced the setting. Fendi is a house for whom much-hyped product has been commercially successful in recent years and a foray into more elegant territory has not left fans of this aesthetic wanting.</p> <p>The setting and aesthetic heralded something of a new era for the house \u2013 a sentiment particularly poignant given that this was the first menswear show since the death of its long-term <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/feb/19/king-karl-12-moments-that-made-lagerfeld-a-legend\">creative director Karl Lagerfeld</a>, who died in February. While most famous for his tenure at Chanel, Lagerfeld helmed the Milan-based house for 54 years.</p> <p>Guadagnino has close ties with the fashion industry, frequently working with high-profile designers. For A Bigger Splash, made in 2015, the former Dior and Calvin Klein designer Raf Simons created the wardrobe worn by Tilda Swinton\u2019s character, while this year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/feb/19/call-me-by-your-names-luca-guadagnino-on-cinemas-love-affair-with-fashion\">Guadagnino worked with Giorgio Armani to create a foundation to support budding filmmakers</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/jul/10/giorgio-armani-80-eight-facts-fashion-designer\">Armani</a> bookended the day with his show on Monday evening, bringing Milan fashion week to a close. Like the overriding themes of Guadignino\u2019s films, he also focused on summer as a \u201cliberating season\u201d.</p> <p>This translated to a relaxed take on everything on the catwalk where \u201cclothes blend together with spontaneity and elegance\u201d \u2013 as the designer relayed. It prevailed in a collection that blended formal and athleisure attire. Where there was a waistcoat or a suit, it was relaxed in structure, cut from cotton chambray and worn with a nonchalantly tied cravat, rather than a tie, and tailored tracksuit bottoms.

      "bodyText": "Two Italian greats came together on Monday morning in Milan as the fashion house Fendi unveiled the Oscar-winning director Luca Guadagnino as the guest artist for its spring/summer 2010 men\u2019s collection. Seating guests on wicker chairs in the garden of Fendi\u2019s headquarters, which lined the meandering gravelled catwalk, Fendi effectively invited the audience on to one of Guadagnino\u2019s sets for the show. It evoked the spellbinding summers he depicted in 2009\u2019s I Am Love and 2017\u2019s box-office hit Call Me By Your Name \u2013 both set in and not too far from Milan, and which are on the unofficial fashion curriculum. A heatwave and the music \u2013 which featured excerpts of piano by the Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto, who worked on the soundtrack of Call Me By Your Name \u2013 only helped. Guadagnino has reinterpreted the concept of La Dolce Vita for a 21st-century audience through his achingly beautiful films. He is the undisputed modern master of painting Italy in its most beguiling light. A long-term friend of Fendi\u2019s creative director, Silvia Venturini Fendi, his collaboration with the fashion house brought with it the ardent desire cinemagoers are usually left with after watching one of his films. Bucking the brand\u2019s habit of showing in a dark inside venue, Fendi was keen that the collection was presented \u201cen plein air [outdoors] \u2026 drawing upon the idea of the garden as a symbol of man\u2019s most sophisticated relationship with nature\u201d, read the show notes. Such sophistication was enhanced by the painterly floral prints that splayed out on to relaxed tailoring and shirts in silk and organza, layered as if to resemble the distant blur of sun-dappled blooms in a Lombardy garden. These originated from sketches Guadagnino made during \u201cmoments of ideleness\u201d on the set of his latest film, Suspiria, on which Fendi served as associate producer. So too, in the super-fine knitwear that came waffled and in open weave \u2013 a lattice effect akin to a garden trellis. Fabrics, such as hessian and raffia, contributed to the back-to-nature ambience. Statements came via twill boilersuits, wax jackets \u2013 long and short with plenty of practical pockets for tools \u2013 and excellent true-blue denim, while accessories worked with the horticultural theme. Gardening gloves with the house\u2019s logo printed on the ribbed cuffs just needed a pair of secateurs to be complete; bucket hats came with sun shields. Elsewhere, plaid picnic baskets and a leather-bound watering can enhanced the setting. Fendi is a house for whom much-hyped product has been commercially successful in recent years and a foray into more elegant territory has not left fans of this aesthetic wanting. The setting and aesthetic heralded something of a new era for the house \u2013 a sentiment particularly poignant given that this was the first menswear show since the death of its long-term creative director Karl Lagerfeld, who died in February. While most famous for his tenure at Chanel, Lagerfeld helmed the Milan-based house for 54 years. Guadagnino has close ties with the fashion industry, frequently working with high-profile designers. For A Bigger Splash, made in 2015, the former Dior and Calvin Klein designer Raf Simons created the wardrobe worn by Tilda Swinton\u2019s character, while this year Guadagnino worked with Giorgio Armani to create a foundation to support budding filmmakers. Armani bookended the day with his show on Monday evening, bringing Milan fashion week to a close. Like the overriding themes of Guadignino\u2019s films, he also focused on summer as a \u201cliberating season\u201d. This translated to a relaxed take on everything on the catwalk where \u201cclothes blend together with spontaneity and elegance\u201d \u2013 as the designer relayed. It prevailed in a collection that blended formal and athleisure attire. Where there was a waistcoat or a suit, it was relaxed in structure, cut from cotton chambray and worn with a nonchalantly tied cravat, rather than a tie, and tailored tracksuit bottoms. Where there were knits, they were fisherman-knit cardigans; jackets were denim bomber silhouettes; and shirting was silk, but the silhouette was dipped and untucked. Footwear featured espadrilles, trainers and smoking slippers. This is, of course, the designer\u2019s signature when it comes to his eponymous label. His commitment to this nonchalant luxury is one of the main reasons why his brand has kept a loyal \u2013 and profitable \u2013 clientele over the years and, at the same time, makes his brand one of the few major fashion houses to remain entirely independent. Like Fendi, Armani broke with show space convention, choosing to stage this outing in the courtyard of the brand\u2019s HQ. As the models took their final bow, Armani joined them, organising them in synchronisation around the pebbled courtyard adorned with greenery and flowers so photographers could get their very best angle. And, just as during the Fendi show earlier in the day, it was like watching one of Italy\u2019s finest directors at play.",

I was new at TGI Fridays and had my first runners. They\u2019d been a nice enough table, but they\u2019d been angry at the long wait for food and then, when it came, the food itself. That was a regular thing. At the end of the night, I was cashing out and one of my managers came over to discuss the run. His management style was horrid \u2013 putting people down, patronising them, goading them in front of customers \u2013 and he hated me. He told me it was my fault and I had to pay the table\u2019s bill or I wouldn\u2019t be able to leave the restaurant. I voiced my disapproval, but he stood his ground and so I began to count the \u00a370 bill out of my tips and own money. It was only when another manager intervened and spoke to the first manager and said that wasn\u2019t store policy that I realised I was being bullied. <em>22-year-old man, London</em></p> <p><strong>\u2018I had to mop up a pool of a blood with one-ply tissue\u2019</strong><br>I worked part-time in a restaurant while studying in college. The manager took a strong dislike to me because I was a little bit less experienced than the other waiting staff. On a particularly busy night, I heard him scream at me from across the restaurant \u2013 a drunk man had fallen from his stool and hit his head and split his lip open. Blood was everywhere, and my manager told me to clean it up. When I asked for gloves and a mop he gestured to some kitchen towel before disappearing behind the bar downstairs. Naively, I did it, as I didn\u2019t want to lose my job. I had to mop up a pool of this drunk old man\u2019s blood with one-ply tissue, on my hands and knees, in a busy restaurant. It was humiliating and I only realised how dangerous it was when a man who was drinking there approached me, told me he was a nurse and warned me to never let them make me do something like this again. I quit soon afterwards, but it haunts me to this day. <em>23-year-old woman, Dublin</em></p> <p><strong>\u2018She told me I needed to be prettier to be such a bad waitress\u2019</strong><br>During university, I worked at a small independent restaurant in south London. On one Sunday I had a customer who insisted on being seated in the closed part of the restaurant and then called me incompetent because I had to set up the table. She was a nightmare for the entire meal. By the time dessert came round, she had told me multiple times I needed to be far prettier if I expected to be such a bad waitress and still wanted a tip. I brought the desserts for her and her two male companions up a rickety staircase and she asked for dessert forks. I didn\u2019t think we had any, but offered to check our own cutlery and with the restaurant next door. I had to inform her there were none available and she pushed the table away from her, got up and swore into my face, asking me how it felt to be \u201cstupid and incompetent\u201d, then giggled with her friends. She tried to get the dessert taken off her bill because she couldn\u2019t eat cheesecake with a normal fork and, shockingly, didn\u2019t leave a tip. Curiously, she returned multiple times, though. This restaurant also tried to get away with not paying me the minimum wage for a 21-year-old because \u201cI had already signed a contract\u201d when I was under 21. <em>26-year-old woman, Wakefield</em></p> <p><strong>\u2018He was very distressed that we had run out of vinegar packets\u2019</strong><br>I worked in a fast-food restaurant at a tourist attraction. One busy summer day we ran out of tiny vinegar packets. One smartly dressed gentleman was very distressed by this, becoming extremely passive aggressive and holding up the queue with a monologue about how much he had paid to get in and expected everything to be \u201cjust so\u201d. About four hours later, as I was cleaning a table, I realised someone was standing next to me. I looked up to see the same man from before, holding a single vinegar packet between thumb and forefinger. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d bring this to you from the [restaurant in other part of attraction]. You know,\u201d he placed it on the table as if it were the golden idol from the first Indiana Jones film, \u201cin case someone asks. <em>26-year-old woman, Edinburgh</em></p> <p><strong>\u2018Only female staff were asked to do cleanup\u2019</strong><br>Working at a hotel in 2011: my tips were kept by management, a male manager kept calling me \u201cgood girl\u201d, only female staff were asked to do \u201ccleanup\u201d, and one set of customers asked me if I \u201cknew the difference between France and England\u201d. When I asked why, they said: \u201cHad you known, you wouldn\u2019t have brought me French [mustard] when I asked for English.\u201d I lasted two months before I was sacked and evicted (I lived on the premises) on Christmas Eve. I had been in the country for only three months at that point. <em>35-year-old-woman, London</em></p> <p><strong>\u2018Dishes had names like Good Girl or Bad Boy breakfast\u2019 </strong><br>Last year, I was working in a brand new pub. It was modern, well decorated and seemed like a really nice place. The issue was the clear sexism of the place. There were neon signs that said things such as \u201ckissable lips\u201d, \u201csexy face\u201d and \u201cglamorous girl\u201d, as well as dishes with names like Good Girl or Bad Boy breakfast, Naked, Dressed or Topless burgers. To make things even worst, it was a sports pub. The amount of shaming comments female waitresses and myself experienced every day from clients, because of the name of dishes, was absurd \u2013 from \u201cI\u2019d rather my waitress was topless\u201d to \u201cAre you a good girl?\u201d I had no chance to defend myself as they were my clients. I couldn\u2019t get out of that place any quicker. <em>20-year-old woman, London</em></p> <p><strong>\u2018Inside the empty crisp packet was an overfull nappy\u2019</strong><br>In the summer of 2014, I waited tables at a zoo restaurant. I will never forget serving one demanding table of two young families who had been incredibly demanding and complained about a range of issues \u2013 mainly the price \u2013 throughout their meal. After they exited I loaded up the rubbish on to a tray and, just as I was about to carry it all to the kitchen, a bag of crisps fell on to the floor. I bent down to pick it up and quickly realised that inside the bag was a warm, overfull nappy and a note saying \u201cThank you\u201d accompanied by a smiley face. <em>25-year-old, Norwich</em></p> <p><strong>\u2018They repeatedly pushed glasses off the table\u2019</strong><br>When I was working at a popular Italian pizza chain in London, on one occasion, a group came in, extremely drunk and obnoxious from the start. They carried on drinking and, after they repeatedly pushed glasses off the table, causing them to smash, we told them we would not be serving any more wine until they had finished their meal. They swore at my manager and told us all that we couldn\u2019t tell them what they can and can\u2019t do because they were 25, work really hard in the week and deserve to get drunk at the weekend. Every waiter in the restaurant at that point was doing a 12-hour shift. <em>27-year-old man, London</em></p> <h2>Responding via Twitter:</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c96c823dbc643462b4e104505583a038fdf660c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c96c823dbc643462b4e104505583a038fdf660c6/0_0_6016_4016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I expected a short break to cry in the bathroom\u2019 \u2026 a barmaid (posed by a model).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I expected a short break to cry in the bathroom\u2019 \u2026 a barmaid (posed by a model).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YakobchukOlena/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>\u201cA customer gave me a \u00a310 tip, which I was initially thrilled with. He then told me that when he eats out he \u2018starts at \u00a320 and deducts \u00a31 per slip-up\u2019. My 10 \u2018slip ups\u2019 ranged from the food taking 12 minutes to come to the stitching on my apron being frayed \u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter my bar hit a certain head count, we had to switch to plastic cups for safety reasons. When I handed a man his pint of lager in a plastic cup he spat at me and called me a bitch. I walked off to tell my manager expecting a short break to cry in the bathroom, but he instead made me go back to the bar and apologise to the man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe were filmed constantly. The owner was completely open about the fact that he, his wife and their adult daughter would watch the footage in real time at their house and ring in to question micro-decisions we made throughout the evening (\u2018Why did you just fill up his water glass? I hope you pushed the expensive wine before serving them the house just then\u2019).\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere was a colleague who used to pick their nose and wipe the contents on the bathroom wall. It was once my job to scrape them off with a knife into some tissue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was a teenage waitress, the tricky, \u2018charismatic\u2019 gentleman who had been celebrating his 80th birthday went to kiss my hand at the end of the meal. He then sucked several of my fingers before I could shriek, \u2018They need me in the kitchen!\u2019</p> <p>\u201cWhen it came to settling the bill, the customer I was serving said: \u2018Girls always come running when there\u2019s money involved\u2019, then screwed up the bank notes and threw them at me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was 15, I worked in a cafe. A woman carefully brought her tray back to me. \u2018How rare! What a thoughtful gesture!\u2019 I thought. Her child had puked all over it, so she was bringing it to me to clean.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI worked in a restaurant in a hotel. One of the chefs had an aneurysm and died when he went to find something in the fridge. The owners insisted that dinner service continue, and that his body be taken out to the ambulance through the back entrance, by the bins.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs the only English woman working in an Italian restaurant, I was subject to some low-level sexual harassment. When I complained, I was told not to be so English about things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA while back we hosted a work party. After the party, I was clearing up and saw a water jug underneath the table, hidden out of sight with a weird substance in. I picked it up and sniffed it. It was someone\u2019s vomit, and I almost vomited myself. So I never sniff anything that looks weird now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGirls weren\u2019t allowed to take orders, deliver savoury food or accept tips. We were only allowed to clear tables, bring drinks and deal with desserts.\u201d</p>",

This restaurant also tried to get away with not paying me the minimum wage for a 21-year-old because \u201cI had already signed a contract\u201d when I was under 21. 26-year-old woman, Wakefield \u2018He was very distressed that we had run out of vinegar packets\u2019 I worked in a fast-food restaurant at a tourist attraction. One busy summer day we ran out of tiny vinegar packets. One smartly dressed gentleman was very distressed by this, becoming extremely passive aggressive and holding up the queue with a monologue about how much he had paid to get in and expected everything to be \u201cjust so\u201d. About four hours later, as I was cleaning a table, I realised someone was standing next to me. I looked up to see the same man from before, holding a single vinegar packet between thumb and forefinger. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d bring this to you from the [restaurant in other part of attraction]. You know,\u201d he placed it on the table as if it were the golden idol from the first Indiana Jones film, \u201cin case someone asks. 26-year-old woman, Edinburgh \u2018Only female staff were asked to do cleanup\u2019 Working at a hotel in 2011: my tips were kept by management, a male manager kept calling me \u201cgood girl\u201d, only female staff were asked to do \u201ccleanup\u201d, and one set of customers asked me if I \u201cknew the difference between France and England\u201d. When I asked why, they said: \u201cHad you known, you wouldn\u2019t have brought me French [mustard] when I asked for English.\u201d I lasted two months before I was sacked and evicted (I lived on the premises) on Christmas Eve. I had been in the country for only three months at that point. 35-year-old-woman, London \u2018Dishes had names like Good Girl or Bad Boy breakfast\u2019 Last year, I was working in a brand new pub. It was modern, well decorated and seemed like a really nice place. The issue was the clear sexism of the place. There were neon signs that said things such as \u201ckissable lips\u201d, \u201csexy face\u201d and \u201cglamorous girl\u201d, as well as dishes with names like Good Girl or Bad Boy breakfast, Naked, Dressed or Topless burgers. To make things even worst, it was a sports pub. The amount of shaming comments female waitresses and myself experienced every day from clients, because of the name of dishes, was absurd \u2013 from \u201cI\u2019d rather my waitress was topless\u201d to \u201cAre you a good girl?\u201d I had no chance to defend myself as they were my clients. I couldn\u2019t get out of that place any quicker. 20-year-old woman, London \u2018Inside the empty crisp packet was an overfull nappy\u2019 In the summer of 2014, I waited tables at a zoo restaurant. I will never forget serving one demanding table of two young families who had been incredibly demanding and complained about a range of issues \u2013 mainly the price \u2013 throughout their meal. After they exited I loaded up the rubbish on to a tray and, just as I was about to carry it all to the kitchen, a bag of crisps fell on to the floor. I bent down to pick it up and quickly realised that inside the bag was a warm, overfull nappy and a note saying \u201cThank you\u201d accompanied by a smiley face. 25-year-old, Norwich \u2018They repeatedly pushed glasses off the table\u2019 When I was working at a popular Italian pizza chain in London, on one occasion, a group came in, extremely drunk and obnoxious from the start. They carried on drinking and, after they repeatedly pushed glasses off the table, causing them to smash, we told them we would not be serving any more wine until they had finished their meal. They swore at my manager and told us all that we couldn\u2019t tell them what they can and can\u2019t do because they were 25, work really hard in the week and deserve to get drunk at the weekend. Every waiter in the restaurant at that point was doing a 12-hour shift. 27-year-old man, London Responding via Twitter: \u201cA customer gave me a \u00a310 tip, which I was initially thrilled with. He then told me that when he eats out he \u2018starts at \u00a320 and deducts \u00a31 per slip-up\u2019. My 10 \u2018slip ups\u2019 ranged from the food taking 12 minutes to come to the stitching on my apron being frayed \u2026\u201d \u201cAfter my bar hit a certain head count, we had to switch to plastic cups for safety reasons. When I handed a man his pint of lager in a plastic cup he spat at me and called me a bitch. I walked off to tell my manager expecting a short break to cry in the bathroom, but he instead made me go back to the bar and apologise to the man.\u201d \u201cWe were filmed constantly. The owner was completely open about the fact that he, his wife and their adult daughter would watch the footage in real time at their house and ring in to question micro-decisions we made throughout the evening (\u2018Why did you just fill up his water glass? I hope you pushed the expensive wine before serving them the house just then\u2019).\u201d \u201cThere was a colleague who used to pick their nose and wipe the contents on the bathroom wall. It was once my job to scrape them off with a knife into some tissue.\u201d \u201cWhen I was a teenage waitress, the tricky, \u2018charismatic\u2019 gentleman who had been celebrating his 80th birthday went to kiss my hand at the end of the meal. He then sucked several of my fingers before I could shriek, \u2018They need me in the kitchen!\u2019 \u201cWhen it came to settling the bill, the customer I was serving said: \u2018Girls always come running when there\u2019s money involved\u2019, then screwed up the bank notes and threw them at me.\u201d \u201cWhen I was 15, I worked in a cafe. A woman carefully brought her tray back to me. \u2018How rare! What a thoughtful gesture!\u2019 I thought. Her child had puked all over it, so she was bringing it to me to clean.\u201d \u201cI worked in a restaurant in a hotel. One of the chefs had an aneurysm and died when he went to find something in the fridge. The owners insisted that dinner service continue, and that his body be taken out to the ambulance through the back entrance, by the bins.\u201d \u201cAs the only English woman working in an Italian restaurant, I was subject to some low-level sexual harassment. When I complained, I was told not to be so English about things.\u201d \u201cA while back we hosted a work party. After the party, I was clearing up and saw a water jug underneath the table, hidden out of sight with a weird substance in. I picked it up and sniffed it. It was someone\u2019s vomit, and I almost vomited myself. So I never sniff anything that looks weird now.\u201d \u201cGirls weren\u2019t allowed to take orders, deliver savoury food or accept tips. We were only allowed to clear tables, bring drinks and deal with desserts.\u201d",

The aged care royal commission has travelled to Broome this week to hear evidence about the barriers and challenges to providing services for Indigenous Australians. Multiple witnesses spoke about the importance of providing \u201cculturally safe\u201d aged care services. This included ensuring residential homes serve Indigenous traditional foods so people maintain their connection to country and culture. At Star of the Sea Elders Village \u2013 the only nursing home in the Torres Strait \u2013 residents are able to look out at the sea from the \u201cocean room\u201d which brought them much joy. Eighty per cent of staff at the nursing home identify as Indigenous Australians. However, the hearing was told the nursing home has difficulties when it comes to serving fresh fish. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of regulation around food safety and then also regulations in [the] aged care environment which prevent us from catching and preparing local fish in our kitchens,\u201d UnitingCare Queensland\u2019s Tamra Bridges told the hearing. \u201cWe have to buy imported frozen fish, you know, and have it delivered to Thursday Island, or we do work arounds with family and we\u2019re relying on the goodwill of family when we do that, which is not really fair on them.\u201d The Tjilpi Pampaku Ngura Flexible Aged Care Service at Docker River in the Northern Territory, has no problems serving residents kangaroo tails. \u201cYou can buy kangaroo tails in the shop and local people that have the ability to go hunting and also bring it into the residence but if it\u2019s purchased from the shop it can be cooked at the facility and is cooked on a fire,\u201d Bridges said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The hearing was also told about the lack of respite care on offer in remote and Indigenous communities. Aboriginal carer Madeleine Jadai, 55, has looked after her sister Betty, 62, who has dementia, for the past seven years. They live at Bidyadanga community, 190 kilometres south of Broome in the Kimberley region. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cOne time I had to go for a funeral out in the desert and I had to take Betty with me because I could not get her into respite care.

The Brumbies won the Australian conference title for the third time in the last four years, securing a home quarter-final against South African side, the Sharks, on Saturday night. Quite frankly, the Brumbies were the only Australian team that looked like playoff material.

With two Super Rugby titles in their trophy cabinet, the Brumbies are the most successful Australian team in the history of the competition and their brand is famous around the world, but they are based in a city of just 400,000 people. It is a mystery how the Brumbies not just continue to survive, but thrive, in a town with such a small population and limited corporate presence. The Rebels, on the other hand, have a history of spending big, but delivering little. But Melbourne does offer enormous potential to grow the game in a city of five million people.

      "bodyText": "Australia is at a crossroads. Drift towards a future of slow decline economically and socially or, if action is taken now to address our most important challenges, create a future of greater prosperity for all, globally competitive industries and a sustainable environment. That is the conclusion of a major report bringing together the thinking of more than 50 leaders in business, academia, NGOs and the community sector, working with the CSIRO to model alternative futures for Australia. The report is described as a \u201cclarion call\u201d for the nation. The Australian National Outlook 2019, two years in the making, aims to \u201chelp kickstart a national conversation about where Australia is heading\u201d, says its co-chair, Dr Ken Henry, the chairman of the National Australia Bank and former secretary of the Treasury department. Participants met as a group with the nation\u2019s leading science agency, the CSIRO, to identify the most critical long-term challenges facing Australia and what needed to change. They included senior leaders from Shell Australia, the Red Cross, McKinsey &amp; Company, Australia Post, PwC, the Cochlear company, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, the Grattan Institute, major universities, the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists and UnitingCare Australia. Individuals included the former New South Wales premier Nick Greiner, former chairman of the Australian competition and consumer commission Allan Fels and co-chair of the report, the CSIRO\u2019s chairman, David Thodey. The report concludes that while Australia has enjoyed almost three decades of economic growth, with enviable social cohesion and strong institutions, it risks \u201cdrifting into the future\u201d if it fails to respond to challenges in a fast-changing world. Those identified are the rise of Asia, rapid technological change, climate change and the environment, changing demographics, declining trust in institutions and business and strains on social cohesion. To deal with them and reach its potential by 2060, Australia must make \u201ckey shifts\u201d in five areas: an industrial shift, an urban shift, an energy shift, a land shift and a culture shift. The director of CSIRO Futures, James Deverell, led the project and said the sense of urgency came from the participants, who gathered for eight workshops, beginning with around 100 priorities for Australia before identifying the most crucial. \u201cThere was this strong sense that we need to take action now,\u201d Deverell said. \u201cThe group sees this as a clarion call, a call to arms for action. \u201cWhen you look at the shifts, there\u2019s a couple of things in common. One is the need to focus on the long term, that these shifts are going to play out over a generation or more, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can kick the can down the road and ignore them. The other one is the need for strong leadership, for bold action.\u201d The report references the 1980s, when strong productivity growth was driven by a consensus on economic reform supported by both major parties, big business and unions. The report does not give specific policy recommendations but suggests the \u201clevers\u201d the country needs to pull to get the best outcomes. One of its strongest conclusions is that there is no tradeoff between strong economic growth and transitioning to zero-emission renewable energy, an argument that has crippled political debate in Australia for more than a decade. In both scenarios modelled by the CSIRO \u2013 slow decline or what the report calls outlook vision \u2013 almost all electricity is generated by renewables by 2060 due to drops in the cost of renewables and the decline in the demand for fossil fuels. The global disruption in the energy market is underway, so whether the Australian government encourages new coal-fired power stations or not, renewables will be cheaper and replace them. In Australia, most of the transition will happen between 2020 and 2040 as ageing coal-fired power plants are retired and replaced with renewables. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen costs come down so much in solar and wind they are now the low-cost solution,\u201d Deverell said. \u201cOnce you hit a certain level of renewables on the grid you need to add storage to the cost, but that\u2019s factored into our modelling and we see the cost of storage coming down over time.\u201d Deverell said even if Australia continued its policy uncertainty around energy and environment policy, we would still get to almost 100% renewable energy by 2060 purely because of the market. But the warning to politicians and policy makers is that \u201cthe transition happens more slowly and ultimately it makes electricity prices higher\u201d. Thodey argues in the report that if Australia pulls the right levers, \u201cit is possible to achieve higher GDP per capita (as much as 36%) while ensuring growth is inclusive and environmentally sustainable\u201d. \u201cIn a global context, strong cooperation on climate change and trade can deliver a better outcome for Australia without significantly impacting our economic growth, where before it may have been thought impossible.\u201d Domestically, the report says that whatever happens in the rest of the world, Australia can make big strides to reduce our emissions through improving energy productivity, which means using less energy for the same outcome. Australia was weak compared with best practice internationally because it was not using the best technology available. It had the potential to become one of the most productive users of energy in the world through energy efficiency and electrification. Electric vehicles, for instance, are expected to be the cheapest form of transport after 2025 and would dominate sales by 2040. Australia needs to prepare to adapt to global conditions whatever they are, but the biggest benefits will come if the world takes concerted action on climate change to limit global warming to a maximum 2C by 2100 rather than the catastrophic 4C rise if little action is taken. If there is cooperative global action on climate change, Australia stands to be a big winner, the report finds. The CSIRO modelling indicates that \u201clower emissions from energy and greater sequestration on the land could enable Australia to achieve \u2018net zero\u2019 emissions by 2050 under the outlook vision\u201d. Australia could capitalise on low-carbon exports such as hydrogen produced by renewable energy, countering the decline in global demand for our fossil fuels exports. \u201cAlthough other countries are also pursuing energy productivity and renewables, modelling suggests that Australia\u2019s vast natural resources for renewable generation should lead to lower cost electricity in 2060,\u201d the report says. With reliable, low-carbon electricity and investor confidence in long-term policy, along with rising wages and improved energy efficiency, \u201cby 2060 Australians are spending between 58% and 64% less on electricity as a proportion of income than they are today\u201d. Even if the world balks at strong action on climate change, Australia does better economically if it if embraces energy efficiency to reduce emissions. The report\u2019s proposed land shift would see a \u201cstretch goal\u201d of increasing agricultural productivity to 3% per year, meaning intensifying agriculture on the best land, using emerging technologies and boosting research and development. For instance, increasing productivity could result in revenue for crops such as winter cereals doubling by 2060. Agriculture in Australia had not yet fully embraced the \u201cdigital revolution\u201d and doing so would be a boon. Strong global action on global warming would present opportunities for land owners to sequester carbon through carbon and environmental planting, a \u201csignificant land use shift\u201d that would protect prime agricultural land for food. As much as half of the least productive agricultural land could be profitably switched to carbon plantings, which would offset Australia\u2019s own greenhouse gas emissions. Additional emissions abatement could be sold as carbon credits to other countries. \u201cAustralia has one of world\u2019s best and largest solar resources and we can capture that and export low emissions energy to countries that don\u2019t have that resource, to places like Japan, Korea and potentially even China,\u201d Deverell said. Overall, the report says that \u201cAustralia is not well prepared and that action is required to avoid the slow decline scenario\u201d.

In both the slow decline and outlook vision scenarios, the report accepts official estimates that Australia\u2019s population will reach 41 million by 2060, with Sydney and Melbourne home to between 8 million and 9 million people, and Brisbane and Perth between 4 million and 5 million. The slow decline model shows millions more living in the outer suburbs, making it harder to travel to jobs, education and services. Housing affordability remains a major problem, and social cohesion is strained. The urban shift requires a big change in the way planning and policy supports our cities, with a growth in medium and high density living, and a focus on multiple \u201ccentres\u201d of growth apart from the CBD, a policy that Sydney and Melbourne are already embracing. Well-designed apartments, semi-detached homes and townhouses make up just over half of the housing stock, with a mix of reasonably priced accommodation so that essential workers can afford homes. People live closer to jobs, to education and to services and recreation. Car use is down, mass transit is up and electric vehicles make up over 80% of new vehicle sales in 2060. An alternative model outlined is one in which satellites cities such as Geelong and Newcastle grow quickly, and 5 million more people choose to live outside the capital cities, easing the density in the capitals. It is the second Outlook report, following a 2015 release that focused more narrowly on water, energy and food. The 2019 report is more ambitious and brings in outside leaders to identify Australia\u2019s key challenges and opportunities. Deverell said it was aimed first at senior decision makers in the public and private sector, as well as NGOs and community groups. But it was \u201ca message to all Australians that we can take control of the kind of future we want for the country\u201d. \u201cBy using those two scenarios we were trying to illustrate just how different the future is depending on the path that we take. We\u2019re saying that Australians need to get together and these are the things we need to be focusing on. This is what\u2019s really important.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government has been challenged by the European Union and by China about whether it can meet its Paris commitments given rising emissions, and about growing pollution from vehicles, ahead of a progress meeting about climate commitments in Bonn next week. Nineteen countries, including Australia, will gather in Bonn on 24 and 25 June for a multilateral assessment of progress made under international climate commitments, and ahead of that session countries have submitted a range of questions about the performance of signatories in meeting their climate targets. As well as questions about rising emissions, the EU and Canada have also queried the Morrison government\u2019s decision to use carry-over credits from the Kyoto protocol in its latest carbon budget. The Coalition is counting a 367 megatonne abatement from carry-over credits (an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030) to help meet Australia\u2019s 2030 target. The EU in its questions to Australia points out that net emissions will grow during the period 2013 to 2020 and notes \u201cAustralia is also increasing coalmining, in particular for export\u201d. It has asked whether Australia considers its emissions profile, which has seen pollution rise since the repeal of the carbon price, to be \u201con a structural path of decrease in line with its commitments\u201d. It has also flagged fossil fuel exports and asked whether they are sustainable \u201cin the context of Paris agreement\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Morrison government officials have addressed the implicit criticism by arguing in a submitted answer that \u201cAustralia\u2019s national emissions peaked in 2007\u201d and pointing to a fall in emissions per capita. It says even without its climate policies, unveiled just before the recent federal election, including the reboot of the Abbott-era emissions reduction fund (ERF), \u201cthe decoupling of economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions has been progressing steadily since 1990\u201d. The government says the mix in electricity generation has changed between 2013 and 2020, and the Renewable Energy Target (RET) will see renewable energy grow to about 23.5% of Australia\u2019s energy mix by 2020. Australian officials do not, in the answer to the EU, mention the RET winds down from 2020, or that a sectoral target to drive emissions reduction in the electricity sector, proposed by Malcolm Turnbull in the national energy guarantee, was scrapped after he was replaced as prime minister by Scott Morrison. The EU has also challenged Australia on its 2030 Paris target, pointing out \u201con the basis of reported projections with existing policies and measures it is not on track to meet this commitment\u201d. The EU asked Australia whether it would need further policies to meet the Paris commitment, given the current trends. Australian government officials point to the policies outlined before the recent election, including the funding boost for the ERF. But in defending the status quo, the government has also restated a commitment to \u201creview and refine\u201d domestic policies aligned with the five-yearly review process under the Paris agreement. \u201cThis approach will provide for integrated consideration of domestic policy and international targets, and provide guidance for industry about future policy review processes,\u201d officials said. China, in a question to Australia, notes there will be a significant increase in transportation greenhouse gas emissions, and asks what measures Australia plans to take to reduce transport pollution in the future. While the Morrison government pilloried Labor in the recent election campaign for proposing a vehicle emissions standard and targets for the uptake of electric vehicles, characterising Labor\u2019s plans as a \u201cwar on the weekend\u201d, government officials have told China the Coalition \u201cis supporting low and zero emissions transport options in a number of ways\u201d. It says it is \u201cdeveloping\u201d a national electric vehicle strategy \u2013 a strategy the government has not yet unveiled \u2013 which it says will build on support being rolled out through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. It also points to the government\u2019s Green Vehicle Guide website, and mandatory fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission labels, that \u201chelp consumers identify and choose more fuel efficient vehicles\u201d as well as \u201caction to bring our fuel quality in line with international standards\u201d. The government says the safeguard mechanism \u201cputs regulated limits on the emissions of large transport facilities that emit more than 100,000 tonnes C02-equivalent each year (mostly rail freight, domestic aviation and shipping)\u201d and says the ERF \u201cincentivises businesses, households and landowners to proactively reduce their emissions [and] provides incentives to reduce the emissions intensity of land and sea transport activity\u201d. It also points to the national hydrogen strategy, which is being led by Australia\u2019s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, which is due to be delivered by the end of 2019.",

      "bodyText": "Australians are slightly more inclined to support nuclear power plants than oppose them, but a clear majority of voters do not want to live near one, according to new polling. With nuclear power making a return to the national political agenda, a new survey from Essential finds 44% of Australians support nuclear power plants, up four points since the question was last asked in November 2015, and 40% oppose them. But asked whether respondents agreed or disagreed with the statement \u201cI would be comfortable living close to a nuclear power plant\u201d, only 28% agreed and 60% disagreed. The new survey comes as some members of the Coalition are pushing for an inquiry into the viability of nuclear energy and the federal energy and environment ministers have left the door open to lifting Australia\u2019s ban on nuclear power as part of a review of environmental regulations. During the recent election campaign Scott Morrison insisted he had no plans to reverse the current ban on nuclear energy, after earlier suggesting he could be open to it if proposals stood on their own two feet. While the internal positioning within the Coalition is nascent, influential industry groups such as the Minerals Council of Australia have been lobbying to overturn the ban. In the event the Morrison government ultimately proceeds with a legislative effort to end the prohibition, it is possible it could get the numbers in the new Senate even if Labor and the Greens oppose the shift. The Australian Conservatives senator Cory Bernardi told Guardian Australia: \u201cI\u2019m all for it\u201d \u2013 although he said he was not supportive of either a carbon price or government subsidies to make nuclear technology economically viable. Bernardi said parliament should remove the ban and then let proponents determine whether power plants were viable or not. The Centre Alliance senator Stirling Griff said it was possible the micro-party, which has two Senate votes, could support ending the nuclear ban. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a closed mind on this, but we are a long way from having an open one,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not there yet, but that\u2019s not to say we won\u2019t get there in the future.\u201d Griff said if any change was to be made it would need to be accompanied by appropriate safeguards and regulations to ensure safety and public confidence, and he said he was not sure Australian voters favoured the change. The returning Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie is yet to flag her position publicly on a range of issues but in 2015 said: \u201cApart from hydro, the only way to decarbonise energy is to move very quickly to nuclear. And it\u2019s about time we move to that option.\u201d The new survey from Essential says a majority of the sample 54% believe nuclear energy would be a reliable energy source for the future (28% disagree) and almost half the people in the survey, 47%, think nuclear would before better for the environment than coal-fired generation (30% disagree). A majority, 63%, think having a nuclear industry in Australia would create skilled jobs, with 22% disagreeing. Even though nuclear energy is expensive, just over half the sample, 51%, think nuclear would help lower power prices (26% disagree). John Howard established a review of nuclear power in the run-up to the 2007 election. The Switkowski review concluded that Australia could establish a nuclear industry, and nuclear power plants \u2013 which don\u2019t emit carbon pollution \u2013 could make a useful contribution to Australia\u2019s abatement task, but setting up the industry would take between 10 and 15 years. That review also concluded nuclear energy would not be viable without a carbon price. A more recent inquiry in South Australia, while supportive of the industry, said a nuclear power plant would not be viable in the state even under carbon pricing policies consistent with achieving the well below 2C target agreed in Paris in December \u201cbecause other low-carbon generation would be taken up before nuclear\u201d. Separate to the renewed nuclear debate, the mining giant BHP has submitted a plan to build a new tailings dam at South Australia\u2019s Olympic Dam uranium mine within months. Dave Sweeney, nuclear campaigner for the Australian Conservation Foundation, said: \u201cAny increase in the footprint of Olympic Dam would mean an increase in the complexity and cost of future clean-up and rehabilitation. \u201cCleaning up a uranium mine is never easy and always costly.

The devastating skin disease caused by parasitic mites had left his skin crusted, bleeding and constantly irritated. His eyes and ears were so affected he could barely see, hear or even smell. The nocturnal animal was out grazing during the day, desperate for nutrients because of his raised metabolic rate but he was gradually wasting away. Untreated, he faced a certain and agonising death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"378f78e56ada226d476fe904256381b8f3120bb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/378f78e56ada226d476fe904256381b8f3120bb1/0_0_800_510/500.jpg\" alt=\"Grasso the wombat when he was first reported to LAOKO.\" width=\"500\" height=\"319\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grasso the wombat when he was first reported to the Looking after our Kosciuszko Orphans (LAOKO) mange management group in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Guarracino</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Volunteer wildlife carer Elena Guarracino, from the <a href=\"https://laokosmwr.org/\">Looking after our Kosciuszko orphans </a>mange management group, was alerted to Grasso\u2019s plight in early May. She set off to find him, somewhere on a property at Avonside in New South Wales. He was in such poor condition that euthanising him could have been considered the kindest option. But Guarracino thought he was plump enough to survive for a while, and so, despite her 120km round trip, she treated him four times over the next 25 days.</p> <p>When she last saw him at the beginning of June, Grasso was much improved. Many of the scabs had dropped off and his fur had regrown. Because his eyes and ears were no longer crusted, he was more alert and trickier to track down but she\u2019s certain he\u2019s on the mend.</p> <p>Day in, day out, wildlife carers such as Guarracino are fighting the scourge of mange across Australia.

University of Tasmania researcher Dr Scott Carver isn\u2019t sure why but wombats are the most affected marsupial, with impacted populations in NSW, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia. Of the three native species, the already critically endangered northern hairy-nosed wombat, the southern hairy-nosed wombat (endangered in NSW) and the bare-nosed wombat, it\u2019s the bare-nosed wombat that\u2019s been hit hardest.

My knees were a bit hurting, but we had enough bowlers to keep going. I think the turning moment was Mustafizur taking wickets. Hetmyer and then Russell in two overs to get them out. <br></p> <p>\u201cShakib did somethign really exceptional, and hopefully the other boys can join him.

I know that if I bat at No5 then I come in at the 30th or 40th over and that\u2019s not ideal for me. So I asked to change.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019m doing ok with the ball, but I can get certainly better.

The batsmen have taken on the short ball today and triumphed. When that didn\u2019t work, West Indies ran out of ideas. It was all pace today, on a good batting strip that didn\u2019t offer much except enough bounce to take the ball over the keeper on occasion.

I do think this will be realised by more people on reflection, but his consistency has been remarkable in a team who have often been less than remarkable.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t argue with that.

Some luck, but intent to score as soon as he came in, unlike his England hundred where he looked to be trying to limit any net run rate damage.

If multiple teams end up with the same number of points, the higher ranked team gets the higher position on the tournament table. This serves a dual role since it is a fairer method than using the NRR, and contextualises bilateral games too! Your thoughts?\u201d</p> <p>I think the main issue is that the ranking uses results from two years ago, but would decide positions in a tournament. One of the joys of knockout play is that a team can shake off its past and emerge anew.

      "bodyText": "And this is a really lovely email, from Shammi Huda. A wonderful win for Bangladesh, and a nice place to leave it. Farewell. \u201coutside, the monsoon in full elemental glory lashing it down on dhaka. season of mango, lychee, jackfruit, jam in full flow. our golden generation of shakib, tamim, mushfiq, and mashrafe on display. a nation of 160 million glued to the tv. it doesn\u2019t get better than this. in the 70s and 80s we gave our love to the west indies, like we did with mohammad ali and pele. the irony isn\u2019t lost on the older generation (with 60% of population under 30). i don\u2019t have a tv but following scoring through the cheers and lulls of the streets. bangla joi!\u201d Here are the updated standings, with Bangladesh just outside the finals position. Jason Holder has some relatively obvious thoughts on what went wrong: \u201cNot enough runs.\u201d Well, yes. \u201cWe never got going as we should have through the middle overs. If you score 320 here you\u2019ve got to fight really hard through the middle overs to defend it, and there were a couple of chances we missed. We tried to hit the top of the stumps but we were just too inconsistent. Having said that. we can\u2019t dwell on it. We\u2019ve got another game to play, and from here everything is a final for us.\u201d And the Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza. \u201cWe said yesterday that there is still a chance to go, but we have to win all matches. My knees were a bit hurting, but we had enough bowlers to keep going. I think the turning moment was Mustafizur taking wickets. Hetmyer and then Russell in two overs to get them out. \u201cShakib did somethign really exceptional, and hopefully the other boys can join him. In the last two matches Mushy batted so well, today Tamim and Soumya batted well. Liton Das, normally he opens or bats at three, so it\u2019s good for him to get a chance for us and he delivered.\" \u201cI am loving following this match. What a joy Bangladesh are,\u201d writes Charlie Jeffery. \u201cWas wondering if they had played Australia yet? To echo someone else it\u2019s such a shame that the Windies are falling away like Steve Finn falling into the stumps. We need upsets though against the fatter teams.PS: I love listening to the Final Word too, even if there is some Oz stuff I just don\u2019t understand.\u201d Couldn\u2019t agree more about the joy. They play Australia on Thursday at Trent Bridge, and I\u2019ll be there bringing you the OBO as ever. As for the last comment, it is true that sometimes our podcast is mystifyingly Australian for some listeners, but we like to bring an exotic streak to lives around the world. Player of the match: Shakib al Hasan. No surprises there. Joel Garner awards the trophy. \u201cIt feels great. I\u2019ve been working on my batting for the last month and a half and it\u2019s paid off. I thought it was a team effort to restrict the West Indies, and I was confident we could make it work. \u201cI know that if I bat at No3 I\u2019ll get more opportunities, more time to bat. I know that if I bat at No5 then I come in at the 30th or 40th over and that\u2019s not ideal for me. So I asked to change. \u201cI think I\u2019m doing ok with the ball, but I can get certainly better. It will be tough next game, especially playing for Australia who are at the peak of their form so we\u2019ll have to bring our A game. Thanks to our supporters who have been there travelling for us, it\u2019s so good to have this support in this World Cup.\u201d 41.3 overs: Bangladesh 322-3 (Shakib 124, Das 94) Pulled for four! And that will finish things off \u2013 both this match, and the West Indies\u2019 World Cup campaign. Fittingly Liton Das hits the boundary, and fittingly it\u2019s a pull. The batsmen have taken on the short ball today and triumphed. When that didn\u2019t work, West Indies ran out of ideas. It was all pace today, on a good batting strip that didn\u2019t offer much except enough bounce to take the ball over the keeper on occasion. Their lone spinner Ashley Nurse didn\u2019t play, and Chris Gayle\u2019s attempt to fill in was unsuccessful in fairly spectacular fashion. 41st over: Bangladesh 316-3 (Shakib 124, Das 88) It\u2019s party time at the Liton Das Ranch House. He strides forward at Holder and laces the first ball of the over through extra cover, then leans back and carves a cut shot over backward point. A couple more boundaries as Bangladesh career towards history. 40th over: Bangladesh 305-3 (Shakib 123, Das 78) Gabriel continues, because there\u2019s no point changing really. The West Indies have given up. And there\u2019s no need for Bangladesh to attack, so the batsmen just work a few runs around to go past 300. \u201cIs there a player in the history of the format that has achieved such incredible statistical feats with less attention?\u201d asks Matthew Potter of Shakib al Hasan. \u201cIf he had achieved for those figures for, say, India, would he not be consistently talked about as an all time great already? I do think this will be realised by more people on reflection, but his consistency has been remarkable in a team who have often been less than remarkable.\u201d I can\u2019t argue with that. It tends to take team wins for players\u2019 feats to be really recognised. But there\u2019ll be a lot of respect for this knock today, given it\u2019s going to lead to an important win. 39th over: Bangladesh 299-3 (Shakib 119, Das 76) Suddenly Bangladesh only need 28 off 12 overs. It doesn\u2019t help when Liton Das smashes a drive straight back at Cottrell and the bowler can\u2019t hang on while trying to preserve his own safety. It helps even less when he follows up with a ball on leg stump that Das glances for four. 38th over: Bangladesh 294-3 (Shakib 118, Das 72) Shannon Gabriel to bowl, striding in to Liton Das. Short, not much bounce though, and it\u2019s pulled away for six! Solid shot, great connection, and it flies well in front of square, into the midwicket crowd. Sweet sound from the first ball of the over. The second, Gabriel pitches up. Das guesses that he will, shuffles away a touch to make some room, and lofts him for six more! Over long off that time, another clean strike and it flies away. Third ball, and IT\u2019S SIX! Bouncer again, middle stump line, but Das moves the other way, steps inside the line of the ball and hooks it over fine leg! What a streak. Will he go for four? No, he\u2019ll play sensibly and drive the wide yorker for one. But Shakib follows up by nicking Gabriel fine for four. Then driving a single. The over goes for 24! This pair could have won Pakistan\u2019s five-over resumption against India last night, at this rate. 37th over: Bangladesh 270-3 (Shakib 113, Das 53) The required rate is down to 4 an over. Cottrell comes in and... bowls a wide. First ball of the over. A couple of dots follow, then has Shakib miscuing but landing safe before it reaches mid-on. So there\u2019s a vestige of pressure, which is then placed on the barbeque and torched when Cottrell bowls a leg-stump half volley for Shakib to clip behind square for four. 36th over: Bangladesh 264-3 (Shakib 109, Das 52) More nervous moments for Bangladesh, as Shakib miscues Thomas back over the bowler, the ball hanging for a long time before landing between mid-on and mid-off. He gets away with it and gets two runs. A couple more wides follow. They\u2019ve been a plague on this match for the Caribbean side. And from the re-bowl - the sixth delivery that has taken three attempts to land - Shakib drives four through long-on. 24 wides today! Bangladesh need 58 from 84. Imagine taking 24 runs from them and four overs off the balls remaining. Toby Sims is in misery. \u201cI\u2019m very much in two minds about this match - I love the West Indies (Jason Holder is a talisman for both them and the game) but I can\u2019t help really wanting Bangladesh to pull this off. Not only for the lesser spotted run chase above 300, but also because of their passion and tenacity (see also Afghanistan). On tenterhooks for both sides, it\u2019s a nightmare!\u201d 35th over: Bangladesh 253-3 (Shakib 101, Das 51) Cottrell tries again. A brace, a couple of singles. The 250 comes up, as does a fifty for Liton Das. He\u2019s been terrific too, taking his time and then motoring along once set, supporting his senior player. Between them they\u2019ve reduced the deficite to 69. Nice. \u201cMy second team is generally whichever side is chasing. Partly because we\u2019re yet to see a really epic run chase in the World Cup (go on, Bangladesh!), but mainly because I just find it entertaining. The psychology of weighing up the risk/reward of batting in a chase is one of my favourite things in sport. (Full disclosure: part of my job involves writing risk assessments. I\u2019m not an interesting person.)\u201d You might be about to see one, Matthew Dony. Then you can reward yourself with a big bowl of plain brown rice and a peruse of the latest Excel formulas. 34th over: Bangladesh 248-3 (Shakib 100, Das 47) Liton Das miscues down to third man for a boundary, then gets off strike. Shakib doesn\u2019t miscue though, from the last ball. He drives Thomas gloriously through cover to raise the milestone! That\u2019s a great get for the highlight reel. Shakib\u2019s second hundred at this World Cup, and he joins a select group of batsmen to achieve that sort of feat. He\u2019s done it quickly, and put his team in pole position to win this match. Some luck, but intent to score as soon as he came in, unlike his England hundred where he looked to be trying to limit any net run rate damage. He was a matchwinner with the bat against South Africa, and could be here. 33rd over: Bangladesh 238-3 (Shakib 95, Das 42) He\u2019s Liton fire! With Shakib maybe growing a bit pensive while close to a century, as batsmen are wont to do, Das is growing in confidence and taking on the responsbility. He gets a short ball from Thomas, with enough width to swing, and just opens the blade to the sky and uppercuts it for six! Short straight boundaries at Taunton. Then two more runs in the same direction along the ground. Jack Jorgensen emails in. \u201cI never imagined myself doing so (too many nightmares about the All Blacks, and jokes about someone\u2019s under-arm) but I find myself backing the Kiwis as my second horse, as an Australian. I love watching Kane bat, and saw part of Ross Taylor\u2019s epic at the WACA a few years back, which bumped up my estimation of his skills. The Big Man / Big House / Dutchie has the poshest name in the tournament. The first name game in the squad is strong as well - two Colins, a Henry, a Martin - almost like a team of history teachers / accountants. Plus they seem to have gotten their balance correct as well, with two decent spinners in Sodhi and Santner, a great pace attack, and a good spread of batting. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how far they get.\u201d 32nd over: Bangladesh 228-3 (Shakib 94, Das 33) The Gayle Experiment is proving costly for West Indies. They have to find two more overs to fill in Russell\u2019s allotment. Gayle may not be the answer. Because Liton Das plays his first shot in anger, skipping down and chipping four over midwicket one ball after that outfielder was moved to square leg. Shakib carves out to deep cover and only a dive keeps him to two, then Das makes room and goes out through cover himself, on the right-hander\u2019s side of the ground, driving four more. Lovely batting, 13 from the over, and their deficit is under 100 now. They need 94 from 18 overs. 31st over: Bangladesh 215-3 (Shakib 92, Das 23) Liton Das gets lucky, skewing Holder over mid-on. Thomas wasn\u2019t right back on the ring, where he might have been tall enough to take it. Those moments have gone against West Indies today. But he\u2019s doing his job, rotating strike, and running hard when Shakib wants a fast two to the midwicket sweeper, making sure they both get home safe. No intensity from West Indies in the field though. Take a wicket and they can definitely still win this, they just don\u2019t look like they believe that. Shakib has gone back to being top run-scorer at this World Cup. He\u2019s passed Aaron Finch\u2019s 343, and done it from one fewer innings. 30th over: Bangladesh 210-3 (Shakib 89, Das 21) Captain Jason Holder is racing in the Desperation Stakes at the moment. Chris Gayle comes on for a bowl. He\u2019s a walk-up start in this team, literally. Uses his height to lob a ball down with reasonable effect. Single, dot, single, landing them alright. Then he bowls another set of five wides. Fifteen runs in such mistakes, and 22 wides in all, from the West Indies bowlers today. Gayle drags it down, always a risk for the less frequent bowler, and Hope can\u2019t get across to take enough off it. May have got a touch, but not enough to slow it sufficiently. Three more singles. An over worth 10. Bangladesh only need 5.6 an over, and are going at 6.95. Stirring stuff. 29th over: Bangladesh 200-3 (Shakib 87, Das 18) Top edge again from Shakib! Tries to pull Holder, and the angle of lift undoes him as it has so many batsmen. But the miscue flies high over the keeper and lands safely to drop and bounce for four. There\u2019s a third-umpire review when Liton Das dives in for a single, but he makes it on Shakib\u2019s call. Then his own single raises the 200. \u201cAbhijato\u2019s tie-breaker suggestion (over 20) is logical, but could be seen as overly bureaucratic,\u201d writes Edmund King. What a worldwide cricket audience surely wants to witness is heart-stoppingly unpredictable live action. How about taking a leaf out of football\u2019s book, but instead of a penalty shootout, asking members of the rival XIs to competitively perform a task against the clock? Exo-planet detection. Harpsichord tuning. If cricket wants to survive, its premier competition needs to embrace bold visions.\u201d Maybe one of those super-jock American college-boy trick-shot YouTube challenges, like trying to throw a Frisbee into a keg of beer from the back of a moving pick-up truck? 28th over: Bangladesh 192-3 (Shakib 81, Das 16) What was that! Excuse me, I\u2019ll have... hmm... a back-foot on-drive punch for four please. I\u2019m sorry sir, we can\u2019t make custom dishes. Shakib has played a wondrous shot to Gabriel. Who then loses his line and delivers a pie, outside leg and glanced for four. Deflated, Gabriel bowls a short ball that doesn\u2019t get up, just served on a plate on off stump. Shakib slaps the short-arm pull shot for four! And 13 from the over. The required rate is under 6 per over. 27th over: Bangladesh 179-3 (Shakib 68, Das 16) Oh, Shakib. He grows ruder and ruder. Faces up to Captain Jason Holder and just slaps him back down the ground for four. Length ball, full swing. They\u2019re going at 6.7 an over and they need 6.1 from here. An awful lot of runs still to get though. Nick Parish emails in. \u201cHearing about Russell\u2019s tumbles inevitably brings to my mind my favourite Terry Pratchett lines. Why are you kicking Andre Russell while he\u2019s down, Shakib al Hasan? Safest way, sir! Well, it was certainly something like that.\u201d 26th over: Bangladesh 172-3 (Shakib 62, Das 15) Gabriel offers yet another wide in this over, as Shakib and Das keep collecting singles.Only four players have done the 6000 runs and 200 wickets in one-dayers: Afridi, Jayasuriya, Kallis and now Shakib. And our man has done it faster than any of them, in 202 matches. \u201cGenuine question about NRR but don\u2019t laugh at me.\u201d George. I would never laugh at anyone from South Slough. \u201cIf a team get bowled out for 100 in 10 overs then is their run rate 10? Being bowled out for 100 in 10 overs would normally be considered quite poor but is it good for NRR purposes? If they were chasing 200 scored over 50 overs then would they lose the match but do well on NRR?\u201d In a fit of heroic honesty, I have to admit that I\u2019ve never been good at understanding net run rate, or Duckworth Lewis Stern. I just believe what the stattos tell me. But I\u2019m pretty sure the deal is that your run rate is spread across 50 overs if bowled out, or replicated across 50 if you\u2019re chasing. So bowled out for 100 in 10 overs is the same as not out making 100 in 50 overs. Run rate of 2 per over. But a winning chase of 100 in 10 overs would be treated as 500 in 50 overs, at 10 per over. Hence the huge gaps when NZ and West Indies bowled out Sri Lanka and Pakistan quickly, then chased quickly. 25th over: Bangladesh 166-3 (Shakib 60, Das 12) Liton Das keeps going well, knocking those ones. Russell tries the short ball to Shakib and beats his attempted uppercut. So he looks to finish the over with another one to Das, but this one clears the keeper for five wides. The second time that\u2019s happened in the innings, and it takes the wides total to 16. The extra delivery is a dot ball, and now comes the traditional Russell limp from the field after six overs. Both Brian Withington and my colleage Tom Bryant have been reminded by Cottrell of this gem from Roger Harper. 24th over: Bangladesh 157-3 (Shakib 58, Das 10) He\u2019s doing this nicely, Liton Das. Finding the singles when he gets on strike. Gabriel bowls a good over that only goes for four. There\u2019s another sniff of a run out but nothing eventuates from it. In honour of Cottrell\u2019s effort, here\u2019s our Joy of Six on the topic. 23rd over: Bangladesh 153-3 (Shakib 56, Das 8) Russell, bowling his fifth over. Has only fallen over once, as far as I can tell. No accurate count on how many knee-rubs he\u2019s done. His pace is down to the 85mph/135kph area. Comes around the wicket at Shakib to bounce him, but Shakib ducks, shimmies, tucks. Finally he takes on the bouncer and top edges it, miles into the air. Hope is running back towards the boundary but can\u2019t quite get there. Gabriel was running off the fence at fine leg and probably could have, but saw Hope coming and wanted to avoid a collision. The ball drops into the metre of space between them, like a high-platform circus artist into a washtub. Plop. Shakib survives. Gets a run. Russell bowls to Liton Das. Who tonks him through midwicket for four. Russell hits the deck again, and stays down a while. It\u2019s safer down there. 22nd over: Bangladesh 146-3 (Shakib 54, Das 3) Shakib is starting to live dangerously, perhaps feeling the pressure to keep the innings moving. He lofts to deep square leg and the ball bounces just short of Hetmyer. Later in the over he mistimes to chip over the bowler, landing safely. The singles come, but it\u2019s dicey stuff. He needs to bat long. 21st over: Bangladesh 141-3 (Shakib 51, Das 1) Finally Shakib gives up the bowling, and Liton Das eases a single to third man first ball. Not so easy later in the over, as he gets tangled up against Russell several balls in a row. The good news for Bangladesh is that Shakib\u2019s first single raises his fifty, meaning he now has 75, 64, 121, and 51* in this World Cup. 20th over: Bangladesh 138-3 (Shakib 49, Das 0) Liton Das is next in. Not much of a record to speak of. 24 years of age. He gets to watch from the far end as Shakib negotiates a tricky Cottrell over, before lofting a straight ball down the ground to beat Captain Jason Holder into the rope. Shakib pinches the strike from the final ball. Abhijato Sensarma has a proposal. \u201cWe can replace NRR as a tie-breaker in tournaments such as the World Cup with the team\u2019s official ODI rankings (on the day the qualification is locked for the event) serving as the judging point instead. If multiple teams end up with the same number of points, the higher ranked team gets the higher position on the tournament table. This serves a dual role since it is a fairer method than using the NRR, and contextualises bilateral games too! Your thoughts?\u201d I think the main issue is that the ranking uses results from two years ago, but would decide positions in a tournament. One of the joys of knockout play is that a team can shake off its past and emerge anew. So a side that has a brilliant run and trounces several good opponents could be ranked behind a side that scraped by each match, if they\u2019re level on points. 19th over: Bangladesh 133-3 (Shakib 44) Well, well, well. That over was, to be frank, an island of floating trash. Short, wide, two balls slapped away by Shakib to the fence, another so wide it was called by the umpire. But when the final ball goes the other side of the stumps, it draws the lucky dismissal. Thomas has had some impressive moments during this Cup, and that bit of good luck might fire him up to replicate them. There\u2019s your answer - no he can\u2019t. One of those nothing dismissals, to end a poor Thomas over, but the last ball drags down leg and Mushy gets a touch on it as he tries to glance. He throws his head back as the finger goes up, knowing that he\u2019s no chance of surviving a review. 18th over: Bangladesh 121-2 (Shakib 34, Mushfiqur 0) A stroke of luck and brilliance for the West Indies, and that\u2019s the kind of thing that can often derail a batting side. The vastly experienced Mushfiqur Rahim comes to the middle. Can he combine with Shakib as they\u2019ve done so many times? Incredible piece of fielding. Direct hit from Cottrell, with maybe a stump and a half to aim at around Tamim\u2019s body, and he does for Tamim by an inch. So often you see bowlers feigning to throw down the striker\u2019s stumps after fielding the ball. Normally it\u2019s just a charade. But this time Tamim had come a step down the wicket to play the ball, and another step to catch his balance. He dug out the full ball back to Cottrell, who picked it up fluidly and fired down the stumps in one move. Tamim was diving back but was short. Cottrell took maybe the catch of the tournament against Australia, and now this. Right up there with a couple of run-outs that Isuru Udana effected from his own bowling for Sri Lanka against Australia as well. 17th over: Bangladesh 119-1 (Tamim 47, Shakib 33) Bang! The over after drinks can often bring a wicket, but this time it brings the shot of the day. Thomas bounces Shakib, and the Bangladeshi cleans up on the pull shot, absolutely nailing it square for four. 16th over: Bangladesh 112-1 (Tamim 47, Shakib 27) Bangladesh take a breather with the drinks break approach, just knocking Gabriel around. There\u2019s no spin option for West Indies today aside from Gayle, who these days sends the ball down about as venomously as he walks to the crease to deliver it. \u201cO Jason, my Jason,\u201d is how Guy Hornsby prefaces his email - very good. \u201cLike Alastair, I\u2019m lucky enough to be going to Old Trafford on Saturday (and tomorrow) and I was looking forward to it being a win-or-bust for either team. Sadly Windies\u2019 promise has been deflated by injuries and form, and the nagging feeling they can\u2019t keep at full wallop for fifty overs at the moment. It\u2019s a real shame, given the youngsters in the squad. Surely though, as England have found, this World Cup is going to be about the squad because playing so many group games is attritional. I hope Roy &amp; Morgan heal, but it\u2019s no bad thing if Vince and Dawson play either. Thoughts, OBO faithful?\u201d It would be certainly great for those two on a personal level to get a game, and feel like they\u2019ve properly been part of the tournament. 15th over: Bangladesh 108-1 (Tamim 46, Shakib 24) Thomas finds some control: singles, and a two down fine towards third man. With that brace, Shakib brings up his 6000th one-day run. Eight centuries there at 37, and the small matter of 252 wickets as well with his spin. 14th over: Bangladesh 103-1 (Tamim 44, Shakib 21) Slip is gone, third man is back finer. He fields a couple of singles, before Gabriel drops short and Tamim batters him through cover with a flat bat. Boundary. The run rate is 7.34, and they only need 6.08 from here. A few more brisk overs could lay this out on a platter for Bangladesh. \u201cAt the risk of further inflating my already burgeoning anti-nationalist cred,\u201d writes Abhinav Dutta, who must have been up to something that we should probably know about, \u201cI have consistently been rooting for the West Indies for some time now and can\u2019t help but admire the Pakistanis when they get their act together. In spite of India boasting a really strong team I find them to be more more efficient than thrilling.\u201d \u201cBut with the Windies and Pakistanis, it\u2019s like a bipolar dimension. One moment magical and the very next farcical. I gather that sustained sporting success is not for me. Instead it\u2019s more of a masochistic exercise where I revel in the pain and anguish of watching teams flounder when they absolutely shouldn\u2019t. Have I told you I also support the Dutch football team and Tottenham?\u201d You\u2019re not alone in this regard, I imagine. Every league has its variant. 13th over: Bangladesh 96-1 (Tamim 38, Shakib 20) They\u2019re throwing plenty of wides at Bangladesh, these bowlers. Nine so far, as Oshane Thomas comes back to donate one more. He gets cut by Shakib, gorgeously, for four behind point. Wrists snapping down so the ball hit the ground and was no chance to be caught. Thomas comes back with a brilliant bouncer, really fast and at the helmet, which Shakib ducks. That sizzled through. One of the OBO favourites Brian Withington is on the email. \u201cMy neutral favourite today has to be Bangladesh, if only to see a side successfully chase a target above 250 in this WC. I noticed that pre-tournament Virat Kohli predicted that the scoring would not be as high as has become the norm in bilateral series. Not just a fairly useful batsman...\u201d Batsman, statesman, soothsayer? 12th over: Bangladesh 89-1 (Tamim 37, Shakib 15) Shannon Gabriel comes on. He can be very brisk when he wants to be, a pretty significant second-change bowler. But he starts with a a wide down leg. He does well, tying down Tamim for a few balls, but when Shakib gets a chance to swing, the batsman gets a high top edge down to a fine fine leg for four, leaping over the rope. Well bowled. Mind you, whenever I see the name Shannon Gabriel I just think of this guy. 11th over: Bangladesh 81-1 (Tamim 36, Shakib 9) I\u2019m pleased to see that Andre Russell has sorted the lettering on his shirt out. He was Russel in his first match, then Russell with an L that had obviously been hastily added from a sports store and didn\u2019t match the font or positioning when he played Australia, then back to Russel in his previous match after a page designer had obviously had a word, and how has a perfect matching letter. Maybe he borrowed an L from Nigel Lllllllllong? It doesn\u2019t help his bowling though, as Tamim decides this is the over to take him on. First a gorgeous drive on the up through cover. Four. Then a brace bunted over midwicket, unconvincing but effective. Finally a better pull shot, cruched squarer for four more. That with Shakib single to start the over makes 11. Zoom. 10th over: Bangladesh 70-1 (Tamim 26, Shakib 8) Four for Tamim! Perhaps he saw Shakib\u2019s swish and thought he needs to score himself to calm his teammate down? Either way, he throws the bat for the first time, driving square through point. The plan, if it was one, doesn\u2019t work, because when Shakib gets strike he flat-bats Holder from around the wicket for four, through long-off. Still two lefties in the middle. Short again and pulled again, but deep square keeps it to one. Not the last ball of the over though! Tamim pulls that finer, from the line of leg stump, and it bounces away with speed for four! The over costs 14. \u201cI\u2019m a New Zealander, and it\u2019s definitely Windies for me, Geoff. Me and my mate Stanley from Trinidad have tickets for next Saturday at Old Trafford, so ideally we want that match to be a sort of quarter-final. That would probably require NZ to lose to SA in the meantime, but I\u2019m willing to make that sacrifice\u2026\u201d Generous from Alistair Connor. 9th over: Bangladesh 56-1 (Tamim 17, Shakib 3) Right then. Soumya has got his team a reasonably fast start but has to make way. Over to Shakib al Hasan, who hasn\u2019t missed out with the bat yet in this World Cup. Bangladesh need him again today. He gets off the mark nicely, driving down the ground and getting back for three with the field up. Then Russell bounces him, and Shakib nails the pull so hard that Cottrell at mid-on falls over backwards in stopping it. Shakib tries a repeat next ball but meets fresh air. Gone! Soft from Soumya. The first ball of the over he got width from Russell and ramped it for six. The second was tighter, at his body, and he tried to steer to third man but Gayle spends about 40 overs of any innings at slip so he doesn\u2019t have to run. And that ball went straight to him, like a fielding drill. 8th over: Bangladesh 46-0 (Tamim 16, Soumya 23) Tamim is starting to get into his groove, taking a couple of singles from Holder. 7th over: Bangladesh 40-0 (Tamim 11, Soumya 22) Andre Russell will come on to try to take some initiative back. Remarkably he can walk. He\u2019s strapping himself up like Sigourney Weaver at the end of Aliens, adjusting a huge compression bandage that goes from shin to thigh under his maroon strides. But he\u2019s going to bowl a bit before grimacing endlessly and falling over several times and limping from the field and bowling another spell, if history is any guide. And he\u2019s quick, as he always is. Up around 90 miles an hour immediately. Just a couple of singles, as he packs his off side field and bowls outside off. \u201cBangladesh are my second team for this game, and for the entire tournament for that matter,\u201d emails Matthew Potter. \u201cGreat fans, a really likable (and in my opinion, underrated) team, with some seriously fun players to watch. For what it\u2019s worth, I think they\u2019ll just miss out and finish fifth, but I\u2019d at least like it to be dragged out. Let\u2019s hope for a Tamim or Shakib ton! (Partially for fantasy cricket purposes, I had a shocker yesterday opting for Imam over Sharma.)\u201d Ouch. On the other side of the argument, Adam Reed has compelling evidence: 6th over: Bangladesh 38-0 (Tamim 10, Soumya 21) Holder won\u2019t be targeted in the same way, as his awkward bounce from his epic height makes the batsmen take more care, just the odd single. He comes around the wicket to Tamim for the last couple of balls, and Tamim steps across to try a ramp which he misses. He wants a wide, but it passed over his leg stump I\u2019d think. Here\u2019s your preview for England\u2019s match tomorrow from Vic Marks. 5th over: Bangladesh 34-0 (Tamim 9, Soumya 19) Well, Tamim can afford to take his time if Soumya keeps doing this. SIX! First ball of Cottrell\u2019s over, slot ball, and Soumya imagines he\u2019s in the last ten overs rather than the first, and cleans it up over midwicket for half a dozen. That throws off Cottrell enough to drag the next down leg, and Soumya glances it for four. Then a single to third man. Simples. And well, Soumya is living in Cottrell\u2019s head at the moment. Tamim hands the strike back, so Cottrell tries a bouncer. The classic response. He gives it everything, too much in fact, and it launches over Shai Hope\u2019s head for five wides! A single follows, then a top save from Pooran at cover keeps the cost of the over to 18. 4th over: Bangladesh 16-0 (Tamim 8, Soumya 6) Holder continues, and Tamim is playing very cautiously here. Can be a dasher but he wants to get set. After Soumya takes a single first ball, Tamim blots out five. \u201cDumb American watching his first cricket world cup here,\u201d writes Jason Straight to get in ahead of all of you toffy Brits and we tactless Australians. \u201cAll these matches are neutral to me. I\u2019ll go for the Windies on this one to try to keep my hemisphere relevant. Loyalty is up for grabs, so sell me on your national side!\u201d Judging by their Twitter presence, I reckon Iceland Cricket is going cheap. 3rd over: Bangladesh 15-0 (Tamim 8, Soumya 6) Cottrell is bowling well here. A bit of swing, and he draws a mistimed single from Tamim, then a play and miss from Soumya. But when he drops short, Tamim pulls for a couple. \u201cGreetings from a warm and sunny Croatia. Am greatly enjoying the OBO \u2014 many thanks!\u201d No - thank you, Mark Jeffery. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to prejudice the outcome of this game, but there does seem to be an almost inevitable pattern here. Team A wins the toss, puts Team B in to bat, who then run up 320+. Team A run themselves into the ground trying to keep up, fall short, and end up losing by anything from 20-80 runs. Maybe teams should try batting first after all? All best and \u017eivjeli (cheers).\u201d \u017divjeli is one of my favourite philosophers. 2nd over: Bangladesh 11-0 (Tamim 5, Soumya 5) Second over, and it\u2019s time for Captain Jason Holder. I was fortunate enough to do some commentary stints on the wireless with Curtly Ambrose in the West Indies-Australia game at Trent Bridge, and the best thing about him is that he uses \u201cCaptain Jason Holder\u201d every time he mentions the player, as though it were a military title. Thus, I can\u2019t think of Holder as Holder anymore. CJH to his friends. Captain Jason Holder bowls wide to Soumya, who slices riskily away with third man pounding around the boundary rope. But it lands wide of him for a single. Two left-handers batting. CJH then swings the ball into Tamim, hitting him almost on the back hip, going well over the stumps. Tamim manages a run dabbing to point, then Soumya launches into a lofted drive over cover. It\u2019s a clunky one, not timed at all, but there\u2019s no one out there so it eventually dribbles for four. 1st over: Bangladesh 5-0 (Tamim 4, Soumya 0) And we\u2019re away. Sheldon Cottrell, star of the mystifyingly popular television program The Big Bang Theory, will open the bowling for West Indies. Gets wided for a bouncer, so he doesn\u2019t continue with that option. Hangs most of his over across the left-handed Tamim, who waits patiently until the fifth ball, a touch fuller, which gets the treatment through cover. All hands and eye, no feet. With all the rain around, and net run rate being a big talking point at this World Cup, here\u2019s an interesting series of musings from an internet gentleman. Neutral cricket watchers, who is your second team for this match? And why? As always, you can email me via geoff.lemon@theguardian.com, or find me on the old Twitter machine. Here\u2019s one of our stable nailing his red and green colours to the mast early. Thanks Ashers. Well, that was fun. Some brilliant fielding from Bangladesh, not always the cleanest stops but effective ones as they hurled themselves around the field. Both of these teams offer a lot in the way of entertainment, and they\u2019re both playing to keep themselves in this World Cup. I like Bangladesh as a batting side when they click: Tamim, Soumya, Shakib, Mushfiq, Mahmudullah: plenty of quality. So they can do this, but teams defending 300 always start with a big advantage. Right, that\u2019s it from me. Geoff Lemon will be with you very shortly for Bangladesh\u2019s chase. At one point it seemed West Indies might only scramble to 270-odd. Then, briefly, 350 seemed likely. So perhaps somewhere between the two is a fair result. 50th over: West Indies 321-7 (Thomas 5, Bravo 19) Shaifuddin takes the final over and he also starts with a wide but, unlike Mustafizur, he follows it up with another a couple of balls later \u2026 and another. It\u2019s all entirely unnecessary \u2013 Thomas is the man on strike. A single puts Bravo on strike and he heaves over midwicket for six. Ten off the over and still three balls to go. Couple of dots, then a yorker does for Bravo. A strange, strange final couple of overs to complete a very strange innings. 49th over: West Indies 311-7 (Thomas 5, Bravo 13) Mustafizur comes in to send down the penultimate over and starts off with a wide but he improves from that point. Then we have a baffling moment \u2013 Thomas plays and misses, then absent mindedly swings his bat back up and over the stumps, then down on to the bails. It\u2019s incredibly clumsy but not out as he\u2019d finished playing his shot. Odd moment. 48th over: West Indies 305-7 (Thomas 1, Bravo 12) This has been a really fascinating contest, one that has ebbed and flowed more than just about any ODI innings I can remember (though, to be honest, my memory isn\u2019t all that great). Bravo finally finds his mojo and a boundary \u2013 six off the last over long on. 47th over: West Indies 297-7 (Thomas 0, Bravo 6) Since Holder\u2019s wicket \u2013 20 balls, 15 runs. Mustafizurhas bowled beautifully here, mixing up his pace and keeping the batsmen to three singles from the first five balls. From the last Hope, increasingly becalmed, shuffles to the off and looks to flick over square leg but can only pick out the man in the deep. 46th over: West Indies 294-6 (Hope 95, Bravo 4) Shaifuddin again and again this pair struggle to find the rope. Five singles and a couple from the last is all the batsmen get. \u201cMy first cat was ginger too, named after (Kit) Marlowe,\u201d writes John Starbuck. \u201cHis principle role was to lie on my legs whilst I was stretched out watching Test matches on TV. That was back in the \u201870s though. His pals and successors have been variously fascinated by cricket, some of them endeavouring to chase and catch the ball as it rolled towards the boundary. Not so much as for snooker though.\u201d 45th over: West Indies 288-6 (Hope 91, Bravo 2) Holder and Hetmyer combined for 83 from 41. Handy. Mehidy returns with his off spin and keeps things nice and quiet \u2013 single, dot, single, single, single, single. Five from the over. 44th over: West Indies 283-6 (Hope 88, Bravo 0) Darren Bravo finally makes it to the crease. Holder, who is batting wonderfully, clonks Shaifuddin down the ground for four more. He goes to 33 from 14. And, of course, he then skies one into the deep for Mamudullah to pouch. 43rd over: West Indies 274-5 (Hope 86, Holder 27) Mashrafe brings himself back into the attack and Holder smites him into the stands at long on. He goes for it again from the next but toe-ends it a little \u2013 Tamim, diving in, watches the ball bounce under his hands and disappear for four. \u201cMany thanks for the magnificent pic of Brian, the Somerset cat,\u201d writes Robert Wilson. \u201cFirst off, way to go unapologetic ginge. Plus great name. I had a cat called Colin and a grumpy life-ruiner named Norman but I think Brian shades it just for how melancholy it would sound shouted reproachfully across the chilly wastes of an empty sports stadium as a winter evening draws in. The best bit is the expression though. If you give a single minute to inspecting the physiognomy of that redoubtable animal, it quickly becomes clear that this is a cat that really hates cricket. It\u2019s magnificent.\u201d 42nd over: West Indies 261-5 (Hope 84, Holder 16) Who knows where we go from here. The tide just keeps turning. Hope drives sweetly for one, Holder lofts for two. The West Indies captain pulls hard for four from the last but this has been an excellent return from Mustafizur, whose figures for the 40th and 42nd over read 2-0-10-2. 41st over: West Indies 254-5 (Hope 83, Holder 10) Holder\u2019s turn to have them ducking in the stands \u2013 a huge slog-sweep off the returning Shakib that disappears into the crowd. He follows that up with a glorious orthodox cover drive for four. Eleven from the over. 40th over: West Indies 243-5 (Hope 82, Holder 0) Well that changes the tone to some extent! Three runs and two wickets from that over. Jason Holder comes out to join Hope, with Bravo \u2013 in the side as an extra batsman \u2013 sliding down the order. Fair to say Bangladesh needed that. And they\u2019ve got another! A gorgeous delivery from the Fiz, moving across Russell and finding the edge. Hetmyer goes to his 50 off just 25 balls, but that\u2019s yer lot. A skew steeples into the Somerset sky and Tamim takes a tricky tumbling catch in the deep. 39th over: West Indies 240-3 (Hope 81, Hetmyer 49) Mehidy keeps this pair to a series of six singles, which Bangladesh will certainly take at this stage. 38th over: West Indies 234-3 (Hope 78, Hetmyer 46) Hetmyer crashes Mosaddek for another boundary through backward point, pulls for a couple, then heaves over cow corner for six! He moves on to 44 from 18, already a game-changing knock. Fourteen from the first three but Mosaddek responds well \u2013 a couple of dots then a scampered two. 37th over: West Indies 220-3 (Hope 78, Hetmyer 32) The return of the pace bowlers really hasn\u2019t worked, so Bangladesh opt to take a bit of heat off the ball and Mehidy comes back into the attack. The now helmet-free Hetmyer responds with another cracker \u2013 a beautiful back-foot off drive placed precisely for four. 36th over: West Indies 210-3 (Hope 74, Hetmyer 26) Shaifuddin steams in once more with Bangladesh under a bit of pressure for pretty much the first time in the match. PLONK! Hetmyer hooks hard for a big six at backward point. And from the last there\u2019s an even bigger hit \u2013 a gigantic slog sweep that has them running for cover on Taunton high street. Fifteen off the over and Hetmyer moves on to 26 from 12. 35th over: West Indies 193-3 (Hope 69, Hetmyer 14) The left-arm-round Mustafizur returns to the attack. And Hope welcomes him by launching him flat-batted over long off for six! What a shot that was. And he follows it up with a hook for four more. Mustafizur \u2013 a touch irked \u2013 then sends down a bouncer that flies over batsman and keeper and zips away for five wides. Yeesh \u2013 he follows that with another wide: 16 off the over, three balls still to go. A dot follows then there\u2019s more chaos \u2013 the batsmen looking at each other in the middle of the pitch as short third man takes aim at the vacant stumps \u2026 and misses. Two off the last and an over Mustafizur will not want to hear from ever again. 34th over: West Indies 174-3 (Hope 58, Hetmyer 12) Hetmyer means business here \u2013 he thunks Shaifuddin to cow corner for four. Eight off the over. 33rd over: West Indies 166-3 (Hope 55, Hetmyer 7) Things are in danger of unravelling here for West Indies \u2013 both times they\u2019ve looked to really accelerate they\u2019ve lost a wicket. Hetmyer looks to pepper the spectators straight away, slog-sweeping away for a couple, then smartly sweeping in more orthordox fashion for four. More, more, more from Shakib. Out, out, out goes Pooran! He slogs hard but can\u2019t get a clean hit on Shakib and can only launch the ball to long on. 32nd over: West Indies 158-2 (Hope 54, Pooran 25) Shaifuddin (3-1-12-1) returns and has Pooran playing and missing wildly outside off. A couple of singles later, he repeats the trick off the last. An excellent return \u2013 just two off the over and that run rates drops below five again. 31st over: West Indies 156-2 (Hope 53, Pooran 24) The West Indies run rate creeps above five-an-over for the first time \u2013 they\u2019ll be eyeing 300, though it\u2019s far from a certainty. Shakib again restricts the batsmen to singles, five of them this time. 30th over: West Indies 151-2 (Hope 51, Pooran 21) Pooran is ready to go. He launches Mehidy down the ground for a couple but finds the sweet spot next ball, back over the bowler\u2019s head for a huge six. New ball required. But a good response from the bowler \u2013 three dots and a single follow that huge hit. \u201cIf E and L wander off, there could be HANDBAGS,\u201d frets Nick Way. 29th over: West Indies 141-2 (Hope 51, Pooran 12) Shakib rattles through an over so quickly I barely noticed it happened. Just two from it. 28th over: West Indies 139-2 (Hope 50, Pooran 10) Mehidy returns. Hope skips down the wicket and clunks a drive down the ground for two, then a skittered single takes Hope to his half century. Pooran joins the fun, thrashing low through point for four more. Nine from the over. 27th over: West Indies 130-2 (Hope 47, Pooran 5) Shakib continues and keeps the batsmen to just a single. 26th over: West Indies 129-2 (Hope 46, Pooran 5) There\u2019s certainly more intent about West Indies now. Mosaddek offers a bit of width for just about the first time and Pooran gets off the mark with a firm cut for four. 25th over: West Indies 122-2 (Hope 44, Pooran 0) Pooran plays and misses at his first delivery and Shakib follows up his wicket with three dots. WHUMP! Lewis gets on one knee and slog-sweeps Shakib into the square-leg stands. The world\u2019s No 1 all-rounder is struggling so far. And, pretty much as I\u2019m typing that, he gets his man. Lewis is aiming for the stands again but this time skews to long on. 24th over: West Indies 114-1 (Hope 44, Lewis 62) Mosaddek rattles through another \u2013 six fuss-free singles off it. 23rd over: West Indies 108-1 (Hope 41, Lewis 59) Lewis brings up his half-century (from 58 balls) with a neat push down the ground for a single. He\u2019s batted nicely since a slightly scrappy start. Hope then cuts for three, a brilliant bit of fielding on the rope forcing the batsmen to panic-scamper the third. Another single brings up the 100 for the Windies and back to back boundaries for Lewis \u2013 the first swept fine, the second slammed uppishly through backward point \u2013 mean 14 from the over and a bit of much-needed acceleration. 22nd over: West Indies 94-1 (Hope 37, Lewis 49) There\u2019s a bit of a retro feel about this at the moment \u2013 only two boundaries since the 13th over. And four singles off this latest effort from Mosaddek. 21st over: West Indies 90-1 (Hope 35, Lewis 47) Shakib Al Hasan into the attack for the first time today, left-arm round. Nudge and nurdle is the order of the day \u2013 four singles in total. \u201cIf only the \u2018L\u2019 and \u2018S letter-shirt people wandered off, the others could end up spelling HEADBANG,\u201d notes Mac Millings. \u201cBut if everyone stays and switches seats, we might get DANGLEBASH, or BLADEGNASH, both of which sound pretty painful. 20th over: West Indies 86-1 (Hope 33, Lewis 45) Mosaddek again. Hope drives sumptuously for two (Mahmudullah making a fine stop; Hope thought it had gone \u2013 he stood and admired it for a few seconds before begrudgingly setting off for the run). 19th over: West Indies 82-1 (Hope 30, Lewis 44) Mustafizur continues and Lewis misses out as he strays to leg, Shaifuddin\u2019s fine fielding at fine leg preventing the boundary. But there\u2019s nothing he can do with this \u2013 an attempted bouncer his helped on its way by Lewis who this time does find the rope. 18th over: West Indies 75-1 (Hope 28, Lewis 39) More spin \u2013 Mosaddek, obviously recovered from his knock, into the attack. A fine bit of fielding from Shakib at square leg denies Hope a certain boundary and after just five dots there is just a single off the last. 17th over: West Indies 74-1 (Hope 27, Lewis 39) West Indies have rebuilt pretty well after that ropey start. You wouldn\u2019t quite say they\u2019re on top yet but they\u2019re definitely in the game. Tidy stuff from Mustafizur here, keeping the batsmen to a single apiece. 16th over: West Indies 72-1 (Hope 26, Lewis 38) Lewis shovels Mehidy through the off-side for a couple. Mossadek fields on the boundary and seems to have done himself a mischief, so they take drinks while he gets some treatment. He goes off and after the break Hope rocks back and punches through the covers for four. 15th over: West Indies 64-1 (Hope 21, Lewis 35) Mustafizur replaces Mortaza, who can go and soak his aching bones for a while. Is Shai Hope\u2019s off-drive the most aesthetically pleasing shot in world cricket at the moment? It\u2019s definitely up there. And he unfurls a corker here (for one). 14th over: West Indies 58-1 (Hope 17, Lewis 35) The Bangladeshi fans seem to be out in force in Taunton \u2013 we get a nice shot of 10 fans, each with one letter of the country\u2019s name on their shirts. You\u2019ve got to be organised with that sort of thing, particularly as the day wears on. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d risk it: all it takes is for a couple of people to wander off at some point and a few people to switch seats and before you know it you\u2019re sat in a row with LASAGNE or GLANDES on your T-shirts. Mehidy twirls through another over, giving up only ones and twos. 13th over: West Indies 53-1 (Hope 15, Lewis 32) \u201cRe: Animal mascots,\u201d begins Charles Montague. \u201cThe Oz badge features two animals that are very much alive and kicking (and punching) in the Australian wild.\u201d Mashrafe continues into his seventh over. Perhaps once those poor old knees get mobile it\u2019s best to keep them moving. He drops a touch short and Lewis is on to it like a shot, pulling hard for a one-bounce four to cow corner. 12th over: West Indies 45-1 (Hope 14, Lewis 26) Mehidy continues and Lewis benefits from a misfield to pinch a single. But it\u2019s more tight stuff from the spinner. 11th over: West Indies 42-1 (Hope 12, Lewis 24) That is apparently the lowest score after 10 overs in the tournament so far, testament to an excellent Bangladesh bowling performance. Lewis has had enough of it \u2013 he slams Mortaza over wide long on for six to get the juices flowing. 10th over: West Indies 32-1 (Hope 12, Lewis 17) Mehidy, the off-spinner, into the attack. Tidy stuff from the youngster \u2013 just the two singles off the over. West Indies haven\u2019t got going at all yet. 9th over: West Indies 30-1 (Hope 11, Lewis 16) Mortaza (4-1-8-0) continues and by the end of the over he has figures of 5-1-9-0. 8th over: West Indies 29-1 (Hope 11, Lewis 15) The first bowling change of the day: Mustafizur comes into the attack. He\u2019s a little too straight throughout, though, and the batsmen are able to tickle him away for a few singles before he overcompensates and Hope is able to punch a short wide one through the covers for four. And here\u2019s the full story on that Jason Roy news: 7th over: West Indies 21-1 (Hope 6, Lewis 13) Mortaza maintains his stranglehold \u2013 tight line and length giving up just three singles. A bit of news from elsehwere: the ECB has confirmed England\u2019s Jason Roy has a hamstring tear and will miss at least two matches. 6th over: West Indies 18-1 (Hope 5, Lewis 11) Yes, this has been an excellent start for Bangladesh. It\u2019s always been an excellent start for Bangladesh. No one ever said it was an excellent start for Sri Lanka. Especially not in the fourth over. No sirree. Don\u2019t know where you got that from. Fake news, I reckon. Hope pirouette-pulls beautifully for four to get off the mark. And Lewis joins the fun later in the over \u2013 Shaifuddin dropping short and offering the sort of width the West Indies opener loves \u2013 four more. Then an escape \u2013 Lewis edging with soft hands just short of slip. 5th over: West Indies 8-1 (Hope 0, Lewis 6) Mortaza continues to trundle in and hit a nice length. Lewis blocks to wide of mid off for a quick single. And a leg bye means just two off the over. 4th over: West Indies 6-1 (Hope 0, Lewis 5) So this has become an excellent start for Bangladesh. Gayle looked a little dozy, a little sluggish, a little like he\u2019d rather be sat on the settee at home \u2013 basically a little like most people on a Monday morning. A wicket maiden for Shaifuddin and only two scoring shots from the Windies so far. Back to Gayle then, who has now gone 12 balls without getting off the mark. And he\u2019s not going to get off the mark! His 13th delivery tempts him into a tentative, awkward push outside off and the ball just carries through to the keeper. 3rd over: West Indies 6-0 (Gayle 0, Lewis 5) A big play-and-miss from Lewis as Mortaza finds some movement off the pitch but he connects with the next \u2013 short and wide from the bowler and thunked through point for four. An inside edge then rattles into the pads and trickles wide of the off stump. 2nd over: West Indies 2-0 (Gayle 0, Lewis 1) Shaifuddin with the new ball at the River End. Lewis pushes his first ball into the off to get us under way and next up Shaifuddin sends down a leg-side wide but Gayle is taking his time to settle in. He\u2019s now seen out seven eight nine 10 11 dots. 1st over: West Indies 0-0 (Gayle 0, Lewis 0) Mashrafe Mortaza opens the bowling, with Chris Gayle coiled at the striker\u2019s end. The Bangladesh captain squares Gayle up with his second ball and, despite offering the batsman a bit of width later in the over, he starts off with a maiden. \u201cIs Bangladesh the only cricketing nation sporting an animal mascot which still roams (bits of) its landscape?\u201d wonders Marting Wright. \u201cLions in Whipsnade don\u2019t count.\u201d Anthemwatch: two of the jauntier anthems on the international circuit these. Amar Sonar Bangla lasts about an hour and a half but doesn\u2019t really outstay it\u2019s welcome as it\u2019s such a nice tune. And I\u2019m not a massive fan of \u201cRally Round the West Indies\u201d but it\u2019s still better than most. Out come the teams. Amusingly, the young mascot seems to be dragging Chris Gayle out there. A bit of pre-match reading: here\u2019s Moeen Ali\u2019s latest column for us: West Indies: Gayle, Lewis, Hope, Pooran, Bravo, Hetmyer, Holder, Russell, Cottrell, Thomas, Gabriel. Bangladesh: Tamim, Soumya, Shakib, Mushfiqur, Litton, Mahmudullah, Mosaddek, Shaifuddin, Mehidy, Mashrafe, Mustafizur. Bangladesh\u2019s Mashrafe Mortaza wins the toss and is going to have a bowl. Bangladesh can feel a little hard-done-by so far in this tournament. They thumped South Africa and got very close against New Zealand before falling short against England \u2013 and if you wanted one of your games rained off, you wouldn\u2019t choose the one against Sri Lanka. I make them favourites today. Morning all. We\u2019re pretty much slap-bang at the halfway point of the group stage and this feels like a must-win for both sides if either are to maintain realistic hopes of making the semi-finals. The good news from Taunton is that for the first time since wooly mammoths were roaming the Somerset wilds, there\u2019s no rain forecast. We should \u2013 should \u2013 be delay-free for the duration.",

      "bodyText": "Hong Kong\u2019s police chief has admitted his officers had sought to arrest wounded demonstrators in hospitals, and acknowledged that only a \u201cminority\u201d had been violent and would face rioting charges. The police commissioner, Stephen Lo Wai-Chung, said officers had followed procedure when he was asked about reports that police used medical records to search hospitals for protesters. \u201cWhenever there are people delivered to the emergency ward, there is a responsibility for police to check whether it is an accident, natural sickness, or [if they were] involved in certain crimes,\u201d he said.\u201cThe allegation that we are going to hospitals, chasing people to disturb their treatment, I disagree.\u201d As the city\u2019s crisis entered its second week, protesters kept up pressure on Chief Executive Carrie Lam by re-occupying streets outside the shuttered legislature building and welcoming the city\u2019s most prominent political activist, Joshua Wong, on his release from jail. Hong Kong was electrified by a record march on Sunday, the third major demonstration in a week. Organisers claimed that nearly 2 million people turned out to oppose an extradition law pushed by Lam, called for her resignation, condemned police brutality against protesters and demanded they drop any rioting charges. The police commissioner, Stephen Lo Wai-Chung, refused to apologise for police use of teargas, rubber bullets and truncheons, saying their hand was forced when \u201ca minority\u201d turned to violence on Wednesday. He claimed police use of riot charges for some of those arrested over the showdown, had been misunderstood, however. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying that the public gathering on that day was a riot,\u201d Lo told a late night press conference. \u201cSome protesters used violence, that\u2019s why the situation was a riot. As for other peaceful protesters \u2026 they need not worry about the riot crime.\u201d Of 32 people arrested over the demonstrations so far, only five have been charged with rioting offences, he said. The legal designation of \u201criot\u201d has been a focus of concerns because it means protesters face heavier sentences. The response was unlikely to satisfy protesters who marched under slogans including \u201cthey are kids, not rioters\u201d and have been emboldened by the government\u2019s unexpected climbdown over the extradition bill. The crowds on Monday were tiny by comparison to Sunday, but participants remained committed. \u201cThis is Hong Kong\u2019s future at stake, it\u2019s really important,\u201d said one 29-year-old protester, who had skipped work to attend. He said his boss knew where he was, but asked not to be named because he feared arrest after roundups including hospital detentions. The timing of Wong\u2019s release on Monday after serving half of a two-month sentence on a contempt charge was coincidental. He rose to prominence during the 2014 pro-democracy \u201cumbrella movement\u201d, and had been finishing a sentence for his role in those protests when Hong Kongers took to the streets again. He wasted no time adding his name to the cause. When he arrived at the protest site in the early afternoon, he told reporters he was in the same clothes he wore when he was jailed, not even taking time to return home and wash or change. \u201c[The protests] showed the spirit and dignity of the Hong Kong people,\u201d Wong said. He urged her to withdraw the controversial law and step down. Sunday was the largest demonstration in Hong Kong\u2019s history and the potent display of public anger pushed Lam to apologise for her handling of the crisis in a statement, but she did not respond to demonstrators\u2019 key demands. Many have sworn they will not rest until she goes. \u201cI know this is going to be a serious fight, but I think it is somehow necessary,\u201d said a 22-year-old student who gave his name as Draven. \u201cWe all know that just one protest is not going to have any long-term impact; we have to go further to let the government know what we need.\u201d That includes bringing an end to Lam\u2019s leadership, he said. China, which handpicked Lam for the job, has stood by her publicly. The foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Monday she had the government\u2019s support. But analysts and opposition politicians said her campaign to force through a much-criticised bill, and her repeated misreading of the public mood as Hong Kong\u2019s people rose up against it, had fatally undermined her authority. \u201cHer government cannot be an effective government, and will have much, much, much difficulties to carry on,\u201d the Democratic party legislator James To told the government-funded broadcaster RTHK. The extradition law at the heart of the crisis would allow both residents and visitors to be sent to China for trial in opaque, communist-controlled courts, which many in Hong Kong fear would prove a devastating blow to their economy and society. The city functions as a regional business and trade hub, protected from China by its judicial \u201cfirewall\u201d.

But there are notable gaps and silences.</p> <p>The Hong Kong government has not said that it is shelving the controversial bill allowing extradition to the mainland \u2013 only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/15/hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-extradition-bill-delay-protests-china\" title=\"\">suspending it</a>, following the protests. As remarkable as Saturday\u2019s U-turn was, that uncertainty brought still more people out the next day: 2 million, or more than one in four residents, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/17/hong-kong-protests-carrie-lam-public-rejects-apology-strike-police\" title=\"\">claimed the organisers</a>. Beijing is unlikely to want to risk another standoff in the immediate future. But previously apolitical sections of Hong Kong society have been radicalised by the threat and are making sure they are heard. They see the separation of the legal systems as the last line of defence for rights that they once took for granted.</p> <p>Yet protesters have not \u2013 with some striking exceptions \u2013 targeted Beijing. Though the fight is to protect the region as the Communist party dismantles its freedoms, signs have demanded the resignation of Carrie Lam, the chief executive trying to ram it through, instead of complaining about her boss, Xi Jinping. The retreat is a striking setback for China\u2019s most powerful leader in decades. But, as opponents of the bill are aware, he might not have felt it possible had demonstrations focused on Beijing.</p> <p>Ms Lam has not acknowledged a single problem with the bill or heavy-handed policing, including the use of teargas and rubber bullets. She has shown spectacular political ineptitude and proved so tone-deaf that her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/17/hong-kong-protests-carrie-lam-public-rejects-apology-strike-police\" title=\"\">apology angered protesters</a> further. But Beijing would probably regard her departure now as a loss of face for itself.</p> <p>With all eyes upon the city\u2019s streets, one key factor in this dispute has been little mentioned: money. The bill would allow mainland-initiated asset freezes, sending a chill through Hong Kong\u2019s powerful and generally pro-Beijing business community. Tycoons have reportedly begun to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-extradition-capitalflight-ex/exclusive-hong-kong-tycoons-start-moving-assets-offshore-as-fears-rise-over-new-extradition-law-idUSKCN1TF1DZ\" title=\"\">move assets offshore</a>. The large foreign business community is equally appalled. If their staff and assets become subject to Beijing\u2019s rules, why not headquarter in Singapore instead?</p> <p>Beijing has not, until now, shown much concern for the potential economic impact of Hong Kong\u2019s political struggle.

      "bodyText": "When hundreds of thousands of people have marched in what appeared to be the biggest protest in Hong Kong\u2019s history, their chants of anger ringing from the streets, it sounds perverse to draw attention to what has not been said. But there are notable gaps and silences. The Hong Kong government has not said that it is shelving the controversial bill allowing extradition to the mainland \u2013 only suspending it, following the protests. As remarkable as Saturday\u2019s U-turn was, that uncertainty brought still more people out the next day: 2 million, or more than one in four residents, claimed the organisers. Beijing is unlikely to want to risk another standoff in the immediate future. But previously apolitical sections of Hong Kong society have been radicalised by the threat and are making sure they are heard. They see the separation of the legal systems as the last line of defence for rights that they once took for granted. Yet protesters have not \u2013 with some striking exceptions \u2013 targeted Beijing. Though the fight is to protect the region as the Communist party dismantles its freedoms, signs have demanded the resignation of Carrie Lam, the chief executive trying to ram it through, instead of complaining about her boss, Xi Jinping. The retreat is a striking setback for China\u2019s most powerful leader in decades. But, as opponents of the bill are aware, he might not have felt it possible had demonstrations focused on Beijing. Ms Lam has not acknowledged a single problem with the bill or heavy-handed policing, including the use of teargas and rubber bullets. She has shown spectacular political ineptitude and proved so tone-deaf that her apology angered protesters further. But Beijing would probably regard her departure now as a loss of face for itself. With all eyes upon the city\u2019s streets, one key factor in this dispute has been little mentioned: money. The bill would allow mainland-initiated asset freezes, sending a chill through Hong Kong\u2019s powerful and generally pro-Beijing business community. Tycoons have reportedly begun to move assets offshore. The large foreign business community is equally appalled. If their staff and assets become subject to Beijing\u2019s rules, why not headquarter in Singapore instead? Beijing has not, until now, shown much concern for the potential economic impact of Hong Kong\u2019s political struggle. But the region\u2019s economy is intertwined with that of the southern Chinese mainland, and \u2013 with the trade war starting to hit home \u2013 leaders may well feel the need to tread more cautiously. The bipartisan support in the US Congress for a bill threatening Hong Kong\u2019s status as a special trading partner will have underscored the risks. How events play out will depend upon Mr Xi\u2019s rigidity or pragmatism as well as the determination and astuteness of those in Hong Kong. The extradition bill is a clear and open threat to the region\u2019s way of life. But other issues are covert and gradual, such as the unlawful abductions which have already taken place, the cowing of the press, and the pursuit of punitive sentences for protesters as a warning.

Such is politics.</p> <p>The winner will stand against Jeremy Corbyn. We all know Corbyn is very concerned about having more women in the Labour leadership. But not concerned enough to actually have many. Emily Thornberry couldn\u2019t be called on to do PMQs as she made the terrible faux pas of telling the truth about the European elections. In the US, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden feel entitled enough to lead despite all the great Democrat women who are running against them.</p> <p>For the past few years, in every chat I have had with a senior Labour person, they have acknowledged that the party needs a female leader. The Tories have done it twice. Maybe the Lib Dems will appoint Jo Swinson. But Labour has a shortage of women, not on its benches but in its inner circle. This inner circle includes the same people who struggle to deal effectively with sexual harassment cases and antisemitism, so it\u2019s understandable they would find it challenging to track down a woman \u2013 any woman! \u2013 with the intellectual depth and mental agility of the present leader.</p> <p>We keep being told politics is broken, and that we are entering the era of a multi-party system. Brexit represents the great divide, while the climate emergency overshadows everything. As always, there is something more important in the air for Labour than gender representation. Strong voices, from Stella Creasy to Jess Phillips, are not loyal enough to a leader who himself was never loyal. A suitable female pet has to be groomed or the revolution may stall.</p> <p>Or it has already. When there is a general election involving a Tory leader who has treated the women in his life abominably, it would be progress at least if he could be challenged by a woman.</p> <p>But I know that\u2019s a silly dream.</p> <p>\u2022Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "On Sunday night, I may have watched some men in suits talking nonsense. I may have been in the pub. I may have fallen asleep because the Tory-leadership candidate who is actually going to win couldn\u2019t be arsed to turn up. Such is power. Some of these guys aren\u2019t recognisable to me. Such is politics. The winner will stand against Jeremy Corbyn. We all know Corbyn is very concerned about having more women in the Labour leadership. But not concerned enough to actually have many. Emily Thornberry couldn\u2019t be called on to do PMQs as she made the terrible faux pas of telling the truth about the European elections. In the US, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden feel entitled enough to lead despite all the great Democrat women who are running against them. For the past few years, in every chat I have had with a senior Labour person, they have acknowledged that the party needs a female leader. The Tories have done it twice. Maybe the Lib Dems will appoint Jo Swinson. But Labour has a shortage of women, not on its benches but in its inner circle. This inner circle includes the same people who struggle to deal effectively with sexual harassment cases and antisemitism, so it\u2019s understandable they would find it challenging to track down a woman \u2013 any woman! \u2013 with the intellectual depth and mental agility of the present leader. We keep being told politics is broken, and that we are entering the era of a multi-party system. Brexit represents the great divide, while the climate emergency overshadows everything. As always, there is something more important in the air for Labour than gender representation. Strong voices, from Stella Creasy to Jess Phillips, are not loyal enough to a leader who himself was never loyal. A suitable female pet has to be groomed or the revolution may stall. Or it has already. When there is a general election involving a Tory leader who has treated the women in his life abominably, it would be progress at least if he could be challenged by a woman. But I know that\u2019s a silly dream. \u2022Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "A damning report by the UN on its own conduct in Myanmar has condemned the organisation\u2019s \u201cobviously dysfunctional performance\u201d over the past decade and concluded there was a systemic failure. The report, seen by the Guardian before publication, was commissioned by the secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, after accusations that the UN system ignored warning signs of escalating violence before an alleged genocide of Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya minority. The report, written by a Guatemalan former foreign minister, Gert Rosenthal, concludes there were various damaging failures, including competing strategies between agencies, a \u201cculture of mistrust\u201d in relations with Myanmar\u2019s government and \u201cmixed and incomplete signals coming from the field\u201d. The report is due to be made public this week. \u201cWithout question, serious errors were committed and opportunities were lost in the UN system following a fragmented strategy rather than a common plan of action,\u201d Rosenthal writes. \u201cThe overall responsibility was of a collective nature; in other words it can truly be characterised as a systemic failure of the United Nations.\u201d Myanmar\u2019s military launched a crackdown on the Rohingya in Rakhine state in August 2017. The violence, which the UN described as ethnic cleansing and possible genocide, included the killing of thousands of people, the rape of women and children and the razing of villages. More than 700,000 Rohingya fled across the border to Bangladesh. Rosenthal\u2019s report emphasises the damaging impact of competing strategies between some UN agencies and individuals. The polarisation of approaches between quiet diplomacy with the Myanmar government and public condemnation of escalating human rights abuses became more magnified as the situation in Rahkine worsened, the report says. \u201cEven at the highest level of the organisation there was no common strategy,\u201d Rosenthal writes. As a result, the UN system was \u201crelatively impotent to effectively work with the authorities of Myanmar to reverse the negative trends in the area of human rights\u201d. The situation descended into \u201cunseemly fighting\u201d where \u201cthose that promote constructive engagement sometimes incur the wrath of those who favour a more robust advocacy role and vice versa,\u201d the report says. \u201cOne can only speculate that [former] secretary general Ban Ki-Moon was either unwilling or unable to arbitrate a common stance between these two competing perspectives.\u201d Rosenthal emphasises that he did not investigate particular individuals, but his report addresses the controversial actions of the former resident coordinator for Myanmar, Renata Lok-Dessallien, who was accused of downplaying concerns about worsening abuses against the Rohingya to further her development agenda. Rosenthal\u2019s findings confirm what many had claimed, that \u201cthere appear to have been instances of deliberately de-dramatising events in reports prepared by the resident coordinator\u201d. His report says Lok-Dessallien was brought in to push forward a development agenda, and she \u201csuddenly found herself embroiled in a situation with strong political overtones,\u201d which was not her area of expertise. Despite pleas for assistance, Lok-Dessallien was \u201cunderstaffed and without clear instructions from headquarters\u201d. Rosenthal writes that Myanmar\u2019s government \u201cappeared to exploit the diverse narratives that they were hearing from different UN entities to play one against another\u201d and forward its own agenda. This was reiterated by a UN source in Myanmar who described the relationship with the UN and the government as unchanged. \u201cIt seems to be that the Myanmar government and military have a set policy with senior UN people where they try to affect who is hired, work with them for as long as they play ball and then cut ties and ask for their removal when they do something they don\u2019t like, as we have seen with Knut Ostby,\u201d he said. \u201cThe UN of course mostly gives into their demands and then the whole cycle starts again.\u201d Ostby, the current resident coordinator, is stepping down after his contract was not renewed, reportedly as a result of pressure from the government over the situation in Rakhine. Speaking at a UN briefing, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said the report had been shared with senior UN leaders and the Secretary General. \u201cThe Secretary-General has accepted the report\u2019s recommendations and is committed to implementing them so as to improve the performance of the United Nations system,\u201d said Dujarric. \u201cThis review is valuable for the Resident Coordinator and the UN Country Team in Myanmar, as well as in other countries where the UN operates in similarly challenging conditions.\u201d The UN had been reluctant to make the internal report public, according to Matthew Smith, the chief executive of the NGO Fortify Rights, which was among those to have highlighted UN dysfunction in Myanmar for years.

In 2018, James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, announced a one-off \u00a330m funding pot for immediate support for councils to tackle rough sleeping.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How does the law treat rough sleepers?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Rough sleeping and begging are illegal in ENgland and Wales under the Vagrancy Act 1824, which makes \u2018wandering abroad and lodging in any barn or outhouse, or in any deserted or unoccupied building, or in the open air, or under a tent, or in any cart or wagon, and not giving a good account of himself or herself\u2019 liable to a \u00a31,000 fine.

The number of homeless camps forcibly removed by councils across the UK has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/17/removal-of-homeless-camps-trebles-as-charities-warn-of-out-of-control-crisis\">more than trebled in five years</a>, figures show, prompting campaigners to warn that the rough sleeping crisis is out of control and has become an entrenched part of life in the country.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is austerity a factor in homelessness?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A Labour party analysis has claimed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/24/homeless-deaths-disproportionately-affected-by-cuts\">local government funding cuts are disproportionately hitting areas that have the highest numbers of deaths among homeless people</a>. Nine of the 10 councils with the highest numbers of homeless deaths in England and Wales between 2013 and 2017 have had cuts of more than three times the national average of \u00a3254 for every household.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the health impacts of rough sleeping?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A study of more than 900 homeless patients at a specialist healthcare centre in the West Midlands found that they were 60 times more likely to visit A&amp;E in a year than the general population in England.</p>\n    <p>Homeless people were more likely to have a range of medical conditions than the general population. While only 0.9% of the general population are on the register for severe mental health problems, the proportion was more than seven times higher for homeless people, at 6.5%.<br></p>\n    <p>Just over 13% of homeless men have a substance dependence, compared with 4.3% of men in the general population. For women the figures were 16.5% and 1.9% respectively. In addition, more than a fifth of homeless people have an alcohol dependence, compared with 1.4% of the general population.

      "bodyText": "The number of homeless camps forcibly removed by councils across the UK has more than trebled in five years, figures show, prompting campaigners to warn that the rough sleeping crisis is out of control and has become an entrenched part of life in the country. Tents, cardboard structures and a garden shed were among the hundreds of homeless encampments torn down by local authorities in the last five years, with the number of tent city clearances rising from 72 in 2014 to 254 last year. Charities say the camp clearances are a symptom of an acute homelessness problem, driven by welfare changes, a lack of properly funded support services and insecure housing. Campaigners have criticised authorities for a heavy-handed approach. Some councils seize tents and even charge for their return. In Brighton, home to England\u2019s second largest population of rough sleepers in 2017, the local authority charges \u00a325 for a confiscated tent. In East Dorset, the fee is \u00a350. Brighton council said the \u00a325 charge was waived if the items were \u201cclaimed by someone who needs their belongings and was unable to pay due to living rough\u201d. East Dorset council did not comment. Separate figures obtained by the Guardian show complaints to councils about homeless encampments have shot up 448% in five years, from 277 in 2014 to 1,241 in 2018, rising year on year, with big increases in 2016 and 2017. On Sunday, a woman in her 30s was found dead in a homeless encampment in Leeds city centre. The number of people living in makeshift camps in the UK is not recorded as a standalone statistic. The official rough sleeping figures, which the UK statistics regulator has warned should not be trusted, aim to include people bedding down in tents and shelters, and the new figures obtained through freedom of information requests suggest it is a growing problem. Matthew Downie, director of policy and external affairs at Crisis, said the findings did not come as a surprise. \u201cWe know that people living in tents as a form of rough sleeping has shot up 165% since 2010,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cWe have now reached unprecedented levels of homelessness across England.

      "bodyText": "\u2018What breed is she?\u201d is one of the questions I\u2019ve learned to avoid in the dog park, along with \u201cOoh, what\u2019s he rolling in?\u201d and \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s play-fighting?\u201d. The park seems to be populated entirely by saints who have spent inordinate amounts of time and money rescuing mutts from conflict zones. There\u2019s no greater piece of canine one-upmanship than the casual reply: \u201cOh, she\u2019s a Syrian street dog.\u201d At which point I have to admit that I bought my dog as an eight-week-old pedigree puppy, a decision that seemed wise at the time, as neither my partner nor I had ever cohabited with one before, but that now makes me feel like a cross between a eugenicist and a child trafficker. Clearly, pedigree dogs are an outmoded, ridiculous idea, so the news that the old English sheepdog \u2013 a perfect visual representation of the genre, with its utterly impractical silky mop \u2013 is now on the Kennel Club\u2019s endangered \u201cat watch list\u201d might seem like a vindication for progress, but it\u2019s hard to feel that way, looking into its \u2026 well, I presume it has eyes somewhere under all that hair. Other native breeds at risk of dying out include the sleek little Manchester terrier, and my beloved sturdy Scottie. After all, mongrels are well known to enjoy better health than their overbred pedigree counterparts, as well as presenting a fun guessing game for life \u2013 where did that tail come from? Is digging up the council flowerbeds is a sign of terrier ancestry? But the rescue element seems to me to be more important than the ancestry. There are plenty of pedigree dogs in need of a good home, for one reason or another \u2013 Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, for example, has seen a huge rise in French bulldogs and pugs given up for adoption in recent years. So if you\u2019re thinking of getting a new best friend, whether it has got documents stretching back to the stone age, or was found in a box in a layby, please consider rehoming, rather than buying. I will next time, I promise.",

The 777X will be the world\u2019s largest twin-engined passenger jet when it takes to the skies later this year. Expectations for the Paris show, which usually features a plethora of new products and big-money orders, had been dampened by economic headwinds, including the US-China trading salvoes and concerns over sluggish growth. However, Airbus followed up the Air Lease deal with news that Virgin Atlantic would buy 14 of its A330neo widebody planes in an order valued at $4.1bn (\u00a33.3bn). Virgin said the planes, with Rolls-Royce engines, would be 13% more fuel-efficient than the aircraft they replaced and also significantly quieter on take-off and landing. The airline\u2019s chief executive, Shai Weiss, said the deal would \u201cplay a pivotal role in our fleet transformation\u201d, adding: \u201cTwenty-nineteen marks a return to growth for Virgin Atlantic as we strive to become the most loved travel company and the nation\u2019s second flag carrier at an expanded Heathrow.\u201d Optimism over airlines\u2019 prospects was in shorter supply elsewhere after another overnight profit warning from German giant Lufthansa. Shares in Lufthansa, which cut its forecast profit for 2019 by 20% in the face of intense fare competition, fell 10%, and European rivals were also dragged down, with easyJet and the British Airways owner, IAG, also falling on the FTSE 100.",

He also had a beard. But, Simon points out, \u201cHe didn\u2019t mention the fact he didn\u2019t really like books.\u201d</p> <p>Both were single and had turned to Twitter to try to meet someone. They liked that it wasn\u2019t a dating platform. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have an expectation,\u201d says Christian. \u201cWe were just two people chatting and getting to know each other.\u201d</p> <p>They exchanged messages for a few days, then spoke on the phone. A couple of weeks later they met \u2013 Simon was moving house and Christian had offered to help move some bookshelves into storage. \u201cHe turned up on the Saturday,\u201d deadpans Simon, \u201cwith a Mini.\u201d Against all the odds, the bookshelves did fit.</p> <p>They had arranged to meet near where Simon was living in Heaton Chapel, near Stockport. Christian, who had driven over from Liverpool, saw him coming down the road, crossed over to meet him, and they happened to meet, romantically, outside the fishmonger\u2019s. \u201cEvery time we drive past now we\u2019re like: \u2018Ah, that\u2019s where we met,\u2019\u201d says Christian.</p> <p>Was it awkward? No, says Simon, \u201cI think because I\u2019d gauged his personality because of Twitter, and we\u2019d both put possibly not very recent photos, but recent enough. It wasn\u2019t like seeing someone you\u2019re not expecting to see.\u201d \u201cIt was just like meeting a person I felt I knew already,\u201d says Christian.</p> <p>What did they like about each other? \u201cIt was just that he made me laugh, and he had a cheeky glint in his eye,\u201d says Simon. Christian says: \u201cI loved his face, and his personality fitted his face because he was as nice as he looked.\u201d When did they realise they wanted to be together? \u201cI think it was really early on,\u201d says Simon. Christian agrees: \u201cFor me it was. People talk about love at first sight. I knew, as soon as I met him, that he was the person I hoped he would be, and that was quite lovely.\u201d</p> <p>Christian had told Simon he might as well store his boxes of books at his house. \u201cHe did say quite confidently: \u2018You\u2019re going to live here eventually,\u2019\u201d says Simon. \u201cI was, like, am I? But actually, we did move in together quite quickly.\u201d</p> <p>About three or four months later, Christian was having his tonsils out and Simon moved in to look after him. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t leave,\u201d he says. That\u2019s quite intimate \u2013 to look after someone when they\u2019re ill. \u201cIt was,\u201d says Christian, who adds that he is a \u201cterrible patient\u201d. \u201cAnd his tonsil wounds reopened,\u201d Simon recalls, \u201cwhich is something to wake up to when you\u2019ve only been with someone a few months and they\u2019ve got blood pouring out of their mouth. It also meant I got to meet his mum and dad quite quickly, at the hospital.\u201d</p> <p>Simon says he knew Christian was serious about their relationship when he half-jokingly sent him a screen-grabbed picture of a kitten he had seen on a listings site with a message saying: \u201cHe\u2019s called Oscar and I think he wants to come and live with us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was late and Chris hadn\u2019t come home, and I was getting annoyed,\u201d says Simon. \u201cHe phoned me, and I was possibly a bit off with him. He said: \u2018Simon, shush, listen.\u2019 The cat was in the car.\u201d Christian had stopped at a pet shop and bought a cat basket and food, then picked the kitten up after work. \u201cHe was reduced,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cI came home with a kitten, and we were a little family.\u201d A risky purchase. \u201cIn hindsight I could have thought: \u2018Was that a little bit quick?\u2019,\u201d says Simon, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t because now we\u2019re married and we\u2019re really happy.\u201d And they have another cat.</p> <p>They got married last year and are now doing up a house together. It has a library for Simon\u2019s books. And a cheese room? \u201cNo, I no longer work in cheese,\u201d says Christian. Simon smiles and says: \u201cWhich is a slight sore point, but has not been too much of an issue.\u201d</p> <p><em>Want to share your story?

I knew, as soon as I met him, that he was the person I hoped he would be, and that was quite lovely.\u201d Christian had told Simon he might as well store his boxes of books at his house. \u201cHe did say quite confidently: \u2018You\u2019re going to live here eventually,\u2019\u201d says Simon. \u201cI was, like, am I? But actually, we did move in together quite quickly.\u201d About three or four months later, Christian was having his tonsils out and Simon moved in to look after him. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t leave,\u201d he says. That\u2019s quite intimate \u2013 to look after someone when they\u2019re ill. \u201cIt was,\u201d says Christian, who adds that he is a \u201cterrible patient\u201d. \u201cAnd his tonsil wounds reopened,\u201d Simon recalls, \u201cwhich is something to wake up to when you\u2019ve only been with someone a few months and they\u2019ve got blood pouring out of their mouth. It also meant I got to meet his mum and dad quite quickly, at the hospital.\u201d Simon says he knew Christian was serious about their relationship when he half-jokingly sent him a screen-grabbed picture of a kitten he had seen on a listings site with a message saying: \u201cHe\u2019s called Oscar and I think he wants to come and live with us.\u201d \u201cIt was late and Chris hadn\u2019t come home, and I was getting annoyed,\u201d says Simon. \u201cHe phoned me, and I was possibly a bit off with him. He said: \u2018Simon, shush, listen.\u2019 The cat was in the car.\u201d Christian had stopped at a pet shop and bought a cat basket and food, then picked the kitten up after work. \u201cHe was reduced,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cI came home with a kitten, and we were a little family.\u201d A risky purchase. \u201cIn hindsight I could have thought: \u2018Was that a little bit quick?\u2019,\u201d says Simon, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t because now we\u2019re married and we\u2019re really happy.\u201d And they have another cat. They got married last year and are now doing up a house together. It has a library for Simon\u2019s books. And a cheese room? \u201cNo, I no longer work in cheese,\u201d says Christian. Simon smiles and says: \u201cWhich is a slight sore point, but has not been too much of an issue.\u201d Want to share your story?

      "bodyText": "Earlier today I set you the following puzzles: 1. In this word-sum, each letter stands for one of the digits 0\u20139, and stands for the same digit each time it appears. Different letters stand for different digits. No number starts with 0. Find all the possible solutions of the word-sum shown above. Solution To find O, we add three Os to find a number that has an O in the units place. The only digits which satisfy this condition are 0 and 5. If O = 0, there are no tens to \u201ccarry\u201d to the middle column and so we are seeking a digit for M, for which three Ms have an M in the units place. Therefore, M is 0 or 5. However, O = 0 and so M = 5 (as different letters stand for different digits). If O = 5, the total of three Os is 15 and so we have a \u20181\u2019 to carry to the middle column. However, there are no digit values of M, where 3M + 1 gives M in the units column. Hence, O = 0 and M = 5. If J = 1, I = 4. If J = 2, I = 7. If J &gt; 2, 3 \u00d7 \u2018JMO\u2019 does not give a 3-digit number and so there are only 2 possible values for J. The only solutions are \u2018JMO\u2019 = 150 with \u2018IMO\u2019 = 450 and \u2018JMO\u2019 = 250 with \u2018IMO\u2019 = 750. 2. In the diagram below, a quarter circle with radius 3cm is positioned next to a quarter circle with radius 4cm. What is the total shaded area bounded by the blue lines, in cm2. Solution Extend the bottom line to make a rectangle with height 1cm and width 3cm: The area of a circle is \u03c0r2, where r is the radius, so the area bounded by the perimeter of the shape in the diagram above is the area of the 3x1 rectangle plus the two quarter circles: 3 + (1/4)9\u03c0 + (1/4)16\u03c0 = 3 + (25/4)\u03c0 The shaded area bound by the blue lines is this value minus the area of the long triangle of height 1cm and width (3 + 4)cm. Which is 3 + (25/4)\u03c0 \u2013 7/2. So the answer is: (25/4)\u03c0 \u2013 (1/2). 3. An equilateral triangle is divided into smaller equilateral triangles. The figure on the left shows that it is possible to divide it into 4 equilateral triangles. The figure on the right shows that it is possible to divide it into 13 equilateral triangles. What are the integer values of n, where n &gt; 1, for which it is possible to divide the triangle into n smaller equilateral triangles? Solution Let\u2019s call the equilateral triangle which is to be divided into smaller equilateral triangles the original triangle. Let\u2019s start with n = 2. Is there a way of dividing the original triangle into two smaller ones? We can\u2019t draw a line from a vertex, since this would produce angles less than 60\u00b0. But if we draw a single line that draws an equilateral triangle, as in (a) below, we create another quadrilateral in the original triangle, not a triangle. So n cannot be 2. If we were going to be able to divide the quadrilateral in (a) into equilateral triangles, we could only divide it into an odd number of equilateral triangles, as in (b), which divides into 5 smaller equilateral triangles. Since there is no way to divide the quadrilateral into an even number of triangles, we can\u2019t divide it into either 2 or 4 triangles, so we can also rule out n = 3 and n = 5. The case for n = 4 is given in the question and so n = 4 is possible. Diagram (b) shows the case for n = 6. Any of the smaller equilateral triangles in this diagram can be spilt into 4 equilateral triangles, which has the effect of adding 3 to the total number of triangles. (Diagram (c) is (b) with the top triangle divided into 4.) We can continue in this fashion in order to create cases when n = 9, 12, 15, . . . . Therefore, it is possible to split the original triangle into n smaller equilateral triangles where n is a multiple of 3, (excluding n = 3). Returning to the diagram for n = 4, we can see that any equilateral triangle can be split into 4 equilateral triangles. Hence, n can be 7, 10, 13, . . . . Therefore, it it is possible to divide the original triangle into n smaller equilateral triangles where n is one more than a multiple of 3. Diagram (d) shows the construction for splitting the original triangle into 8 smaller equilateral triangles. From this diagram, we can show that n = 11, 14, 17, . . . are possible by splitting any of the existing equilateral triangles into 4 equilateral triangles. Therefore, is is possible to split the original triangle into n smaller equilateral triangles where n is two more than a multiple of 3 (excluding n= 5.) Therefore, is is possible to divide the triangle into n smaller equilateral triangles for all positive integer values of n, excluding 2, 3 and 5.

      "body": "<p>Before Steven Jason Williams had his gastric bypass in August 2017, he attended group sessions to prepare himself. It was at one of these classes that Williams, now 44, was first told that many married patients will divorce within years of the surgery. He turned to look at his wife, Desiree, who had trundled him into the meeting using the portable wheelchair they kept in the boot of their car. Williams couldn\u2019t walk more than a few feet \u2013 at his heaviest, he weighed 587lbs (266kg) \u2013 and he spent nearly all his time at home, being cared for by Desiree. He knew then that their marriage was over.</p> <p>\u201cI remember just looking at her thinking, that\u2019s going to be us. Because we\u2019re already rocky as it is,\u201d says Williams. Two months after the surgery, Desiree was gone. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even got the stitches healed.\u201d</p> <p>A successful YouTuber, Williams is known for the gaming vlogs he uploads<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boogie2988\" title=\"\"> as Boogie2988</a> from his home in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Since having the surgery, Williams has lost nearly a third of his body weight, and now weighs 340lbs (154kg). Would Williams have had the surgery if he had known it would cost him his marriage? Absolutely, he says. \u201cIt was an easy choice. My doctor basically sat me down and said: \u2018Steve, if we don\u2019t do this, you are going to die.\u2019\u201d But even aside from the health benefits, he would still have gone ahead \u2013 for Desiree. \u201cI would do it again just to give her that freedom and the option to end our codependent relationship, because it wasn\u2019t working. I just wanted her to be happy.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/25/may-super-obese-children-surgery-life-changing-bariatric-gastric-band\">\u200b'Before, I couldn't walk 200m'\u200b \u2013 why surgery can be life-changing for super-obese children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The statistic that made such an impression on Williams came from <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/article-abstract/2676728\" title=\"\">a 2018 study</a>. That found, of nearly 1,000 obese patients in relationships who had had bariatric surgery, 9% had divorced or separated within four years of their surgery, compared with 6% in a control group. Patients who were single prior to their surgery were more likely to find love afterwards. Out of nearly 1,000 single patients, 21% got married or started a relationship within four years, compared with 11% of those who didn\u2019t have the procedure. The study also reported an association between the degree of weight loss and the possibility of finding a partner.</p> <p>\u201cMany people who have undergone this treatment describe it as a strong, almost life-changing event,\u201d says Prof Per-Arne Svensson of the University of Gothenburg, who led the research. \u201cMany things apart from just the kilos are affected: how they socialise with people, how they become more socially active.\u201d</p> <p>This was the case for Gary Cupid, 35, a facilities manager from Hackney, east London. After having a mini gastric bypass in June 2017, Cupid lost 108lb (49kg). As the weight fell off, he started working out and making friends. His confidence grew, but his relationship foundered. His fiancee ended their engagement, two months after the surgery. \u201cI think she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with the friendships I\u2019d gained ... she felt that I\u2019d become a different person.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not just how you feel about yourself that changes after dramatic weight loss. Society treats you differently, too. \u201cA lot of these people have been obese for many years, or even their whole life,\u201d says Svensson. \u201cSuddenly, they lose the weight, and people start noticing them.\u201d Patients used to being invisible suddenly find themselves to be a desirable sexual and romantic proposition.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Invisible\u2019 is the best way to describe it,\u201d says Chloe (not her real name), 34, a therapist from Shropshire. After she had a gastric sleeve fitted, she went from a size 28 to a 14. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise how differently I was treated to everyone else until I was treated like everyone else. I thought it was me personally that repelled people, and that\u2019s why strangers wouldn\u2019t make eye contact with me.\u201d</p> <p>Chloe didn\u2019t feel deserving of love when she was obese. \u201cI didn\u2019t really feel like I had a choice. I felt like if somebody who wanted a relationship with me came along, I had to take it with both hands and run with it.\u201d She married her husband young; they are now separated. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have got married,\u201d she says. \u201cI got married because \u2013 there\u2019s no other way of putting this \u2013 he was willing.\u201d Their marriage foundered, in part due to his low sex drive, which she attributed to her weight.</p> <p>When you feel invisible, you take what love you can get \u2013 even if it\u2019s not healthy. \u201cWestern culture has a fascination with thinness as being one of our most pronounced markers of beauty and attractiveness,\u201d says Dr David Sarwer of the Center for Obesity Research and Education at Temple University. \u201cFor people with extreme obesity, the message is, if you\u2019re not thin, lean and toned, physical attraction, romance and sexuality is not for you.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b320dd05953644e03beedc1e05b814adb6c9d866\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b320dd05953644e03beedc1e05b814adb6c9d866/0_36_1582_1977/800.jpg\" alt=\"Aisha, who runs the thegastricguru.com.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aisha, who runs the thegastricguru.com.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Gastric Guru</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following surgery, Chloe\u2019s self-esteem slowly improved, but her husband became resentful, she says. \u201cHe got the air that I was leaving him behind.\u201d One day they had an argument. Chloe was still recovering from surgery, but her husband refused to help prepare for a party, and she realised how toxic her marriage had become. \u201cI gained the confidence to see that I didn\u2019t need to be treated that way any more.\u201d</p> <p>The kind of clarity that Chloe experienced is not uncommon. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bariatric surgery seems to be compromising healthy marriages, but rather it seems like it\u2019s helping people get out of unhealthy relationships,\u201d says Sarwer. \u201cImagine the scenario in which someone entered into the relationship with low self-esteem and self-worth.

      "bodyText": "Before Steven Jason Williams had his gastric bypass in August 2017, he attended group sessions to prepare himself. It was at one of these classes that Williams, now 44, was first told that many married patients will divorce within years of the surgery. He turned to look at his wife, Desiree, who had trundled him into the meeting using the portable wheelchair they kept in the boot of their car. Williams couldn\u2019t walk more than a few feet \u2013 at his heaviest, he weighed 587lbs (266kg) \u2013 and he spent nearly all his time at home, being cared for by Desiree. He knew then that their marriage was over. \u201cI remember just looking at her thinking, that\u2019s going to be us. Because we\u2019re already rocky as it is,\u201d says Williams. Two months after the surgery, Desiree was gone. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even got the stitches healed.\u201d A successful YouTuber, Williams is known for the gaming vlogs he uploads as Boogie2988 from his home in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Since having the surgery, Williams has lost nearly a third of his body weight, and now weighs 340lbs (154kg). Would Williams have had the surgery if he had known it would cost him his marriage? Absolutely, he says. \u201cIt was an easy choice. My doctor basically sat me down and said: \u2018Steve, if we don\u2019t do this, you are going to die.\u2019\u201d But even aside from the health benefits, he would still have gone ahead \u2013 for Desiree. \u201cI would do it again just to give her that freedom and the option to end our codependent relationship, because it wasn\u2019t working. I just wanted her to be happy.\u201d The statistic that made such an impression on Williams came from a 2018 study. That found, of nearly 1,000 obese patients in relationships who had had bariatric surgery, 9% had divorced or separated within four years of their surgery, compared with 6% in a control group. Patients who were single prior to their surgery were more likely to find love afterwards. Out of nearly 1,000 single patients, 21% got married or started a relationship within four years, compared with 11% of those who didn\u2019t have the procedure. The study also reported an association between the degree of weight loss and the possibility of finding a partner. \u201cMany people who have undergone this treatment describe it as a strong, almost life-changing event,\u201d says Prof Per-Arne Svensson of the University of Gothenburg, who led the research. \u201cMany things apart from just the kilos are affected: how they socialise with people, how they become more socially active.\u201d This was the case for Gary Cupid, 35, a facilities manager from Hackney, east London. After having a mini gastric bypass in June 2017, Cupid lost 108lb (49kg). As the weight fell off, he started working out and making friends. His confidence grew, but his relationship foundered. His fiancee ended their engagement, two months after the surgery. \u201cI think she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with the friendships I\u2019d gained ... she felt that I\u2019d become a different person.\u201d It\u2019s not just how you feel about yourself that changes after dramatic weight loss. Society treats you differently, too. \u201cA lot of these people have been obese for many years, or even their whole life,\u201d says Svensson. \u201cSuddenly, they lose the weight, and people start noticing them.\u201d Patients used to being invisible suddenly find themselves to be a desirable sexual and romantic proposition. \u201c\u2018Invisible\u2019 is the best way to describe it,\u201d says Chloe (not her real name), 34, a therapist from Shropshire. After she had a gastric sleeve fitted, she went from a size 28 to a 14. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise how differently I was treated to everyone else until I was treated like everyone else. I thought it was me personally that repelled people, and that\u2019s why strangers wouldn\u2019t make eye contact with me.\u201d Chloe didn\u2019t feel deserving of love when she was obese. \u201cI didn\u2019t really feel like I had a choice. I felt like if somebody who wanted a relationship with me came along, I had to take it with both hands and run with it.\u201d She married her husband young; they are now separated. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have got married,\u201d she says. \u201cI got married because \u2013 there\u2019s no other way of putting this \u2013 he was willing.\u201d Their marriage foundered, in part due to his low sex drive, which she attributed to her weight. When you feel invisible, you take what love you can get \u2013 even if it\u2019s not healthy. \u201cWestern culture has a fascination with thinness as being one of our most pronounced markers of beauty and attractiveness,\u201d says Dr David Sarwer of the Center for Obesity Research and Education at Temple University. \u201cFor people with extreme obesity, the message is, if you\u2019re not thin, lean and toned, physical attraction, romance and sexuality is not for you.\u201d Following surgery, Chloe\u2019s self-esteem slowly improved, but her husband became resentful, she says. \u201cHe got the air that I was leaving him behind.\u201d One day they had an argument. Chloe was still recovering from surgery, but her husband refused to help prepare for a party, and she realised how toxic her marriage had become. \u201cI gained the confidence to see that I didn\u2019t need to be treated that way any more.\u201d The kind of clarity that Chloe experienced is not uncommon. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bariatric surgery seems to be compromising healthy marriages, but rather it seems like it\u2019s helping people get out of unhealthy relationships,\u201d says Sarwer. \u201cImagine the scenario in which someone entered into the relationship with low self-esteem and self-worth. They underwent surgery and started feeling better about themselves, and they decided: \u2018You know what? I can do better in terms of my romantic relationships.\u2019\u201d Not all relationships that end after bariatric surgery are toxic. Being with a morbidly obese person may mean becoming their caregiver; some marriages struggle to withstand that burden. \u201cIf people are struggling with significant medical complications, that can be very threatening to a romantic relationship,\u201d says Sarwer. Desiree helped Williams wash, did the shopping and drove him to doctor\u2019s appointments. \u201cShe was exhausted, because she was both the caretaker of the home and my caretaker. She had to do literally everything.\u201d After Williams\u2019 surgery, he says Desiree said: \u201cI feel like a weight has been lifted off me \u2013 I don\u2019t feel anxious, I\u2019m not angry, I feel like myself again.\u201d Patients, though, can wake up on the operating table as if born anew. \u201cHaving surgery was the turning point in my life,\u201d says Kelly Graham, 38, a team leader from Bedfordshire. \u201cAnd my relationship was the biggest thing I needed to deal with.\u201d Worried about complications, Graham\u2019s wife didn\u2019t want her to have the surgery \u2013 \u201cShe joked: \u2018You\u2019ll have to do it when I\u2019m not in the country\u2019\u201d \u2013 so Graham had a gastric sleeve fitted in June 2018 while her wife was on holiday. Afterwards, Graham realised her marriage had been floundering for years. \u201cI was too busy being miserable about my weight \u2013 that took over my life, more so than dealing with my relationship. But once I had the surgery and I started losing weight and feeling better about myself, I addressed the relationship.\u201d They separated this year, after three years of marriage. It\u2019s not only romantic relationships that are transformed by bariatric surgery. Many patients lose friends. Aisha Walker, 43, from Kent, had a mini gastric bypass in March 2017. Within a month, Walker, who runs the Gastric Guru support group, had lost some of her best friends. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the friend who just sat in the corner and said yes all the time. I gained my own spirit, and that made them feel uncomfortable.\u201d Walker says one fitness-conscious friend felt like she had taken the \u201ceasy way out\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Almost two in five Syrian asylum seekers were made to take a widely criticised language test to prove their nationality, the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>Campaigners and experts have criticised the Home Office for the widespread use of language analysis on those claiming to have fled Syria, describing it as \u201cpseudoscience\u201d and a political tool to exclude migrants.</p> <p>The tests are used to determine asylum seekers\u2019 country of origin by profiling aspects of their speech, and should be carried out by experts familiar with the language. <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/685203/Language-analysis-AI-v21.0EXT.pdf\">Current guidelines</a> state language analysis should generally be used where applicants cannot produce reliable and accepted documents.</p> <p>A Guardian investigation has found:</p> <ul> <li><p>The Home Office used language analysis tests in cases where visas had been issued or reliable documents existed.</p></li> <li><p>An author of a report produced by the company Verified AB, which was used by the Home Office to dispute the nationality of a Syrian asylum seeker, could not speak Arabic.</p></li> <li><p>One report by Verified AB cited speech that <a href=\"https://tribunalsdecisions.service.gov.uk/utiac/pa-02083-2016\">did not exist in the audio recording</a>.</p></li> <li><p>Analysts at the company Sprakab failed to make allowances for minors in some cases and in one case incorrectly recorded a minor <a href=\"https://tribunalsdecisions.service.gov.uk/utiac/aa-07115-2014\">as an adult</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p>The Home Office contracts two private companies, Verified AB and Sprakab, to run thetests on asylum seekers. The department carried out 5,900 language analysis tests between 2011 and 2018, according to information obtained through freedom of information requests.</p> <p>More than two-thirds of all tests \u2013 about 3,900 \u2013 were done in cases where the applicant claimed Syrian nationality.

I\u2019ve certainly found there is that risk because there\u2019s a lack of diligence when commissioning private contractors to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Matras, an expert in Arabic and Kurdish, has provided testimony in court and helped overturn more than a dozen decisions in the past three years where the Home Office relied on language analysis to refuse asylum.</p> <p>After first publication of this article, Roderick Martin, a spokesperson for Verified AB, of Sweden, said that in Verified\u2019s case one or more trained native-speaker analysts always contribute to an analysis report, along with the professional linguist who oversees and signs the report. This combination of native speaker and linguist, he said, is the <a href=\"http://www.iafpa.net/langidres.htm\">method sanctioned</a> by IAFPA, <a href=\"http://www.iafpa.net/code.htm\">the International Association for Forensic Phonetics and Acoustics</a>. [See footnote]</p> <p>Ahmed, 28, who did not wish to give his real name, came to the UK on a student visa in 2015. Before this he had lived in Syria until the age of four and later Dubai.</p> <p>When he applied for asylum in 2015, he was asked to do a language analysis test, despite having a range of documents and the visa as proof of his identity. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to hide. I am Syrian, both my parents are Syrian. And I couldn\u2019t go back to Syria because the situation is horrendous. But this did feel discriminatory,\u201d Ahmed said.</p> <p>In another case, 31-year-old Zahra, who did not want to give her real name, arrived in the UK on a student visa in 2015 with a scholarship exclusively given to students from the Levant.</p> <p>Despite providing her passport and other documents for her visa and scholarship, Zahra was asked to undertake language analysis. \u201cI had everything with me, original papers in very good condition. I\u2019m not sure if they did this randomly or if they targeted people,\u201d Zahra said.</p> <p>Mohammed Ateek, a teaching fellow at the University of Reading, who researches language and migration, said: \u201cThe use of language analysis on applicants with valid documents or UK visas doesn\u2019t leave any space for doubt that it has been used in a discriminatory manner.\u201d </p> <p>The Labour MP Thangam Debbonaire, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on refugees, said: \u201cAccording to this investigation, language analysis tests are being used even when other documents are available. This is worrying, considering that it is such an imprecise method for assessing where people come from.</p> <p>\u201cWe should not rely on such uncertain assessment methods when other information is available. To do so risks sending people back into danger. I will be writing to the home secretary to ask about this.\u201d</p> <p>Chai Patel, the legal policy director at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: \u201cThe fact that caseworkers are continuing to use discredited pseudoscience to reject asylum claims is hardly surprising. But the problem isn\u2019t one of science or technology, it is that the Home Office is culturally and institutionally incentivised to deny protection to those fleeing persecutions.</p> <p>\u201cPoliticians need to take responsibility for the culture they have created through their dehumanising language around refugees, and work to rebuild the Home Office from the ground up.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said:<strong> </strong>\u201cLanguage analysis testing is just one piece of evidence used as part of the consideration process to ensure genuine refugees receive our support. It can provide a speedy resolution to claims by helping to confirm an asylum applicant\u2019s place of origin, and its use in immigration cases has been supported by the courts, including the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2013-0202-judgment.pdf\">supreme court</a>.</p> <p>\u201cAsylum caseworkers follow the published guidance on the use of this testing and carry out routine quality checks to ensure compliance.\u201d</p> <p>Roderick Martin of Verified said that his <a href=\"https://www.verified.se/eng_services.html\">company\u2019s method</a> \u2013 Linguistic Origin IDentification (LOID) \u2013 was supported by \u201cobservations and detailed references to scientific literature. Verified includes a clear account of the limitations of the method as well as the cautions that should be taken into account where each language test is concerned.\u201d The method, he added, \u201cdoes not operate with geographical communities or nationalities, but with linguistic communities \u2013 dialects \u2013 which can sometimes straddle borders\u201d.</p> <p>The spokesman said that Verified did not operate with geographical communities or nationalities, but with linguistic communities, which can sometimes straddle borders.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was updated on 3 July and 10 July 2019 to: include additional comments from Verified AB; specify companies in some examples; and clarify that language analysis reports can have multiple authors.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Almost two in five Syrian asylum seekers were made to take a widely criticised language test to prove their nationality, the Guardian can reveal. Campaigners and experts have criticised the Home Office for the widespread use of language analysis on those claiming to have fled Syria, describing it as \u201cpseudoscience\u201d and a political tool to exclude migrants. The tests are used to determine asylum seekers\u2019 country of origin by profiling aspects of their speech, and should be carried out by experts familiar with the language. Current guidelines state language analysis should generally be used where applicants cannot produce reliable and accepted documents. A Guardian investigation has found: The Home Office used language analysis tests in cases where visas had been issued or reliable documents existed. An author of a report produced by the company Verified AB, which was used by the Home Office to dispute the nationality of a Syrian asylum seeker, could not speak Arabic. One report by Verified AB cited speech that did not exist in the audio recording. Analysts at the company Sprakab failed to make allowances for minors in some cases and in one case incorrectly recorded a minor as an adult. The Home Office contracts two private companies, Verified AB and Sprakab, to run thetests on asylum seekers. The department carried out 5,900 language analysis tests between 2011 and 2018, according to information obtained through freedom of information requests. More than two-thirds of all tests \u2013 about 3,900 \u2013 were done in cases where the applicant claimed Syrian nationality. Syrians accounted for 5% of all asylum applications in this period. Between 2011 and 2018, 10,255 Syrians applied for asylum, according to Home Office statistics, meaning almost 40% of all applicants were tested. Yaron Matras, a professor of linguistics at the University of Manchester, said: \u201cThere\u2019s been suggestions from academics and activists that the use of language analysis is a political way of excluding people. I\u2019ve certainly found there is that risk because there\u2019s a lack of diligence when commissioning private contractors to do that.\u201d Matras, an expert in Arabic and Kurdish, has provided testimony in court and helped overturn more than a dozen decisions in the past three years where the Home Office relied on language analysis to refuse asylum. After first publication of this article, Roderick Martin, a spokesperson for Verified AB, of Sweden, said that in Verified\u2019s case one or more trained native-speaker analysts always contribute to an analysis report, along with the professional linguist who oversees and signs the report. This combination of native speaker and linguist, he said, is the method sanctioned by IAFPA, the International Association for Forensic Phonetics and Acoustics. [See footnote] Ahmed, 28, who did not wish to give his real name, came to the UK on a student visa in 2015. Before this he had lived in Syria until the age of four and later Dubai. When he applied for asylum in 2015, he was asked to do a language analysis test, despite having a range of documents and the visa as proof of his identity. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to hide. I am Syrian, both my parents are Syrian. And I couldn\u2019t go back to Syria because the situation is horrendous. But this did feel discriminatory,\u201d Ahmed said. In another case, 31-year-old Zahra, who did not want to give her real name, arrived in the UK on a student visa in 2015 with a scholarship exclusively given to students from the Levant. Despite providing her passport and other documents for her visa and scholarship, Zahra was asked to undertake language analysis. \u201cI had everything with me, original papers in very good condition. I\u2019m not sure if they did this randomly or if they targeted people,\u201d Zahra said. Mohammed Ateek, a teaching fellow at the University of Reading, who researches language and migration, said: \u201cThe use of language analysis on applicants with valid documents or UK visas doesn\u2019t leave any space for doubt that it has been used in a discriminatory manner.\u201d The Labour MP Thangam Debbonaire, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on refugees, said: \u201cAccording to this investigation, language analysis tests are being used even when other documents are available. This is worrying, considering that it is such an imprecise method for assessing where people come from. \u201cWe should not rely on such uncertain assessment methods when other information is available. To do so risks sending people back into danger. I will be writing to the home secretary to ask about this.\u201d Chai Patel, the legal policy director at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: \u201cThe fact that caseworkers are continuing to use discredited pseudoscience to reject asylum claims is hardly surprising. But the problem isn\u2019t one of science or technology, it is that the Home Office is culturally and institutionally incentivised to deny protection to those fleeing persecutions. \u201cPoliticians need to take responsibility for the culture they have created through their dehumanising language around refugees, and work to rebuild the Home Office from the ground up.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cLanguage analysis testing is just one piece of evidence used as part of the consideration process to ensure genuine refugees receive our support. It can provide a speedy resolution to claims by helping to confirm an asylum applicant\u2019s place of origin, and its use in immigration cases has been supported by the courts, including the supreme court. \u201cAsylum caseworkers follow the published guidance on the use of this testing and carry out routine quality checks to ensure compliance.\u201d Roderick Martin of Verified said that his company\u2019s method \u2013 Linguistic Origin IDentification (LOID) \u2013 was supported by \u201cobservations and detailed references to scientific literature. Verified includes a clear account of the limitations of the method as well as the cautions that should be taken into account where each language test is concerned.\u201d The method, he added, \u201cdoes not operate with geographical communities or nationalities, but with linguistic communities \u2013 dialects \u2013 which can sometimes straddle borders\u201d. The spokesman said that Verified did not operate with geographical communities or nationalities, but with linguistic communities, which can sometimes straddle borders. \u2022 This article was updated on 3 July and 10 July 2019 to: include additional comments from Verified AB; specify companies in some examples; and clarify that language analysis reports can have multiple authors.",

Both her mother and father were music teachers. \u201cI wanted to be the first lady president or a veterinarian.\u201d</p> <p>On <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00934fc\">BBC Radio Four\u2019s Desert Island Discs in 2005</a>, she chose her own performance of Joni Mitchell\u2019s River. \u201cI was probably 16 or 17 when I heard Joni Mitchell and thought, \u2018That\u2019s my voice.\u2019 I played the guitar and went through a whole singer-songwriter era.\u201d It was a rebellion of sorts for a \u201cgood girl who wanted to be bad, to wear nylons and smoke in the bathroom\u201d. At college, she sang with a jazz trio, only opting decisively for a classical career after being forced to choose between dropping out to tour with the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABXPi3jzagg\">Illinois Jacquet Big Band</a> or going on to graduate school.</p> <p>Fleming\u2019s career has been so dazzling, it is a surprise to learn how slow it was to take off. In her early 20s, she failed a big audition but now regards it as a blessing. \u201cMy voice wasn\u2019t worked out, I had a lot of technical flaws.\u201d She took herself off for classes with legendary soprano <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4o4VHHxlE8\">Eli</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4o4VHHxlE8\">sabeth Schwarzkopf</a>, who piled shame on her: \u201cYou were either \u2018golden\u2019 or you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to sing at all.\u201d One of several bouts of stage fright followed. How has that experience informed the masterclasses that she now gives to young singers? \u201cI don\u2019t use the singers to make the audience laugh,\u201d she says, pointedly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve been presenting opera in the same way for so long that it\u2019s ceased to be relevant</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By her own account, her biggest break came in her mid-30s, through an understudy role. The Desdemona in a top-flight production of Verdi\u2019s Otello hurt her back, plunging Fleming into the part \u2013 and a confrontation scene with a giant she had never even met: Pl\u00e1cido Domingo. \u201cHe was so frightening that, by the end, I needed help to get off the stage,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when it was over, he held out his hand and said, \u2018Hello, I\u2019m Pl\u00e1cido Domingo.\u2019 It\u2019s very important to be prepared. That Otello put me on the map.\u201d She continued to sing Desdemona up to 2012.</p> <p>Perhaps her most life-changing break happened off stage, though, after she was introduced to author Ann Patchett by someone who mistakenly believed that Fleming was the inspiration for Bel Canto, Patchett\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jul/14/fiction.reviews1\">Orange prize-winning novel </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jul/14/fiction.reviews1\">about an opera singer</a> taken hostage. The two women became close friends. And Patchett introduced her to a lawyer friend of hers, Tim Jessell, who in 2011 became Fleming\u2019s second husband. Fleming went on to provide Julianne Moore\u2019s singing voice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/25/bel-canto-review-julianne-moore-trills-as-opera-star-in-hostage-drama\">in last year\u2019s film adaptation of Bel Canto</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af3310db41ace952aa44249d31c48522a10a9b97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af3310db41ace952aa44249d31c48522a10a9b97/0_530_7952_4774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fleming starred with Ben Whishaw in Anne Carson\u2019s Norma Jeane Baker of Troy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Break-out moment \u2026 Fleming starred with Ben Whishaw in Anne Carson\u2019s Norma Jeane Baker of Troy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy the Shed</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI love finding interesting ways of making classical singing accessible to the rest of the world,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause the opera world is increasingly small. We\u2019ve been presenting it in the same way for so long that it\u2019s ceased to be relevant.\u201d Which is why she is so keen to venture beyond the classical repertoire. Between performances, recordings and masterclasses, she works with Washington\u2019s Kennedy Center, bringing neurologists and artists together to promote the use of music for people with brain injuries.</p> <p>In 2009, after a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gRSzLSb-ak\">guest appearance on Elvis Costello\u2019s TV show, Spectacle</a>, she was signed on for an album, Dark Hope, covering songs by Leonard Cohen, Jefferson Airplane and Tears for Fears. It\u2019s a mark of the importance of family to Fleming that her backing singers on Dark Hope included her <a href=\"http://www.kennedy-center.org/Artist/A100875\">cabaret-singer sister, Rachelle</a>, and her own daughters, Amelia and Sage. They are now 26 and 28 and, although both were promising singers, they showed no sign of allowing themselves to be \u201cindentured\u201d into a musical career. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard lifestyle,\u201d says Fleming with a laugh, \u201cand they know too much.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The Light in the Piazza is at <a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/126992-light-piazza-2019\">Royal Festival Hall, London</a>, until 5 July.</p>",

Both her mother and father were music teachers. \u201cI wanted to be the first lady president or a veterinarian.\u201d On BBC Radio Four\u2019s Desert Island Discs in 2005, she chose her own performance of Joni Mitchell\u2019s River. \u201cI was probably 16 or 17 when I heard Joni Mitchell and thought, \u2018That\u2019s my voice.\u2019 I played the guitar and went through a whole singer-songwriter era.\u201d It was a rebellion of sorts for a \u201cgood girl who wanted to be bad, to wear nylons and smoke in the bathroom\u201d. At college, she sang with a jazz trio, only opting decisively for a classical career after being forced to choose between dropping out to tour with the Illinois Jacquet Big Band or going on to graduate school. Fleming\u2019s career has been so dazzling, it is a surprise to learn how slow it was to take off. In her early 20s, she failed a big audition but now regards it as a blessing. \u201cMy voice wasn\u2019t worked out, I had a lot of technical flaws.\u201d She took herself off for classes with legendary soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, who piled shame on her: \u201cYou were either \u2018golden\u2019 or you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to sing at all.\u201d One of several bouts of stage fright followed. How has that experience informed the masterclasses that she now gives to young singers? \u201cI don\u2019t use the singers to make the audience laugh,\u201d she says, pointedly. By her own account, her biggest break came in her mid-30s, through an understudy role. The Desdemona in a top-flight production of Verdi\u2019s Otello hurt her back, plunging Fleming into the part \u2013 and a confrontation scene with a giant she had never even met: Pl\u00e1cido Domingo. \u201cHe was so frightening that, by the end, I needed help to get off the stage,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when it was over, he held out his hand and said, \u2018Hello, I\u2019m Pl\u00e1cido Domingo.\u2019 It\u2019s very important to be prepared. That Otello put me on the map.\u201d She continued to sing Desdemona up to 2012. Perhaps her most life-changing break happened off stage, though, after she was introduced to author Ann Patchett by someone who mistakenly believed that Fleming was the inspiration for Bel Canto, Patchett\u2019s Orange prize-winning novel about an opera singer taken hostage. The two women became close friends. And Patchett introduced her to a lawyer friend of hers, Tim Jessell, who in 2011 became Fleming\u2019s second husband. Fleming went on to provide Julianne Moore\u2019s singing voice in last year\u2019s film adaptation of Bel Canto. \u201cI love finding interesting ways of making classical singing accessible to the rest of the world,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause the opera world is increasingly small. We\u2019ve been presenting it in the same way for so long that it\u2019s ceased to be relevant.\u201d Which is why she is so keen to venture beyond the classical repertoire. Between performances, recordings and masterclasses, she works with Washington\u2019s Kennedy Center, bringing neurologists and artists together to promote the use of music for people with brain injuries. In 2009, after a guest appearance on Elvis Costello\u2019s TV show, Spectacle, she was signed on for an album, Dark Hope, covering songs by Leonard Cohen, Jefferson Airplane and Tears for Fears. It\u2019s a mark of the importance of family to Fleming that her backing singers on Dark Hope included her cabaret-singer sister, Rachelle, and her own daughters, Amelia and Sage. They are now 26 and 28 and, although both were promising singers, they showed no sign of allowing themselves to be \u201cindentured\u201d into a musical career. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard lifestyle,\u201d says Fleming with a laugh, \u201cand they know too much.\u201d \u2022 The Light in the Piazza is at Royal Festival Hall, London, until 5 July.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cBulk hacking\u201d powers exploited by the intelligence services to access electronic devices represent an illegal intrusion into the private lives of millions of people, the high court has been told. In its latest challenge to the 2016 Investigatory Powers Act (IPA), the civil rights organisation Liberty has argued that government surveillance practices breach human rights law. Of the multiple powers authorised by the legislation \u2013 labelled by critics as the \u201csnooper\u2019s charter\u201d \u2013 the ability to interfere with computers, mobiles and other equipment amounts to the greatest invasion of individuals\u2019 privacy, the court was told. Appearing for Liberty, Martin Chamberlain QC explained that the IPA \u201cprovides for a wide expansion of bulk secret surveillance powers\u201d, undermining articles 8 and 10 of the European convention on human rights which guarantee privacy and freedom of expression. He warned of the \u201cinherent dangers\u201d of bulk hacking powers, by which the intelligence services could take \u201cremote control of a device, for example, to turn mobile phones with cameras into recording devices \u2026 or to log keystrokes to capture passwords,\u201d thereby potentially overriding any encryption. Chamberlain cautioned about \u201cthe dangers of secret surveillance regimes\u201d, which arose from \u201cthe possibility of abuse of power necessarily exercised in secret, and the generally chilling effect on individuals\u2019 communications and expression of ideas caused by the existence of such powers.\u201d Other powers in the act, he said, \u201cpermit the interception or obtaining, processing, retention and examination of the private information of very large numbers of people \u2013 in some cases, the whole population. They also permit serious invasions of journalistic and watchdog organisations\u2019 materials and lawyer-client communication.\u201d He said MI5 and GCHQ could intercept data that \u201cshows, for example, that an individual has accessed a website containing information about sexual health or abortion or suicide,\u201d and this data \u201cwould be searchable without a warrant\u201d. Vulnerabilities that have been built into software to allow law enforcement access cause \u201creal and significant risks\u201d that third parties could exploit them. The WannaCry online attack, by which hackers infected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide with ransomware in 2017 attack, represented \u201can example of the kind of unintended consequences that state bulk hacking activities \u2026 can have,\u201d he said. But Sir James Eadie QC, representing the government, argued that the powers provided by IPA \u201cstrike an appropriate balance between security and individual privacy\u201d. He said in his written submission: \u201cThe powers under challenge are of critical importance to, and are effective in securing, the protection of the public from a range of serious and sophisticated threats arising in the context of terrorism, hostile state activity and serious/organised crime.\u201d Last week it emerged that MI5 had lost control of its data storage operations. MI5 admitted there were \u201cungoverned spaces\u201d on its computers where it did not know what it held. In parliamentary debates about the Investigatory Powers Act, the government insisted the security services conducted only targeted searches of data under legal warrants in pursuit of terrorist or criminal activity, and that bulk interception was necessary as a first step in that process. Compliance with the Investigatory Powers Act is overseen by the investigatory powers commissioner, Lord Justice Fulford, who has announced he is stepping down from the role in October almost six months earlier than scheduled. He is to become vice-president of the criminal division of the court of appeal. In comments revealed during legal action last week, it emerged that Fulford had written to MI5 warning that future applications for interception warrants \u201cwill not be approved by the judicial commissioners\u201d unless there were improvements to its storage practices. The National Union of Journalists has intervened in the Liberty case, arguing that there are insufficient safeguards in the act to protect confidential journalistic sources. Before the hearing, Megan Goulding, a lawyer at Liberty, said: \u201cIn creating the snoopers\u2019 charter, the UK government has attempted to legitimise the most sweeping and intrusive mass surveillance powers to be found anywhere in the democratic world. These powers allow the state to collect the messages, location and browsing history of innocent, ordinary people without grounds for suspicion. \u201cWe are bringing this challenge because this law has no place in any credible democracy, least of all one with such a long and proud history of defending individual liberty. The government must introduce a targeted surveillance regime that does not require its citizens to sacrifice their rights to privacy and freedom of expression.\u201d Responding to the legal action, the security minister, Ben Wallace, said: \u201cWe live in a world where paedophiles groom children online, terrorists continue to plot attacks and where hostile states have attempted assassination on our streets. It is therefore imperative that our law enforcement and security and intelligence agencies have the tools they need to protect us all from these very real threats to our security, prosperity and our way of life. \u201cPolice and intelligence officers who use these investigatory powers every day do so within a strict set of rules and are overseen by ministers and the independent investigatory powers commissioner. We will continue to defend the investigatory powers regime in court.\u201d The hearing, at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, is expected to last five days.",

      "body": "<p>What is it about language that gets people so hot under the collar? That drives them to spend hours arguing with strangers on the internet, to go around correcting misspelt signs in the dead of night, or even to threaten acts of violence? The languages we speak are central to our sense of self, so it is not surprising that their finer points can become a battleground. Passionate feelings about what\u2019s right and wrong extend from the use of \u201cdisinterested\u201d to what gay people are allowed to call themselves. Here are some of the most memorable rows, spats and controversies.</p> <h2><strong>Apostrophe catastrophe</strong></h2> <p>A so-called \u201cgrammar vigilante\u201d has been correcting shop fronts in Bristol, England, for more than a decade. His pet peeve is the confusion of plain old plurals with possessives, which in English are usually marked by an apostrophe followed by an S. Confronted with a sign advertising \u201cAmy\u2019s Nail\u2019s\u201d, he will obliterate the second apostrophe with a sticker. Addressing the potentially illegal nature of his mission in a BBC <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-39459831/meet-the-grammar-vigilante-of-bristol\" title=\"\">report</a>, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s more of a crime that the apostrophe is wrong in the first place\u201d. Linguist Rob Drummond <a href=\"https://qz.com/963389/picking-on-someones-poor-grammar-is-always-a-cowardly-attack/\" title=\"\">disagrees</a>: \u201cFetishising the apostrophe as if its rules are set in stone,\u201d he writes, \u201cand then fostering an environment in which it is acceptable to take pleasure in uncovering other people\u2019s linguistic insecurities is not OK.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Are you really disinterested?</strong></h2> <p>Use this word at your own risk. If what you want to say is \u201clacking in interest\u201d then brace yourself, because there\u2019s an army of people who will point out that it should be \u201cuninterested\u201d, and that \u201cdisinterested\u201d must mean \u201cimpartial\u201d. They are sticklers for what they regard as the correct meaning, and have taken up columnist William Safire\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/opinion/10iht-edsafire.3844279.html\" title=\"\">command</a> to \u201crear up and rage, rage against the dying of an enlightening distinction\u201d. The problem is that if a word is more frequently used to mean one thing than another, then that\u2019s effectively what it means: you can\u2019t fight a linguistic consensus. The news for pedants gets worse, however. The OED tells us that the use of \u201cdisinterested\u201d to mean not interested or unconcerned has been around since at least the 17th century, used by no less a stylist than the poet John Donne.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"17132c545b1872b1f8870bf340cc5c86a693815e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17132c545b1872b1f8870bf340cc5c86a693815e/0_0_3426_4960/691.jpg\" alt=\"English and Maori versions of the Treaty of Waitangi had important differences.\" width=\"691\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">English and Maori versions of the Treaty of Waitangi had important differences.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Paterson/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Shipshape and patriarchal</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIt is an insult to a generation of sailors ... a ship is like a mother.\u201d An incensed Admiral Lord West was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-48037933\" title=\"\">speaking</a> earlier this year about the Scottish Maritime Museum\u2019s decision to stop using \u201cshe\u201d to describe ships and boats on its information signs. The move, made after the female pronouns were scratched out by persons unknown, provoked a furious debate, with feminists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/26/ships-she-royal-navy-language-row-female\" title=\"\">arguing</a> that the tradition was anachronistic and \u201cperpetuat[ed] the patriarchal view\u201d while naval enthusiasts claimed it was \u201cpolitical correctness gone mad\u201d. Unlike English, many languages force speakers to assign a gender to inanimate objects, and there is evidence that it influences the way they think about them. For example, \u201cbridge\u201d is feminine in German and masculine in Spanish. When asked by <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~eckert/Courses/l1562018/Readings/BoroditskyEtAl2003\" title=\"\">researchers</a> to pick words they associated with it, German speakers chose adjectives like \u201cbeautiful\u201d, \u201celegant\u201d, \u201cpretty\u201d and \u201cslender\u201d and the Spanish speakers chose \u201cbig\u201d, \u201cstrong\u201d, \u201csturdy\u201d and \u201ctowering\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Nucular\u2019 war</strong></h2> <p>The fact that we used to make fun of George W Bush for his malapropisms seems quaint these days. But it was worrying to many of us at the time that the man in charge of the world\u2019s most powerful nuclear arsenal didn\u2019t seem to be able to pronounce it right. He said \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hORaebYWDwk\" title=\"\">nucular</a>\u201d and it was one more black mark against his intelligence. But this syllable-flip is in fact a fairly common linguistic process called metathesis. All English speakers live with the results of historic metatheses that caught on: horse used to be \u201chros\u201d and bird used to be \u201cbrid\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Trumped by language</strong></h2> <p>Now we have far greater opportunities for ridicule in Donald Trump, whose multisyllabic manglings have become world famous: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/31/what-is-covfefe-donald-trump-baffles-twitter-post\" title=\"\">covfefe</a>\u201d anyone? But acting as a linguistic irritant appears to be a family trait. Journalist Eve Peyser has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/evepeyser/status/922836526379294727?lang=en\" title=\"\">kept tabs</a> on words the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka seemed to misuse in public pronouncements, and they included relative (\u201cmy husband keeps incredibly long hours, so I try to keep mine on a relative basis\u201d), otherwise (\u201cCuddling my little nephew Luke, the best part of an otherwise incredible day!\u201d) and \u201cindeniably\u201d (\u201cIndeniably it\u2019s very expensive to raise children\u201d).</p> <h2><strong>When commas change history</strong></h2> <p>Let\u2019s just hope none of the Trump family gets to rewrite the US constitution, because it\u2019s there that linguistic quirks get really serious. Its precise wording, even punctuation, has been endlessly scrutinised, sometimes with life-and-death consequences. The second amendment states that: \u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d The comma after the word \u201carms\u201d has been used to argue that the framers of the constitution believed the right of an individual to own a gun was more important than collective self-defence. That interpretation ultimately resulted in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/opinion/16freedman.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">striking down</a> of some Washington DC gun controls, which had been among the strictest in the nation.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Please return the word \u201cgay\u201d\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The word used to refer to gay people has been controversial in several languages, not least English, where people railed against the co-option of the term until quite recently. In 1990 an anonymous journalist <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/please-return-word-gay-205916\" title=\"\">wrote</a> a piece for Newsweek headlined \u201cPlease return the word \u2018gay\u2019\u201d. \u201cIt is of the least possible concern to me what homosexuals do with one another in the privacy of their homes ... But I want the word \u2018gay\u2019 back. \u2018Gay\u2019 used to be an extremely useful word. It showed up frequently in poetry and prose \u2013 Shakespeare used it 12 times.\u201d Fast forward 30-odd years and a similar row is playing out in China, where the word <em>tongzhi</em>, whose literal meaning is \u201ccomrade\u201d increasingly only has one interpretation. That didn\u2019t stop the Contemporary Chinese Dictionary from prudishly <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-18920096\" title=\"\">refusing</a> to list its common connotation, with one compiler telling the BBC they \u201cdid not want to draw attention to its more colloquial meaning\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>The Ebonics controversy</strong></h2> <p>In 1996 the school board of Oakland, California, decided to recognise the dialect of many of its African American pupils, which it called \u201cEbonics\u201d, as a language. It would henceforth be used to \u201cfacilitate their acquisition and mastery of English-language skills\u201d. The move became a major flashpoint in the US culture wars after being attacked by commentators across the country. Then Clinton aide Rahm Emanuel <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/25/us/administration-rejects-black-english-as-a-second-language.html\" title=\"\">labelled</a> it \u201ca big mistake\u201d and black leaders weighed in, too, with Jesse Jackson <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/US/9612/22/black.english/index.html\" title=\"\">writing</a> \u201cin Oakland some madness has erupted over making slang talk a second language\u201d. But the Linguistic Society of America took a different view. It <a href=\"https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/lsa-resolution-oakland-ebonics-issue\" title=\"\">said:</a> \u201cCharacterisations of Ebonics as \u2018slang\u2019, \u2018mutant\u2019, \u2018lazy,\u2019 \u2018defective\u2019, \u2018ungrammatical\u2019, or \u2018broken English\u2019 are incorrect and demeaning\u201d and argued that evidence from other countries suggested its use in the classroom would help students. The storm of criticism stifled sensible discussion of the issue for years. \u201cEver since,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/johnson/2010/08/24/do-it-be-makin-sense\" title=\"\">according</a> to the Economist, \u201cany recognition that there is such a thing as Ebonics sets people foaming at the mouth.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7e80058d88726763718e91f3b97110951beccc0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e80058d88726763718e91f3b97110951beccc0e/0_272_4520_2711/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Statue of late Turkmenistan president  Saparmurat Niyazov\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Turkmen president-for-life Saparmurat Niyazov decided to rename the months and days of the week according to some of his favourite things.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valery Sharifulin/Tass</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Splitting hairs</strong></h2> <p>You may have been told that it\u2019s bad to split your infinitives in English \u2013 that you should never put anything between \u201cto\u201d and the verb \u2013 meaning a sentence like: \u201cShe wanted to fully support him\u201d would be wrong. This was certainly a tenet of prescriptive works (like Strunk and White\u2019s The Elements of Style) and classroom instruction for much of the 20th century.

Particularly, it seems, when you add gender to the mix. In 2014 a row over whether masculine titles should be changed when the bearer is a woman erupted in the French National Assembly. Conservative representative Julien Aubert insisted on referring to socialist Sandrine Mazetier as <em>Madame le president</em>, using the masculine article and noun ending. Mazetier responded that he must call her <em>Madame la presidente</em>, and when he refused, she <a href=\"http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2014/10/07/01002-20141007ARTFIG00324-madame-la-presidente-ou-le-president-quelle-est-la-regle.php\" title=\"\">fined</a> him \u20ac1,378 (\u00a31,230).</p> <h2><strong>Bollocks to jargon</strong></h2> <p>In the late 2000s, the problem of obscure government language was getting so bad that the House of Commons Public Administration Select Committee wrote a <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmpubadm/17/1702.htm\" title=\"\">report</a> on it. They referred back to comments by Tessa Jowell who, as culture secretary, said: \u201cI have what I call a \u2018bollocks list\u2019, where I just sit in meetings and I write down some of the absurd language we use.\u201d The report notes: \u201cThe unlovely language of this unreal world floats along on a linguistic sea of roll-outs, step changes, public domains, fit for purposes, stakeholder engagements, across the pieces, win-wins, level playing fields and going forwards.\u201d In what must be a rare rebuke of Latin from a Conservative leadership hopeful, Michael Gove lamented that: \u201cSince becoming a member of parliament I\u2019ve been learning a new language \u2026 No one ever uses a simple Anglo-Saxon word, or a concrete example, where a Latinate construction or a next-to-meaningless abstraction can be found.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Buried in translation</strong></h2> <p>An interesting sub-genre of language controversy is the tiny translation error that has gigantic geopolitical ramifications. In 1956 Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev told western ambassadors at an event in Moscow <em>My vas pokhoronim!</em>, using a Russian idiom that means roughly \u201cwe will <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/28/opinion/sunday/why-mistranslation-matters.html\" title=\"\">outlast</a> you\u201d \u2013 in other words, that communism would prevail in the long run. Against the background of a nuclear arms race, the English translation, \u201cwe will bury you\u201d, took on an altogether more sinister meaning, particularly when it was splashed across the front pages of western newspapers. Five years later the Cuban missile crisis brought the Soviet Union and the United States to the brink of nuclear war.</p> <h2><strong>Polite to a fault</strong></h2> <p>Richard Nixon was foxed by elaborate Japanese politeness in 1969.

English missionaries had translated the draft of the Treaty of Waitangi into Maori but the two versions had important differences. The New Zealand Ministry of Culture <a href=\"https://teara.govt.nz/en/treaty-of-waitangi\" title=\"\">explains</a> that \u201cin Maori it gave Queen Victoria governance [<em>kawanatanga</em>] over the land, while in English it gave her sovereignty over the land, which is a stronger term\u201d. The English text also <a href=\"https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/the-treaty-in-brief\" title=\"\">assured</a> the Maori that they would have \u201cundisturbed possession\u201d of all their \u201cproperties\u201d, whereas the Maori translation merely gave them <em>tino rangatiratanga</em> (full authority) over <em>taonga</em> (treasures) \u2013 a more nebulous term.</p> <h2><strong>Mother\u2019s month</strong></h2> <p>If you\u2019re a ruler with absolute power there\u2019s nothing to stop you issuing any manner of linguistic decrees. Turkish leader Atat\u00fcrk, for example, masterminded the abolition of the Arabic script and the adoption of a Latin-based alphabet in 1928. In 2002, in another country where a Turkic language is spoken, a more eccentric set of reforms failed to meet with universal approval. Turkmen president-for-life Saparmurat Niyazov decided to rename the months and days of the week according to some of his favourite things: April changed from <em>Aprel</em> to <em>Gurbansoltan</em>, which happened to be Niyazov\u2019s mum\u2019s name. January was no longer <em>\u00ddanwar</em>, but <em>T\u00fcrkmenba\u015fy</em>, which means \u201cleader of the Turkmen\u201d and was one of Niyazov\u2019s self-bestowed titles. A Turkmen source <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2181151.stm\" title=\"\">told</a> the BBC: \u201cIt seems like he lives on another planet,\u201d and the changes never gained popular legitimacy. They were reversed in 2008, two years after his death.</p> <h2><strong>A country at odds</strong></h2> <p>Belgium is a country divided between Walloons who speak French, and Flemings who speak Flemish, a variety of Dutch (Walloon and Fleming are the demonyms for people from Wallonia and Flanders). The linguistic conflict simmers in places like Linkebeek, whose population is 85% francophone, despite being in Flanders. In 2010, the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/09/belgium-flanders-wallonia-french-dutch\" title=\"\">reported</a> that the man who had been elected mayor on 66% of the local vote was barred from taking office because he sent out election literature in French to French speakers, and not in Dutch as the law stipulated. Conflict over language and identity was at the heart of Belgium\u2019s failure to form a government for 589 days in 2010\u201311, setting a record for a democracy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/16/urgency-climate-crisis-robust-new-language-guardian-katharine-viner\">The urgency of climate crisis needed robust new language to describe it | Paul Chadwick</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Agree to disagree</strong></h2> <p>Linguists use the word \u201cagreement\u201d to describe the way the form of a word can change depending on its relationship with other words in a sentence. For example, if a man is named, then at second mention a pronoun can be used instead, but it has to \u201cagree\u201d in gender and number \u2013 so it would be \u201che\u201d not \u201cshe\u201d. But can it also be \u201cthey\u201d? \u201cThey\u201d is traditionally regarded as being plural: it refers to more than one person. As a result, sentences like: \u201cIf someone wants me, tell them I\u2019ll be in the kitchen\u201d are frowned upon. But, as so often with grammatical bugbears regarded as dastardly innovations, this kind of usage has been around a long time \u2013 since at least 1375, <a href=\"https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/\" title=\"\">according</a> to the OED. And now, of course, \u201cthey\u201d is increasingly being used to refer to those who do not identify with gender-specific pronouns. A key pedantic bastion fell in 2017, when the Chicago Manual of Style <a href=\"https://cmosshoptalk.com/2017/04/03/chicago-style-for-the-singular-they/\" title=\"\">changed</a> its advice to read \u201ca person\u2019s stated preference for a specific pronoun should be respected\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Are you literally kidding?</strong></h2> <p>How can a word come to mean its opposite? That\u2019s against nature, surely. Except when you consider \u201ccleave\u201d or \u201csanction\u201d, so-called auto-antonyms (you can cleave something apart or together; you can sanction a behaviour, then sanction someone for doing it). But enough of them. Literally seems to be a word on a journey from one meaning \u2013 \u201cIn a literal, exact, or actual sense; not figuratively, allegorically\u201d \u2013 to its polar opposite \u2013 \u201cthe strongest possible version of a figurative or allegorical sense\u201d. Once more, this is a journey that began far earlier than you might think. The OED records the following sentence, from 1825: \u201cLady Kirkclaugh ... literally worn to a shadow, died of a broken heart\u201d. William Makepeace Thackeray wrote \u201cI literally blazed with wit\u201d in 1847. That hasn\u2019t stopped repeated shock not only at the usage itself, but at dictionaries\u2019 radical decisions to include it. \u201cMerriam-Webster caves in: \u2018literally\u2019 now means \u2018figuratively\u2019\u201d <a href=\"https://www.languagetrainers.com/blog/2011/09/27/merriam-webster-caves-in-literally-now-means-figuratively/\" title=\"\">declared</a> one blog in 2011. \u201cMerriam-Webster says the word can now mean its exact opposite\u201d <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2013/08/22/according_to_the_dictionary_literally_now_also_means_figuratively_newscred/\" title=\"\">reported</a> Salon in 2013. The pedant community is convulsed like this every few years despite the fact that, according to Merriam- Webster\u2019s own lexicographers, the definition has been sitting there for all to see since <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/misuse-of-literally\" title=\"\">1909</a>.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/don-t-believe-a-word-9781474608435.html\">Don\u2019t Believe a Word: The Surprising Truth About Language</a> will be published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson in August</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "What is it about language that gets people so hot under the collar? That drives them to spend hours arguing with strangers on the internet, to go around correcting misspelt signs in the dead of night, or even to threaten acts of violence? The languages we speak are central to our sense of self, so it is not surprising that their finer points can become a battleground. Passionate feelings about what\u2019s right and wrong extend from the use of \u201cdisinterested\u201d to what gay people are allowed to call themselves. Here are some of the most memorable rows, spats and controversies. Apostrophe catastrophe A so-called \u201cgrammar vigilante\u201d has been correcting shop fronts in Bristol, England, for more than a decade. His pet peeve is the confusion of plain old plurals with possessives, which in English are usually marked by an apostrophe followed by an S. Confronted with a sign advertising \u201cAmy\u2019s Nail\u2019s\u201d, he will obliterate the second apostrophe with a sticker. Addressing the potentially illegal nature of his mission in a BBC report, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s more of a crime that the apostrophe is wrong in the first place\u201d. Linguist Rob Drummond disagrees: \u201cFetishising the apostrophe as if its rules are set in stone,\u201d he writes, \u201cand then fostering an environment in which it is acceptable to take pleasure in uncovering other people\u2019s linguistic insecurities is not OK.\u201d Are you really disinterested? Use this word at your own risk. If what you want to say is \u201clacking in interest\u201d then brace yourself, because there\u2019s an army of people who will point out that it should be \u201cuninterested\u201d, and that \u201cdisinterested\u201d must mean \u201cimpartial\u201d. They are sticklers for what they regard as the correct meaning, and have taken up columnist William Safire\u2019s command to \u201crear up and rage, rage against the dying of an enlightening distinction\u201d. The problem is that if a word is more frequently used to mean one thing than another, then that\u2019s effectively what it means: you can\u2019t fight a linguistic consensus. The news for pedants gets worse, however. The OED tells us that the use of \u201cdisinterested\u201d to mean not interested or unconcerned has been around since at least the 17th century, used by no less a stylist than the poet John Donne. Shipshape and patriarchal \u201cIt is an insult to a generation of sailors ... a ship is like a mother.\u201d An incensed Admiral Lord West was speaking earlier this year about the Scottish Maritime Museum\u2019s decision to stop using \u201cshe\u201d to describe ships and boats on its information signs. The move, made after the female pronouns were scratched out by persons unknown, provoked a furious debate, with feminists arguing that the tradition was anachronistic and \u201cperpetuat[ed] the patriarchal view\u201d while naval enthusiasts claimed it was \u201cpolitical correctness gone mad\u201d. Unlike English, many languages force speakers to assign a gender to inanimate objects, and there is evidence that it influences the way they think about them. For example, \u201cbridge\u201d is feminine in German and masculine in Spanish. When asked by researchers to pick words they associated with it, German speakers chose adjectives like \u201cbeautiful\u201d, \u201celegant\u201d, \u201cpretty\u201d and \u201cslender\u201d and the Spanish speakers chose \u201cbig\u201d, \u201cstrong\u201d, \u201csturdy\u201d and \u201ctowering\u201d. \u2018Nucular\u2019 war The fact that we used to make fun of George W Bush for his malapropisms seems quaint these days. But it was worrying to many of us at the time that the man in charge of the world\u2019s most powerful nuclear arsenal didn\u2019t seem to be able to pronounce it right. He said \u201cnucular\u201d and it was one more black mark against his intelligence. But this syllable-flip is in fact a fairly common linguistic process called metathesis. All English speakers live with the results of historic metatheses that caught on: horse used to be \u201chros\u201d and bird used to be \u201cbrid\u201d. Trumped by language Now we have far greater opportunities for ridicule in Donald Trump, whose multisyllabic manglings have become world famous: \u201ccovfefe\u201d anyone? But acting as a linguistic irritant appears to be a family trait. Journalist Eve Peyser has kept tabs on words the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka seemed to misuse in public pronouncements, and they included relative (\u201cmy husband keeps incredibly long hours, so I try to keep mine on a relative basis\u201d), otherwise (\u201cCuddling my little nephew Luke, the best part of an otherwise incredible day!\u201d) and \u201cindeniably\u201d (\u201cIndeniably it\u2019s very expensive to raise children\u201d). When commas change history Let\u2019s just hope none of the Trump family gets to rewrite the US constitution, because it\u2019s there that linguistic quirks get really serious. Its precise wording, even punctuation, has been endlessly scrutinised, sometimes with life-and-death consequences. The second amendment states that: \u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d The comma after the word \u201carms\u201d has been used to argue that the framers of the constitution believed the right of an individual to own a gun was more important than collective self-defence. That interpretation ultimately resulted in the striking down of some Washington DC gun controls, which had been among the strictest in the nation. \u2018Please return the word \u201cgay\u201d\u2019 The word used to refer to gay people has been controversial in several languages, not least English, where people railed against the co-option of the term until quite recently. In 1990 an anonymous journalist wrote a piece for Newsweek headlined \u201cPlease return the word \u2018gay\u2019\u201d. \u201cIt is of the least possible concern to me what homosexuals do with one another in the privacy of their homes ... But I want the word \u2018gay\u2019 back. \u2018Gay\u2019 used to be an extremely useful word. It showed up frequently in poetry and prose \u2013 Shakespeare used it 12 times.\u201d Fast forward 30-odd years and a similar row is playing out in China, where the word tongzhi, whose literal meaning is \u201ccomrade\u201d increasingly only has one interpretation. That didn\u2019t stop the Contemporary Chinese Dictionary from prudishly refusing to list its common connotation, with one compiler telling the BBC they \u201cdid not want to draw attention to its more colloquial meaning\u201d. The Ebonics controversy In 1996 the school board of Oakland, California, decided to recognise the dialect of many of its African American pupils, which it called \u201cEbonics\u201d, as a language. It would henceforth be used to \u201cfacilitate their acquisition and mastery of English-language skills\u201d. The move became a major flashpoint in the US culture wars after being attacked by commentators across the country. Then Clinton aide Rahm Emanuel labelled it \u201ca big mistake\u201d and black leaders weighed in, too, with Jesse Jackson writing \u201cin Oakland some madness has erupted over making slang talk a second language\u201d. But the Linguistic Society of America took a different view. It said: \u201cCharacterisations of Ebonics as \u2018slang\u2019, \u2018mutant\u2019, \u2018lazy,\u2019 \u2018defective\u2019, \u2018ungrammatical\u2019, or \u2018broken English\u2019 are incorrect and demeaning\u201d and argued that evidence from other countries suggested its use in the classroom would help students. The storm of criticism stifled sensible discussion of the issue for years. \u201cEver since,\u201d according to the Economist, \u201cany recognition that there is such a thing as Ebonics sets people foaming at the mouth.\u201d Splitting hairs You may have been told that it\u2019s bad to split your infinitives in English \u2013 that you should never put anything between \u201cto\u201d and the verb \u2013 meaning a sentence like: \u201cShe wanted to fully support him\u201d would be wrong. This was certainly a tenet of prescriptive works (like Strunk and White\u2019s The Elements of Style) and classroom instruction for much of the 20th century. But the Chicago Manual of Style dropped its objection in 1983, and there are relatively few pedants now prepared to die on a hill to keep the infinitive joined in matrimony. The origins of the \u201crule\u201d are shrouded in mystery, with perhaps its earliest appearance in an 1803 grammar guide. But in reality, English speakers have been splitting their infinitives for hundreds of years. For an edict that\u2019s never been properly observed, it has loomed surprisingly large in the grammatical consciousness. Don\u2019t call me \u2018le president\u2019 The self-appointed guardians of French, a once dominant language assailed by the rise and rise of English, can be especially touchy about changes to the conventions that govern speech. Particularly, it seems, when you add gender to the mix. In 2014 a row over whether masculine titles should be changed when the bearer is a woman erupted in the French National Assembly. Conservative representative Julien Aubert insisted on referring to socialist Sandrine Mazetier as Madame le president, using the masculine article and noun ending. Mazetier responded that he must call her Madame la presidente, and when he refused, she fined him \u20ac1,378 (\u00a31,230). Bollocks to jargon In the late 2000s, the problem of obscure government language was getting so bad that the House of Commons Public Administration Select Committee wrote a report on it. They referred back to comments by Tessa Jowell who, as culture secretary, said: \u201cI have what I call a \u2018bollocks list\u2019, where I just sit in meetings and I write down some of the absurd language we use.\u201d The report notes: \u201cThe unlovely language of this unreal world floats along on a linguistic sea of roll-outs, step changes, public domains, fit for purposes, stakeholder engagements, across the pieces, win-wins, level playing fields and going forwards.\u201d In what must be a rare rebuke of Latin from a Conservative leadership hopeful, Michael Gove lamented that: \u201cSince becoming a member of parliament I\u2019ve been learning a new language \u2026 No one ever uses a simple Anglo-Saxon word, or a concrete example, where a Latinate construction or a next-to-meaningless abstraction can be found.\u201d Buried in translation An interesting sub-genre of language controversy is the tiny translation error that has gigantic geopolitical ramifications. In 1956 Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev told western ambassadors at an event in Moscow My vas pokhoronim!, using a Russian idiom that means roughly \u201cwe will outlast you\u201d \u2013 in other words, that communism would prevail in the long run. Against the background of a nuclear arms race, the English translation, \u201cwe will bury you\u201d, took on an altogether more sinister meaning, particularly when it was splashed across the front pages of western newspapers. Five years later the Cuban missile crisis brought the Soviet Union and the United States to the brink of nuclear war. Polite to a fault Richard Nixon was foxed by elaborate Japanese politeness in 1969. Prime minister Eisaku Sat\u014d visited the White House amid a trade row over textile imports. Nixon\u2019s job was to get him to agree to restrict them. According to the New York Times, \u201cMr Sato replied as he looked ceilingward, Zensho shimasu. Literally, the phrase means: \u2018I will do my best,\u2019 and that\u2019s how the interpreter translated it. What it really means to most Japanese is: \u2018No way.\u2019\u201d When the Japanese government did precisely nothing, Nixon was furious, branding Sato a liar. Black coffee There\u2019s often a dark side to disputes over language: they are often the medium through which inter-ethnic conflicts are brutally expressed. Linguists Marko Dragojevic and colleagues recount the story of a cafe in an area of Bosnia and Herzegovina controlled by Croatians during the 1992-95 war. \u201cOn its menu, the cafe offered its customers coffee at three different prices, depending on which pronunciation customers used to order the item. Kava, indexing a Croatian, and by extension, Catholic identity, was sold for the modest price of 1 Deutsche Mark. Kafa, indexing a Serbian and Orthodox Christian identity, was not available for sale. Finally, kahva, indexing a Bosnian Muslim identity, cost the customer a \u2018bullet in the forehead\u2019.\u201d The Waitangi swindle In 1840, the British government and more than 500 local chiefs signed a bilingual agreement that made New Zealand a colony. English missionaries had translated the draft of the Treaty of Waitangi into Maori but the two versions had important differences. The New Zealand Ministry of Culture explains that \u201cin Maori it gave Queen Victoria governance [kawanatanga] over the land, while in English it gave her sovereignty over the land, which is a stronger term\u201d. The English text also assured the Maori that they would have \u201cundisturbed possession\u201d of all their \u201cproperties\u201d, whereas the Maori translation merely gave them tino rangatiratanga (full authority) over taonga (treasures) \u2013 a more nebulous term. Mother\u2019s month If you\u2019re a ruler with absolute power there\u2019s nothing to stop you issuing any manner of linguistic decrees. Turkish leader Atat\u00fcrk, for example, masterminded the abolition of the Arabic script and the adoption of a Latin-based alphabet in 1928. In 2002, in another country where a Turkic language is spoken, a more eccentric set of reforms failed to meet with universal approval. Turkmen president-for-life Saparmurat Niyazov decided to rename the months and days of the week according to some of his favourite things: April changed from Aprel to Gurbansoltan, which happened to be Niyazov\u2019s mum\u2019s name. January was no longer \u00ddanwar, but T\u00fcrkmenba\u015fy, which means \u201cleader of the Turkmen\u201d and was one of Niyazov\u2019s self-bestowed titles. A Turkmen source told the BBC: \u201cIt seems like he lives on another planet,\u201d and the changes never gained popular legitimacy. They were reversed in 2008, two years after his death. A country at odds Belgium is a country divided between Walloons who speak French, and Flemings who speak Flemish, a variety of Dutch (Walloon and Fleming are the demonyms for people from Wallonia and Flanders). The linguistic conflict simmers in places like Linkebeek, whose population is 85% francophone, despite being in Flanders. In 2010, the Guardian reported that the man who had been elected mayor on 66% of the local vote was barred from taking office because he sent out election literature in French to French speakers, and not in Dutch as the law stipulated. Conflict over language and identity was at the heart of Belgium\u2019s failure to form a government for 589 days in 2010\u201311, setting a record for a democracy. Agree to disagree Linguists use the word \u201cagreement\u201d to describe the way the form of a word can change depending on its relationship with other words in a sentence. For example, if a man is named, then at second mention a pronoun can be used instead, but it has to \u201cagree\u201d in gender and number \u2013 so it would be \u201che\u201d not \u201cshe\u201d. But can it also be \u201cthey\u201d? \u201cThey\u201d is traditionally regarded as being plural: it refers to more than one person. As a result, sentences like: \u201cIf someone wants me, tell them I\u2019ll be in the kitchen\u201d are frowned upon. But, as so often with grammatical bugbears regarded as dastardly innovations, this kind of usage has been around a long time \u2013 since at least 1375, according to the OED. And now, of course, \u201cthey\u201d is increasingly being used to refer to those who do not identify with gender-specific pronouns. A key pedantic bastion fell in 2017, when the Chicago Manual of Style changed its advice to read \u201ca person\u2019s stated preference for a specific pronoun should be respected\u201d. Are you literally kidding? How can a word come to mean its opposite? That\u2019s against nature, surely. Except when you consider \u201ccleave\u201d or \u201csanction\u201d, so-called auto-antonyms (you can cleave something apart or together; you can sanction a behaviour, then sanction someone for doing it). But enough of them. Literally seems to be a word on a journey from one meaning \u2013 \u201cIn a literal, exact, or actual sense; not figuratively, allegorically\u201d \u2013 to its polar opposite \u2013 \u201cthe strongest possible version of a figurative or allegorical sense\u201d. Once more, this is a journey that began far earlier than you might think. The OED records the following sentence, from 1825: \u201cLady Kirkclaugh ... literally worn to a shadow, died of a broken heart\u201d. William Makepeace Thackeray wrote \u201cI literally blazed with wit\u201d in 1847. That hasn\u2019t stopped repeated shock not only at the usage itself, but at dictionaries\u2019 radical decisions to include it. \u201cMerriam-Webster caves in: \u2018literally\u2019 now means \u2018figuratively\u2019\u201d declared one blog in 2011. \u201cMerriam-Webster says the word can now mean its exact opposite\u201d reported Salon in 2013. The pedant community is convulsed like this every few years despite the fact that, according to Merriam- Webster\u2019s own lexicographers, the definition has been sitting there for all to see since 1909.

      "bodyText": "OJ Simpson\u2019s surprise Twitter debut, which came several days after the 25th anniversary of the murders of his ex-wife and her friend, has spurred sharp criticism and emphatic calls to action. Writer Yashar Ali tweeted: \u201cI see that the unrepentant murderer just joined Twitter\u201d, referring to the one-time football star, who was accused of the 12 June 1994 killing of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. Simpson has always maintained his innocence. While the 71-year-old, who now lives in Las Vegas, was acquitted of the murder charges, Brown and Goldman\u2019s families sued him in civil court for wrongful death, winning a $33.5m judgment. The vast majority of this judgment has not been paid. Ali urged Twitter users to support Goldman\u2019s sister, who hosts a new podcast called \u201cConfronting: OJ Simpson.\u201d \u201cCan everyone do me a big favor? Please follow Ron Goldman\u2019s sister, @KimEGoldman She should have more followers than that monster Please RT,\u201d Ali wrote. Danny Deraney, a top Los Angeles publicist, slammed Simpson\u2019s new followers, who now total about 630,000. \u201cIf you followed OJ Simpson on Twitter, I think you should be obligated to tell Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown\u2019s families and tell them why you did so. In fact do that with all murdered victims families if you choose to follow a murderer on Twitter,\u201d Deraney tweeted. Prominent figures in the entertainment world also criticized Simpson\u2019s Twitter debut, including the Emmy-nominated comedian Billy Eichner. He asked Simpson\u2019s new followers, \u201cSeriously, what the f--k is wrong with you?\u201d Randi Mayem Singer, who wrote the screenplay for Mrs. Doubtfire, also questioned Simpson\u2019s followers, writing on Twitter, \u201cWhy? Why would you do that? Please explain to me.\u201d Comedienne Chelsea Handler\u2019s sardonic response \u2013 \u201cLet\u2019s all take a moment to be happy OJ Simpson joined Twitter and not Trump\u2019s cabinet. It\u2019s the little things these days\u201d \u2013 prompted a reply from Goldman\u2019s sister. \u201cI could think of a hundred million other things to be happy about than a double murderer joining anything \u2026 but I get your point,\u201d Goldman wrote. In a video posted to Simpson\u2019s Twitter page \u2013 which was not verified by the social media company but was reportedly confirmed to be authentic by Simpson himself \u2013 he says he has a \u201clittle gettin\u2019 even to do\u201d. He also claimed that his Twitter account would be used to \u201cset the record straight\u201d. Simpson was released from prison in October 2017 after being arrested in 2007 over a botched Las Vegas robbery. He was found guilty the next year. Another disgraced public figure also prompted outrage on Twitter over the weekend in the shape of Bill Cosby, who is now imprisoned in Pennsylvania for sexual assault. A tweet from his verified account, as well as an Instagram account, referred to Cosby as \u201cAmerica\u2019s dad\u201d. \u201cI know it\u2019s late, but to all of the Dads \u2026 It\u2019s an honor to be called a Father, so let\u2019s make today a renewed oath to fulfilling our purpose \u2013 strengthening our families and communities,\u201d said the much-derided post. Cosby\u2019s spokesman told USA Today that the disgraced star had asked that a Father\u2019s Day message from him be posted and that it was aimed at soon-to-be released prisoners.",

      "bodyText": "Scotland should consider new nuclear power stations, investing in hydrogen and installing many more windfarms to meet its climate goals, an expert inquiry has concluded. The inquiry by the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Scotland\u2019s national academy, said a massive increase in low-carbon electricity production would be needed in order to reach the country\u2019s new goal of net zero emissions by 2045. Prof Becky Lunn, a civil engineer who is deputy chair of the inquiry, said electricity production may need to increase fourfold to decarbonise the transport system and heating, with major implications for ministers and the public. \u201cWe have got difficult decisions to make and if we delay we will end up importing by default, which is not a place where in future I think we would wish to be,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to change. At the moment we have a totally unsustainable system.\u201d Alongside a substantial increase in electricity production, Scotland would need: \u2022 A statutory commission to provide independent expert direction on energy policy and governance. \u2022 Much tougher energy efficiency regulations for homes and buildings. \u2022 Substantial investment in carbon capture and storage, so CO2 created during the production of hydrogen could be buried offshore. \u2022 Subsidies to ensure higher energy prices and upgrading costs did not increase fuel poverty. Lunn said this was increasingly urgent. Scotland\u2019s two nuclear power stations at Hunterston and Torness, which provided 37% of the country\u2019s electricity in 2017, are due to close by 2030, just as electricity demand is forecast to soar. The RSE report, Scotland\u2019s Energy Future, was published as climate activists with the Extinction Rebellion protest group marched on the Scottish parliament to set up a week-long camp to put pressure on Holyrood to agree more ambitious CO2 reduction targets. Meanwhile Greenpeace continued its campaign against BP\u2019s increased oil drilling by pursuing an oil rig its activists had occupied in the Cromarty Firth last week into the North Sea, using its protest ship, Arctic Sunrise. Greenpeace said its continued pursuit of the rig, the Paul B Loyd Jr, had prevented it from arriving in the Vorlich oilfield, where BP hopes to extract 30m barrels of oil. Extinction Rebellion is planning to block roads in Edinburgh this week, mirroring similar protests in London and other cities. The Scottish government has accepted a challenging target of achieving net zero emissions by 2045, five years earlier than the 2050 UK target agreed last week by Theresa May, the prime minister.

The RSE inquiry was funded by four major energy firms, the oil company BP, the French nuclear and renewables firm EDF, the gas company Centrica and the renewables firm SSE. The RSE said they had no bearing or influence over the report\u2019s conclusions but the report mirrored those companies\u2019 arguments that nuclear energy, oil and gas would still be needed \u2013 conclusions many climate and environment activists reject. Lunn said ministers should eventually consider small modular nuclear reactors, an experimental technology which, its supporters argue, is safer and much easier to build than large-scale nuclear power stations. Methane would still be needed in large amounts to produce hydrogen: large-scale hydrogen plants would be connected to carbon storage sites in the bedrock offshore. Oil would still be needed to provide fuel for aviation and shipping, for medicines and materials such as plastics. It would be impossible, the RSE said, to equally meet the four key tests of tackling climate change, guaranteeing energy security, making it affordable and at the same time maximising the social acceptability and economic wellbeing of those energy choices.

      "body": "<h2>THE SEASON IS NEVER OFF</h2> <p>On 11 June Paul Pogba played in the France team that beat Andorra 4-0, after which he posted an update on social media disgraces. \u201cLast game of the season we finish well,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTime to relax.\u201d The Fiver certainly knows how to relax: a diary clear for at least a fortnight, sunshine, a swimming pool, a refreshing Tin-a colada and a DVD box set of Zico\u2019s Finest Matches 1978-82 and we\u2019re happy. The picture in Pogba\u2019s mind, however, involved a near-instant departure for a tough shift at the coalface of relentless self-promotion.</p> <p>Within 72 hours he landed in Asia for the first leg of his one-man promotional tour of South Korea, China and Japan. This is not to be confused with Manchester United\u2019s forthcoming promotional tour of Australia, China, Singapore and, er, Wales. On this tour, Pogba is promoting two brands: Adidas and Pogba Inc. Among the subjects Pogba has spoken about on his travels is Paul Pogba. And also, cleanliness. \u201cThe national team in Japan, they always clean the changing room and it looks like a new changing room,\u201d he whooped. \u201cThis is a very good message for everyone and we should do the same in Europe.\u201d Manchester United\u2019s changing room is like the Augean stables of Greek mythological fame: full of unutterable filth. As in the myths, at some point someone will just have to sluice away the lot of it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/16/paul-pogba-manchester-united-new-challenge-good-time-transfer-real-madrid-juventus\">Paul Pogba alerts Real Madrid with talk of \u2018time to have a new challenge\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For now, though, it is what it is, and Pogba is a part of it \u2013 though perhaps not for long. After three years at Old Trafford, it seems the French ace <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/16/paul-pogba-manchester-united-new-challenge-good-time-transfer-real-madrid-juventus\">is eyeing pastures new</a>. Speaking at a promotional event in Tokyo also featuring four sumo wrestlers, the player was asked about his future. \u201cAfter this season, and after everything that happened this season, with my season being my best season as well,\u201d he tooted, \u201cI think for me it could be a good time to have a new challenge somewhere else.\u201d Pogba came third in the club\u2019s player of the year poll, behind Luke Shaw and Victor Lindel\u00f6f.</p> <p>He could, of course, accept a new challenge in the same place, the challenge being to focus more on ball-kicking and less on the general pursuit of sponsordollars. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s attempts to make United less embarrassing could certainly do with the assistance of peak-form Pogba, but sporting achievement is not on the midfielder\u2019s mind. \u201cI have been in Manchester for three years and have been doing great \u2013 some good moments and some bad moments, like everybody. Like everywhere else.\u201d The question now is whether there\u2019s a big club somewhere with a spare \u00a3150m down the back of <em>el sof\u00e1</em>. Apparently United are \u201cdistinctly unimpressed\u201d with Pogba\u2019s revelation and are resolved not to sell him unless they receive an \u201castronomical\u201d offer. They have resolved that nobody\u2019s going to be taking them to the cleaners, though perhaps it wouldn\u2019t be such a bad idea.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Niall McVeigh from 5pm BST for hot MBM coverage of China 1-2 Spain and South Africa 0-2 Germany, while John Brewin will be on hand at 8pm for Nigeria 0-3 France and South Korea 1-1 Norway</a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cHosting the draw in a supermarket as fans go about their daily lives provides them with a great opportunity to engage with the competition\u201d \u2013 Ray Parlour gives this week\u2019s Coca-Cola Cup round one tombola, which takes place with EhJohnEhBarnes somewhere near the meat counter and aisle 17 of Morrisons in Colindale [obviously \u2013 Fiver Ed], the big sell.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbb5732796616e7c725358b3bf15b0b91021edd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbb5732796616e7c725358b3bf15b0b91021edd8/0_0_877_501/500.jpg\" alt=\"Someone not planning on sleeping for a good while, earlier.\" width=\"500\" height=\"286\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Someone not planning on sleeping for a good while, earlier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carabao Cup/EFL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> <p>\u201cEven the venerable New York Times <a href=\"https://nyti.ms/2Xhq2UY\">is joining your STOP FOOTBALL campaign</a>\u201d \u2013 Kristian Karamfiles.</p> <p>\u201cWhat with Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County clinging on, how about calling a newly-promoted Premier League \u2018Teemu Pukki\u2019s Norwich\u2019.

      "bodyText": "THE SEASON IS NEVER OFF On 11 June Paul Pogba played in the France team that beat Andorra 4-0, after which he posted an update on social media disgraces. \u201cLast game of the season we finish well,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTime to relax.\u201d The Fiver certainly knows how to relax: a diary clear for at least a fortnight, sunshine, a swimming pool, a refreshing Tin-a colada and a DVD box set of Zico\u2019s Finest Matches 1978-82 and we\u2019re happy. The picture in Pogba\u2019s mind, however, involved a near-instant departure for a tough shift at the coalface of relentless self-promotion. Within 72 hours he landed in Asia for the first leg of his one-man promotional tour of South Korea, China and Japan. This is not to be confused with Manchester United\u2019s forthcoming promotional tour of Australia, China, Singapore and, er, Wales. On this tour, Pogba is promoting two brands: Adidas and Pogba Inc. Among the subjects Pogba has spoken about on his travels is Paul Pogba. And also, cleanliness. \u201cThe national team in Japan, they always clean the changing room and it looks like a new changing room,\u201d he whooped. \u201cThis is a very good message for everyone and we should do the same in Europe.\u201d Manchester United\u2019s changing room is like the Augean stables of Greek mythological fame: full of unutterable filth. As in the myths, at some point someone will just have to sluice away the lot of it. For now, though, it is what it is, and Pogba is a part of it \u2013 though perhaps not for long. After three years at Old Trafford, it seems the French ace is eyeing pastures new. Speaking at a promotional event in Tokyo also featuring four sumo wrestlers, the player was asked about his future. \u201cAfter this season, and after everything that happened this season, with my season being my best season as well,\u201d he tooted, \u201cI think for me it could be a good time to have a new challenge somewhere else.\u201d Pogba came third in the club\u2019s player of the year poll, behind Luke Shaw and Victor Lindel\u00f6f. He could, of course, accept a new challenge in the same place, the challenge being to focus more on ball-kicking and less on the general pursuit of sponsordollars. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s attempts to make United less embarrassing could certainly do with the assistance of peak-form Pogba, but sporting achievement is not on the midfielder\u2019s mind. \u201cI have been in Manchester for three years and have been doing great \u2013 some good moments and some bad moments, like everybody. Like everywhere else.\u201d The question now is whether there\u2019s a big club somewhere with a spare \u00a3150m down the back of el sof\u00e1. Apparently United are \u201cdistinctly unimpressed\u201d with Pogba\u2019s revelation and are resolved not to sell him unless they receive an \u201castronomical\u201d offer. They have resolved that nobody\u2019s going to be taking them to the cleaners, though perhaps it wouldn\u2019t be such a bad idea.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cEven the venerable New York Times is joining your STOP FOOTBALL campaign\u201d \u2013 Kristian Karamfiles. \u201cWhat with Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County clinging on, how about calling a newly-promoted Premier League \u2018Teemu Pukki\u2019s Norwich\u2019. It might not be original enough for you though, as the Finnish newspapers appear to have got there first\u201d \u2013 Mike Walsh. \u201cHastily Googling for stuff at work is dangerous (Fiver letters passim). My colleague (definitely my colleague) was putting together a presentation about the appalling treatment of Colombian trade unionists some years ago. He needed to find a picture of then US president George W Bush in his younger years, but what he typed into Google on the work laptop was not his smartest search\u201d \u2013 Dan Ashley. \u201cI work at a cosmetics company, with mostly female co-workers. On a recent occasion, it was observed at a meeting that those under a certain age named Richard will not go by the nickname D!ck. This prompted an ill-advised search for \u2018Famous D!cks\u2019 on a work computer and an ever more ill-advised mass email from yours truly. I never did hear from HR, surely because they (correctly) assumed I would be red-faced enough about it without them\u201d \u2013 Matt Richman. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

      "bodyText": "There will be quite a few individuals at Royal Ascot this week for whom \u00a317m is the rough equivalent of the small change that the rest of us put in a pot by the front door for emergencies. Racing as a whole, however, still considers \u00a317m to be quite a lot of money and it also happens to be the size of the dent left in the sport\u2019s finances by the Cheltenham and Aintree Festivals this year. The results at those two meetings were, overall, very good for the punters and therefore very bad for the bookies. At Cheltenham nine of the 28 races went to the favourite, including a six-race sequence on the middle two days when the backers could do no wrong. One of the winners was Tiger Roll, probably the most popular horse in training, who compounded the bookies\u2019 misery three weeks later when he won the Grand National. Bookies pay a percentage of their profits on racing bets back to the sport via a mechanism known as the Levy. If their profits dip, so does the Levy. But even so there was general astonishment last month when it transpired that the 2018-19 Levy scheme had come up \u00a317m short of expectations. The shortfall will translate into cutbacks over the coming months: less prize money, reduced investment, lowered expectations. And while the punters, as ever, will be cheering for the favourites at Flat racing\u2019s showpiece event, those in charge of the sport\u2019s cashflow may be hoping for an upset or two \u2013 or even four or five \u2013 to ease the pressure. They may well be disappointed because the trainer the punters will be backing above all others is Aidan O\u2019Brien, a dominant force in Flat racing for two decades and someone who seems, if anything, to be tightening his grip year by year. O\u2019Brien is expected to field the favourite in around a third of the meeting\u2019s 30 races, is odds-on to finish the week as the leading trainer and could easily trouble the all-time record of seven winners at a single Royal meeting, which he set in 2016. Ryan Moore, O\u2019Brien\u2019s principal jockey, is around 5-2 to equal his own record of nine winners, set in 2015. Punters will be impatient to get proceedings underway with the first of the O\u2019Brien-trained favourites, Le Brivido, in the Queen Anne Stakes, the first race of the meeting on Tuesday. O\u2019Brien also has the favourite for Wednesday\u2019s feature event, the Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes, in Magical, while Hermosa and Ten Sovereigns, in the two big races on Friday, will also be paired in countless win doubles, currently paying out at around 5-1. The Gold Cup, the feature event of the meeting, is one of the few when O\u2019Brien does not have the first or second favourite. But Stradivarius, the 5-4 market leader to win the race for a second year running, is due to be ridden by the other man the bookies fear: Frankie Dettori. Moore is odds-on to be the week\u2019s top rider and Dettori is second-favourite at 3-1.

      "bodyText": "Ireland has unveiled an ambitious plan to tackle the climate emergency by weaning the state, businesses, farms and households off fossil fuels. The government published a long-awaited report on Monday outlining more than 180 measures to curb the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and set a path for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It envisages a rise in carbon taxes, a multibillion-euro scheme to retro-fit houses, almost a million electric vehicles and a number of other measures to change behaviour by institutions, companies and individuals. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said: \u201cWe are going to change how electricity is produced and consumed, how our homes and workplaces are heated; the way we travel; the types of vehicles we purchase, and how food is produced. Above all, we are going to decouple emissions growth from economic growth \u2026 This plan represents the sum of our hopes for the future.\u201d Ireland is one of the European Union\u2019s worst carbon emission offenders and is facing fines of more than \u20ac250m for missing 2020 targets on reducing emissions and adopting renewable energy. Trends in agriculture and transport mean that emissions are set to continue rising in the next few years, risking even steeper fines for missing 2030 goals and raising questions over if and how Ireland will make its bold plan a reality. The Fine Gael-led centre-right government is entering a general election cycle and is wary of alienating poorer and rural voters with higher carbon taxes \u2013 the trigger for France\u2019s yellow-vest protests. However, support for Ireland\u2019s Green party surged in local and European elections last month, reflecting growing concern over the climate crisis. The Climate Action Plan to Tackle Climate Breakdown drew on a report published earlier this year by an all-party committee. Richard Bruton, the minister for climate action, said it put Ireland on a \u201ctrajectory\u201d to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, a significantly bolder ambition than the previous commitment to reduce emissions by 80% \u2013 but it is an aspiration, not a binding target. The report also commits Ireland to 2030 EU goals \u2013 to avert fines estimated at \u20ac6bn, it must slash emissions from 60m to 33m tonnes \u2013 by planting more trees and buying carbon credits from other countries. Other goals include: Boost the use of renewable sources for power generation from 30% to 70% of electricity. New onshore and offshore wind turbines are expected to replace peat- and coal-powered power stations. Pave the way for 950,000 electric vehicles by expanding charging networks and banning the sale of petrol and diesel cars from 2030.

Oil and gas boilers will be prohibited in new homes by 2025. Eliminate non-recyclable plastic and ban single-use plastic plates, cutlery, straws, balloon sticks and cotton buds. The central strategy involves increasing carbon taxes from \u20ac20 to \u20ac80 per tonne by 2030 \u2013 a politically fraught exercise that will require cushioning poor people and rural dwellers from higher fuel and heating prices. Another measure targets financial services: pension providers will have to disclose whether they hold fossil fuel assets, giving pension-holders the option to switch providers.

Based on the novel by Liane Moriarty, the show centers around the lives of five very different women in Monterey, California, who are connected through a murder. Since its first season, the show has been celebrated for its gorgeous cinematography, deft storytelling and excellent acting. Though the show explores many forms of deception, from white lies to infidelity, its nuanced look at the ways that domestic violence can remain hidden from public view is one of the series\u2019 most important additions to the cultural conversation.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/08/big-little-lies-reese-witherspoon-meryl-streep-nicole-kidman-zoe-kravitz-laura-dern\">Is Big Little Lies selling us a version of consumer feminism that's too good to be true?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On the surface at least, Celeste Wright, played by a tremendously subtle and talented Nicole Kidman, who won an Emmy for her impressive performance in season one, seems to have it all: beauty, wealth, a devoted husband and two playful, healthy sons. And yet, just beneath the outward veneer, we see ways that her husband, Perry is controlling, violent and completely intent on terrorizing the woman he claims to love dearly. In many of the series\u2019 most potent scenes we see the quickness with which Perry transforms from doting to monstrous, and also see the ways that Celeste is increasingly frightened by her husband\u2019s behavior, even as she struggles to keep from admitting that she (and her children) might well be in real danger.</p> \n<p>Throughout the first season, Celeste\u2019s journey is about coming to terms with the fact that the man she loves is actively abusing her. In the second, Big Little Lies considers how the effects of abuse linger even after the abuser is out of the picture. Celeste mourns Perry\u2019s death, even though she knows intellectually that she deserved a life free from his violence and rage. Her therapist wisely counsels her to understand her longing for her husband as a kind of PTSD, not dissimilar to how some soldiers find it hard to adapt to civilian life because they don\u2019t find it stimulating enough. \u201cYou miss the war,\u201d she tells Celeste, who doesn\u2019t quite believe her. She\u2019s safe but hungry for the kind of intimacy that Perry offered. Alone, in bed, she is at least able to pretend. She touches herself as she watches old Skype video footage of her husband acting towards her with kindness and affection. It\u2019s the way she wants to remember him, even if it isn\u2019t the whole truth.</p> \n<p>Big Little Lies isn\u2019t the only show to deal with women\u2019s trauma \u2013 over the years, many shows have looked at the ways that home life can play out as a battleground between husband and wife. Even though the portrayal of such a dynamic has become more nuanced, the audience response can often be depressingly tone deaf in terms of seeing violence against women as a legitimately serious issue. In Breaking Bad, for example, we saw the ways that Walt\u2019s ascent to drug kingpin was connected to the way in which he aimed to control his wife and children. Rather than open up a compelling discussion about domestic violence, many fans saw Skyler\u2019s lack of compliance in her husband\u2019s schemes as evidence that she was shrill and unlikable. Likewise, while fans of Mad Men were, rightly, furious at Betty\u2019s abusive approach to parenting, many viewers gave Don\u2019s cruel actions towards Betty a pass. She was a beautiful, kept housewife \u2013 why should she be seen as worthy of empathy? There are even fans of Big Little Lies who seem to willfully misinterpret Perry\u2019s character \u2013 if you look up YouTube discussions of the series, you encounter a number of viewers who see the relationship as sexy, rather than seriously disturbing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1c9d584c6e3f78299ddf256cdfaf2bcedab6db80\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c9d584c6e3f78299ddf256cdfaf2bcedab6db80/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicole Kidman in Big Little Lies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicole Kidman in Big Little Lies.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As Rachel Louise Snyder points out in her recent book, No Visible Bruises<em>,</em> domestic violence remains a major problem in our culture precisely because we fail to place the blame where it is due. We question why the woman doesn\u2019t leave, rather than probing why the man can\u2019t keep his violence at bay. We assume that victims must have done something to provoke the rage and we judge women who begin to placate their abusers out of fear of escalating tensions. Even hard evidence that someone has been abused doesn\u2019t seem to change our willingness to forgive the abuser \u2013 for example, even though there was tangible photographic evidence of Rihanna\u2019s injuries, there were still many fans who blamed her for making her boyfriend at the time, Chris Brown, angry. Likewise, even though their abusive behaviors have been well documented, both Mel Gibson and Charlie Sheen have their own staunch defenders.</p> \n<p>In this way, Big Little Lies\u2019 nuanced depiction of abuse offers an essential counterpoint to a culture that consistently minimizes victims and their humanity. In one particularly wrenching scene in the second season we see Celeste\u2019s therapist urge her to imagine her close friend Madeline being brutalized by her husband. Celeste closes her eyes and the viewer sees Madeline, normally bright, cheery and talkative, with Perry\u2019s hands around her throat. The image shocks Celeste so much that she starts screaming. Portraying a domestic violence survivor as a protector rather than a powerless victim not only reimagines the typical abuse narrative we are used to watching unfold onscreen, it also actively indicts the ways our culture often seeks to flatten abused characters into two-dimensional archetypes.</p> \n<p>While it\u2019s promising to see an acclaimed series tackle this type of difficult subject matter so deftly, attitudes about what constitutes \u201cwomen\u2019s entertainment\u201d may also end up limiting the cultural impact. <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/hbos-big-little-lies-review-972805\">A 2017 review in the Hollywood Reporter</a> claimed that the series was simply, \u201csoapy melodrama\u201d laundry-listing \u201cabuse\u201d along with other boring \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d like child rearing. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/big-little-lies-returns-with-more-and-still-more-of-its-exquisite-high-end-suffering/2019/06/05/eae69a42-8333-11e9-95a9-e2c830afe24f_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.2b31e3ebf2d4\">A more recent review in the Washington Post</a> says the show is obsessed with \u201chigh-end suffering\u201d and suggests that the subject matter itself is well acted but also slight. Even ardent fans often refer to the show as a kind of guilty pleasure rather than serious storytelling.</p> \n<p>Certainly, it\u2019s worthwhile to consider our collective obsession with the lives of affluent, beautiful people and how this obscures other kinds of compelling narratives. By the same token, the idea that getting over an abusive marriage is simply not an <em>important </em>narrative arc strikes me as a radical misunderstanding about what constitutes good storytelling. Celeste\u2019s journey out of her abusive marriage should be seen as just as meaningful as the story of a soldier coming out of a war. Big Little Lies\u2019 sensitive depiction of domestic violence is important, but until we see female stories as, first and foremost, <em>human</em> stories, many viewers will see Celeste\u2019s tale as just another sad thing that happens to women before looking the other way.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bc562a86-4914-4dfc-bd0c-7ab60c7a26e1\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Season two</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/10/big-little-lies-recap-season-two-episode-one-what-have-they-done\">Episode 1: What Have They Done?</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/17/big-little-lies-recap-season-two-episode-two-tell-tale-hearts\">Episode 2: Tell-Tale Hearts</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/24/big-little-lies-recap-season-two-episode-three-the-end-of-the-world\">Episode 3: The End of the World</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/01/big-little-lies-recap-season-two-episode-four-she-knows\">Episode 4: She Knows</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/08/big-little-lies-recap-season-two-episode-five-kill-me\">Episode 5: Kill Me</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/15/big-little-lies-recap-season-two-episode-six-the-bad-mother\">Episode 6: The Bad Mother</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/22/big-little-lies-recap-season-two-finale-i-want-to-know\">Episode 7: I Want To Know</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "Wednesday could well mark the start of a new period in the global economy: a decade after the financial crisis hit, the Federal Reserve could be about to cut interest rates again. The Fed, led by Jerome Powell, has to balance a US economy that economists believe is still relatively healthy with the risks to growth posed particularly by White House trade policy towards China. Investors are on tenterhooks as they await the signals from Powell and co as to whether a cut in July is likely. US President Donald Trump\u2019s willingness to impose tariffs in the dispute with China \u2013 and indeed other major trading partners \u2013 means downside risks to growth are building, according to James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, the investment bank. He said: On Wednesday, we expect the Fed to signal precautionary rate cuts are in the offing. Markets favour a 25bp rate cut in July with three additional rate cuts over the next twelve months. In corporate news, the aviation and aerospace industries have been in focus today. Lufthansa suffered a surprise earnings downgrade on Sunday, which has weighed on the German carrier\u2019s shares \u2013 as well as the broader sector. Easyjet remained the biggest faller on London\u2019s FTSE 100 with just under 90 minutes of trading remaining on Monday, down by 5%. British Airways owner International Airlines Group (IAG) lost 2.6%, while budget carrier Wizz Air lost 2.9%. The Paris air show also started on Monday, thrusting the focus onto Boeing as the crisis over grounded 737 Max planes continues. European rival Airbus stole a march on Boeing on the first day of the show, unveiling a longer-range A321 model. Meanwhile in the UK, construction and support services firm Kier Group has plans to cut 1,200 jobs and sell off or close four divisions as it tries to tackle its debt pile. Paul Mumford, fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management, said decisive actions from Kier were overdue. He said: The passing of the dividend will mean that income funds will be running for cover, not least due to the overhang from the Woodford saga. However, providing assets are not sold off too cheaply, it could be an interesting speculative buy if this is indeed the last of the final downgrades. Thanks for reading today, and please do join my colleague Angela on the business live blog tomorrow for more rolling coverage of business, economics and markets. JJ Venerable auction house Sotheby\u2019s has been bought by telecoms billionaire Patrick Drahi, in a deal that values the company at $3.7bn (\u00a32.9bn). The Sotheby\u2019s board has accepted the proposal, which would take the company fully into private ownership. Drahi, a French-Israeli billionaire, built up telecoms company Altice through a string of acquisitions. Forbes magazine values his net worth at $9.3bn. The offer price represents a premium of 61% to Sotheby\u2019s closing price on Friday, the company said. Sotheby\u2019s has been trading since 1744, and claims to be the first international auction house. It operated solely in the UK until 1955, but was then listed in New York by investors 31 years ago. Wall Street has dipped at the open on Monday, as investors eye the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest interest rates decision later in the week. The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.29% after the market opened to reach 2,890.62 points, while the Nasdaq rose by 0.29% to 7,819.29 points. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.07% to 26,106.9 points. Boeing has agreed a first-of-its-kind deal which will supply parts to British Airways for its fleet of A320 planes, manufactured by its fierce rival Airbus. The deal with British Airways owner International Airlines Group (IAG), one of the world\u2019s largest airline groups, will mean that Boeing and its partners will own and manage a global exchange inventory of parts for the airline\u2019s A320 and A320neo aircraft. The unusual deal, signed at the Paris air show, comes with Boeing trying to bounce back from the crisis which resulted in the grounding of its 737 Max fleet. The crisis has dominated the buildup to the show \u2013 with Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenberg apologising for the company\u2019s handling of the crisis yesterday. However, analysts remain relatively sanguine for the prospects for the major aerospace companies \u2013 even as geopolitical and trade tensions loom over the growth outlook \u2013 mainly because of the sheer size of the multi-year order backlogs for new jets from Airbus and Boeing. US pharma giant Pfizer has agreed to pay $10.6bn in cash for cancer drugs specialist Array BioPharma. Array specialises in \u201ctargeted small molecule medicines\u201d to treat cancer and other diseases. The boards both companies have approved the merger. Reuters reported that the US Food and Drug Administration last year approved Array\u2019s oral combination treatment for use in patients with melanoma \u2013 the deadliest form of skin cancer. The company is also testing its triple combo therapy in colorectal cancer patients. An interesting graph on the past year for airlines, or travel firms with significant airline arms, from the Share Centre here. Add to the below list Germany\u2019s Lufthansa \u2013 down by about 30% in the past 12 months, in no small part thanks to a 11% drop so far today on the back of a surprise Sunday night profit warning. Graham Spooner, investment research analyst at the Share Centre, said: Airline companies remain at the mercy of a number of external factors which they have little control over: terrorism, air traffic control strikes, volcanic eruptions, currency movements, oil prices, along with new events such as Brexit and people flying drones over airports. Many of these can lead to a squeezing of margins or wipe out profits in what is a cut-throat business. This makes life difficult for management in their quest to grow the business especially with regards to upgrading their fleet. But demand for travel is not going to go away, so long-term investors in the sector should hopefully be aware that it will be a bumpy ride and is likely to remain so in the foreseeable future. N.B.: There is one possible fly in that ointment: new regulations aimed at tackling the climate crisis (although that is still in all likelihood years away). The early mood of cautious optimism on European indices appears to have turned slightly sour as traders in London approach their lunchtime. The FTSE 100 is now in the red, down by 0.1% at 7,337 points. Bourses in France and Italy are still holding on to gains for the day, but the broader Stoxx 600 index is down by 0.1%. Defence ministers from France, Germany and Spain today signed an agreement at the Paris air show to develop a European fighter jet and air combat system, as they bolster efforts to reduce their dependency on the United States. French President Emmanuel Macron presided over the signing. Here\u2019s more from the Associated Press: The project fits in with Macron\u2019s ambition to increase European cooperation at a time when the United States under President Donald Trump is showing an increasing reluctance to support the continent militarily. The Future Combat Air System (FCAS) is not expected to be operational until 2040. The chief executive of investment funds platform Hargreaves Lansdown has delayed taking his bonus for the year until investors are able to access money held in a fund run by Neil Woodford which has suspended redemptions. Woodford, previously feted by Hargreaves Lansdown and many others as a star fund manager, made the shock decision to suspend his flagship Equity Income Fund on 3 June, following a surge in redemptions sparked by poor performance of investments. Hill has previously apologised to customers for the suspensions. In a brief statement, Chris Hill, chief executive of Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Until investors are able to access their money held with Woodford Equity Income, I will not be taking a bonus. Boeing with an order at Paris: aircraft lessor GE Capital Aviation Services has ordered 10 freighters, with the option of 15 more. The 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighter (BCF), which is making its air show debut at Paris this week, is Boeing\u2019s newest freighter product. The US company converts 737 passenger airplanes into cargo jets that are capable of carrying up to 23.9 tonnes than its previous standard-body freighters. Sterling is flat against the euro and the US dollar today; indeed, there has been little major movement in the pound since the start of June. That could change as the Conservative party leadership contest continues, and the various views on how to leave the EU are sifted. The candidates \u2013 again minus the frontrunner \u2013 are currently at a press gallery hustings. Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid and Rory Stewart have all answered questions, with Dominic Raab and Michael Gove still to come. The justice secretary, David Gauke, has mocked Boris Johnson, the absent contender, for making profligate spending promises during the ongoing Conservative leadership campaign, saying \u201cgood luck\u201d to whoever became his chancellor. You can follow all the details from the event with Andrew Sparrow on the Guardian\u2019s politics live blog. Investors are currently pricing in a one-in-five chance of a cut on Wednesday, according to CME Group\u2019s very useful FedWatch tool. The tool, which is based on investors\u2019 hedging activities, shows an 83% chance of a rate cut at the next meeting on 31 July. Investors are weighing up whether the US Federal Reserve is going to signal a likely cut interest rates on Wednesday, in what would be the first downwards move since the US economy emerged from the financial crisis. The US dollar has today remained near levels reached on Friday, after stronger-than-expected industrial output data and consumer confidence. The dollar index, measured against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, remains about 0.5% higher than its opening level on Friday. Investors generally buy the dollar if they believe US interest rates will remain higher for longer. Analysts at Creditsights, a bond ratings agency, said they expect a \u201cmore dovish outlook\u201d from the infamous dotplot, which shows the various Fed voters\u2019 interest rate expectations. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, said: Despite expecting a more dovish tone from the Fed at this meeting, investors are also focusing on how other central banks will react to the escalation in trade tensions, knowing that many will be very likely to start easing soon, too. A Paris deal: Virgin Atlantic has ordered 14 of Airbus\u2019s A330neo aircraft in a deal valued at $4.1bn (\u00a33.3bn). The airline, which was founded by Sir Richard Branson, has the option of ordering another six of the wide-body aircraft, it announced. Airbus has unveiled a new long-range version of its A321neo jet, kicking off the biannual Paris air show, which will occupy the aviation industry for the next four days. Airbus will announce close to 200 orders for the new model, according to sources cited by Reuters. The buildup to the show has been overshadowed by the controversy over Boeing\u2019s 737 Max, which has been grounded after safety features were implicated in two fatal air crashes. Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg, yesterday said the company\u2019s communications were \u201cnot consistent\u201d and that was \u201cunacceptable\u201d. Global trade tensions and a worsening outlook for global growth have also weighed on analyst expectations for the show, which traditionally offers a bonanza of deals \u2013 as well as product launches. Euro zone wages rose \u201calmost uniformly\u201d across sectors, according to Claus Vistesen, chief euro zone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, offering a \u201cdecent headline\u201d for European Central Bank (ECB) watchers. Overall, these are encouraging headlines, though Eurostat\u2019s labour cost data are horribly lagging. Looking ahead, wage growth in the [euro zone] should now be picking up, in response to a tighter labour market, but the pace remains uneven across countries. [L]abour costs in the [euro zone] appear to be accelerating, consistent with a tightening labour market. We think this trend will continue this year, and unlike in previous cycles, the ECB is unlikely to be \u201cworried\u201d about it. Euro zone inflationary pressure has been hard to come by in the last decade \u2013 just ask the European Central Bank, which spent the last four years expanding its balance sheet with quantitative easing to try to pump up the economy. Perhaps this is it? Euro zone wages rose in the first quarter of the year at the highest pace recorded since 2010, when the European commission first started collecting the data. Wages and salaries rose by 2.5% in the first three months of the year compared to the previous year, said the commission\u2019s statistics office, Eurostat. At mid-morning there is little movement on major stock market indices, with banks helping to counterbalance the under-pressure airline sector. The FTSE 100 has risen by 0.2%, while the broader Stoxx 600 index \u2013 which tracks large companies across Europe \u2013 is up by 0.1%. An interesting session coming up tomorrow for the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee of MPs: a meeting with one of the leaders of the Extinction Rebellion climate protest movement. The government has committed to cut UK carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, but some environmental groups have argued for a more ambitious target, given the scale of the climate emergency. The committee will \u201cexamine the rationale for going faster to hit the net zero target\u201d, hearing from witnesses including Gail Bradbrook of Extinction Rebellion, Isabella O\u2019Dowd, climate and energy specialist at WWF, and Baroness Bryony Worthington of the Environmental Defense Fund. Deutsche Bank appears to be on track to throw in the towel on keeping an investment bank with global scale, according to reports this morning. Germany\u2019s biggest lender has drawn up plans for a radical restructuring which will involve the creation of a \u201cbad bank\u201d to hold tens of billions of euros of toxic assets and a round of severe cuts to its investment banking operations, writes Martin Farrer. The bad bank would house or sell assets valued at up to \u20ac50bn (\u00a345bn) comprising mainly of long-term trades that have been a major drag on the struggling bank\u2019s balance sheet, the Financial Times reported, citing four people briefed on the plan. Pressure on chief executive Christian Sewing (who is still relatively new in the job) has increased since he abandoned merger talks with Commerzbank in April. You can read more here: Chinese telecoms company Huawei has been at the centre of one of the most important stories in business and geopolitics this year. That controversy has had a big impact on revenues, according to its chief executive. Huawei now expects revenues of about $100bn (\u00a380bn) annually for the next two years, compared to $105bn in 2018 \u2013 and well below targets of $125bn in 2019. Huawei\u2019s founder and chief executive, Ren Zhengfei, likened his company to a badly damaged plane Monday and said the firm will reduce capacity, according to Reuters. However, US moves to restrict its business \u2013 which have widely been seen as part of the Trump administration\u2019s trade battle with China \u2013 \u201cwill not stop us,\u201d said Zhengfei. You can read a lot more on the controversies here. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the turnaround at Kier will not be an easy task, even as it stops its dividend payouts. New CEO Andrew Davies is not stopping at just the dividend. He is taking drastic action in an attempt to avoid Kier suffering a similar fate to its doomed peer Carillion. Jobs are being slashed, the housebuilding unit is being sold and the company is prioritising cash flow. These all seem like sensible steps but delivering on this plan will not be easy. Analysts at Liberum believe Kier could get as much as \u00a3315m from a sale of its housebuilding operation, excluding \u00a360m of old land. The separate property development arm could be worth \u00a3254m, wrote analysts led by Joe Brent. Despite that potential to tackle the \u00a3920m debt pile, Liberum is cautious. There is much to be concerned about. While expected net debt of \u00a3200m seems manageable the total creditor stack is too large. Disposals can reduce debt and probably more importantly reduce leverage ratios. However, events are moving fast and disposals are likely to be complicated. (Kier is a client of both Liberum and previously quoted Peel Hunt.) The investment community is trying to work out whether Kier is doing enough to turn around \u2013 even with the painful loss of 1,200 jobs. Andrew Nussey, an analyst at Peel Hunt, the stockbroker, said Kier\u2019s plans to sell or close some parts of the business were \u201cwelcome\u201d. Kier has already received interest for its housebuilding arm, meaning it will likely go some way to reducing its debt levels. In a note to clients, he wrote: We are mindful that there are numerous potential scenarios and possibilities ahead. Despite the asset value, reassurance over trading and evidently supportive customers, the uncertainties around the period-end debt position results in us placing our estimates under review ahead of the July debt update. There has also been movement in the outsourcing sector aside from Kier: Babcock, which carries out maintenance on much of the UK\u2019s submarine and naval fleet, today confirmed that it had rejected an approach for a merger by Serco, another outsourcer. Babcock \u201creceived an unsolicited and highly preliminary proposal\u201d from Serco for an all-share combination. \u201cNo further proposal has been received\u201d, it added. In a statement Babcock said: The board of Babcock, together with its advisers, carefully considered the proposal and unanimously rejected it, having concluded that a combination of the two companies had no strategic merit and was not in the best interests of Babcock\u2019s shareholders, customers or wider stakeholders. Babcock shares had risen by 4.2% in morning trading. Jarrod Castle, an analyst at UBS, the investment bank, said the steep share fall for Lufthansa and the broader sector weakness were to be expected, given the airline\u2019s warnings. Competition in the short-haul sector is brutal. Castle said: While long haul remains strong especially on transatlantic and Asian routes, the European short haul network (especially Germany and Austria) is under increased pressure due to over-capacity and need to defend home markets. The long haul yield strength is not sufficient to offset short haul weakness and the company has revised guidance for group margin to 5.5%-6.5% from 6.5%-8% which results in a material downgrade to guidance. A few more additions to the airlines who are under pressure this morning, as the Lufthansa struggles point to broader problems in the sector. Ryanair shares are down by 4.7%. Dart Group, the owner of Jet2, lost 1.5%. Air France KLM and Norwegian Air Shuttle fell by 4.3% and 4% respectively. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said: Over-capacity in the European short haul market, intense competition and the resulting pressure on fares can be blamed for the decline in profitability, whilst rising fuel costs are an added headache. The sector always does a good job at competing away margins in the good times. No signs that anyone is prepared to reduce capacity therefore we would anticipate the wave of consolidation in European short haul is not over. Shares in airlines are on the back foot across Europe after a surprise Lufthansa profit warning overnight. Lufthansa shares fell by 11.5% on Monday morning after the German airline on Sunday lowered its profit outlook for 2019, citing intense price competition from low-cost rivals in Europe. Lufthansa slashed its pretax profit expectations from a range of \u20ac2bn to \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a31.8bn to \u00a32.1bn), compared with the previously targeted \u20ac2.4bn to \u20ac3bn. The company said: Yields in the European short-haul market, in particular in the group\u2019s home markets, Germany and Austria, are affected by sustained overcapacities caused by carriers willing to accept significant losses to expand their market share. Budget carrier Easyjet and British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group were the biggest fallers in early trading on the FTSE 100, down by 3.2% and 2.7% respectively. Shares in Wizz Air, another budget airline which trades on the FTSE 250, fell by 4.5%. Some interesting details on debt levels from the Kier statement, admitting that their business model was too reliant on taking on large debts to expand. In its statement to the stock market, Kier said: The strategic review concluded that, during this period, there was insufficient focus on cash generation and that the group today has debt levels that are too high. It also concluded that the group\u2019s portfolio is too diverse and contains a number of businesses that are incompatible with the group\u2019s new strategy and working capital objectives. Net debt at 30 June 2019 will be \u201chigher than current market expectations\u201d, Kier said, while its average month-end net debt will rise to \u00a3420m-\u00a3450m. And, meanwhile, the brief bump in the share price has reversed, with a fall of 8% at the time of writing \u2013 although as noted we should expect volatility given how far the company\u2019s value has fallen. Kier brought in Andrew Davies as chief executive only two months ago, and he has taken little time before wielding the axe. Speaking to analysts and investors this morning, Davies said that Kier is a great company at its core, but that it needs self-help. I\u2019ll put up any more comments that come through from the call, but meanwhile, here is Davies\u2019s pre-prepared statement: Since becoming chief executive on 15 April, I have visited many of our key locations and spent time with all of our businesses, meeting the leadership teams and many of our dedicated people in the process. I have also met with many of our clients. Kier has a number of high-quality, market-leading businesses, in particular Regional Building, Infrastructure, Utilities and Highways. I believe that these businesses will deliver long-term, sustainable revenues and margins and are inherently cash generative. As previously announced, I have been leading a strategic review which has resulted in the actions being announced today. These actions are focused on resetting the operational structure of Kier, simplifying the portfolio, and emphasising cash generation in order to structurally reduce debt. By making these changes, we will reinforce the foundations from which our core activities can flourish in the future, to the benefit of all of our stakeholders.\u201d Investors appear to have cautiously welcomed Kier Group\u2019s actions, with shares rising by about 2% in early trading. Bear in mind, however, that any moves on stock markets are less meaningful given Kier\u2019s decline even in the last year. Here\u2019s a chart showing the collapse in the value of a share in Kier over the past five years. Stock markets in Europe have started the week slowly \u2013 with all of the action likely as investors build up to the Fed. The FTSE 100 in London rose by 0.1% at the open to about 7,355 points. France\u2019s Cac 40 also rose by 0.1%, while Germany\u2019s Dax gained 0.2%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It has been a torrid few years for the inelegantly named construction and support services sector. Carillion went bust at the start of 2018, but other survivors are still feeling the pressure: Kier Group today revealed plans to cut 1,200 jobs to try to turn around its struggling business. About 650 staff will be made redundant by the end of the month, while the other 550 will leave by the end of June 2020. The company is also stopping all dividend payments for 2019 and 2020. The job cuts are part of plans to cut \u00a355m per year from the 2021 financial year, and the firm will also sell off or close four divisions. Kier will sell its affordable housebuilding arm, Living, and its property development unit, while its facilities management and environmental services arms are earmarked for closure \u201cin due course\u201d. The asset sales are part of plans to address Kier\u2019s debt pile, a recurrent issue for leveraged support services companies which bought multiple businesses, only to find they had limited opportunities to share costs.

Translated by Robert Fagles, one marvels at its poetic grandeur and religious ritual, especially in Agamemnon, the first play of the cycle, Though that reaches a dramatic height with Agamemnon\u2019s murder by Clytemnestra. The second play, The Libation Bearers, where Orestes decides to murder his mother in revenge for her murder of Agamemnon, moves more quickly, and, to my mind, reads better. The final play, The Eumenides, is the most frightening. Legend has it that the dance and chant where the Furies called down revenge on Orestes had women fainting in the audience. (I\u2019d bet the men were shivering in their boots as well.) There was nothing to match it in world literature until Shakespeare wrote the witches\u2019 scenes in Macbeth.</p> </blockquote> <p>Joseph Conrad\u2019s Lord Jim has wowed <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14928665\">WebberExpat</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Wow, I\u2019m still a little discombobulated with that one, which is rarely a bad sign. The book didn\u2019t really go at all how I expected it to. The direction of the narrative set in the first 50 or so pages preordained a certain finish, but the end was not what I had foreseen. Those closing pages really just knocked me on my ass ever so slightly.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3932549\">Millingabout</a> is \u201cdeep into\u201d Jerusalem by Alan Moore:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is apparently one of the longest novels ever written, which explains the tissue thin papers and small text. My god, is it good. Part anthropological dig into the residents of \u201cThe Boroughs\u201d of Northampton, part historical fiction, part fantasy, and a deep delve into life, death and the afterlife that serves as the veins of the story. Jerusalem blends real life and fiction perfectly, it truly is Moore\u2019s magnum opus. Out of all of the fascinating, mad, dark tales the author has given us, truly this is a story to rival Chaucer\u2019s Tales. It feels like the type of story that should be broken up into parts and retold as folk tales for centuries to come. Highly recommended.</p> </blockquote> <p>An unusual experience for <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/101510359\">CCCubbon</a>, when dipping into The World Turned Upside Down by Christopher Hill:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This morning I dug out Hill\u2019s excellent book on the radical ideas of groups such as Levellers, Seekers, Ranters, Diggers and Fifth Modernists, sects like Quakers, Baptists and Muggletonians \u2026 But here\u2019s the strangest thing. Something I had not noticed before. This paperback was published by Penguin in 1991. I must have picked it up in some secondhand bookshop one day and I wanted to look up a reference to Sir Isaac Newton and his belief in alchemy, page 290, when I noticed that page 288 had a different typeface. Checking further, all the pages from 240 were in the same different typeface, in fact, after 240 the page number was 129. How odd. Investigating further, I discovered that a section from a different book was included (129-160); this is from Unweaving the Rainbow by Richard Dawkins. Pages 240-288 of Hill\u2019s book missing. I have never come across such a thing before and wonder if every 1991 edition has the same error?</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI have read Old Filth by Jane Gardam,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13505124\">lonelybloomer</a> \u201cand I\u2019m in love\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is exactly the book I was looking for. What a treat to find there are two more in the trilogy! Feeling positively energised and happy with my reading habit.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12515333\">ChronicExpat</a> has just finished The Hanged Man of Saint-Pholien by Georges Simenon (translated by Linda Coverdale):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My, what a strange, surreal little book it is! As I read, I couldn\u2019t help envisioning it as a black-and-white New Wave film, filled with shadowy lighting, rapid scene changes and long tracking shots\u2026 I am enjoying my initial forays into the world of Maigret very much. Given how many of them there are, of course, I shall have to pick up the pace if I intend to get through all of them: there are 73 novels left (not to mention the short stories) which, at my current rate of three a year, will take me another 24 years to get through \u2026 and I rather think I\u2019ll be lucky to live that long.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17181788\">Eamonn Barrett</a> has a James Joyce habit:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This week every year I take <em>Ulysses</em> down from the shelf and read three or four pages from each of the 18 chapters. It\u2019s a ritual I enjoy more with each passing year and my admiration for Joyce\u2019s masterpiece grows accordingly. Such a wonderful affirmation of words, of language, and ultimately, of our humanity. It is a novel that has never been bettered and I will be forever grateful to Joyce for completing it and to Sylvia Beach for publishing it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well said.<a href=\"https://shakespeareandcompany.com/35/history/95/sylvia-beachs-shakespeare-and-company-1919-1941\"> Beach was a literary hero</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Interesting links about books and reading</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>\u201cI\u2019m the same old wreck I\u2019ve always been.\u201d Rejoice!

I must have picked it up in some secondhand bookshop one day and I wanted to look up a reference to Sir Isaac Newton and his belief in alchemy, page 290, when I noticed that page 288 had a different typeface. Checking further, all the pages from 240 were in the same different typeface, in fact, after 240 the page number was 129. How odd. Investigating further, I discovered that a section from a different book was included (129-160); this is from Unweaving the Rainbow by Richard Dawkins. Pages 240-288 of Hill\u2019s book missing. I have never come across such a thing before and wonder if every 1991 edition has the same error? \u201cI have read Old Filth by Jane Gardam,\u201d says lonelybloomer \u201cand I\u2019m in love\u201d: It is exactly the book I was looking for. What a treat to find there are two more in the trilogy! Feeling positively energised and happy with my reading habit. ChronicExpat has just finished The Hanged Man of Saint-Pholien by Georges Simenon (translated by Linda Coverdale): My, what a strange, surreal little book it is! As I read, I couldn\u2019t help envisioning it as a black-and-white New Wave film, filled with shadowy lighting, rapid scene changes and long tracking shots\u2026 I am enjoying my initial forays into the world of Maigret very much. Given how many of them there are, of course, I shall have to pick up the pace if I intend to get through all of them: there are 73 novels left (not to mention the short stories) which, at my current rate of three a year, will take me another 24 years to get through \u2026 and I rather think I\u2019ll be lucky to live that long. Finally, Eamonn Barrett has a James Joyce habit: This week every year I take Ulysses down from the shelf and read three or four pages from each of the 18 chapters. It\u2019s a ritual I enjoy more with each passing year and my admiration for Joyce\u2019s masterpiece grows accordingly. Such a wonderful affirmation of words, of language, and ultimately, of our humanity. It is a novel that has never been bettered and I will be forever grateful to Joyce for completing it and to Sylvia Beach for publishing it. Well said. Beach was a literary hero. Interesting links about books and reading \u201cI\u2019m the same old wreck I\u2019ve always been.\u201d Rejoice! The poet, lyricist and extreme talent David Berman is back. Salman Rushdie on Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s Slaughterhouse-Five. The mysterious 11-day disappearance of Agatha Christie in 1926. \u201cIf he had a third eye, it was staring at me, too.\u201d Not strictly books, but Brian Cullman writes so beautifully about the late, great Dr John in the Paris Review that you won\u2019t regret the reading. If you\u2019re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #GuardianBooks, and we\u2019ll include a selection in this blog. Happy reading!",

      "bodyText": "Children\u2019s home environments have a bigger effect on social mobility than being born into low-income backgrounds or attending underperforming schools, the education secretary has said. Damian Hinds described the issue as \u201cthe last taboo in public policy\u201d, and added that \u201cwhat parents do is actually more important than who your parents are\u201d in an unscripted speech addressed to people involved in education on Monday. Speaking before a Tory leadership election and with a cabinet reshuffle looming, Hinds said growing up in households where arguments were frequent and parents were disengaged from their children\u2019s education had the effect of nine grades at GCSE level on a child\u2019s attainment. He used the event to announce a package of measures from the Department for Education, including the launch of a programme in July \u201cwhich isn\u2019t going to be patronising and lecturing\u201d to advise parents on how to create a better learning environment at home. \u201cNobody wants to be the politician that starts talking about \u2018well you should do this and you should do that\u2019 or make it sound like they know better than a family and I don\u2019t want to be that person either,\u201d said Hinds. \u201cBut, if we are serious about social mobility we have to go there, we have to care about the home learning environment because it is going to determine the futures of a lot of those children.\u201d Other measures announced on Monday included a plan to ensure new teachers in England are trained in how to spot early warning signs of mental illness, better sharing of information between councils and schools and tackling absence and exclusions. In light of a government review published on Monday, Hinds also said school admissions codes would be changed to speed up school moves for vulnerable children \u2013 such as domestic abuse victims. Responding to Hinds\u2019 announcement, Anntoinette Bramble, a councillor and chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s children and young people board, said: \u201cSchools and councils are both struggling with insufficient budgets, which makes it increasingly difficult to give children the support they need to thrive. \u201cCouncils face an \u00a38bn funding gap by 2025, while an additional \u00a31.6bn is required in high-needs funding by 2021. It is essential that government uses the forthcoming spending review to address these shortfalls, and to ensure schools are adequately funded to support all children to achieve their ambitions.\u201d In a bid to shore up her \u201clegacy\u201d, it has been reported that the outgoing prime minister, Theresa May, is also attempting to add an extra \u00a327bn to the education budget. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the school leaders\u2019 union NAHT, said: \u201cAlthough many of these measures are positive and welcome, sooner or later the government will have to recognise that without decent levels of basic funding for schools and public services, the hard work and positive ideas of so many will simply go to waste. \u201cWe desperately need new money from the Treasury for schools and children\u2019s services, or children will continue to be failed.\u201d",

This Pennsylvania county may hold the key</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He was dismissed. He was scorned. He was laughed at. But he had the last laugh. To the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/donald-trump-supporters-hilton-new-york\">astonishment and consternation</a> of the establishment, Trump went on to offer the ultimate proof that in America, anyone can be president. He beat 16 fellow Republicans, then Democrat Hillary Clinton, to become the first person to reach the Oval Office with no political or military experience.</p> <p>Now he has to hope that lightning can strike twice. On Tuesday 18 June, Trump, accompanied by the first lady, Melania Trump, the vice-president, Mike Pence and the second lady, Karen Pence, will hold a Make America Great Again rally in Orlando, Florida, a state that is home to his Mar-a-Lago resort and is usually a pivotal battleground in presidential elections.</p> <p>This time the insurgent is the incumbent, lacking outsider status or shock value, but boasting all the advantages of incumbency, a vast war chest and buy-in from Republican party mandarins. Will he run a more conventional campaign this time? Will he heed the advice of his well-paid advisers? Has the presidency changed him at all?</p> <p>\u201cHell no!\u201d said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelSteele?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Michael Steele</a>, former chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC). \u201cI remember doing an interview the week of the inaugural and I said my assessment going into this new administration hinges on the answer to a question: will Donald Trump be changed by the presidency or will he change the presidency itself? And the answer is very clear at this point. He has fundamentally changed the presidency of the United States and it will take a man or woman of incredible character to restore it.\u201d</p> <h2>Trump\u2019s 2020 strategy</h2> <p>Back in 2016, which here in Washington feels like millennia ago, Trump ran as a celebrity businessman who glorified in trashing norms and expertise, hurling vulgar insults and sticking two fingers up to the political elite. In 2020, he will run as a celebrity businessman who glorifies in trashing norms and expertise, hurling vulgar insults and flipping off the political elite.</p> <p>Once a blur on the horizon, the outlines of his next campaign are coming into sharp focus. He has laid out his strategy for re-election in his tweets, his interviews, his speeches and his presidency thus far. It will probably be a rerun of 2016, throwing red meat to red states in a series of high-octane rallies and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/mar/18/fox-news-donald-trump-barack-obama-election\">Fox News interviews</a> that lean in to America\u2019s toxic tribalism.</p> <p>Most conventionally, Trump and his allies will tout the economy. Trump seldom misses an opportunity to talk about stock market highs, growth topping 3% or unemployment hitting the lowest rate in half a century. The White House relishes recycling old comments from Democrat Nancy Pelosi likening Trump\u2019s tax cuts to \u201cArmageddon\u201d or economist Paul Krugman\u2019s prophecy of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/opinion/election-night-2016/paul-krugman-the-economic-fallout\">\u201cglobal recession, with no end in sight\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Ronna McDaniel, current chair of the RNC, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLM_1WUUEaE&amp;feature=youtu.be\">told Fox News</a> in May: \u201cThe case is gonna be the economy, economy, economy, period.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"104b81aa5069b13abfaa0c13374d92555626e07b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/104b81aa5069b13abfaa0c13374d92555626e07b/0_32_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Steele: \u2018It\u2019s going to be playing to his nationalistic tendencies because he\u2019s an autocrat at heart and that\u2019s the space he knows and occupies.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Steele: \u2018It\u2019s going to be playing to his nationalistic tendencies because he\u2019s an autocrat at heart and that\u2019s the space he knows and occupies.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump\u2019s speechwriters are also likely to trumpet his two supreme court appointments, bipartisan criminal justice reform and an \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach to foreign policy that <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/03/18/trump-isis-terrorists-defeated-foreign-policy-225816\">he claims defeated Islamic State</a> and brought the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, to the negotiating table. But in the 2018 midterms, Trump tended to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2019/mar/07/the-teleprompter-test-why-trumps-populism-is-often-scripted\">veer off teleprompter</a> and trample on his own message.</p> <p>He talked less conspicuously about the economy than immigration, whipping up fear of caravans from Central America pouring over the border. The nativist message, with its naked appeals to white nationalism at rallies resounding to chants of \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d, seems certain to loom large again. Once again, critics say, Trump will <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/us/politics/trump-presidency-base.html\">adopt the politics of divide and rule</a>, riling up his base rather than broadening his coalition.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be immigration all the time, scaring people about those <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-moving-to-curb-asylum-system-bets-that-a-hard-line-on-immigration-can-deliver-the-white-house-again--and-put-democrats-in-a-bind/2019/05/01/ed4029f8-6b68-11e9-be3a-33217240a539_story.html?utm_term=.4c0ab37c8613\">brown folks coming across the border</a>,\u201d Steele said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be playing to his nationalistic tendencies because he\u2019s an autocrat at heart and that\u2019s the space he knows and occupies. And he\u2019s reinforced now by an attorney general who also believes apparently in the autocracy of an untouchable president.</p> <p>\u201cSo Trump, having been reinforced from a legal perspective, feels that he probably can go out there and keep swinging at the fences on these very delicate issues like immigration, which are tinged with race and xenophobia, and then in between throw in, \u2018Yeah, the economy is doing great\u2019. Because the truth of that, as I think the numbers have borne out, is while the economy is strong and GDP is great, most people aren\u2019t necessarily realising the benefit.\u201d</p> <p>Progressive groups are braced for the onslaught. Maurice Weeks, co-executive director of the <a href=\"https://www.acrecampaigns.org/\">Action Center on Race and the Economy</a>, said: \u201cI expect a lot more talk about the wall. I expect a lot more talk about Muslims. I expect a lot more outwardly racist, sexist and homophobic things and that really won\u2019t be a break from anything that\u2019s happened since before he was elected up until now. I think that he\u2019s just going to keep hammering on these things that have maintained his level of support at this scarily high level.\u201d</p> <p>Weeks added: \u201cHe\u2019s never said this meme that we\u2019ve heard from presidents, like after you get elected you\u2019re going to reach across and heal the nation by bringing them together. That\u2019s just not his game.\u201d</p> <h2>Lessons from 2016</h2> <p>Trump\u2019s first campaign thrived as much on what it was against as what it was for. He lambasted the political and media elites and, towards the end of the campaign, kept promising to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d. But enemy No 1 was his opponent, Clinton, whom he branded \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d as he spoke endlessly about her emails amid chants of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/11/trump-jail-hillary-clinton-private-email-server-us-election\">\u201cLock her up!\u201d</a> In 2020, Clinton will not be on the ballot.</p> <p>Trump already has new ammunition, however. He has been quick to seize on the ascent of self-declared democratic socialists such as the 2020 Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders and millennial New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as well as Democrats\u2019 willingness to contemplate policies such as Medicare for All and a Green New Deal.</p> <p>Whoever ultimately wins the Democratic nomination, expect to hear a reprise of Trump\u2019s applause line at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/06/trumps-lip-service-to-unity-meets-wall-of-resistance-from-the-women-in-white\">his 2019 </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/06/trumps-lip-service-to-unity-meets-wall-of-resistance-from-the-women-in-white\">State of the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/06/trumps-lip-service-to-unity-meets-wall-of-resistance-from-the-women-in-white\">Union address:</a> \u201cWe renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2582e677aa602ce1998a8fa080fafc05e1b38a3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2582e677aa602ce1998a8fa080fafc05e1b38a3c/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on 29 April 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on 29 April 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/erinmperrine?lang=en\">Erin Perrine,</a> deputy communications director of the Trump 2020 campaign, said: \u201cDemocrats are, by their own admission, embracing socialism. Whoever comes out of the primary, they\u2019re going to be broken, they\u2019re going to be beaten up, they\u2019re going to be saddled with all these policies.\u201d</p> <p>The red scare tactic was used against Barack Obama in the 2008 election after he suggested that \u201cwhen you <a href=\"https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/spread-wealth-around-comment-comes-back-haunt-obama\">spread the wealth around,</a><em> </em>it\u2019s good for everybody\u201d, but to little effect. It may gain more traction if Democrats do not choose a centrist as their nominee. <a href=\"https://johnzogbystrategies.com/about-us/\">John Zogby,</a> a pollster and author, said: \u201cThe socialism argument will try to go beyond his base to voters over 65 who do not like his behaviour but remember the cold war and worry the Democratic party may have moved too far left.\u201d</p> <p>If past is prologue, Trump will also traffic in falsehoods to win, portraying Democrats as favouring \u201copen borders\u201d and \u2013 to cement the crucial support of Christian evangelicals \u2013 as promoting <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pete-buttigieg-fox-news-town-hall_n_5ce1db9be4b00e035b928161\">late-term abortions and even \u201cinfanticide\u201d</a>.</p> <p>He will try to turn the special counsel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/25/donald-trump-mueller-report-no-collusion-weaponize-democrats-media\">Russia investigation on its head</a>, characterising it as a deep state \u201ccoup\u201d intended to thwart the forgotten men and women of America and urging: <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/investigate-the-investigators-is-new-trump-rallying-cry-to-counter-mueller-report/2019/05/04/9319b520-6db6-11e9-be3a-33217240a539_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.e44f06b10dad&amp;wpisrc=nl_evening&amp;wpmm=1\">\u201cInvestigate the investigators!\u201d</a> Although he holds the most powerful office in the world, he will revel in grievance and victimhood.</p> <h2>Resources and Russia</h2> <p>Whereas his 2016 campaign had an improvisational let\u2019s-do-the-show-right-here quality, this time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/16/trumps-2020-campaign-just-like-2016-but-now-with-more-political-data\">it will be a formidable machine</a> that can build a database of supporters and donors. It has already raised more than $100m and hired about 40 staff <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/politics/brad-parscale-trump-campaign.html\">led by Brad Parscale</a>, a digital guru promising it will \u201cbigger, better and badder\u201d by \u201cevery single metric\u201d.</p> <p>Perrine said: \u201cIn 2016, they were building the plane in play but they also managed to land the plane; they did a fantastic job. This will be a campaign befitting an incumbent president. We\u2019re going to have a massive ground game.\u201d</p> <p>Analysts agree the effort will be professionalised. <a href=\"https://eppc.org/author/henry_olsen/\">Henry Olsen</a>, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a mom-and-pop campaign like it was in 2016. Tactically, they\u2019ll be much more sophisticated because he\u2019s the incumbent. They will be better staffed with much more resources. He may go off script any time at a rally but the TV ads will be better produced.\u201d</p> <p>Most infamously, the 2016 election was scarred by the Trump team\u2019s willingness to accept help from Russia, although the special counsel\u2019s report <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/23/mueller-report-donald-trump-latest-news-collusion-russia\">did not identify a criminal conspiracy</a>, despite not entirely exonerating Trump. Could it happen again?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think after what everyone\u2019s been through over the last three years, you\u2019d have to be a complete idiot to go for something that foreigners provided</p> <footer> <cite>Henry Olsen</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Olsen said: \u201cI think after what everyone\u2019s been through over the last three years, you\u2019d have to be a complete idiot to go for something that foreigners provided. They say once bitten, twice shy. Many people have been scorched and scorched again by this, and they don\u2019t want to have third degree burns.\u201d</p> <p>But whatever guardrails are put in place, the great unknown is the candidate \u2013 capricious, mercurial, sometimes unhinged and always unconventional. Most presidents with his economic numbers would be polling much higher, but Trump\u2019s approval rating has remained stubbornly well below 50%.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.wwsg.com/speakers/rick-tyler/\">Rick Tyler</a>, a political analyst and former spokesman for Ted Cruz\u2019s 2016 campaign, said: \u201cThe campaign strategy should be, are you better off today than you were four years ago because, for many Americans, the answer would be yes. That\u2019s what I would run on, but this president is incapable of doing that.</p> <p>\u201cSo far, he\u2019s the victim and everyone\u2019s out to get to him and I don\u2019t know why that would appeal to voters. He has no message discipline, he\u2019s incapable of articulating a vision and his behaviour is obnoxious. All the economic trends point to him winning but he defies convention and I really am sceptical about his ability to cash in.\u201d</p> <h2>Can Trump cash in?</h2> <p>Trump\u2019s tenure in the Oval Office \u2013 where chiefs of staff, communications directors and others <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2018/jul/05/donald-trump-firings-resignations-white-house-full-list-latest\">have come and gone</a> with head-spinning speed \u2013 shows he is unlikely to listen to advice from his strategists. Tyler observed: \u201cIt bores him. There\u2019s no fight there. He\u2019s wired to fight. He\u2019s got to pick a fight.\u201d</p> <p>But while the 45th president is notoriously hard to tame, his campaign is likely to remain tightly controlled, hoping to steer him to victory despite himself. Even Trump will not be able to control every ad and social media post going out on his behalf.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They\u2019ll make the case that he\u2019s an asshole, but he\u2019s your asshole</p> <footer> <cite>Larry Sabato</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/\">Larry Sabato</a>, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said: \u201cThe slogan they will try to sell is \u2018You\u2019ve never had it so good\u2019. The campaign surrogates will concede he is obstreperous, outlandish and not a very nice person, and you may not love him, but you love his policies. They\u2019ll make the case that he\u2019s an asshole, but he\u2019s your asshole.\u201d</p> <p>Like Steele, Sabato does not believe the presidency has changed Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s just as obnoxious as when he was elected. In some ways he\u2019s worse because he now has power. He\u2019s not got any better. He hasn\u2019t reached out in any way; we\u2019ve never had a president like that. Every other president has tried to unite the country but he\u2019s a divider, not a uniter.\u201d</p> <p>Days after Trump\u2019s election, Obama warned \u201cthis office has a way of waking you up\u201d and \u201creality has a way of asserting itself\u201d. But not with Trump. <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/people/faculty-fellows/schiller\">Wendy Schiller,</a> a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, said: \u201cHe\u2019s more self-aggrandising than he has ever been before and he\u2019s gotten away with more,\u201d she said. \u201cBut like many other presidents, he has become very focused on winning re-election. He\u2019s not on the golf course as much as in the first year. That\u2019s the only way in which he has changed.\u201d</p> <p>Some Democrats believe that Trump fluked his way to victory in 2016, losing the popular vote but prevailing in the electoral college based on 77,000 votes across three states, and will not be able to pull off the same trick twice. <a href=\"https://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1058165\">Bob Shrum,</a> a veteran consultant on several presidential elections, said: \u201cIf it\u2019s a rerun of 2016, he will certainly lose because it\u2019s impossible to draw an inside straight twice in those three states, yet he shows no sign of broadening his appeal at all.\u201d</p> <p>Shrum, a political science professor at the University of Southern California, does think the office of the presidency has altered Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s made him worse.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a government undermining the law. It\u2019s dangerous in the sense that he worries about what would happen to him and his family if he doesn\u2019t get re-elected, so he\u2019ll do anything.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/01/donald-trump-gorka-lewandowski-hannity-fbi-treason-mueller-russia\">'No idea too lunatic': how Trump's shock troops attack US democracy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Indeed, in 2016 Trump made great play of claiming the game was rigged against him, laying the groundwork so that if he lost, he could cry foul and claim the result would be illegitimate. It is a playbook <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/us/politics/nancy-pelosi.html\">he may well reach for again,</a> especially if foreign powers seek to interfere. Trump\u2019s spurious claim of \u201ctotal exoneration\u201d in the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/16/trump-finds-putin-denial-of-election-meddling-powerful\">ongoing refusal to condemn Russia</a> for its meddling, is an ominous sign.</p> <p>Steele, the former RNC chairman, said: \u201cBe afraid, be very afraid, be worried, be very worried, because here again the president has literally gotten away with allowing a foreign government to interfere in our election and his silence \u2013 and in some cases standing right next to [Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin] and pretty much putting his arm around saying I believe him over everybody else who has incontrovertible evidence \u2013 we should be very worried.</p> <p>\u201cSo 2020 is probably the most unsafe election in our history. We haven\u2019t even begun to seriously drill down on the depths of this \u2026 But unfortunately right now we don\u2019t have the leadership in our government that is saying that nor taking steps to to do something about it.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Donald Trump launches his presidential re-election campaign this week, he will do it at a rally in the Amway Center \u2013 home to sports teams Orlando Magic, Orlando Solar Bears and Orlando Predators \u2013 in a part of Florida better known for Cape Canaveral and Walt Disney World. It will be four years and two days since the property developer and reality TV star descended an escalator at Trump Tower in New York to launch the longest of long-shot campaigns by raging against unfair trade deals and promising to \u201cbuild a great wall\u201d on the US-Mexico border. He was dismissed. He was scorned. He was laughed at. But he had the last laugh. To the astonishment and consternation of the establishment, Trump went on to offer the ultimate proof that in America, anyone can be president. He beat 16 fellow Republicans, then Democrat Hillary Clinton, to become the first person to reach the Oval Office with no political or military experience. Now he has to hope that lightning can strike twice. On Tuesday 18 June, Trump, accompanied by the first lady, Melania Trump, the vice-president, Mike Pence and the second lady, Karen Pence, will hold a Make America Great Again rally in Orlando, Florida, a state that is home to his Mar-a-Lago resort and is usually a pivotal battleground in presidential elections. This time the insurgent is the incumbent, lacking outsider status or shock value, but boasting all the advantages of incumbency, a vast war chest and buy-in from Republican party mandarins. Will he run a more conventional campaign this time? Will he heed the advice of his well-paid advisers? Has the presidency changed him at all? \u201cHell no!\u201d said Michael Steele, former chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC). \u201cI remember doing an interview the week of the inaugural and I said my assessment going into this new administration hinges on the answer to a question: will Donald Trump be changed by the presidency or will he change the presidency itself? And the answer is very clear at this point. He has fundamentally changed the presidency of the United States and it will take a man or woman of incredible character to restore it.\u201d Trump\u2019s 2020 strategy Back in 2016, which here in Washington feels like millennia ago, Trump ran as a celebrity businessman who glorified in trashing norms and expertise, hurling vulgar insults and sticking two fingers up to the political elite. In 2020, he will run as a celebrity businessman who glorifies in trashing norms and expertise, hurling vulgar insults and flipping off the political elite. Once a blur on the horizon, the outlines of his next campaign are coming into sharp focus. He has laid out his strategy for re-election in his tweets, his interviews, his speeches and his presidency thus far. It will probably be a rerun of 2016, throwing red meat to red states in a series of high-octane rallies and Fox News interviews that lean in to America\u2019s toxic tribalism. Most conventionally, Trump and his allies will tout the economy. Trump seldom misses an opportunity to talk about stock market highs, growth topping 3% or unemployment hitting the lowest rate in half a century. The White House relishes recycling old comments from Democrat Nancy Pelosi likening Trump\u2019s tax cuts to \u201cArmageddon\u201d or economist Paul Krugman\u2019s prophecy of \u201cglobal recession, with no end in sight\u201d. Ronna McDaniel, current chair of the RNC, told Fox News in May: \u201cThe case is gonna be the economy, economy, economy, period.\u201d Trump\u2019s speechwriters are also likely to trumpet his two supreme court appointments, bipartisan criminal justice reform and an \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach to foreign policy that he claims defeated Islamic State and brought the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, to the negotiating table. But in the 2018 midterms, Trump tended to veer off teleprompter and trample on his own message. He talked less conspicuously about the economy than immigration, whipping up fear of caravans from Central America pouring over the border. The nativist message, with its naked appeals to white nationalism at rallies resounding to chants of \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d, seems certain to loom large again. Once again, critics say, Trump will adopt the politics of divide and rule, riling up his base rather than broadening his coalition. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be immigration all the time, scaring people about those brown folks coming across the border,\u201d Steele said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be playing to his nationalistic tendencies because he\u2019s an autocrat at heart and that\u2019s the space he knows and occupies. And he\u2019s reinforced now by an attorney general who also believes apparently in the autocracy of an untouchable president. \u201cSo Trump, having been reinforced from a legal perspective, feels that he probably can go out there and keep swinging at the fences on these very delicate issues like immigration, which are tinged with race and xenophobia, and then in between throw in, \u2018Yeah, the economy is doing great\u2019. Because the truth of that, as I think the numbers have borne out, is while the economy is strong and GDP is great, most people aren\u2019t necessarily realising the benefit.\u201d Progressive groups are braced for the onslaught. Maurice Weeks, co-executive director of the Action Center on Race and the Economy, said: \u201cI expect a lot more talk about the wall. I expect a lot more talk about Muslims. I expect a lot more outwardly racist, sexist and homophobic things and that really won\u2019t be a break from anything that\u2019s happened since before he was elected up until now. I think that he\u2019s just going to keep hammering on these things that have maintained his level of support at this scarily high level.\u201d Weeks added: \u201cHe\u2019s never said this meme that we\u2019ve heard from presidents, like after you get elected you\u2019re going to reach across and heal the nation by bringing them together. That\u2019s just not his game.\u201d Lessons from 2016 Trump\u2019s first campaign thrived as much on what it was against as what it was for. He lambasted the political and media elites and, towards the end of the campaign, kept promising to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d. But enemy No 1 was his opponent, Clinton, whom he branded \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d as he spoke endlessly about her emails amid chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d In 2020, Clinton will not be on the ballot. Trump already has new ammunition, however. He has been quick to seize on the ascent of self-declared democratic socialists such as the 2020 Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders and millennial New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as well as Democrats\u2019 willingness to contemplate policies such as Medicare for All and a Green New Deal. Whoever ultimately wins the Democratic nomination, expect to hear a reprise of Trump\u2019s applause line at his 2019 State of the Union address: \u201cWe renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.\u201d Erin Perrine, deputy communications director of the Trump 2020 campaign, said: \u201cDemocrats are, by their own admission, embracing socialism. Whoever comes out of the primary, they\u2019re going to be broken, they\u2019re going to be beaten up, they\u2019re going to be saddled with all these policies.\u201d The red scare tactic was used against Barack Obama in the 2008 election after he suggested that \u201cwhen you spread the wealth around, it\u2019s good for everybody\u201d, but to little effect. It may gain more traction if Democrats do not choose a centrist as their nominee. John Zogby, a pollster and author, said: \u201cThe socialism argument will try to go beyond his base to voters over 65 who do not like his behaviour but remember the cold war and worry the Democratic party may have moved too far left.\u201d If past is prologue, Trump will also traffic in falsehoods to win, portraying Democrats as favouring \u201copen borders\u201d and \u2013 to cement the crucial support of Christian evangelicals \u2013 as promoting late-term abortions and even \u201cinfanticide\u201d. He will try to turn the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation on its head, characterising it as a deep state \u201ccoup\u201d intended to thwart the forgotten men and women of America and urging: \u201cInvestigate the investigators!\u201d Although he holds the most powerful office in the world, he will revel in grievance and victimhood. Resources and Russia Whereas his 2016 campaign had an improvisational let\u2019s-do-the-show-right-here quality, this time it will be a formidable machine that can build a database of supporters and donors. It has already raised more than $100m and hired about 40 staff led by Brad Parscale, a digital guru promising it will \u201cbigger, better and badder\u201d by \u201cevery single metric\u201d. Perrine said: \u201cIn 2016, they were building the plane in play but they also managed to land the plane; they did a fantastic job. This will be a campaign befitting an incumbent president. We\u2019re going to have a massive ground game.\u201d Analysts agree the effort will be professionalised. Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a mom-and-pop campaign like it was in 2016. Tactically, they\u2019ll be much more sophisticated because he\u2019s the incumbent. They will be better staffed with much more resources. He may go off script any time at a rally but the TV ads will be better produced.\u201d Most infamously, the 2016 election was scarred by the Trump team\u2019s willingness to accept help from Russia, although the special counsel\u2019s report did not identify a criminal conspiracy, despite not entirely exonerating Trump. Could it happen again? Olsen said: \u201cI think after what everyone\u2019s been through over the last three years, you\u2019d have to be a complete idiot to go for something that foreigners provided. They say once bitten, twice shy. Many people have been scorched and scorched again by this, and they don\u2019t want to have third degree burns.\u201d But whatever guardrails are put in place, the great unknown is the candidate \u2013 capricious, mercurial, sometimes unhinged and always unconventional. Most presidents with his economic numbers would be polling much higher, but Trump\u2019s approval rating has remained stubbornly well below 50%. Rick Tyler, a political analyst and former spokesman for Ted Cruz\u2019s 2016 campaign, said: \u201cThe campaign strategy should be, are you better off today than you were four years ago because, for many Americans, the answer would be yes. That\u2019s what I would run on, but this president is incapable of doing that. \u201cSo far, he\u2019s the victim and everyone\u2019s out to get to him and I don\u2019t know why that would appeal to voters. He has no message discipline, he\u2019s incapable of articulating a vision and his behaviour is obnoxious. All the economic trends point to him winning but he defies convention and I really am sceptical about his ability to cash in.\u201d Can Trump cash in? Trump\u2019s tenure in the Oval Office \u2013 where chiefs of staff, communications directors and others have come and gone with head-spinning speed \u2013 shows he is unlikely to listen to advice from his strategists. Tyler observed: \u201cIt bores him. There\u2019s no fight there. He\u2019s wired to fight. He\u2019s got to pick a fight.\u201d But while the 45th president is notoriously hard to tame, his campaign is likely to remain tightly controlled, hoping to steer him to victory despite himself. Even Trump will not be able to control every ad and social media post going out on his behalf. Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said: \u201cThe slogan they will try to sell is \u2018You\u2019ve never had it so good\u2019. The campaign surrogates will concede he is obstreperous, outlandish and not a very nice person, and you may not love him, but you love his policies. They\u2019ll make the case that he\u2019s an asshole, but he\u2019s your asshole.\u201d Like Steele, Sabato does not believe the presidency has changed Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s just as obnoxious as when he was elected. In some ways he\u2019s worse because he now has power. He\u2019s not got any better. He hasn\u2019t reached out in any way; we\u2019ve never had a president like that. Every other president has tried to unite the country but he\u2019s a divider, not a uniter.\u201d Days after Trump\u2019s election, Obama warned \u201cthis office has a way of waking you up\u201d and \u201creality has a way of asserting itself\u201d. But not with Trump. Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, said: \u201cHe\u2019s more self-aggrandising than he has ever been before and he\u2019s gotten away with more,\u201d she said. \u201cBut like many other presidents, he has become very focused on winning re-election. He\u2019s not on the golf course as much as in the first year. That\u2019s the only way in which he has changed.\u201d Some Democrats believe that Trump fluked his way to victory in 2016, losing the popular vote but prevailing in the electoral college based on 77,000 votes across three states, and will not be able to pull off the same trick twice. Bob Shrum, a veteran consultant on several presidential elections, said: \u201cIf it\u2019s a rerun of 2016, he will certainly lose because it\u2019s impossible to draw an inside straight twice in those three states, yet he shows no sign of broadening his appeal at all.\u201d Shrum, a political science professor at the University of Southern California, does think the office of the presidency has altered Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s made him worse. \u201cWe have a government undermining the law. It\u2019s dangerous in the sense that he worries about what would happen to him and his family if he doesn\u2019t get re-elected, so he\u2019ll do anything.\u201d Indeed, in 2016 Trump made great play of claiming the game was rigged against him, laying the groundwork so that if he lost, he could cry foul and claim the result would be illegitimate. It is a playbook he may well reach for again, especially if foreign powers seek to interfere. Trump\u2019s spurious claim of \u201ctotal exoneration\u201d in the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, and ongoing refusal to condemn Russia for its meddling, is an ominous sign. Steele, the former RNC chairman, said: \u201cBe afraid, be very afraid, be worried, be very worried, because here again the president has literally gotten away with allowing a foreign government to interfere in our election and his silence \u2013 and in some cases standing right next to [Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin] and pretty much putting his arm around saying I believe him over everybody else who has incontrovertible evidence \u2013 we should be very worried. \u201cSo 2020 is probably the most unsafe election in our history. We haven\u2019t even begun to seriously drill down on the depths of this \u2026 But unfortunately right now we don\u2019t have the leadership in our government that is saying that nor taking steps to to do something about it.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Roman Catholic church is opening the door to a change in its centuries-old requirement that priests must be celibate in a document suggesting older married men may be ordained in remote areas of the Amazon.</p> <p>A Vatican document has called on the church to consider the far-reaching move as a way to overcome the shortage of clergy in the region. </p> <p>Although the proposals to be considered by the Vatican concern the ordination of married men in specific communities, the opening up of debate at the highest levels of the church will boost those arguing for a general relaxation of the celibacy rule. However, the possibility of such a profound change to almost a millennium of tradition is likely to dismay conservatives.</p> <p>The recommendation will be discussed at a synod of bishops from the Amazon taking place at the Vatican in October. A working document for the event says the possibility of ordaining <em>\u201cviri probati\u201d</em> \u2013 Latin for \u201cmen of proven virtue\u201d \u2013 should be discussed.</p> <p>\u201cWhile affirming that celibacy is a gift for the church, there have been requests that, for the most remote areas of the region, the possibility of conferring priestly ordination on elderly men is discussed,\u201d the document says.</p> <p>It adds: \u201cCommunities have difficulty in celebrating the Eucharist frequently due to the lack of priests. For this reason, instead of leaving the communities without the Eucharist, the criteria of selection and preparation of the ministers authorised to celebrate it should be changed.\u201d</p> <p>The document says potential priests should be \u201cpreferably indigenous, respected and accepted members of their communities\u201d. The men could also enter the priesthood \u201ceven if they already have a family that is established and stable, in order to ensure the sacraments that accompany and sustain the Christian life\u201d.</p> <p>It has also been recommended that the synod, which takes place from 6-27 October, discusses giving women in the Amazon a greater role within the Catholic church. The document acknowledges that within the church \u201cthe feminine presence in communities isn\u2019t always valued\u201d. </p> <p>Pope Francis has previously said that he would be open to allowing married men to be ordained in areas where there is a scarcity of priests, while maintaining the requirement for most priests to be celibate.

      "bodyText": "The Roman Catholic church is opening the door to a change in its centuries-old requirement that priests must be celibate in a document suggesting older married men may be ordained in remote areas of the Amazon. A Vatican document has called on the church to consider the far-reaching move as a way to overcome the shortage of clergy in the region. Although the proposals to be considered by the Vatican concern the ordination of married men in specific communities, the opening up of debate at the highest levels of the church will boost those arguing for a general relaxation of the celibacy rule. However, the possibility of such a profound change to almost a millennium of tradition is likely to dismay conservatives. The recommendation will be discussed at a synod of bishops from the Amazon taking place at the Vatican in October. A working document for the event says the possibility of ordaining \u201cviri probati\u201d \u2013 Latin for \u201cmen of proven virtue\u201d \u2013 should be discussed. \u201cWhile affirming that celibacy is a gift for the church, there have been requests that, for the most remote areas of the region, the possibility of conferring priestly ordination on elderly men is discussed,\u201d the document says. It adds: \u201cCommunities have difficulty in celebrating the Eucharist frequently due to the lack of priests. For this reason, instead of leaving the communities without the Eucharist, the criteria of selection and preparation of the ministers authorised to celebrate it should be changed.\u201d The document says potential priests should be \u201cpreferably indigenous, respected and accepted members of their communities\u201d. The men could also enter the priesthood \u201ceven if they already have a family that is established and stable, in order to ensure the sacraments that accompany and sustain the Christian life\u201d. It has also been recommended that the synod, which takes place from 6-27 October, discusses giving women in the Amazon a greater role within the Catholic church. The document acknowledges that within the church \u201cthe feminine presence in communities isn\u2019t always valued\u201d. Pope Francis has previously said that he would be open to allowing married men to be ordained in areas where there is a scarcity of priests, while maintaining the requirement for most priests to be celibate. He has also spoken about \u201callowing space for women in the church at all levels\u201d. The church has been struggling with a shortage of priests for decades, particularly in Europe and North America, which have had sharp falls in church membership as well as devastating sexual abuse scandals. In some places, priests have been moved from sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, where the church is flourishing, to fill vacancies. Pressure to allow married priests has been building. In Ireland, where the number of parish priests fell by almost 17% in the 10 years to 2014, from 3,141 to 2,627, the Association of Catholic Priests has said the church should allow the ordination of married men to counter the \u201cvocations crisis\u201d. A survey by the association in 2012 found that almost nine in 10 Irish Catholics wanted priests to be allowed to marry. Some have argued that celibacy may contribute to the sexual abuse of children and vulnerable adults by priests, although others point out that many paedophiles and abusers are not celibate. Lifelong celibacy is a hallmark of the Catholic priesthood and a prerequisite for ordination, but it is not doctrinal. In 1075, Pope Gregory VII effectively barred married priests from ministry, a move which was formalised almost half a century later. However, eastern Catholic churches have continued to allow priests to marry before their ordination, and the Roman Catholic church allowed married Anglican priests who converted to Catholicism after disagreements over the ordination of women to continue their ministry.",

The director of documentaries about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/31/senna-asif-kapadia\" title=\"\">Ayrton Senna</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/11/the-50-best-films-of-2015-in-the-uk-no-6-amy\" title=\"\">Amy Winehouse</a> chooses to concentrate on a particular period of the player\u2019s career, his years with Napoli, which included the 1986 World Cup in which he led Argentina to victory. The before and the after \u2013 from the childhood in a Buenos Aires slum and the ill\u2011fated arrival in Europe with Barcelona to the bitter defeat against West Germany at San Siro in 1990 and the pathos of his late middle age \u2013 are also included. But what happened to him from 1984 to 1991, between the ages of 23 and 30, is the only real focus, and Kapadia makes it seem brutally short.</p> \n<p>As as admirer of the director\u2019s immersive approach to documentary-making, I found it a little overcooked. A film that begins with a lunatic car journey through the streets of Naples seldom takes its foot off the throttle. You could argue that Maradona\u2019s life was like that, but it wouldn\u2019t be entirely true. Nor was the football he played a constant barrage of thud and crunch, as Kapadia and his sound-effects team make it seem. There was poetry as well as percussion in there, although the director is right to link the two goals against England in the Azteca to the appalling smash to Maradona\u2019s face delivered by Terry Fenwick \u2013 did he really play for England, or was it just a bad dream? \u2013 earlier in the match.</p> \n<p>Kusturica found some poetry when he led the footballer out of a people-carrier and confronted him with Manu Chao leaning against a storefront, strumming a guitar and singing a song about his life: \u201cIf I were Maradona / I would live like him \u2026\u201d Maradona\u2019s eyes are hidden, but you can sense the play of emotions behind his wraparound shades as he listens to Chao sing about a life of \u201ca thousand rockets, a thousand friends\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60855b0918a2a4538f8bcaf3bb8379c201112d94\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60855b0918a2a4538f8bcaf3bb8379c201112d94/273_287_2799_1679/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Napoli\u2019s Diego Maradona alongside Milan\u2019s Ruud Gullit in a May 1988 Serie A match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Napoli\u2019s Diego Maradona alongside Milan\u2019s Ruud Gullit in a May 1988 Serie A match.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That life is Kapadia\u2019s subject, and what he captures quite brilliantly is the unsustainable pressure exerted by the sort of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/07/maradona-naples-documentary\" title=\"\">adulation Maradona encountered in Naples</a>, an endless physical assault by people wanting to touch him, to be in a photograph with him, to take away a piece of him. Those people crowd the frames of the film, eroding his soul almost as effectively as the Camorra bosses who spotted his weaknesses.</p> \n<p>His swift and premature downfall has never held back those to whom he ranks highest in a list including not just Pel\u00e9 but Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s, Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Franz Beckenbauer, George Best, Johan Cruyff, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Each has, or had, his own special story. Pusk\u00e1s crossed the iron curtain at the height of the cold war. Di St\u00e9fano represented a certain regal presence. Pel\u00e9 expressed the triumph of individual invention. Beckenbauer showed us how a defender could construct the play of the entire team. Best \u2013 the closest in several ways to Maradona \u2013 was untameable. Cruyff saw the whole thing, and knew how to reshape it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b2378cc1-8e9c-4558-992d-05fbf2532016\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cuErPYsoaR4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>And now we have the two stars whose decade\u2011long duel has offered such a study in contrast: Messi expressing his virtuosity with a unique air of humility, taking a goal of breathtaking execution with the air of a servant swigging a glass of vintage champagne, Ronaldo deploying his ego as an extra piece of technical equipment, forcing opponents to shrivel in the heat of his personal spotlight. For me, now, it is Ronaldo, inventing new ways of striking the ball while triumphing in England, Spain and Italy and with his national team, who stands supreme. And you don\u2019t have to like him to acknowledge that.</p> \n<p>Ronaldo, Messi and others of their generation know all about what happened to Maradona, how fame devoured him. His example, burnt into every frame of Kapadia\u2019s film, is the reason they are now such remote figures. No footballer earning upwards of a quarter of a million pounds a week is short of instruction on how to build the walls, physical and psychological, with which to protect themselves against their worshippers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A few hours after seeing the new film, I read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/16/phil-foden-desire-england-european-u21-championships\" title=\"\">an interview in these pages</a> in which Phil Foden, a 19\u2011year\u2011old Manchester City and England star in the making, talked about his first experience of celebrity. \u201cPeople are always watching you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what happens.

The before and the after \u2013 from the childhood in a Buenos Aires slum and the ill\u2011fated arrival in Europe with Barcelona to the bitter defeat against West Germany at San Siro in 1990 and the pathos of his late middle age \u2013 are also included. But what happened to him from 1984 to 1991, between the ages of 23 and 30, is the only real focus, and Kapadia makes it seem brutally short. As as admirer of the director\u2019s immersive approach to documentary-making, I found it a little overcooked. A film that begins with a lunatic car journey through the streets of Naples seldom takes its foot off the throttle. You could argue that Maradona\u2019s life was like that, but it wouldn\u2019t be entirely true. Nor was the football he played a constant barrage of thud and crunch, as Kapadia and his sound-effects team make it seem. There was poetry as well as percussion in there, although the director is right to link the two goals against England in the Azteca to the appalling smash to Maradona\u2019s face delivered by Terry Fenwick \u2013 did he really play for England, or was it just a bad dream? \u2013 earlier in the match. Kusturica found some poetry when he led the footballer out of a people-carrier and confronted him with Manu Chao leaning against a storefront, strumming a guitar and singing a song about his life: \u201cIf I were Maradona / I would live like him \u2026\u201d Maradona\u2019s eyes are hidden, but you can sense the play of emotions behind his wraparound shades as he listens to Chao sing about a life of \u201ca thousand rockets, a thousand friends\u201d. That life is Kapadia\u2019s subject, and what he captures quite brilliantly is the unsustainable pressure exerted by the sort of adulation Maradona encountered in Naples, an endless physical assault by people wanting to touch him, to be in a photograph with him, to take away a piece of him. Those people crowd the frames of the film, eroding his soul almost as effectively as the Camorra bosses who spotted his weaknesses. His swift and premature downfall has never held back those to whom he ranks highest in a list including not just Pel\u00e9 but Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s, Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Franz Beckenbauer, George Best, Johan Cruyff, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Each has, or had, his own special story. Pusk\u00e1s crossed the iron curtain at the height of the cold war. Di St\u00e9fano represented a certain regal presence. Pel\u00e9 expressed the triumph of individual invention. Beckenbauer showed us how a defender could construct the play of the entire team. Best \u2013 the closest in several ways to Maradona \u2013 was untameable. Cruyff saw the whole thing, and knew how to reshape it. And now we have the two stars whose decade\u2011long duel has offered such a study in contrast: Messi expressing his virtuosity with a unique air of humility, taking a goal of breathtaking execution with the air of a servant swigging a glass of vintage champagne, Ronaldo deploying his ego as an extra piece of technical equipment, forcing opponents to shrivel in the heat of his personal spotlight. For me, now, it is Ronaldo, inventing new ways of striking the ball while triumphing in England, Spain and Italy and with his national team, who stands supreme. And you don\u2019t have to like him to acknowledge that. Ronaldo, Messi and others of their generation know all about what happened to Maradona, how fame devoured him. His example, burnt into every frame of Kapadia\u2019s film, is the reason they are now such remote figures. No footballer earning upwards of a quarter of a million pounds a week is short of instruction on how to build the walls, physical and psychological, with which to protect themselves against their worshippers. A few hours after seeing the new film, I read an interview in these pages in which Phil Foden, a 19\u2011year\u2011old Manchester City and England star in the making, talked about his first experience of celebrity. \u201cPeople are always watching you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what happens. I was walking down the road after one of my first games and people were asking for a picture. From that moment I knew it was going to be hard.\u201d Already he probably understands the meaning of Maradona\u2019s most poignant words in Kapadia\u2019s film: \u201cWhen you\u2019re on the pitch, life goes away. Everything goes away.\u201d",

Luke Turner, an author who worked at Hotcourses for three years and coined the description of him as an \u201caffable lummox\u201d, says no one could have guessed then that he would end up as an MP, let alone not far from No 10.</p> <p>\u201cHe was kind of nice but had an utter lack of awareness and seeming lack of empathy with the people he employed doing endless late shifts with no overtime and getting told off for coming in one minute after 9am the next day and then giving you a company mouse mat as a thank you. He was very \u2018Tim Nice But Dim\u2019 [the Harry Enfield character], although maybe a bit smarter than that,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Other alumni of Hotcourses, a company that has reputedly made Hunt the richest member of the cabinet, say they scoffed at his recent claim to have gone through a \u201cdaily grind to stay alive\u201d when starting his own business, as they only knew him as a decidedly well-to-do son of an admiral and former head boy of Charterhouse.</p> <p>Friends say Hunt has found the best fit of his career so far at the Foreign Office, as a keen traveller who has spent periods of his life fascinated with different parts of the world, including Japan and Brazil. He has also taken advantage of the role to cosy up to serious global players, including Henry Kissinger and Donald Trump\u2019s influential son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p> <p>He has not been free of embarrassment in that job, wrongly telling Slovenia it had been a \u201cvassal state of the Soviet Union\u201d and accidentally saying his wife was Japanese rather than Chinese. His short stint in the job appears to have been flattered by the gaffe-strewn tenure of his predecessor, Johnson, and he has impressed colleagues with his natural diplomacy.</p> <p>MPs convinced by Hunt believe he is at heart one of the \u201csensibles\u201d, with a good chance of securing a Brexit deal while avoiding what he has termed the political suicide of no deal. He is now in second place with 43 endorsements, but his team still have a way to go before a place on the shortlist alongside Johnson is guaranteed.</p> <h2>The CV</h2> <p><strong>Age: </strong>52</p> <p><strong>Biographical details: </strong>Born in Surrey, Hunt was head boy at the \u00a339,000-a-year Charterhouse boarding school before studying PPE at Oxford University.</p> <p><strong>Career trajectory:</strong> After Oxford, Hunt worked in consulting and spent two years teaching English in Japan. He went on to establish a PR firm, a directory publishing business and a charity for Aids orphans in Africa. He was elected MP for South West Surrey in May 2005, and joined the cabinet as culture secretary in 2010. He was appointed health secretary in 2012 and replaced Boris Johnson as foreign secretary in 2018.</p> <p><strong>High point: </strong>Outlasting the NHS founder, Aneurin Bevan, to become the longest serving health secretary. His time in office was marked by a long battle with junior doctors, widespread cuts and parliamentary backlash over misleading pledges on NHS funding, making his longevity all the more remarkable.</p> <p><strong>Low point:</strong> Confusing his own wife\u2019s nationality. During an official visit to Beijing in his first month as foreign secretary, Hunt incorrectly described his Chinese wife as Japanese. The gaffe came shortly after he had been criticised for failing to declare business interests in his purchase of seven luxury apartments on the south coast of England.<br></p>",

Wilson says he \u201cdefinitely saw a difference before and after Leveson\u201d in Hunt, as \u201cgoing through the fire\u201d of a big political furore made him a better politician, enabling him to climb the ranks of the cabinet. Some of those who worked with Hunt longer ago certainly express surprise that he has made it so far in government. Luke Turner, an author who worked at Hotcourses for three years and coined the description of him as an \u201caffable lummox\u201d, says no one could have guessed then that he would end up as an MP, let alone not far from No 10. \u201cHe was kind of nice but had an utter lack of awareness and seeming lack of empathy with the people he employed doing endless late shifts with no overtime and getting told off for coming in one minute after 9am the next day and then giving you a company mouse mat as a thank you. He was very \u2018Tim Nice But Dim\u2019 [the Harry Enfield character], although maybe a bit smarter than that,\u201d he says. Other alumni of Hotcourses, a company that has reputedly made Hunt the richest member of the cabinet, say they scoffed at his recent claim to have gone through a \u201cdaily grind to stay alive\u201d when starting his own business, as they only knew him as a decidedly well-to-do son of an admiral and former head boy of Charterhouse. Friends say Hunt has found the best fit of his career so far at the Foreign Office, as a keen traveller who has spent periods of his life fascinated with different parts of the world, including Japan and Brazil. He has also taken advantage of the role to cosy up to serious global players, including Henry Kissinger and Donald Trump\u2019s influential son-in-law Jared Kushner. He has not been free of embarrassment in that job, wrongly telling Slovenia it had been a \u201cvassal state of the Soviet Union\u201d and accidentally saying his wife was Japanese rather than Chinese. His short stint in the job appears to have been flattered by the gaffe-strewn tenure of his predecessor, Johnson, and he has impressed colleagues with his natural diplomacy. MPs convinced by Hunt believe he is at heart one of the \u201csensibles\u201d, with a good chance of securing a Brexit deal while avoiding what he has termed the political suicide of no deal. He is now in second place with 43 endorsements, but his team still have a way to go before a place on the shortlist alongside Johnson is guaranteed. The CV Age: 52 Biographical details: Born in Surrey, Hunt was head boy at the \u00a339,000-a-year Charterhouse boarding school before studying PPE at Oxford University. Career trajectory: After Oxford, Hunt worked in consulting and spent two years teaching English in Japan. He went on to establish a PR firm, a directory publishing business and a charity for Aids orphans in Africa. He was elected MP for South West Surrey in May 2005, and joined the cabinet as culture secretary in 2010. He was appointed health secretary in 2012 and replaced Boris Johnson as foreign secretary in 2018. High point: Outlasting the NHS founder, Aneurin Bevan, to become the longest serving health secretary. His time in office was marked by a long battle with junior doctors, widespread cuts and parliamentary backlash over misleading pledges on NHS funding, making his longevity all the more remarkable. Low point: Confusing his own wife\u2019s nationality. During an official visit to Beijing in his first month as foreign secretary, Hunt incorrectly described his Chinese wife as Japanese. The gaffe came shortly after he had been criticised for failing to declare business interests in his purchase of seven luxury apartments on the south coast of England.",

      "bodyText": "Penguin Random House has asked Rabbi Baroness Julia Neuberger to independently review one of its books, Pedro Ba\u00f1os\u2019s How They Rule the World, after allegations of antisemitism made against the author continue to grow. Concerns had been raised over imprint Ebury\u2019s decision to cut 30,000 words from the English-language edition of the Spanish book, including passages about the Rothschild family, a banking dynasty often subject to antisemitic conspiracy theories. Ba\u00f1os, a colonel in the Spanish army, had also called the Rothschilds \u201cdominant\u201d and has compared them to the Illuminati in interviews. The cover of both the English and Spanish editions also features octopus tentacles \u2013 imagery long associated with antisemitism. Ebury said last week that it had undertaken a thorough review into the book and concluded that while the author \u201cclearly expresses robust opinions\u201d, they had found no evidence of antisemitism. But on Friday, Ebury asked Neuberger to conduct an external review of both the English language and a translation of the Spanish edition of the book, along with any other aspects that she feels are relevant to making an overall assessment. Neuberger \u2013 author of Antisemitism: What It Is. What It Isn\u2019t. Why It Matters \u2013 was also asked by the publisher to consult with a small number of other independent experts. Neuberger, who has not finished her review, told Radio 4 on Monday that the UK edition of the book was definitely not antisemitic and said it was unfair to describe the tentacle imagery as antisemitic, saying it had been used to denote people controlling other people since the 19th century. Looking at the 30,000 words cut from the Spanish edition, she said Ba\u00f1os\u2019 writing \u201cbetray[s] a sort of fascination\u201d with the Rothschilds, \u201cthat they\u2019re very powerful and very rich and sort of secretive\u201d. She told the Today programme: \u201cIt\u2019s not antisemitic in itself, but it hints at stuff about the Jewish conspiracies: powerful, half-hidden, secretive groups mainly of Jewish men bankers. That all goes back to something called the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which is a fake \u2013 it was proved to be a fake actually in London in 1921 \u2013 but nevertheless it keeps reappearing.. \u201cI think what would push it over the line is if he\u2019s known to have made lots of allusions, if you like, to some kind of Jewish conspiracy. Because that is antisemitism. I think where people allege that there is a Jewish conspiracy to control the world or control banking or whatever it is, that is antisemitism \u2026 because it evokes the stuff about the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and we know that that itself is pretty nasty.\u201d She said there were some questions to be asked about the edits that were made, and that Ba\u00f1os\u2019s past needed to be looked at more closely. Penguin Random House chief executive Tom Weldon said the external review was \u201can unusual step, which is a mark of how seriously we view the complaints made and the complexity and sensitivity of the issues involved\u201d. He added: \u201cWe will give full consideration to the review and any conclusions and recommendations it makes within the context of our long-held commitment to publish responsibly across a spectrum of opinion and a diversity of voices.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An independent tribunal sitting in London has concluded that the killing of detainees in China for organ transplants is continuing, and victims include imprisoned followers of the Falun Gong movement. The China Tribunal, chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, who was a prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, said in a unanimous determination at the end of its hearings it was \u201ccertain that Falun Gong as a source - probably the principal source - of organs for forced organ harvesting\u201d. \u201cThe conclusion shows that very many people have died indescribably hideous deaths for no reason, that more may suffer in similar ways and that all of us live on a planet where extreme wickedness may be found in the power of those, for the time being, running a country with one of the oldest civilisations known to modern man.\u201d He added: \u201cThere is no evidence of the practice having been stopped and the tribunal is satisfied that it is continuing.\u201d The tribunal has been taking evidence from medical experts, human rights investigators and others. Among those killed, it has been alleged, are members of religious minorities such as Falun Gong. Persecution of the group began in 1999 after it had attracted tens of millions of followers and came to be seen as a threat to the communist party. There is less evidence about the treatment of Tibetans, Uighur Muslims and some Christian sects. China announced in 2014 that it would stop removing organs for transplantation from executed prisoners and has dismissed the claims as politically-motivated and untrue. The tribunal was initiated by the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (Etac) and its members, all of whom worked without payment, included medical experts. Waiting times for transplantation offered by hospitals in China were extraordinarily low, the tribunal noted, often only a couple of weeks. Investigators calling hospitals in China inquiring about transplants for patients, the tribunal said, have in the past been told that the source of some organs were from Falun Gong followers. Both former Falun Gong and Uighur inmates gave testimony of undergoing repeated medical testing in Chinese jails. Jennifer Zeng, a Falun Gong activist who was imprisoned for a year in a female labour camp, gave evidence to the China Tribunal about what she said were repeated medical check-ups and blood tests to which inmates were subjected. She told the Guardian: \u201cOn the day we were transferred to the labour camp, we were taken to a medical facility where we underwent physical check-ups. We were interrogated about what diseases we had and I told them I had hepatitis. \u201cThe second time, after about a month in the camp, everyone was handcuffed and put in a van and taken to a huge hospital. That was for a more thorough physical check-up. We were given X-rays. On the third occasion in the camp, they were drawing blood from us. We were all told to line up in the corridor and the test were given.\u201d Zeng, who fled China in 2001, did not see any direct evidence of forced organ removal but since reading other accounts, she has questioned whether the tests were part of a medical selection process. In her statement to the tribunal, she said: \u201cInmates of the labour camp were not allowed to exchange contact details, so there was no way to trace each other after we were released. When anyone disappeared from the camp, I would assume that she was released and had gone home. \u201cBut in reality that cannot be confirmed, as I had no way to trace others after my release and I now fear they might have been taken to a hospital and had their organs removed without consent and thus killed in the process.\u201d As many as 90,000 transplant operations a year are being carried out in China, the tribunal estimated, a far higher figure than that given by official government sources.

      "body": "<p>Companies like nothing more than to refer to themselves, unironically, as families. The actors of Paris\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.comedie-francaise.fr/\">Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise</a> have a better claim than most, however: for starters, directors keep casting them as fratricidal dynasties. Just this season, the oldest active theatre troupe in the world has portrayed a tribe pushed to the brink in Ingmar Bergman\u2019s Fanny and Alexander; the murderous siblings Electra and Orestes; and the Essenbecks, the wealthy Nazi-era family that comes undone in The Damned.</p> <p>Now London audiences will get to see some of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise\u2019s star performers lock horns, too. This week, The Damned, staged by Ivo van Hove and based on <a href=\"https://emanuellevy.com/review/featured-review/damned-the-1969-viscontis-revisited/\">Luchino Visconti\u2019s 1969 film</a>, will open at London\u2019s Barbican. It is the French company\u2019s first UK tour in nearly two decades. The production is hardly traditional, with spare sets and extensive live filming, yet as an intergenerational tragedy, it hits the mark chillingly.</p> <p>It\u2019s a fitting vehicle for the singular, self-managed troupe, where the actors are the main stakeholders. \u201cNo one really knows this house,\u201d suggests Christophe Montenez, who joined five years ago and plays the decadent Martin von Essenbeck in The Damned. \u201cPeople are fascinated, scared \u2013 they think it\u2019s a nest of vipers or the Atreides\u201d (in Greek mythology, the less-than-peaceful family of Electra and Orestes). I\u2019m assured by everyone I meet that this is an old-fashioned idea. \u201cIt really is a family,\u201d Montenez says, unprompted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8c391780d6ca9427d6fcf1c845cb4514adfec386\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c391780d6ca9427d6fcf1c845cb4514adfec386/0_176_1920_2711/708.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We\u2019ve played lovers, siblings, cousins, we\u2019ve sweated and been naked on stage together\u2019 \u2026 Eric Ruf.\" width=\"708\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019ve played lovers, siblings, cousins, we\u2019ve sweated and been naked on stage together\u2019 \u2026 Eric Ruf.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brigitte Enguerand/Divergence</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise certainly boasts an impressive ancestry. Based at the Salle Richelieu, near the Louvre, the company has weathered over three centuries of artistic and political storms. In the hallway next to the office of the current director, Eric Ruf, known as the administrator, a list of 51 names is carved into a marble wall. They represent every Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise dean (an important office, held by the longest-serving company member) since 1658. The first is none other than the playwright Moli\u00e8re \u2013 an honorary father figure, since the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise was officially born in 1680, the fusion of his troupe and another.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes young directors who come in think: that\u2019s nice, but I have my own collective,\u201d says Ruf, a Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise actor and set designer appointed administrator in 2014. \u201cI tell them that they\u2019re going to work with the oldest collective in the world. If you like to direct people who know each other, well, we\u2019ve played lovers, siblings, cousins, we\u2019ve sweated and been naked on stage together.\u201d</p> <p>As we sit around a large table covered in notes and documents for an upcoming production of <a href=\"https://www.comedie-francaise.fr/en/event-article-past/la-vie-de-galilee\">Brecht\u2019s Life of Galileo</a>, Ruf\u2019s deep, melodious voice strikes me anew. After joining the company in 1993, he spent two decades acting in everything from Moli\u00e8re and Victor Hugo to Tennessee Williams, and it shows: he phrases his answers with warm elegance and the odd literary flourish. \u201cThe administrator who hired me said that a Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise actor is an operator of the verb, and I like that idea,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The company\u2019s reverence for texts makes it an outlier in contemporary French theatre. For the past few decades, experimental directors have received the lion\u2019s share of attention in the country, and steered critical attention away from a play\u2019s integrity. As the last permanent troupe in France, the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise plays a vital role in passing down the craft that goes into performing French dramatic verse, from Racine\u2019s hieratic alexandrines to Paul Claudel\u2019s free verse. To this day, the literary merit of every play that joins the repertoire is assessed by a reading committee, although the rules have been relaxed to allow adaptations such as The Damned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ee42bb51daa16f4b920729a618f22e9c9b13a89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ee42bb51daa16f4b920729a618f22e9c9b13a89/0_0_5506_3700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guillaume Gallienne (centre) and members of the company in Life of Galileo by Bertolt Brecht.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guillaume Gallienne (centre) and members of the company in Life of Galileo by Bertolt Brecht.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: St\u00e9phane de Sakutin/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It isn\u2019t the only seemingly quaint house tradition. Company members are split into two groups, the <em>pensionnaires </em>and the <em>soci\u00e9taires</em>. <em>Pensionnaires </em>such as Montenez are hired by the administrator on one-year contracts, while the 39 <em>soci\u00e9taires </em>are seasoned actors who own stakes in the troupe. Every artist\u2019s performance is reviewed yearly by a committee composed of the administrator, the dean and eight <em>soci\u00e9taires</em>, who have the power to let their peers go and to promote the <em>pensionnaires</em>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s extremely difficult, but it\u2019s better to have the opinion of 10 people than just one person,\u201d says Claude Mathieu, the current dean, who trained with the legendary French director Antoine Vitez before joining in 1979. \u201cOtherwise, like every other company, it would be made up of the director\u2019s own actors.\u201d Some dismissals still make headlines, not least when they involve popular performers. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the actor: it\u2019s also the <em>soci\u00e9taire</em>, the person. An older company member who can\u2019t stand the younger ones may be an issue.\u201d</p> <p>The cliche of the airhead actor doesn\u2019t fly at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise. The board is composed entirely of <em>soci\u00e9taires</em>, who approve the budget and other strategic decisions. If a company member misses a performance without a good reason, he or she must pay the lost box-office revenue, and the repertoire system is intense, with several productions on at once. \u201cBefore I joined, the stage had a sacred aspect for me. I had a lot of rituals, I would put on a lot of creams,\u201d the 30-year-old Montenez says with a laugh. \u201cHere, you\u2019re on so much that you develop an instinct on stage.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29f432f478066e1f89ca5eaf96703765b7e153d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29f432f478066e1f89ca5eaf96703765b7e153d2/0_313_4724_2836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018You\u2019re on stage so much you develop an instinct\u2019 \u2026The Damned.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You\u2019re on stage so much you develop an instinct\u2019 \u2026The Damned.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jan Versweyveld</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a utopian model that may well be on trend again, as the egalitarian theatre collectives that have sprung up in France in recent years suggest. The Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise\u2019s motto is \u201cSimul et singulis\u201d \u2013 together yet individual. \u201cThere was a stronger hierarchy when I first joined, but productions are collective efforts these days. Everyone is equal, whether you\u2019re 25 or 70 years old,\u201d Mathieu explains. \u201cA lazy actor is going to have a hard time. We have a joke: you\u2019re very <em>singulis </em>at the moment, you\u2019re just thinking about yourself!\u201d</p> <p>The Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise continues to produce its fair share of stars. Among the cast of The Damned, Denis Podalyd\u00e8s and Guillaume Gallienne are household names in France, with film careers on the side. Elsa Lepoivre, who plays Sophie von Essenbeck, is widely considered one of the finest stage actors of her generation. Montenez is only the latest to make a name for himself, with a TV series in the works.</p> <p>This actor-led setup means the administrator has less power than most artistic directors, despite being responsible for programming. The system favours insiders who can navigate the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise\u2019s checks and balances, and after a slow start, Ruf\u2019s leadership has blossomed into a steady success. Prestigious international directors, from Van Hove to Thomas Ostermeier, have made their house debuts, while Ruf has initiated a push for more diversity, on stage and in the wings.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lazy actor is going to have a hard time here</p> <footer> <cite>Claude Mathieu</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His rule of gender parity among the directors working across the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise\u2019s three stages is especially meaningful in France, where there is still resistance to any serious examination of institutional sexism. When I tell him he is setting an example, he replies with characteristic measure. \u201cI\u2019m lucky: there are plenty of impressive female directors in the younger generation. Some tell me it\u2019s not enough, that there aren\u2019t enough women on the main stage. I agree, but I don\u2019t want to set quotas, I want to do things intelligently. It\u2019s not easy to harness the Salle Richelieu: it can burn someone.\u201d</p> <p>The administrator sees racial diversity on stage as an even longer game. Despite a couple of recent hires, the company remains overwhelmingly white, with limited turnover. When Ruf cast Ga\u00ebl Kalimindi, a black actor, as the son of the blond Elsa Lepoivre in Hugo\u2019s Lucr\u00e8ce Borgia, there was some pushback from within the institution. \u201cThe audience doesn\u2019t care, but some professionals still tell me: yes, but if the mother is white \u2026\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/10/the-damned-ivo-van-hove-avignon-festival\">The Damned five-star review \u2013 Van Hove's chillingly prescient masterstroke</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ruf\u2019s contract is up in August, but if it is renewed for a second five-year term, as is highly likely, he will steward the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise through another momentous transition. In 2024, the company is scheduled to swap its two smaller stages (the Studio-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, underneath the Louvre Pyramid, and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Vieux-Colombier) for a pair of newly built ones at the Cit\u00e9 du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, a multipurpose site currently being renovated in the north of Paris. The larger, more flexible auditoriums should bring in much-needed additional revenue, since the institution\u2019s annual public grant of \u20ac24.5m hasn\u2019t kept up with its labour costs (around \u20ac29m).</p> <p>There will be challenges ahead for France\u2019s premier theatre family on that front, but in the meantime, Ruf would be grateful if everyone stopped asking how he intends to rejuvenate the supposedly \u201cdusty\u201d institution. \u201cThere is an anchor in our longevity, a weightiness that can be fertile. If this company has been active since 1680, isn\u2019t it somewhat exemplary?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The Damned is at the <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2019/event/comedie-francaise-the-damned\">Barbican, London</a>, 19-25 June.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Companies like nothing more than to refer to themselves, unironically, as families. The actors of Paris\u2019s Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise have a better claim than most, however: for starters, directors keep casting them as fratricidal dynasties. Just this season, the oldest active theatre troupe in the world has portrayed a tribe pushed to the brink in Ingmar Bergman\u2019s Fanny and Alexander; the murderous siblings Electra and Orestes; and the Essenbecks, the wealthy Nazi-era family that comes undone in The Damned. Now London audiences will get to see some of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise\u2019s star performers lock horns, too. This week, The Damned, staged by Ivo van Hove and based on Luchino Visconti\u2019s 1969 film, will open at London\u2019s Barbican. It is the French company\u2019s first UK tour in nearly two decades. The production is hardly traditional, with spare sets and extensive live filming, yet as an intergenerational tragedy, it hits the mark chillingly. It\u2019s a fitting vehicle for the singular, self-managed troupe, where the actors are the main stakeholders. \u201cNo one really knows this house,\u201d suggests Christophe Montenez, who joined five years ago and plays the decadent Martin von Essenbeck in The Damned. \u201cPeople are fascinated, scared \u2013 they think it\u2019s a nest of vipers or the Atreides\u201d (in Greek mythology, the less-than-peaceful family of Electra and Orestes). I\u2019m assured by everyone I meet that this is an old-fashioned idea. \u201cIt really is a family,\u201d Montenez says, unprompted. The Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise certainly boasts an impressive ancestry. Based at the Salle Richelieu, near the Louvre, the company has weathered over three centuries of artistic and political storms. In the hallway next to the office of the current director, Eric Ruf, known as the administrator, a list of 51 names is carved into a marble wall. They represent every Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise dean (an important office, held by the longest-serving company member) since 1658. The first is none other than the playwright Moli\u00e8re \u2013 an honorary father figure, since the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise was officially born in 1680, the fusion of his troupe and another. \u201cSometimes young directors who come in think: that\u2019s nice, but I have my own collective,\u201d says Ruf, a Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise actor and set designer appointed administrator in 2014. \u201cI tell them that they\u2019re going to work with the oldest collective in the world. If you like to direct people who know each other, well, we\u2019ve played lovers, siblings, cousins, we\u2019ve sweated and been naked on stage together.\u201d As we sit around a large table covered in notes and documents for an upcoming production of Brecht\u2019s Life of Galileo, Ruf\u2019s deep, melodious voice strikes me anew. After joining the company in 1993, he spent two decades acting in everything from Moli\u00e8re and Victor Hugo to Tennessee Williams, and it shows: he phrases his answers with warm elegance and the odd literary flourish. \u201cThe administrator who hired me said that a Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise actor is an operator of the verb, and I like that idea,\u201d he says. The company\u2019s reverence for texts makes it an outlier in contemporary French theatre. For the past few decades, experimental directors have received the lion\u2019s share of attention in the country, and steered critical attention away from a play\u2019s integrity. As the last permanent troupe in France, the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise plays a vital role in passing down the craft that goes into performing French dramatic verse, from Racine\u2019s hieratic alexandrines to Paul Claudel\u2019s free verse. To this day, the literary merit of every play that joins the repertoire is assessed by a reading committee, although the rules have been relaxed to allow adaptations such as The Damned. It isn\u2019t the only seemingly quaint house tradition. Company members are split into two groups, the pensionnaires and the soci\u00e9taires. Pensionnaires such as Montenez are hired by the administrator on one-year contracts, while the 39 soci\u00e9taires are seasoned actors who own stakes in the troupe. Every artist\u2019s performance is reviewed yearly by a committee composed of the administrator, the dean and eight soci\u00e9taires, who have the power to let their peers go and to promote the pensionnaires. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely difficult, but it\u2019s better to have the opinion of 10 people than just one person,\u201d says Claude Mathieu, the current dean, who trained with the legendary French director Antoine Vitez before joining in 1979. \u201cOtherwise, like every other company, it would be made up of the director\u2019s own actors.\u201d Some dismissals still make headlines, not least when they involve popular performers. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the actor: it\u2019s also the soci\u00e9taire, the person. An older company member who can\u2019t stand the younger ones may be an issue.\u201d The cliche of the airhead actor doesn\u2019t fly at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise. The board is composed entirely of soci\u00e9taires, who approve the budget and other strategic decisions. If a company member misses a performance without a good reason, he or she must pay the lost box-office revenue, and the repertoire system is intense, with several productions on at once. \u201cBefore I joined, the stage had a sacred aspect for me. I had a lot of rituals, I would put on a lot of creams,\u201d the 30-year-old Montenez says with a laugh. \u201cHere, you\u2019re on so much that you develop an instinct on stage.\u201d It\u2019s a utopian model that may well be on trend again, as the egalitarian theatre collectives that have sprung up in France in recent years suggest. The Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise\u2019s motto is \u201cSimul et singulis\u201d \u2013 together yet individual. \u201cThere was a stronger hierarchy when I first joined, but productions are collective efforts these days. Everyone is equal, whether you\u2019re 25 or 70 years old,\u201d Mathieu explains. \u201cA lazy actor is going to have a hard time. We have a joke: you\u2019re very singulis at the moment, you\u2019re just thinking about yourself!\u201d The Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise continues to produce its fair share of stars. Among the cast of The Damned, Denis Podalyd\u00e8s and Guillaume Gallienne are household names in France, with film careers on the side. Elsa Lepoivre, who plays Sophie von Essenbeck, is widely considered one of the finest stage actors of her generation. Montenez is only the latest to make a name for himself, with a TV series in the works. This actor-led setup means the administrator has less power than most artistic directors, despite being responsible for programming. The system favours insiders who can navigate the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise\u2019s checks and balances, and after a slow start, Ruf\u2019s leadership has blossomed into a steady success. Prestigious international directors, from Van Hove to Thomas Ostermeier, have made their house debuts, while Ruf has initiated a push for more diversity, on stage and in the wings. His rule of gender parity among the directors working across the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise\u2019s three stages is especially meaningful in France, where there is still resistance to any serious examination of institutional sexism. When I tell him he is setting an example, he replies with characteristic measure. \u201cI\u2019m lucky: there are plenty of impressive female directors in the younger generation. Some tell me it\u2019s not enough, that there aren\u2019t enough women on the main stage. I agree, but I don\u2019t want to set quotas, I want to do things intelligently. It\u2019s not easy to harness the Salle Richelieu: it can burn someone.\u201d The administrator sees racial diversity on stage as an even longer game. Despite a couple of recent hires, the company remains overwhelmingly white, with limited turnover. When Ruf cast Ga\u00ebl Kalimindi, a black actor, as the son of the blond Elsa Lepoivre in Hugo\u2019s Lucr\u00e8ce Borgia, there was some pushback from within the institution. \u201cThe audience doesn\u2019t care, but some professionals still tell me: yes, but if the mother is white \u2026\u201d Ruf\u2019s contract is up in August, but if it is renewed for a second five-year term, as is highly likely, he will steward the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise through another momentous transition. In 2024, the company is scheduled to swap its two smaller stages (the Studio-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, underneath the Louvre Pyramid, and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Vieux-Colombier) for a pair of newly built ones at the Cit\u00e9 du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, a multipurpose site currently being renovated in the north of Paris. The larger, more flexible auditoriums should bring in much-needed additional revenue, since the institution\u2019s annual public grant of \u20ac24.5m hasn\u2019t kept up with its labour costs (around \u20ac29m). There will be challenges ahead for France\u2019s premier theatre family on that front, but in the meantime, Ruf would be grateful if everyone stopped asking how he intends to rejuvenate the supposedly \u201cdusty\u201d institution. \u201cThere is an anchor in our longevity, a weightiness that can be fertile. If this company has been active since 1680, isn\u2019t it somewhat exemplary?\u201d \u2022 The Damned is at the Barbican, London, 19-25 June.",

Hong Kong protesters reject apology and vow to continue Following protests that attracted up to 2 million people, demonstrators in Hong Kong are calling on the government to withdraw the controversial extradition bill allowing people to be sent to mainland China where their legal protections are not guaranteed. They are also demanding that the crackdown on activists ends and for police to be held accountable for brutal tactics at previous protests. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, apologised and suspended the extradition law, but has refused demands to resign. Joshua Wong, a prominent activist during Hong Kong\u2019s last major protests in 2014, was released from prison on Monday and said Lam was \u201cno longer qualified to be Hong Kong\u2019s leader\u201d. \u2018First martyr\u2019. An unknown male activist, 35, fell to his death after unfurling a protest banner on scaffolding near government headquarters, becoming the first to die during the protests that have engulfed the territory. Netanyahu names settlement in Golan Heights after Trump The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, unveiled the new name of a hinterland settlement in the Golan Heights, \u201cRamat Trump\u201d \u2013 or Trump Heights \u2013 built on land captured from Syria in 1967. As proceedings got under way, the Guardian\u2019s Oliver Holmes spoke to residents with Quique Kierszenbaum. \u201cI think it will mean something for him, that there is a place in the world, far away from the States, with his name,\u201d said Naomi Ish Shalom, an organic farmer. Scant recognition. Israel\u2019s claim to the area has been rebuked by the UN and never internationally recognised, but was suddenly given some approval by Trump in a tweet earlier this year. Families of victims demand answers from Boeing over crashes Relatives of those who died in 737 Max crashes say they should be consulted on whether the plane flies again and are demanding clarity as they file lawsuits against Boeing, and the airlines involved. Family involvement in previous air crash investigations and hearings has often come later, but with the plane potentially back in service by the end of 2019, the relatives are channeling their grief. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want there to be a third crash,\u201d said Michael Stumo, the father of 24-year-old Samya, who was on her way to start a healthcare job in Kenya. \u2018We will improve\u2019. Head of Boeing admits company\u2019s communications after the 737 Max jet crisis that grounded the entire fleet were \u201cnot consistent\u201d and that was \u201cunacceptable\u201d. US waste travels across world and overwhelms poorest nations Today we are launching our new series United States of Plastic with an exclusive investigation into where the US\u2019s waste goes after it\u2019s thrown away. We\u2019re also looking at some of the biggest recycling myths, and why you\u2019re probably doing it wrong. You can read more about the series and why we\u2019re launching it here. Did you know. The equivalent of 68,000 shipping containers of American plastic recycling were exported last year to developing countries that mismanage more than 70% of their own plastic waste. Crib sheet The UN warned Myanmar that it would withdraw support in Rakhine state to avoid complicity in \u201cpolicy of apartheid\u201d for Rohingya Muslims since the current government policy \u201crisks entrenching segregation\u201d. France is to declare a state of natural disaster after deadly flash storms ripped through the south-east and ruined crops in the \u201corchard of France\u201d as pingpong-ball-sized hailstones rained down in places. The motoring show Top Gear sprayed LGBT pride flags on cars used in Brunei in a gesture of opposition to the country\u2019s threat to punish gay sex with death by stoning. The presenter Andrew Flintoff explains. Almost half of Britons socialise with family and friends at most once a month, according to a survey, with the lack of human interaction said to be causing the nation\u2019s sense of wellbeing to dwindle. Must reads Fears that sleep trackers can have the opposite effect on the zzzs Chronically underslept consumers are fuelling rapid growth in the sleep aids market, but sleep trackers could lead to a rise in insomnia, as those who use the gadgets report that it makes sleeping even more difficult, while there are fears over the emergence of orthosomnia, a newly observed condition described as a quest to achieve perfect sleep. The enduring magic of the Wizard of Oz \u201cSomewhere, over the rainbow, skies are blue / And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true,\u201d sings Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, the 1939 classic that inspired everyone from David Lynch to Salman Rushdie and has turned 80 today.

Back in 2013, images of a woman giving birth in a hospital courtyard after being turned away by staff shone a light on women\u2019s experiences, but the same issues persist, as Nina Lakhani reports.

Today\u2019s criminalization of humanitarian assistance is sustained, widespread, and growing \u2026 Who needs an invader when we can destroy ourselves, perfectly well, one trial of a humanitarian volunteer at a time.

      "body": "<p>On 17 August 1603 \u2013 they chose the day for its excellent astrological alignments of Jupiter, Saturn and Mercury \u2013 a group of friends got together in Rome to found a society to study and record the natural world. They wanted to emulate the lynx, believed to be the most keen-eyed of animals, so they called themselves the Academy of Linceans. Their mission was to look at nature with the bright, sharp eye of the night-hunting cat.</p> <p>The Barber Institute\u2019s exhibition of the pioneering masterpieces of natural history this secretive society commissioned is a journey to the dawn of modern science. Keen eyes look back at you everywhere. A pelican glares with a fierce, blue-pupilled orb, surrounded by circles of pink skin that resemble the orbits of planets. A civet stares out of another of these bold yet precise watercolours while also turning its anus to face the onlooker \u2013 the Linceans were interested in its anal musk gland as a source of precious scent.</p> <p>These sharply coloured drawings are the ancestors of every modern nature photograph and film. When a television documentary watches a sloth painstakingly make its way up a rainforest tree, the camera crew are following in the footsteps of the anonymous artist who produced the picture here of a South American sloth. It is actually one of the less accurate studies on show, for the Academy of Linceans didn\u2019t have a living sloth to study, just bits of bone and skin and travellers\u2019 tales from the New World.</p> <p>A drawing that shows corals and rocks looks, at first sight, like a modern scientific classification of nature, but these treasures are arranged partly by magical potency: coral was an aphrodisiac; polished jasper was health-promoting. Yet among the occult gems in this watercolour are fossils including a spiralling ammonite shell, ancient shark\u2019s teeth, and a thick tube of fossil ivory the academy mistook at first for a giant\u2019s bone before deciding it belonged to some kind of elephant \u2013 correctly, for it is a mammoth fossil.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ba2b9d5d4bac700ec8b1eee8ec8bb1b42a65895\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ba2b9d5d4bac700ec8b1eee8ec8bb1b42a65895/0_0_3859_3751/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fingered Lemon (Citrus limon), c 1640, by Vincenzo Leonardi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"972\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Startling and alien \u2026 Fingered Lemon (Citrus limon), c 1640, by Vincenzo Leonardi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Royal Collection Trust/\u00a9 Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is impossible to overstate the importance of these masterpieces of scientific art, yet until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/feb/01/featuresreviews.guardianreview22\">art historian David Freedberg</a> chanced on them in a cupboard in Windsor Castle in 1986, they lay neglected for centuries, their connection with one of Europe\u2019s first scientific academies forgotten. The new kind of art initiated by the lynxes became part of the \u201cpaper museum\u201d of Cassiano dal Pozzo, a 17th-century lawyer, diplomat and scientific amateur. These albums of intricate learning eventually found their way into Britain\u2019s Royal Collection. This show has been selected by art history and curating students at Birmingham University from the huge hoard in the Royal Library \u2013 and they\u2019ve done a cracking job. There is even a case full of real fossils and minerals from the university geology museum to compare with Cassiano\u2019s virtual cabinet of curiosities.</p> <p>The images are glowing relics of a revolutionary moment in art and science. In the 1600s, science was a visual enterprise. The most famous member of the Academy of Linceans was the pioneering astronomer and physicist Galileo Galilei. In 1610, Galileo published a small book entitled The Starry Messenger, in which he not only describes but illustrates with his own sketches what he saw when he first pointed a telescope at the night sky. His rugged drawings of the moon\u2019s crater-scarred surface turned cosmology on its head, because up to then it was thought to be just a heavenly light in the sky.

      "bodyText": "On 17 August 1603 \u2013 they chose the day for its excellent astrological alignments of Jupiter, Saturn and Mercury \u2013 a group of friends got together in Rome to found a society to study and record the natural world. They wanted to emulate the lynx, believed to be the most keen-eyed of animals, so they called themselves the Academy of Linceans. Their mission was to look at nature with the bright, sharp eye of the night-hunting cat. The Barber Institute\u2019s exhibition of the pioneering masterpieces of natural history this secretive society commissioned is a journey to the dawn of modern science. Keen eyes look back at you everywhere. A pelican glares with a fierce, blue-pupilled orb, surrounded by circles of pink skin that resemble the orbits of planets. A civet stares out of another of these bold yet precise watercolours while also turning its anus to face the onlooker \u2013 the Linceans were interested in its anal musk gland as a source of precious scent. These sharply coloured drawings are the ancestors of every modern nature photograph and film. When a television documentary watches a sloth painstakingly make its way up a rainforest tree, the camera crew are following in the footsteps of the anonymous artist who produced the picture here of a South American sloth. It is actually one of the less accurate studies on show, for the Academy of Linceans didn\u2019t have a living sloth to study, just bits of bone and skin and travellers\u2019 tales from the New World. A drawing that shows corals and rocks looks, at first sight, like a modern scientific classification of nature, but these treasures are arranged partly by magical potency: coral was an aphrodisiac; polished jasper was health-promoting. Yet among the occult gems in this watercolour are fossils including a spiralling ammonite shell, ancient shark\u2019s teeth, and a thick tube of fossil ivory the academy mistook at first for a giant\u2019s bone before deciding it belonged to some kind of elephant \u2013 correctly, for it is a mammoth fossil. It is impossible to overstate the importance of these masterpieces of scientific art, yet until art historian David Freedberg chanced on them in a cupboard in Windsor Castle in 1986, they lay neglected for centuries, their connection with one of Europe\u2019s first scientific academies forgotten. The new kind of art initiated by the lynxes became part of the \u201cpaper museum\u201d of Cassiano dal Pozzo, a 17th-century lawyer, diplomat and scientific amateur. These albums of intricate learning eventually found their way into Britain\u2019s Royal Collection. This show has been selected by art history and curating students at Birmingham University from the huge hoard in the Royal Library \u2013 and they\u2019ve done a cracking job. There is even a case full of real fossils and minerals from the university geology museum to compare with Cassiano\u2019s virtual cabinet of curiosities. The images are glowing relics of a revolutionary moment in art and science. In the 1600s, science was a visual enterprise. The most famous member of the Academy of Linceans was the pioneering astronomer and physicist Galileo Galilei. In 1610, Galileo published a small book entitled The Starry Messenger, in which he not only describes but illustrates with his own sketches what he saw when he first pointed a telescope at the night sky. His rugged drawings of the moon\u2019s crater-scarred surface turned cosmology on its head, because up to then it was thought to be just a heavenly light in the sky. By showing that our satellite is a solid rock in space, Galileo provided mighty evidence for the Copernican belief that Earth, too, is a rocky sphere in orbit around the sun. The same kind of open, questing eye with which Galileo pioneered modern empirical science is in evidence everywhere in this show. It is especially powerful in the drawings of Vincenzo Leonardi. His watercolour of a peculiarly shaped lemon that looks as though it has fingers or tentacles is as startling and alien as a glimpse of a remote planet\u2019s surface. This is a great work of art. It doesn\u2019t take anything about a lemon for granted, but explores the mysterious contours of this unique, sui generis, mutant lemon. This is a new way of looking, refusing to be bound by convention, expectation or politeness. In another eerily objective watercolour, Leonardi looks at fragments of a dissected porcupine.

      "body": "<p>After 18 months stranded on a cargo vessel miles off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, with little food or water, no wages and little means of communication, Captain Ayyappan Swaminathan\u2019s ordeal is finally over.</p> \n<p>In April, the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/apr/12/abandoned-at-sea-the-crews-cast-adrift-without-food-fuel-or-pay\">reported the story of Ayyappan</a> and his 10-strong crew, one of the most extreme cases of seafarer abandonment in recent years.</p> \n<p>On Sunday night, Ayyappan said his \u201ccup is overflowing\u201d with happiness after an emotional reunion with the family he hasn\u2019t seen since he left India, in January 2017. Speaking from his home in Kumbakonam, with his wife, Menaka and daughter, Aniya, who turned seven last week, Ayyappan said: \u201cI cannot describe what it felt like to hold my daughter again after so many days and nights. I\u2019m really happy. She is also very happy.\u201d</p> \n<p>He last saw Aniya when she was four years old.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec9549c8acb66bf27336d2b92fa2e7edf23d6e96\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec9549c8acb66bf27336d2b92fa2e7edf23d6e96/0_0_1280_853/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Captain Ayyappan Swaminathan reunited with his wife, Menaka and seven-year-old daughter, Aniya\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Captain Ayyappan Swaminathan reunited with his wife, Menaka and seven-year-old daughter, Aniya.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jaffer Shadiq/Mission To Seafarers</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It marks the end of a long, drawn-out case where the captain and crew were abandoned by the vessel owner, Elite Way Marine Services, unable to leave the ship fearing the loss of their claim to thousands of dollars in unpaid wages.</p> \n<p>Ayyappan sent the Guardian a video that recorded the emotional moment he finally left his ship, MV Azraqmoiah, shot from a speedboat carrying him safely to shore. </p> \n<p>\u201cWhen I touched land, I felt like flying \u2013 oh my God,\u201d said the merchant seaman of 20 years. \u201cThis is the day we dreamed of. My cup is overflowing again and again.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ayyappan, who thanked everyone who helped him, said he had now been paid 80% of the $84,000 (\u00a366,000) salary owed to him.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9b8800fb-c8fa-4520-a562-c070c5f36d31\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jhfUCCOXjsE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>His two colleagues, Rajib Ali, a cook from India, and Ibrahim Adam Iazim, chief officer from Sudan, were also repatriated. Other members of the crew, who accepted 40-60% of their owed salaries, left the ship in April.</p> \n<p>The seafarers endured terrible hardship aboard, as their supplies dwindled and finally ran out, prompting them to seek help to survive. Ali\u2019s father passed away in August 2018, yet still they waited for the wages. There were days when a lack of fuel left the vessel in darkness in the busy shipping lane, endangering the crew and other ships. The Indian consulate and the charity Mission to Seafarers were able to help by providing food and water.</p> \n<p>In all, 36 sailors in at least seven vessels were abandoned by Elite Way Marine Services, according to the Federal Transport Authority (FTA) in the UAE. The case was first highlighted by the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation (ITF). </p> \n<p>UAE-owned Elite Way Marine Services told the Guardian in April that they failed to pay the seafarers from Azraqmoiah and other ships after encountering financial problems, but promised they would be paid soon. Captain Ibrahim Gafar, Elite Way\u2019s operations manager, said the company had previously been unwilling to sell any of its vessels to release money for wage payments because unfavourable market conditions meant he would not get a good price, but they later found a buyer for one while another was being sold for scrap. \u201cWe have a financial problem,\u201d said Gafar at the time. \u201cFor one and a half years the market has been down. Any person would not give a good price for the vessel.\u201d</p> \n<p>The company could not be contacted for this article.</p> \n<p>It has since emerged that the international attention brought by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/may/20/abandoned-at-sea-the-invisible-seafarers-trying-to-get-home\">the Guardian\u2019s coverage</a> in April and May helped to pressurise the owners to act.</p> \n<p>In February, Mission to Seafarers and the FTA took legal action against the vessel\u2019s owner over the unpaid salaries. The first ship was arrested under maritime law in April, followed by other vessels, including the Azraqmoiah, which was sold to pay the seafarers\u2019 salaries. The FTA has banned the company from operating in UAE waters.</p> \n<p>Jasamin Fichte, of the law firm Fichte &amp; Co, said the vessel\u2019s owner had \u201cmade a mockery\u201d of the UAE legal system. She vowed to lobby for better regulations.</p> \n<p>Fichte said: \u201cIt\u2019s obvious to everyone involved the ship owner has to pay their wages. If it hadn\u2019t been for our actions, the crew would not have been paid at all. But the vessel owner got away with paying less. He has made a mockery of the legal system here.\u201d</p> \n<p>The conditions on the ship were \u201chorrible\u201d, she added.</p> \n<p>\u201cSuch actions would be considered criminal in many jurisdictions.

      "bodyText": "After 18 months stranded on a cargo vessel miles off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, with little food or water, no wages and little means of communication, Captain Ayyappan Swaminathan\u2019s ordeal is finally over. In April, the Guardian reported the story of Ayyappan and his 10-strong crew, one of the most extreme cases of seafarer abandonment in recent years. On Sunday night, Ayyappan said his \u201ccup is overflowing\u201d with happiness after an emotional reunion with the family he hasn\u2019t seen since he left India, in January 2017. Speaking from his home in Kumbakonam, with his wife, Menaka and daughter, Aniya, who turned seven last week, Ayyappan said: \u201cI cannot describe what it felt like to hold my daughter again after so many days and nights. I\u2019m really happy. She is also very happy.\u201d He last saw Aniya when she was four years old. It marks the end of a long, drawn-out case where the captain and crew were abandoned by the vessel owner, Elite Way Marine Services, unable to leave the ship fearing the loss of their claim to thousands of dollars in unpaid wages. Ayyappan sent the Guardian a video that recorded the emotional moment he finally left his ship, MV Azraqmoiah, shot from a speedboat carrying him safely to shore. \u201cWhen I touched land, I felt like flying \u2013 oh my God,\u201d said the merchant seaman of 20 years. \u201cThis is the day we dreamed of. My cup is overflowing again and again.\u201d Ayyappan, who thanked everyone who helped him, said he had now been paid 80% of the $84,000 (\u00a366,000) salary owed to him. His two colleagues, Rajib Ali, a cook from India, and Ibrahim Adam Iazim, chief officer from Sudan, were also repatriated. Other members of the crew, who accepted 40-60% of their owed salaries, left the ship in April. The seafarers endured terrible hardship aboard, as their supplies dwindled and finally ran out, prompting them to seek help to survive. Ali\u2019s father passed away in August 2018, yet still they waited for the wages. There were days when a lack of fuel left the vessel in darkness in the busy shipping lane, endangering the crew and other ships. The Indian consulate and the charity Mission to Seafarers were able to help by providing food and water. In all, 36 sailors in at least seven vessels were abandoned by Elite Way Marine Services, according to the Federal Transport Authority (FTA) in the UAE. The case was first highlighted by the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation (ITF). UAE-owned Elite Way Marine Services told the Guardian in April that they failed to pay the seafarers from Azraqmoiah and other ships after encountering financial problems, but promised they would be paid soon. Captain Ibrahim Gafar, Elite Way\u2019s operations manager, said the company had previously been unwilling to sell any of its vessels to release money for wage payments because unfavourable market conditions meant he would not get a good price, but they later found a buyer for one while another was being sold for scrap. \u201cWe have a financial problem,\u201d said Gafar at the time. \u201cFor one and a half years the market has been down. Any person would not give a good price for the vessel.\u201d The company could not be contacted for this article. It has since emerged that the international attention brought by the Guardian\u2019s coverage in April and May helped to pressurise the owners to act. In February, Mission to Seafarers and the FTA took legal action against the vessel\u2019s owner over the unpaid salaries. The first ship was arrested under maritime law in April, followed by other vessels, including the Azraqmoiah, which was sold to pay the seafarers\u2019 salaries. The FTA has banned the company from operating in UAE waters. Jasamin Fichte, of the law firm Fichte &amp; Co, said the vessel\u2019s owner had \u201cmade a mockery\u201d of the UAE legal system. She vowed to lobby for better regulations. Fichte said: \u201cIt\u2019s obvious to everyone involved the ship owner has to pay their wages. If it hadn\u2019t been for our actions, the crew would not have been paid at all. But the vessel owner got away with paying less. He has made a mockery of the legal system here.\u201d The conditions on the ship were \u201chorrible\u201d, she added. \u201cSuch actions would be considered criminal in many jurisdictions. Seafarers were suffering from physical and psychological conditions. We were worried for their safety. No food, no water, no air conditioning in 40 degree heat \u2013 it\u2019s not something I would wish on anybody.\u201d Fichte said she will meet with the UAE government to talk about how they can stop the rising problem of vessel owners abandoning crew in their waters. A law to seize abandoned ships is already under discussion in the country. Rev Andy Bowerman, the Middle East and south-east Asia director of Mission to Seafarers, praised Ayyappan for helping to highlight the \u201cunacceptable\u201d issue of abandonment at sea. \u201cHe realised that if he held out for longer, he would highlight the issue \u2013 and there is a bigger issue here,\u201d said Bowerman. \u201cAt some point the UAE has got to change its approach to seafarers.\u201d He urged the UAE to sign up to an amendment to the maritime labour convention, which guarantees better protection for seafarers by requiring ships to carry insurance to pay them if they are abandoned. Worldwide, 4,866 seafarers on a total of 336 vessels have been abandoned on board ship since 2004, according to a database by the International Maritime Organization and the International Labour Organization. \u201cThe flag states should do more,\u201d said Mohamed Arracedi, the ITF\u2019s coordinator for the Arab world and Iran, who has dealt with over 100 cases of abandonment and recovered $1.26m in owed wages in 2018. \u201cMany of the cases we are dealing with in the Emirates are severe abandonment cases.

That\u2019s why we spend a certain amount of time visiting with the city officials and because some of this is public-private help. It\u2019s finding the right facility, it\u2019s getting the right coaches.

And so it\u2019s kind of the icing on the cake that you have an owner there that is making a lot of things happen.\u201d Speaking in a hotel bar on Lexington after making Bastareaud happen, Kennedy put a New York spin on things when he said, \u201cI think for the league the season was a success, but for me it wasn\u2019t because we didn\u2019t win the final.\u201d He added: \u201cYou\u2019ll see that the expectations are much higher now, because you\u2019ll see the amount of head coaches that are going to be replaced in the off-season.\u201d Kennedy indicated an imponderable of any league \u2013 the question of money, who has it and who doesn\u2019t \u2013 when he responded to a Rugby Today report which said he had run out of cash. \u201cWe are very well financed,\u201d he said, \u201cand have been entertaining investment offers for the last year and a half.\u201d \u2018One team\u2019s problem is all of our problems\u2019 MLR is indeed an investment opportunity, for players, coaches and those who hold the capital. Which means it carries risk. RUNY have French funds and a glittering market but struggled to attract crowds out to Coney Island. Kennedy said games will be played elsewhere next year. That San Diego hosted Seattle in the final was fitting not just in that they were the top two teams on the regular-season table. Both also play in smart stadiums, Torero and Starfire, which they have managed to fill. The Houston Sabercats have followed the Glendale Raptors in building their own home but the Austin Elite, like RUNY, found themselves playing in an echoing ballpark. Unlike RUNY, the Texans finished winless. There have been changes, former US Eagle Todd Clever becoming director of rugby. But unlike the Utah Warriors, once precariously placed too, Austin do not seem to have stabilised. There are rumours the operation could move to Ohio, which hosted a team in PRO, the predecessor to MLR. \u201cThis is a single entity,\u201d Howes said, referring to the MLR ownership structure. \u201cSo one team\u2019s problem is all of our problems. So we definitely have a ways to go but this is not atypical, right? I mean this is something every league goes through and I think it\u2019s better if they go through it with partners around them than if they were in a franchise model and things were a little different. \u201cThe league is involved with everybody, and we still have to improve some of our groups, and help them, and get them in a situation where they can succeed. That\u2019s why we spend a certain amount of time visiting with the city officials and because some of this is public-private help. It\u2019s finding the right facility, it\u2019s getting the right coaches. This is a complex heavy lift, and we want to work together to solve it.\u201d James English, RUNY\u2019s general manager, called their season \u201ca roller coaster and a learning curve\u201d. But he also confirmed that Foden would be back for 2020, to join Bastareaud in working with Americans new to the professional life. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to kind of go into the foreign player well a little bit deeper than we did [last year],\u201d Howes said, before a finale that showed strong South African influence. \u201cBut predominantly we are still a domestic league, which is our goal. And I think the domestic players have done a great job, augmented a little bit by the programs that we have going on [to import players from] Uruguay, and next year we\u2019ll have an Ireland programme and we\u2019ve got a few French players too. \u201cWe want to build up our domestic teams, our players, and our national team. But at the same time we feel one of the important things is that we have some international players to try to teach our players. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased that the speed and the games I think are far better this year, even though we had to go deeper in talent pool.\u201d Some around the league say the bottom of that pool will be hit before kick-off in February. With 12 teams in two conferences, three in the east will be newly scrapping for talent. Around the oval world, players with passports may not lack for options. Back in the hotel bar in New York, Kennedy decided to tantalise. \u201cYou look at next year,\u201d he said, \u201cafter the World Cup, and you wonder... I\u2019m hearing rumors about a lot of All Blacks coming in.\u201d It\u2019s not an outrageous suggestion: Mils Muliaina packed up his 100 All Black caps and played in PRO, as did the big prop Jamie Mackintosh, who admittedly wore the silver fern 99 times fewer. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking to any,\u201d Kennedy added, smiling. \u201cBut I think you\u2019ll see a lot of talent come in. Hopefully it will spread across the league.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>From one 90s superstar to another \u2026 Donatella Versace dedicated her spring/summer 2020 menswear show to the Progidy\u2019s Keith Flint in Milan at the weekend. The designer described the musician, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/04/prodigy-singer-keith-flint-dies-aged-49\" title=\"\">who died in March this year</a>, as \u201cmy friend, and a disruptor of this world\u201d.</p> <p>Homage was paid through the pounding soundtrack of the band\u2019s monster hit, Firestarter, and models bearing his distinctive double mohawk and tinted bug-eye sunglasses. Although the revelation that Flint and Versace were friends may have come as a surprise, it\u2019s not an incongruous pairing; Versace has been something of a disruptor herself. Picking up the mantle of the family business her brother, Gianni, established in 1978, she embraced full-blown sex appeal in her collections from day one, and has admitted in the past to not knowing how to do things quietly. Last year, she surprised the world when she announced that she sold her family company to Capri Holdings \u2013 formerly known as Michael Kors Holdings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"de833da80e0953248b9fad06c8a505ad60032f15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de833da80e0953248b9fad06c8a505ad60032f15/0_0_3280_4928/666.jpg\" alt=\"Models wore double denim emblazoned with car prints.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Models wore double denim emblazoned with car prints.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Less than a year into the merger, it is a bit early to say how that is going from a business perspective. On the catwalk, however, it is very much business as usual. Versace described her next-season muse as \u201ca slightly more serious guy\u201d just before the show, adding that she wanted to celebrate the moment \u201ca young man becomes a man\u201d which for her comes the ceremonial purchase of their first car. Models walked around an XL black car covered in purple flowers, wearing suits, shirts and double denim emblazoned and appliqued with car prints \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jan/13/menswear-evolves-in-new-ways-at-versace-and-marni-in-milan-fashion-week\" title=\"\">a continuation from last season\u2019s collaboration with Ford</a>.</p> <p>Continuing a theme from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/feb/22/versace-has-softened-the-sex-appeal-but-its-wattage-remains-high\" title=\"\">the womenswear show in February</a>, looks featured vintage fragrance advertisements from the brand\u2019s archive. We were told, post-show, that this was a nod to rediscovery; another tribute to the brand\u2019s past without being too obvious. Other themes in this collection didn\u2019t play the same game. The bondage look, which has been synonymous with the house since Gianni\u2019s 1990s collections, appeared via black leather trousers with all-over eyelets and whipstitched seams.</p> <p>The memory of Donatella\u2019s brother was, as ever, evident throughout, with his signature appearing on ties, socks and in all-over Swarovski applique in skintight jersey. Moving the handwriting of the house forward, she adapted its signature baroque print \u2013 usually seen in black and gold \u2013 into acidic pastels. Tailoring, meanwhile, was softened with a less rigid fit on blazers and bootleg jersey trousers \u2013 like the ones Versace favours herself. Versace \u201cdoesn\u2019t like to talk about gender fluidity, more interested in the fluidity of masculinity\u201d, said the company, post preview.</p> <p>The CEO of Capri Holdings, John D Idol, has made clear his plans for the brand\u2019s evolution: there are plans to increase the number of Versace shops from 200 to 300. He added that \u201cwith the full resources of our group, we believe that Versace will grow to [sales of] over $2bn\u201d. For her part, Versace is showing she intends to keep up her creative side of such expansion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"503cbf3fc6b074a9defcc42c8c861948c8c7b049\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/503cbf3fc6b074a9defcc42c8c861948c8c7b049/0_140_4256_2553/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Models on the catwalk for Dolce &amp; Gabbana\u2019s spring/summer 2020 show, part of Milan fashion week men\u2019s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Models on the catwalk for Dolce &amp; Gabbana\u2019s spring/summer 2020 show, part of Milan fashion week men\u2019s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Earlier in the day, Dolce &amp; Gabbana revealed the latest collection in its brand story. Titled Sicilian Tropical, it featured designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana paying homage to their southern Italian roots with fruit-bowl and piastrelle prints.</p> <p>For the rest of the collection, they went further afield. The set was transformed into an elaborate jungle rainforest which featured a lifesize leopard and jaguar on the stage (not real, but made from sisal by the artist Anne Andersson, and borrowed from the designers\u2019 private collection) and which led on to a 40-yard leopard-print catwalk.</p> <p>On it, the collection was an amalgamation of several themes: baroque, pin-ups, polka dot and the 1950s, we were informed.

      "bodyText": "From one 90s superstar to another \u2026 Donatella Versace dedicated her spring/summer 2020 menswear show to the Progidy\u2019s Keith Flint in Milan at the weekend. The designer described the musician, who died in March this year, as \u201cmy friend, and a disruptor of this world\u201d. Homage was paid through the pounding soundtrack of the band\u2019s monster hit, Firestarter, and models bearing his distinctive double mohawk and tinted bug-eye sunglasses. Although the revelation that Flint and Versace were friends may have come as a surprise, it\u2019s not an incongruous pairing; Versace has been something of a disruptor herself. Picking up the mantle of the family business her brother, Gianni, established in 1978, she embraced full-blown sex appeal in her collections from day one, and has admitted in the past to not knowing how to do things quietly. Last year, she surprised the world when she announced that she sold her family company to Capri Holdings \u2013 formerly known as Michael Kors Holdings. Less than a year into the merger, it is a bit early to say how that is going from a business perspective. On the catwalk, however, it is very much business as usual. Versace described her next-season muse as \u201ca slightly more serious guy\u201d just before the show, adding that she wanted to celebrate the moment \u201ca young man becomes a man\u201d which for her comes the ceremonial purchase of their first car. Models walked around an XL black car covered in purple flowers, wearing suits, shirts and double denim emblazoned and appliqued with car prints \u2013 a continuation from last season\u2019s collaboration with Ford. Continuing a theme from the womenswear show in February, looks featured vintage fragrance advertisements from the brand\u2019s archive. We were told, post-show, that this was a nod to rediscovery; another tribute to the brand\u2019s past without being too obvious. Other themes in this collection didn\u2019t play the same game. The bondage look, which has been synonymous with the house since Gianni\u2019s 1990s collections, appeared via black leather trousers with all-over eyelets and whipstitched seams. The memory of Donatella\u2019s brother was, as ever, evident throughout, with his signature appearing on ties, socks and in all-over Swarovski applique in skintight jersey. Moving the handwriting of the house forward, she adapted its signature baroque print \u2013 usually seen in black and gold \u2013 into acidic pastels. Tailoring, meanwhile, was softened with a less rigid fit on blazers and bootleg jersey trousers \u2013 like the ones Versace favours herself. Versace \u201cdoesn\u2019t like to talk about gender fluidity, more interested in the fluidity of masculinity\u201d, said the company, post preview. The CEO of Capri Holdings, John D Idol, has made clear his plans for the brand\u2019s evolution: there are plans to increase the number of Versace shops from 200 to 300. He added that \u201cwith the full resources of our group, we believe that Versace will grow to [sales of] over $2bn\u201d. For her part, Versace is showing she intends to keep up her creative side of such expansion. Earlier in the day, Dolce &amp; Gabbana revealed the latest collection in its brand story. Titled Sicilian Tropical, it featured designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana paying homage to their southern Italian roots with fruit-bowl and piastrelle prints. For the rest of the collection, they went further afield. The set was transformed into an elaborate jungle rainforest which featured a lifesize leopard and jaguar on the stage (not real, but made from sisal by the artist Anne Andersson, and borrowed from the designers\u2019 private collection) and which led on to a 40-yard leopard-print catwalk. On it, the collection was an amalgamation of several themes: baroque, pin-ups, polka dot and the 1950s, we were informed. Retro sports jerseys \u2013 including baseball, tennis, golf, rugby and boxing \u2013 were reimagined in lace \u201cto make it more sexy\u201d, said Gabbana backstage before the show, and emblazoned with messages such as, \u201cChoose me\u201d, \u201cTake a look\u201d and \u201cOnly good vibes\u201d. Elsewhere, khaki dominated the 119-look show, appearing in uniform-fresh, box pleated separates. The duo\u2019s adopted decade was a dominating theme throughout, but, while it may be an era be a decade ripe for mining classic sartorial codes, some \u2013 such as the wide-lapelled double-breasted suits, knitted polos, Cuban-collared shirts and pleated trousers seen here \u2013 are naturally less problematic than others in our woke world. Such expeditions, like those evoked by the khaki section of this show, in the faraway jungle setting conjured voyager vibes which, these days, tend to get talked about in a colonial context rather than recalled in such a way on the runway. Of the setting and direction, Gabbana said before the show: \u201cFashion is beautiful because you change every season.\u201d Different, but familiar, this was a collection that was distinctively Dolce &amp; Gabbana.",

Slim, and with colours as intense as the food it promises, it\u2019s one of the few books from which I want to make everything.</p> <p>Like many Sicilian sweets, the recipe starts with almonds, which are rich in moisture and essential oils \u2013 both of which dissipate when almonds are ground and left too long in packets or jars. So if you can, make your own ground almonds. This is easily done by reducing blanched almonds to a fine flour in a food processor. If you peel them yourself, even better (I don\u2019t).</p> <p>I do a mixture of biscuit shapes. You could also do as the Sicilians and roll the balls in pine nuts or crushed pistachios, stud with glac\u00e9 cherries or a curl of candied peel, or go full-on Liberace and use more than one decoration.</p> <p>These are as much marzipan sweets as they are biscuits, with the egg white keeping them sticky and light, so they need careful cooking: 10-14 minutes at 170C (150C fan)/gas 3\u00bd, in which time they will have spread slightly, cracked at the edges and turned opaque with just a touch of the lightest gold on top.</p> <p>The exact time will vary from oven to oven. In my fierce gas oven (the same one as Sophia Loren, according to her book In the Kitchen with Love \u2013 which is where the similarities end), I bake the biscuits on the middle shelf and keep a close eye on them, so they don\u2019t catch on the bottom. These are not biscuits to walk away from \u2013 they require you to loiter nearby. When they come out, they will be soft, so let them cool before lifting on to a plate and dusting with more icing sugar.</p> <p>Freshly made paste di mandorla are well matched with cherries. Ideally, the cherries should be so cold that their skin is like a glass-fronted beer fridge and misty with condensation \u2013 a taut and fresh contrast to the marzipan-hearted sweet. For more symmetry, cherries have an almond-scented stone to suck on.</p> <p>Well matched and also lovely to look at; a plate of icing sugar-dusted rounds and a big bowl of the reddest fruit, stalks up and waiting to be knotted.

      "bodyText": "You were right, those of you who suggested making soft almond biscuits with egg whites rather than the whole egg. I am stubborn, though, and prideful, and attached to my \u201ccoat-on\u201d soft almond biscuits; the ones that have stepped in like an extra helping hand, providing puddings, presents, picnics and peace offerings. To make another sort would seem to betray them, and yet I had to remind myself that you can have more than one way of doing something. It is true, whisked egg whites make for the most tender marzipan-hearted paste di mandorla, the sugar-coated, jewel-studded bling that fills the grass-fronted counters of Sicilian pastry shops, and sends puffs of icing sugar down the front of your T-shirt. The recipe I followed comes from a book called Cucina Siciliana: Ricette, Sapori, Sagre (recipes, flavours and festivals), which I bought from a Sicilian bookshop in liquidation a few years ago. Slim, and with colours as intense as the food it promises, it\u2019s one of the few books from which I want to make everything. Like many Sicilian sweets, the recipe starts with almonds, which are rich in moisture and essential oils \u2013 both of which dissipate when almonds are ground and left too long in packets or jars. So if you can, make your own ground almonds. This is easily done by reducing blanched almonds to a fine flour in a food processor. If you peel them yourself, even better (I don\u2019t). I do a mixture of biscuit shapes. You could also do as the Sicilians and roll the balls in pine nuts or crushed pistachios, stud with glac\u00e9 cherries or a curl of candied peel, or go full-on Liberace and use more than one decoration. These are as much marzipan sweets as they are biscuits, with the egg white keeping them sticky and light, so they need careful cooking: 10-14 minutes at 170C (150C fan)/gas 3\u00bd, in which time they will have spread slightly, cracked at the edges and turned opaque with just a touch of the lightest gold on top. The exact time will vary from oven to oven. In my fierce gas oven (the same one as Sophia Loren, according to her book In the Kitchen with Love \u2013 which is where the similarities end), I bake the biscuits on the middle shelf and keep a close eye on them, so they don\u2019t catch on the bottom. These are not biscuits to walk away from \u2013 they require you to loiter nearby. When they come out, they will be soft, so let them cool before lifting on to a plate and dusting with more icing sugar. Freshly made paste di mandorla are well matched with cherries. Ideally, the cherries should be so cold that their skin is like a glass-fronted beer fridge and misty with condensation \u2013 a taut and fresh contrast to the marzipan-hearted sweet. For more symmetry, cherries have an almond-scented stone to suck on. Well matched and also lovely to look at; a plate of icing sugar-dusted rounds and a big bowl of the reddest fruit, stalks up and waiting to be knotted. One of my favourite ways to swallow my pride and end a meal at this time of year. Soft almond biscuits with cherries (paste di mandorla) Prep 20 min Cook 12 min Makes 25-30 300g blanched almonds 300g icing sugar, plus extra to dust Zest of an unwaxed lemon 2 egg whites Plain flour, to thicken (optional) To decorate Almonds Cherry jam Glace or fresh cherries Heat the oven to to 170C (150C fan)/gas 3\u00bd. In a food processor, grind the almonds to a flour, tip into a bowl, then add the icing sugar and lemon zest. Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks, add to the almond mix and bring everything together into a dough (hands are best for this). If it seems too soft and sticky, add a spoonful of flour. Dust your hands with icing sugar and make balls by rolling walnut-sized lumps of dough between your palms. To decorate, either press a whole almond into the centre of each biscuit, or make a deep indent with your finger and fill with a blob of cherry jam. Or, you can pinch them into a rough pyramid shape by pinching four sides of the biscuit to get a cross-shaped ridge. I do a mixture of all three. Put the dough shapes, nicely spaced out so they have room to expand, on a baking tray lined with two layers of baking paper, and bake on the middle shelf for 10-12 minutes, or until they are lightly golden. They will still be soft when pulled from the oven, so leave them to cool completely, then lift on to a plate and dust with more icing sugar.",

He went through a fallow spell before leaving his previous yard and did not win on turf from 2016 until May.</p> \n<p>Roger Fell has since got him to win at Thirsk and Pontefract and their successful tour of Yorkshire tracks may continue today. Even on this mark of 70, Tricky Dicky is 5lb below the peak rating he had two years ago.</p> \n<p>An hour later, I\u2019ll give one more chance to <strong>John Clare (3.45)</strong>, who put up such an encouraging return at Leicester in April but then regressed when well held in third as the favourite at Yarmouth 18 days ago. He met fast ground both times but may be more comfortable on the spongier surface he will meet here, having won a nursery on good to soft in late October. Pam Sly continues in form and Conor McGovern is a useful claimer.</p> \n<p>Ben Sanderson is one of the more experienced apprentices taking part in Catterick\u2019s closer and he may be able to make the most of <strong>Rockley Point (5.15)</strong>, a 4-1 shot. One of two course and distance winners in the field, he\u2019s back down to his last winning mark and ran with some promise last time.</p> \n<p>Pick of the Carlisle card could be <strong>Dream House (3.00)</strong>, a promising fifth on his handicap debut recently despite stepping down to five furlongs and being weak in the market. He\u2019s back up to six furlongs today and Tim Easterby is getting plenty of winners, though I detect no great support as yet for this one, an 8-1 shot.</p> \n<h2>Royal Ascot tipping competitions</h2> \n<p>We\u2019ll be running our usual tipping competitions on each day of Royal Ascot, Tuesday to Friday this week.

Even on this mark of 70, Tricky Dicky is 5lb below the peak rating he had two years ago. An hour later, I\u2019ll give one more chance to John Clare (3.45), who put up such an encouraging return at Leicester in April but then regressed when well held in third as the favourite at Yarmouth 18 days ago. He met fast ground both times but may be more comfortable on the spongier surface he will meet here, having won a nursery on good to soft in late October. Pam Sly continues in form and Conor McGovern is a useful claimer. Ben Sanderson is one of the more experienced apprentices taking part in Catterick\u2019s closer and he may be able to make the most of Rockley Point (5.15), a 4-1 shot. One of two course and distance winners in the field, he\u2019s back down to his last winning mark and ran with some promise last time. Pick of the Carlisle card could be Dream House (3.00), a promising fifth on his handicap debut recently despite stepping down to five furlongs and being weak in the market. He\u2019s back up to six furlongs today and Tim Easterby is getting plenty of winners, though I detect no great support as yet for this one, an 8-1 shot. Royal Ascot tipping competitions We\u2019ll be running our usual tipping competitions on each day of Royal Ascot, Tuesday to Friday this week. Ladbrokes Coral are offering a \u00a350 bet to our winner each day, so do join us tomorrow when the great race-meeting begins.",

But it turns out they just might. Tess and her neighbours in the desirable Lowland Way are dismayed when a new couple move into number one. Darren and Jodie don\u2019t fit into this supremely middle-class world of \u201cbespoke steel-framed glass kitchen doors\u201d and \u201cPlay Out Sundays\u201d; they park their multiple cars all over the pavement, play Metallica at epic volumes and quickly become known as \u201cthose people\u201d. As tempers fray and life becomes unbearable for some residents of the road, Candlish flits between a police inquiry into a death that has occurred in Lowland Way and how exactly events led up to it. A clever, enjoyable follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/16/best-crime-novels-review-louise-candlish-andrew-taylor-christine-mangan-melba-escobar-ragnar-jonasso\" title=\"\"><em>Our House</em></a>, Candlish\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.curtisbrown.co.uk/news/louise-candlish-s-our-house-wins-at-the-british-book-awards\" title=\"\">award-winning</a> first venture into \u201cproperty noir\u201d, this is scarily plausible.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/missing-years-9781786495570.html\" title=\"\">The Missing Years</a></h2> <p>Lexie Elliott<br><em>Corvus, \u00a312.99, pp384</em></p> <p>Lexie Elliott\u2019s debut novel, <em>The French Girl</em>, was excellent: a knotty, read-in-one-sitting look at the death of a French girl while six Oxford graduates were on holiday, 10 years earlier. Her second novel, <em>The Missing Years</em>, moves the action to the Highlands, where Ailsa Calder has inherited half of a house after the death of her mother. She returns home in an attempt to sell the house, but is stymied by the fact that her father, who disappeared 27 years ago, leaving a wash of anger and misery behind him, owns the other half. Her return has her probing forgotten childhood memories as both the house itself, and some of the locals, appear determined to scare her off. The whip-smart Ailsa\u2019s descent into terror and confusion as the Manse begins to have an effect on her is played out beautifully. Like <em>The French Girl</em>, this manages to be both uncannily creepy and grounded in the true horror of human evil.</p> <p></p> <h2><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/never-be-broken-d-i-marnie-rome-6-9781472249005.html\" title=\"\">Never Be Broken</a></h2> <p>Sarah Hilary<br><em>Headline, \u00a318.99, pp368</em></p> <p><em>Never Be Broken</em> is the sixth in Sarah Hilary\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/21/quieter-than-killing-sarah-hilary-review-marnie-rome-vivid-thriller\" title=\"\">crime series</a> about DI Marnie Rome, and is her darkest, grittiest outing yet.

Then Raphaela Belsham is shot on the street in Muswell Hill: she\u2019s white, it\u2019s a nice part of town and the world starts to notice. As Rome digs into the links between the deaths and Erskine Tower, a poverty-stricken high-rise nearby, her sidekick, DS Noah Jake, continues to reel from the recent murder of his brother in prison.

      "bodyText": "Those People Louise Candlish Simon &amp; Schuster, \u00a312.99, pp400 \u201cPeople don\u2019t kill over house prices, do they?\u201d asks Tess, one of the mothers in Louise Candlish\u2019s new novel, Those People. But it turns out they just might. Tess and her neighbours in the desirable Lowland Way are dismayed when a new couple move into number one. Darren and Jodie don\u2019t fit into this supremely middle-class world of \u201cbespoke steel-framed glass kitchen doors\u201d and \u201cPlay Out Sundays\u201d; they park their multiple cars all over the pavement, play Metallica at epic volumes and quickly become known as \u201cthose people\u201d. As tempers fray and life becomes unbearable for some residents of the road, Candlish flits between a police inquiry into a death that has occurred in Lowland Way and how exactly events led up to it. A clever, enjoyable follow-up to Our House, Candlish\u2019s award-winning first venture into \u201cproperty noir\u201d, this is scarily plausible. The Missing Years Lexie Elliott Corvus, \u00a312.99, pp384 Lexie Elliott\u2019s debut novel, The French Girl, was excellent: a knotty, read-in-one-sitting look at the death of a French girl while six Oxford graduates were on holiday, 10 years earlier. Her second novel, The Missing Years, moves the action to the Highlands, where Ailsa Calder has inherited half of a house after the death of her mother. She returns home in an attempt to sell the house, but is stymied by the fact that her father, who disappeared 27 years ago, leaving a wash of anger and misery behind him, owns the other half. Her return has her probing forgotten childhood memories as both the house itself, and some of the locals, appear determined to scare her off. The whip-smart Ailsa\u2019s descent into terror and confusion as the Manse begins to have an effect on her is played out beautifully. Like The French Girl, this manages to be both uncannily creepy and grounded in the true horror of human evil. Never Be Broken Sarah Hilary Headline, \u00a318.99, pp368 Never Be Broken is the sixth in Sarah Hilary\u2019s crime series about DI Marnie Rome, and is her darkest, grittiest outing yet. Rome and her team are looking into the murders of London\u2019s \u201clost\u201d children: those recruited and exploited by gangs. Then Raphaela Belsham is shot on the street in Muswell Hill: she\u2019s white, it\u2019s a nice part of town and the world starts to notice. As Rome digs into the links between the deaths and Erskine Tower, a poverty-stricken high-rise nearby, her sidekick, DS Noah Jake, continues to reel from the recent murder of his brother in prison. He\u2019s finding it increasingly hard not to let his demons affect his work. Starting with the rage that explodes out of Raphaela\u2019s father when Noah finds a bullet in her room \u2013 \u201cI want him out of my house. He worked his jaw to get rid of the adrenaline\u201d \u2013 racism, both overt and hidden, bubbles under the surface of everything in this searing, perceptive novel. Joe Country Mick Herron John Murray, \u00a314.99, pp352 Following the misadventures of the sidelined spies who have been banished to Slough House for various misdemeanours \u2013 \u201cthis was the Service\u2019s backwater, where they sent you when they wanted to bore you to death\u201d \u2013 Mick Herron\u2019s Jackson Lamb novels are among the best spy novels being written today.

There is no entitlement in the NBA, it is the ultimate meritocracy: your value is measured by performance alone. And if we increase the pool of competitors, the entire game will be elevated even higher. This is evident from examining the Raptors\u2019 roster which includes Serge Ibaka (Congo and Spain), Pascal Siakam (Cameroon), Marc Gasol (Spain), and OG Anunoby (born in London to Nigerian parents). One of the assistant coaches, Patrick Mutombo, was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The team president, Masai Ujiri, was born in the UK and grew up in Nigeria.

      "bodyText": "Folklore tells us that if you can see your initials in a spider\u2019s web, you have good fortune ahead. Maybe the NBA saw their initials in the hoop net last Thursday because the Toronto Raptors\u2019 championship victory that night could be an early prognosticator of a brighter future for professional basketball worldwide. At the very least, it could encourage the expansion of NBA teams to include other countries from south of the border and elsewhere, leading to the league evolving into a more international competition. As the Borg would say, \u201cResistance is futile.\u201d The winds of change are already upon us. Despite California\u2019s Golden State Warriors being the \u201chometown\u201d favorites, it was Canada\u2019s \u201cvisitor\u201d team that most Americans were rooting for in the finals. According to a recent poll, the majority of Americans in every state except California, Nevada, and Hawaii were cheering for the Raptors to win. This is not a slight against the excellent Warriors, who may just be victims of their own deserved success in that people prefer rooting for the underdog. When it comes to sports, Americans don\u2019t seem to share the xenophobia and nationalist fervor of the current White House administration. If that welcoming spirit continues to spread we may see changes beyond sports that extends to cultural and diplomatic areas. In 1996, economist Thomas Friedman proposed the \u201cGolden Arches Theory of Conflict,\u201d which suggested that no two countries with a McDonald\u2019s franchise would go to war with each other because \u201ccountries with middle classes large enough to sustain a McDonald\u2019s have reached a level of prosperity and global integration that makes warmongering risky and unpalatable to its people.\u201d Of course, that didn\u2019t hold up in reality for a few countries, but a similar basic ideal applies here: countries sharing an NBA franchise are more likely to also share cultural awareness \u2013 and that can lead to us focusing on our similarities without fearing our differences. Sports has often been a trailblazer for an enlightened social agenda. Ibtihaj Muhammad won a fencing bronze medal at the 2016 Olympics \u2013 and also became the first woman to represent the United States at the Games while wearing a hijab. The so-called \u201cping-pong diplomacy\u201d of the early 1970s, in which the US and China exchanged ping-pong players, is credited with easing tensions between the countries and making President Richard Nixon\u2019s visit to China possible.

Joe Root bowled nicely too \u2013 he works on his variations a lot \u2013 and then played beautifully from opener. It\u2019s a sign of our depth that, with injuries to Morgs and Jason Roy, my fellow Brummie Chris Woakes stepped up from No 7 to No 3 and helped put on 105 for the second wicket. We feel like one of those teams that, whatever happens, we can find a way to overcome it. Woakesy and I met in our early teens and he has always been a good cricketer. But I believe he has transformed himself into a brilliant one in the past few years. He is such a calming influence and I can confirm the reports that he is one of the nicest guys you could wish to meet. The injuries have put the whole squad on alert for the Afghanistan game at Old Trafford on Tuesday. It will be a used pitch, so I would hope a second spinner is required. Rash isn\u2019t the type to say he is No 1 and, in fact, he admitted the other day he has been missing me out in the middle. People have questioned if his shoulder is OK but from my perspective the ball looks to be coming out nicely still. Had a couple of catches been held off his bowling \u2013 Mohammad Hafeez at Trent Bridge and Andre Russell in Southampton \u2013 there would be less talk about this. We don\u2019t take Afghanistan lightly. They have some dangerous cricketers \u2013 Rashid Khan and Mohammad Nabi are world class \u2013 and very passionate supporters. In five to 10 years\u2019 time I believe they are going to be a genuine force in world cricket, right up there with the best teams. So, while they haven\u2019t got the results so far, there is no danger of us thinking we just have to rock up to get the win.",

      "bodyText": "Matt Hancock, who dropped out of the Conservative leadership race at the end of last week, has endorsed Boris Johnson, despite having campaigned on a modernising ticket and said he would not push for a no-deal Brexit. In an article for the Times announcing the decision, the health secretary said it was clear Johnson was likely to win, and it was time to \u201cunite behind him\u201d as soon as possible. However, Hancock said Johnson, the former foreign secretary, had given assurances he would govern as a consensual, one-nation Conservative, and would support the needs of business. On both issues, Hancock said, he would \u201chold him to that\u201d. In the first round of voting among Tory MPs on Thursday, Hancock finished sixth out of 10 candidates with 20 supporters, above the 13 needed to progress to the next round but with little seeming chance of progressing much further. Hancock announced he was pulling out of the race on Friday morning. His endorsement for Johnson does not mean his former supporters will follow suit. On Monday, one of these, the Scottish Conservative MP Paul Masterton, said he would instead back the other self-styled moderniser in the race, Rory Stewart. Stewart was among five of the six remaining candidates who took part in a Channel 4 televised debate on Sunday night, which Johnson chose to not attend. Michael Gove, who had been hoping to receive Hancock\u2019s endorsement, said it was \u201cdisappointing, naturally\u201d, for it to go to Johnson, but insisted he remained a serious contender. \u201cAt the moment, yes of course it is the case that Boris is the frontrunner,\u201d the environment secretary told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cBut we need to make sure that he is tested, and we have two candidates who go forward, if Boris is one of them, who we know are being capable of being prime minister from day one.\u201d Gove added: \u201cI would be ready to take control of the ship of state and steer it safely through the difficult waters ahead.\u201d Asked about criticisms of Johnson\u2019s character and honesty, Gove was circumspect: \u201cThere have been various attempts to mount personal attacks against him and against some of the other candidates.

      "body": "<p>You may not look around a city like London and notice acres of unused space lying empty. But it is there. There might be some inside your own house. Kamal El-Haj and his wife Michelle live in Chingford, and were expecting their second child last summer, so they had just begun to look for new sources of income when they noticed their garage.</p> <p>\u201cAll I\u2019ve got in there is my old car, which she hates,\u201d El-Haj says. \u201cI looked at it, and my car is tucked over to one side, and our bits are all neatly organised, so there\u2019s still loads of space. Maybe we should look at renting it out or something like that?\u201d </p> <p>He looked online and found Stashbee, one of several companies offering to match people with space to spare and people with things to store. Because that\u2019s the other half of the picture: many city-dwellers wish they had acres of space, but don\u2019t. So-called peer-to-peer storage is generally much cheaper than the traditional kind, often about 50% cheaper. It may be more convenient too, even outside cities, if you can find a host nearby, and hosts can be renters as well as homeowners, as long as their tenancy agreement allows it.</p> <p>The simplest way of thinking about it might be as Airbnb for inanimate objects, although Store at My House was already trading in 2007, before Airbnb began. Still, it\u2019s an idea that seems to have exploded recently, perhaps as Airbnb has made sharing space feel normal and respectable.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpnrYsifeuk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wpnrYsifeuk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Storemates on Dragons Den.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>You might remember the three founders of Storemates, who sought investment on Dragons\u2019 Den in April 2012. The Dragons didn\u2019t get it. Back then, the thought of trusting strangers in your home seemed outlandish to many people. \u201cYou\u2019re nice guys,\u201d Deborah Meaden <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpnrYsifeuk\">told them</a>. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re relying on everybody being the people that you are, and this is ripe for somebody to take advantage of. You don\u2019t even know if the stuff you\u2019re storing belongs to those people.\u201d</p> <p>Today,\u200b \u200bStoremates\u200b is still going, and the upstart Stashbee, founded in 2016, is about to expand beyond London to compete with it for the whole of the UK. For the time being, focus will follow population density through Birmingham, Manchester and the country\u2019s other big cities, where space is scarcer and more valuable.

      "bodyText": "You may not look around a city like London and notice acres of unused space lying empty. But it is there. There might be some inside your own house. Kamal El-Haj and his wife Michelle live in Chingford, and were expecting their second child last summer, so they had just begun to look for new sources of income when they noticed their garage. \u201cAll I\u2019ve got in there is my old car, which she hates,\u201d El-Haj says. \u201cI looked at it, and my car is tucked over to one side, and our bits are all neatly organised, so there\u2019s still loads of space. Maybe we should look at renting it out or something like that?\u201d He looked online and found Stashbee, one of several companies offering to match people with space to spare and people with things to store. Because that\u2019s the other half of the picture: many city-dwellers wish they had acres of space, but don\u2019t. So-called peer-to-peer storage is generally much cheaper than the traditional kind, often about 50% cheaper. It may be more convenient too, even outside cities, if you can find a host nearby, and hosts can be renters as well as homeowners, as long as their tenancy agreement allows it. The simplest way of thinking about it might be as Airbnb for inanimate objects, although Store at My House was already trading in 2007, before Airbnb began. Still, it\u2019s an idea that seems to have exploded recently, perhaps as Airbnb has made sharing space feel normal and respectable. You might remember the three founders of Storemates, who sought investment on Dragons\u2019 Den in April 2012. The Dragons didn\u2019t get it. Back then, the thought of trusting strangers in your home seemed outlandish to many people. \u201cYou\u2019re nice guys,\u201d Deborah Meaden told them. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re relying on everybody being the people that you are, and this is ripe for somebody to take advantage of. You don\u2019t even know if the stuff you\u2019re storing belongs to those people.\u201d Today, Storemates is still going, and the upstart Stashbee, founded in 2016, is about to expand beyond London to compete with it for the whole of the UK. For the time being, focus will follow population density through Birmingham, Manchester and the country\u2019s other big cities, where space is scarcer and more valuable. However, Stashbee co-founder David Mantle suspects the firm may eventually find even greater demand in rural areas, where traditional self-storage is less likely to be available nearby.

      "bodyText": "Paul Pogba\u2019s casual admission that \u201cit could be a good time to have a new challenge somewhere else\u201d gets every English newspaper excited, though the Mirror says that Manchester United will adopt a \u201chardline stance\u201d, insisting \u201cthe World Cup winner cannot dictate terms to them\u201d, demanding \u00a3150m (the Telegraph says they want \u00a3160m; the Times that they \u201care adamant Pogba will not be sold\u201d) and thereby potentially pricing him out of a move. Neither Juventus nor Real Madrid, his rumoured suitors, will be keen on paying that much, though the Mail reports that Real feel they could buy him for around \u00a3133m, and the Sun that the Spaniards \u201cwould be happy to throw in Gareth Bale or Isco as part of the deal\u201d. The Sun also predicts that United will now \u201cembark on a frantic fortnight of business\u201d as they attempt to complete their squad rebuilding in time for the start of pre-season training. The Times says that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer \u201cwants to sign four more players\u201d, with Youri Tielemans still on their radar \u2013 though Monaco would like an offputting \u00a340m for him \u2013 as well as Newcastle\u2019s Sean Longstaff, while \u201cas many as six players could leave in the coming weeks\u201d. In Spain, Mundo Deportivo says that United will need \u201cmoral as well as sporting reinforcements\u201d should Pogba depart, and are considering a move for one or both of Ivan Rakitic and Philippe Coutinho. Internationally it\u2019s not Pogba hogging the front pages but Neymar, who according to L\u2019Equipe is singing \u201cle chant du d\u00e9part\u201d (RM history lesson: Le Chant du D\u00e9part was a popular revolutionary tune written in 1794 and still familiar in France, whose title translates as the Song of Departure).

      "body": "<p>Eighty years ago, in the summer of 1939, 16-year-old Judy Garland appeared on cinema screens as the orphan Dorothy Gale, dreaming of escape from bleak, monochrome Kansas. \u201cFind yourself a place where you won\u2019t get into any trouble,\u201d her aunt beseeches, too busy for poor old Dorothy, who soon breaks into song: \u201cSomewhere, over the rainbow, skies are blue / And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true\u201d. Her wish is soon granted by a tornado that carries her to the gaudy, Technicolor Land of Oz, instilling her as an icon for misfits, migrants, gay kids, dreamers \u2013 anyone who has ever wanted to run away.</p> <p>More than 40 years later, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-wizard-of-oz\" title=\"\">The Wizard of Oz</a></em> was one of the first films I watched as a toddler in Rio de Janeiro, on my dad\u2019s Super 8 projector. My parents were already dreaming of their own escape to London, where we would go a few years later. They hadn\u2019t been born when the film was released, a few days before the start of the second world war, though by then my mother\u2019s Jewish parents were building a life in Rio, their own Oz, far away from Poland \u2013 a land that would turn out to be far bleaker than Kansas. My grandparents were homesick, not quite settled, for the rest of their lives. Unlike Dorothy, they couldn\u2019t click their heels together and magic themselves back. Home didn\u2019t exist any more; it was a memory, an idea, a receptacle for feelings of loss.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everyone has their own Oz. For my parents, it was Europe; I begged to go back to Brazil</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s impossible to guess how many times I\u2019ve watched <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>. Fifty? A hundred? When we came to London, I couldn\u2019t speak English and had no friends, but the film kept me company along with <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/mary-poppins-returns\" title=\"\">Mary Poppins</a></em>, <em>An American in Paris</em>, <em>West Side Story</em>, reruns of <em>The Muppet Show</em>, musical dreamworlds I could escape to whenever I wanted. But <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> was The One. We had it on VHS, recorded from TV, but the tape ran out of space shortly after Dorothy returns to Kansas, so it was only years later that I heard her final words: \u201cOh, Auntie Em \u2013 there\u2019s no place like home!\u201d The empty lure of escape, the fantasy of an eternal home and perfect belonging: this is what <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> means to me. Dorothy is an orphan, but who are her parents? In the entire film, they are not mentioned once. Perhaps it does not matter who they are. Like many fictional orphans, from Oliver Twist to Harry Potter, Dorothy is a symbol of loss and abandonment, while Kansas v Oz is the battle we all fight between reality and fantasy, home and elsewhere.</p> <p>Everyone has their own Oz, be it fame, money or love; but for immigrants, it is usually an actual place. For my Jewish grandparents, it was anywhere but Europe; for my parents, it was Europe; while my siblings and I begged to go back to Brazil. For Iris Cohen, the protagonist of my second novel, <em>Everything You Ever Wanted</em>, Oz is the planet Nyx, a meaningful new life far from Earth from which there is no return. I didn\u2019t realise I was writing an immigration novel until I had finished the first draft, but I knew early on that Iris was my Dorothy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb407ea4b92d5b6986291f7f891f25fc09d61883\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb407ea4b92d5b6986291f7f891f25fc09d61883/0_129_2762_1658/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Harring and Justin Theroux in David Lynch\u2019s Mulholland Drive (2001).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Strange worlds \u2026 Laura Harring and Justin Theroux in David Lynch\u2019s Mulholland Drive (2001).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In all of western cinema, is there a more recognisable image than Dorothy in her blue gingham dress, arm in arm with the Scarecrow, the Lion and the Tin Man, skipping down the yellow brick road to the Emerald City, so that the Wizard can fulfil their dreams?

      "bodyText": "Eighty years ago, in the summer of 1939, 16-year-old Judy Garland appeared on cinema screens as the orphan Dorothy Gale, dreaming of escape from bleak, monochrome Kansas. \u201cFind yourself a place where you won\u2019t get into any trouble,\u201d her aunt beseeches, too busy for poor old Dorothy, who soon breaks into song: \u201cSomewhere, over the rainbow, skies are blue / And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true\u201d. Her wish is soon granted by a tornado that carries her to the gaudy, Technicolor Land of Oz, instilling her as an icon for misfits, migrants, gay kids, dreamers \u2013 anyone who has ever wanted to run away. More than 40 years later, The Wizard of Oz was one of the first films I watched as a toddler in Rio de Janeiro, on my dad\u2019s Super 8 projector. My parents were already dreaming of their own escape to London, where we would go a few years later. They hadn\u2019t been born when the film was released, a few days before the start of the second world war, though by then my mother\u2019s Jewish parents were building a life in Rio, their own Oz, far away from Poland \u2013 a land that would turn out to be far bleaker than Kansas. My grandparents were homesick, not quite settled, for the rest of their lives. Unlike Dorothy, they couldn\u2019t click their heels together and magic themselves back. Home didn\u2019t exist any more; it was a memory, an idea, a receptacle for feelings of loss. It\u2019s impossible to guess how many times I\u2019ve watched The Wizard of Oz. Fifty? A hundred? When we came to London, I couldn\u2019t speak English and had no friends, but the film kept me company along with Mary Poppins, An American in Paris, West Side Story, reruns of The Muppet Show, musical dreamworlds I could escape to whenever I wanted. But The Wizard of Oz was The One. We had it on VHS, recorded from TV, but the tape ran out of space shortly after Dorothy returns to Kansas, so it was only years later that I heard her final words: \u201cOh, Auntie Em \u2013 there\u2019s no place like home!\u201d The empty lure of escape, the fantasy of an eternal home and perfect belonging: this is what The Wizard of Oz means to me. Dorothy is an orphan, but who are her parents? In the entire film, they are not mentioned once. Perhaps it does not matter who they are. Like many fictional orphans, from Oliver Twist to Harry Potter, Dorothy is a symbol of loss and abandonment, while Kansas v Oz is the battle we all fight between reality and fantasy, home and elsewhere. Everyone has their own Oz, be it fame, money or love; but for immigrants, it is usually an actual place. For my Jewish grandparents, it was anywhere but Europe; for my parents, it was Europe; while my siblings and I begged to go back to Brazil.

The Lily puts on modest musical revue shows with dancing girls for the local working-class audience and is always one step away from bankruptcy.

Gilbert has said that she wanted to write a novel in which female desire was celebrated, rather than punished as it has been for so much of literary history, but a story in which actions have no consequences would be as dull as one of the Lily\u2019s early musical comedies, so inevitably Vivian causes a scandal that threatens the theatre\u2019s newfound success and the integrity of her friendships.

Lloyd wasn\u2019t sure whose original idea it was, but Lindsey Horan told her they decided whoever scored would perform the clap. \u201cIt was fun,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cI think it made a statement on the sideline.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FOXSoccer/status/1140292245368668161\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WHAT A GOAL FROM CARLI LLOYD! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8<br><br>Dream start for the USA! <a href=\"https://t.co/txYUkQTCTN\">pic.twitter.com/txYUkQTCTN</a></p>&mdash; FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FOXSoccer/status/1140292245368668161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 16, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>So much for their so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/15/its-great-when-theres-a-target-on-your-back-usa-untroubled-with-villain-role\">protective bubble that blocks out criticism</a>, eh?

      "bodyText": "In a result that surprised no one, the US women\u2019s national team punched past Chile to secure a spot in the knockout round of the Women\u2019s World Cup. The group stage rolls on, however, and the match against Sweden will determine the USA\u2019s path through the rest of the tournament. Now, first or second place in the group is up for grabs. Here is what we learned from the USA\u2019s 3-0 win on Sunday over Chile. The Americans are having fun, naysayers be darned With the controversy that ensued after the USWNT exuberantly celebrated all 13 goals they scored against Thailand, the Americans were a little more low-key in their celebrations against Chile.

Exercise felt like a slog. I tried colouring books, but they didn\u2019t work. I have extreme stage fright and I am an introvert, but I was fed up with my grey life and outlook and wanted to try something radically different.

We kept them buried for 20 years, remember?\u201d I said.</p> <p>I came to the scene with a fully formed story in my mind and struggled to deviate. I did not want this to be about a roast dinner. Pickles don\u2019t even belong in a roast dinner. How could I work with these people?</p> <p>I knew performing would be scary, but relinquishing control was the mind-screw I had not anticipated.</p> <p>In another scene, I was paired with a woman named Maria. \u201cYou\u2019re in a garden centre!\u201d Liam said. I didn\u2019t know what to say and neither did Maria, who looked at me blankly. Then, \u201cLook at these shrubs!\u201d she yelled, pointing at a beanbag.</p> <p>\u201cVery green!\u201d I finally said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think this shrub is doing?\u201d Maria asked.</p> <p>I froze.</p> <p>\u201cI think there\u2019s something wrong with this shrub,\u201d Maria added, her eyes pleading with me to join in.</p> <p>Spontaneous. Free-flowing. Yes, and \u2026?</p> <p>\u201cMa\u2019am, this shrub is PREGNANT!\u201d I shouted.</p> <p>Where had that come from? Free from my everyday boring self, I was discovering sides of my personality I had never known. I could feel my brain shifting as I became more creative, playful and animated.</p> <p>After safely delivering the shrub\u2019s baby (7lb 6oz, the mother is doing fine, thank you for asking), I began to realise that at improv you can\u2019t worry about work deadlines, breakups or money woes because you are constantly jumping from scene to scene. I was free from the agonising loop of being myself: introvert, anxious and shy. My anxiety evaporated in that room. My stage fright transformed into excitement, and I became dynamic, looser, more spontaneous. Happier.</p> <p>I had social anxiety, but in every scene, I leaped off a cliff into the unknown and my scene partners, virtual strangers, would catch me. After class, the world seemed kinder and more manageable because mistakes were so easily forgiven. My shyness slowly melted away.</p> <p>In one class, I laughed so hard that I cried, full-on shaking with laughter, as tears streamed down my face. My scene partner couldn\u2019t hold it together either, and the feeling came over me suddenly. Oh, no. My vigour for life appalled me.</p> <p>I now regularly try to make room for improv and play time in my life. It is a bright spot when I am feeling beaten down by the everyday. The three hours of laughter do wonders for my stress levels, and afterwards I sleep without a care. I love improv, which means I have to reckon with the most hideous thought: I might actually be a joyful, whimsical fool. However, I am far too busy playing a drunk scientist off the coast of Papua New Guinea to care.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Sorry I\u2019m Late, I Didn\u2019t Want to Come: An Introvert\u2019s Year of Living Dangerously by Jessica Pan </em><em>(Doubleday)</em><em> is \u00a312.99.

I froze. \u201cI think there\u2019s something wrong with this shrub,\u201d Maria added, her eyes pleading with me to join in. Spontaneous. Free-flowing. Yes, and \u2026? \u201cMa\u2019am, this shrub is PREGNANT!\u201d I shouted. Where had that come from? Free from my everyday boring self, I was discovering sides of my personality I had never known. I could feel my brain shifting as I became more creative, playful and animated. After safely delivering the shrub\u2019s baby (7lb 6oz, the mother is doing fine, thank you for asking), I began to realise that at improv you can\u2019t worry about work deadlines, breakups or money woes because you are constantly jumping from scene to scene. I was free from the agonising loop of being myself: introvert, anxious and shy. My anxiety evaporated in that room. My stage fright transformed into excitement, and I became dynamic, looser, more spontaneous. Happier. I had social anxiety, but in every scene, I leaped off a cliff into the unknown and my scene partners, virtual strangers, would catch me. After class, the world seemed kinder and more manageable because mistakes were so easily forgiven. My shyness slowly melted away. In one class, I laughed so hard that I cried, full-on shaking with laughter, as tears streamed down my face. My scene partner couldn\u2019t hold it together either, and the feeling came over me suddenly. Oh, no. My vigour for life appalled me. I now regularly try to make room for improv and play time in my life. It is a bright spot when I am feeling beaten down by the everyday. The three hours of laughter do wonders for my stress levels, and afterwards I sleep without a care. I love improv, which means I have to reckon with the most hideous thought: I might actually be a joyful, whimsical fool. However, I am far too busy playing a drunk scientist off the coast of Papua New Guinea to care. \u2022 Sorry I\u2019m Late, I Didn\u2019t Want to Come: An Introvert\u2019s Year of Living Dangerously by Jessica Pan (Doubleday) is \u00a312.99.

The rearguard action comes after the Australian Workers\u2019 Union secretary, Daniel Walton, became the latest labour movement leader to call for Setka\u2019s resignation. The Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary, Sally McManus, led the push last week, saying Setka should quit even if he was not guilty of harassment charges, for which he will face court this month. On Monday, Albanese stood firm on his push to expel Setka, saying the controversy had starved Labor and the union movement of \u201cclean air\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A psychologist who treats patients experiencing stress and anxiety with a dose of nature in Richmond Park says the expansion of Heathrow airport will be detrimental to mental health. Heathrow will on Tuesday publish a consultation on its \u201cmaster plan\u201d for airport expansion, including environmental aspects of building a third runway. Expert evidence, which will be submitted to the consultation by the Friends of Richmond Park, said the effect of low flying aircraft directly over the park for the first time as a result of the expansion would be damaging to mental health. Dr Alison Greenwood\u2019s evidence comes days after research which showed a two-hour \u201cdose\u201d of nature a week significantly boosts health and wellbeing. Under the planned expansion of Heathrow hundreds of planes will fly at low altitude over the park \u2013 a national nature reserve \u2013 for the first time. Greenwood said the potential negative effects of increased noise pollution from low-flying aircraft on mental wellbeing were of great concern in a country where one in four people suffered a mental health problem each year. She said: \u201cWith over 91% of us living in urban environments, and studies showing a significant increase in anxiety and mood disorders among city dwellers, one might expect our government to be doing all it could to protect our valuable natural spaces. \u201cIt seems irrational then that the government is allowing Heathrow, as part of its plans for the third runway, to propose routing for the first time 47 low-flying arrivals as well as between 17 and 47 extra departures every hour directly over Richmond Park, London\u2019s largest open space, a national nature reserve and a site of special scientific interest.\u201d Greenwood said she treated patients with mental health problems who were referred to her by GPs, with doses of nature in the park. \u201cThe conclusion of hundreds of scientific studies comprehensively demonstrates the mental health benefits of exposure to nature,\u201d she said. \u201cI regularly walk or sit in Richmond Park with people suffering from all kinds of mental distress, and I see first hand the powerful healing qualities of being in such a magnificent natural setting.\u201d According to the World Health Organization, environmental noise features among the top environmental risks to physical and mental health and wellbeing. The WHO guidelines recommend reducing noise levels produced by aircraft to below 45 decibels (dB). \u201cAircraft noise above this level is associated with adverse health effects,\u201d it said. Under the Heathrow expansion plans, hundreds of planes would produce noise levels of up to 80dB \u2013 nearly eight times the WHO guidelines \u2013 flying at 1,500 feet over the park. Boris Johnson, the frontrunner to win the Conservative leadership, has suggested he would drop his longstanding opposition to a third runway at Heathrow if he becomes prime minister, according to the Times. The former mayor of London, who told his constituents he would \u201clie down with you in front of those bulldozers and \u2026 stop the construction of that third runway,\u201d refused to reassure campaigners against the runway earlier this week that he would cancel the scheme. The Heathrow airspace and future operations consultation, which follows MPs\u2019 approval of the third runway last year, indicates that 47 arrivals an hour and between 17 and 47 departures would fly directly over the park at below 900 metres. Heathrow\u2019s flights are currently capped at 480,000 a year, but it wants to increase this by 25,000 in 2021 and further when the third runway is built.

It is clear that upending discrimination on the basis of age will require fundamental changes in the way society is structured.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have to come up with fairer and broader ways to access productivity, devise more ways for older people to continue to contribute, support them in their endeavours and decouple the value of a human being from success along any of these metrics,\u201d she says.</p> <p>It is not news that the population is ageing. Life expectancy in Britain is growing by a dramatic <a href=\"https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/five-hours-a-day/\">five hours a day</a>. Furthermore, in 2014, the average age of the UK population exceeded 40 for the first time \u2013 up from 33.9 in 1974. This is no mere blip; the trend will continue as life expectancy increases. In fact, this year marked a demographic turning point: for the first time since the early 1980s there were more people either too old or too young to work than there were of working age. The number of people in the UK aged 85 or more is expected to more than double in the next 25 years and by 2040, nearly one in seven Britons will be over 75. By 2066, 26% of the total population <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/ageing/articles/livinglongerhowourpopulationischangingandwhyitmatters/2018-08-13#how-is-the-uk-population-changing\" title=\"\">will be aged 65 years and over</a>. Some 10 million of us alive in the UK are likely to live past the age of 100.</p> <p>But despite the overwhelming message from media and society that wrinkles are unattractive, old people are incompetent and ageing is something to be feared, research also shows that people are happiest at the beginning and the end of their lives. And despite the fear that most of us have of care homes, the vast majority of people over 65 live independently: \u201cHow come so many of us unthinkingly assume that depression, diapers, and dementia lie ahead?\u201d asks Applewhite. \u201cThat the 20th century\u2019s astonishing leap in life expectancy is a disaster in the making? Underlying all the hand-wringing is ageism: discrimination that sidelines and silences older people.\u201d</p> <p>Applewhite\u2019s journey from her personal experience of ageing to the political stage seems to have hit the crest of a wave: the reception of her book has been more than enthusiastic. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/books/anne-lamott-leftie-guru-of-optimism.html\" title=\"\">Anne Lamott</a>, a New York Times bestselling author, said: \u201cI never use the word empower, but this book has empowered me.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the acclaim, however, the prevailing message about age and ageing is, Applewhite says, uniformly negative: \u201cThere are giant, legitimate challenges individually and structurally to scaling up the support an older population will require, and to the personal fears about running out of money and ending up alone. But what never occurs to most of us is that hugely amplifying those fears and contextualising them is the culture in which we age. The story of the 80-year-old supergeezer jumping out of an aeroplane or the 50-year-old woman waylaid by early Alzheimer\u2019s is going to get a lot more readers than the true story, which is that most of us muddle along fine and continue to do everything we always did, or at least, versions of it, right to the end.\u201d</p> <p>Ageism, she believes, is the \u201clast socially sanctioned prejudice\u201d. \u201cRacist and sexist comments no longer get a pass, but who even blinks when old people are described as worthless, incompetent, or \u2018out of it\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>Suppose, she suggests, we could step off \u201cthe treadmill of age denial and begin to see how ageism segregates and diminishes our prospects\u201d? \u201cUntil then,\u201d she says, \u201cageism will pit us against each other: it will rob society of an immense accrual of knowledge and experience; and it will poison our futures by framing longer, healthier lives as problems instead of the remarkable achievements and opportunities they represent.\u201d</p> <p>So how to counter ageism? Applewhite is clear about where we all need to start: \u201cThe first and most essential step is to look at our own attitudes towards age and ageing because most bias is unconscious and we can\u2019t challenge bias without thinking about it. All change starts within.\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t compliment an older person by telling her she is different \u2013 fitter, stronger, more stylish \u2013 than other people her age, she says. Watch out for sanitised or romanticised views of ageing: sexless, placid depictions of older people on a cruise or playing the token wise elder: \u201cIdealised depictions of later life distract from the real challenges of ageing and the need to confront them.\u201d Don\u2019t use adjectives for older people that you wouldn\u2019t use for younger ones, like feisty and kindly. Try active, opinionated and kind instead: \u201cChildren are little \u2013 their grandparents are not,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Above all, \u201cwe must be proud of our age,\u201d she says. \u201cAge pride is for everyone who refuses to regret waking up a day older, who acknowledges long life as the privilege it is, and who is prepared to challenge the power structures that underlie all discrimination.\u201d</p> <p><em>This Chair Rocks: A Manifesto Against Ageism by Ashton Applewhite is published </em><em>by Melville House UK for (\u00a312.99).

It is clear that upending discrimination on the basis of age will require fundamental changes in the way society is structured.\u201d \u201cWe have to come up with fairer and broader ways to access productivity, devise more ways for older people to continue to contribute, support them in their endeavours and decouple the value of a human being from success along any of these metrics,\u201d she says. It is not news that the population is ageing. Life expectancy in Britain is growing by a dramatic five hours a day. Furthermore, in 2014, the average age of the UK population exceeded 40 for the first time \u2013 up from 33.9 in 1974. This is no mere blip; the trend will continue as life expectancy increases. In fact, this year marked a demographic turning point: for the first time since the early 1980s there were more people either too old or too young to work than there were of working age. The number of people in the UK aged 85 or more is expected to more than double in the next 25 years and by 2040, nearly one in seven Britons will be over 75. By 2066, 26% of the total population will be aged 65 years and over. Some 10 million of us alive in the UK are likely to live past the age of 100. But despite the overwhelming message from media and society that wrinkles are unattractive, old people are incompetent and ageing is something to be feared, research also shows that people are happiest at the beginning and the end of their lives. And despite the fear that most of us have of care homes, the vast majority of people over 65 live independently: \u201cHow come so many of us unthinkingly assume that depression, diapers, and dementia lie ahead?\u201d asks Applewhite. \u201cThat the 20th century\u2019s astonishing leap in life expectancy is a disaster in the making? Underlying all the hand-wringing is ageism: discrimination that sidelines and silences older people.\u201d Applewhite\u2019s journey from her personal experience of ageing to the political stage seems to have hit the crest of a wave: the reception of her book has been more than enthusiastic. Anne Lamott, a New York Times bestselling author, said: \u201cI never use the word empower, but this book has empowered me.\u201d Despite the acclaim, however, the prevailing message about age and ageing is, Applewhite says, uniformly negative: \u201cThere are giant, legitimate challenges individually and structurally to scaling up the support an older population will require, and to the personal fears about running out of money and ending up alone. But what never occurs to most of us is that hugely amplifying those fears and contextualising them is the culture in which we age. The story of the 80-year-old supergeezer jumping out of an aeroplane or the 50-year-old woman waylaid by early Alzheimer\u2019s is going to get a lot more readers than the true story, which is that most of us muddle along fine and continue to do everything we always did, or at least, versions of it, right to the end.\u201d Ageism, she believes, is the \u201clast socially sanctioned prejudice\u201d. \u201cRacist and sexist comments no longer get a pass, but who even blinks when old people are described as worthless, incompetent, or \u2018out of it\u2019?\u201d Suppose, she suggests, we could step off \u201cthe treadmill of age denial and begin to see how ageism segregates and diminishes our prospects\u201d? \u201cUntil then,\u201d she says, \u201cageism will pit us against each other: it will rob society of an immense accrual of knowledge and experience; and it will poison our futures by framing longer, healthier lives as problems instead of the remarkable achievements and opportunities they represent.\u201d So how to counter ageism? Applewhite is clear about where we all need to start: \u201cThe first and most essential step is to look at our own attitudes towards age and ageing because most bias is unconscious and we can\u2019t challenge bias without thinking about it. All change starts within.\u201d Don\u2019t compliment an older person by telling her she is different \u2013 fitter, stronger, more stylish \u2013 than other people her age, she says. Watch out for sanitised or romanticised views of ageing: sexless, placid depictions of older people on a cruise or playing the token wise elder: \u201cIdealised depictions of later life distract from the real challenges of ageing and the need to confront them.\u201d Don\u2019t use adjectives for older people that you wouldn\u2019t use for younger ones, like feisty and kindly. Try active, opinionated and kind instead: \u201cChildren are little \u2013 their grandparents are not,\u201d she says. Above all, \u201cwe must be proud of our age,\u201d she says. \u201cAge pride is for everyone who refuses to regret waking up a day older, who acknowledges long life as the privilege it is, and who is prepared to challenge the power structures that underlie all discrimination.\u201d This Chair Rocks: A Manifesto Against Ageism by Ashton Applewhite is published by Melville House UK for (\u00a312.99).

      "bodyText": "The prime minister\u2019s department is mounting a costly legal battle to keep secret information the government has previously released, a situation described as \u201claughable\u201d. The Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick is trying to secure the release of the navy chief\u2019s diary as part of his attempts to investigate why a $4bn arms contract was awarded to German shipbuilder L\u00fcrssen instead of Australian firm Austal. But the Australian government has resisted his efforts, arguing the diary contains dates of cabinet meetings and would therefore reveal confidential cabinet information and is exempt from freedom of information law. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet is so convinced the dates should be kept secret, it is mounting what could prove a costly case in the administrative appeals tribunal (AAT) to keep the diary from the public. Similar cases Patrick has been involved in have cost taxpayers $150,000. But Guardian Australia has seen documents that show the government has previously released diaries containing the dates of cabinet meetings without objection. Earlier this year, the government released to Patrick the diaries of the resources minister, Matt Canavan, which contained the dates of numerous cabinet meetings. Neither the minister\u2019s office or the prime minister\u2019s department raised any objection to the publication of cabinet meeting dates. Patrick said the information commissioner has already ruled that the navy chief\u2019s diary should be published, finding cabinet dates were not exempt from release. \u201cI do not agree with the department that the documents include \u2018advice that is proposed to be provided to the cabinet for the purposes of deliberation by a minister or the government of the commonwealth\u2019,\u201d the information commissioner, Angelene Falk, said. \u201cIt is my view that the entries recorded in the documents do not contain any opinion, advice, recommendations, consultations or deliberations that have taken place.\u201d Following that decision, the defence department agreed to release the documents, only for the prime minister\u2019s department to intervene at the last moment. The PM\u2019s department said it was seeking a review of the decision as an \u201caffected third party\u201d and that the diaries contained \u201ccabinet-in-confidence material\u201d. Patrick said that view was at odds with the previous release of similar material. \u201cIt\u2019s laughable to suggest the dates that cabinet meetings are properly a secret, they are not,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cI know that, the information commissioner knows that, and so too does minister Canavan.\u201d Asked about the inconsistency, the department said it believed the documents contained cabinet-in-confidence material. \u201cTherefore, as the custodian of Cabinet information and processes, the Department has exercised its right of review,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cAs the matter is currently with the AAT, it is not appropriate to comment further.\u201d \u201cQuestions in relation to the FOI decision by the Minister for Resources and Northern Australia should be directed to his Office.\u201d Patrick has been one of many transparency advocates openly critical of the current FOI regime.

After a stockpiling rush this year that pumped up the rate of economic growth, the British Chambers of Commerce said growth would slow in 2020 and 2021. The organisation has slashed its forecast for GDP growth next year to just 1%, from 1.3%, marking the weakest expansion in the British economy since the 2009 recession that followed the financial crisis. Growth is also forecast to remain subdued in 2021, at 1.2%, down from its previous estimate of 1.4%. The British economy has benefited in recent months as companies braced for a no-deal Brexit ahead of the original deadline of 29 March, before Theresa May delayed the process until the autumn. The unprecedented rise in manufacturers storing up raw materials and components fuelled a rise in GDP of 0.5% in the first three months of the year, which the BCC said should lift the overall growth rate in for 2019 as a whole. However, the increase means firms now have inventories they can run down without needing to place as many orders for new stock, hitting economic momentum.

They stayed mostly civil towards each other, but Jeremy Hunt called out Johnson\u2019s no-show and four of them ganged up on Dominic Raab over his openness to forcing through a no-deal Brexit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/08/suspending-parliament-should-not-be-ruled-out-says-dominic-raab\">without the permission of parliament</a>.</p> \n<h2>Jeremy Hunt</h2> \n<p><strong>Overall pitch</strong> Hunt stressed that he is an entrepreneur with the negotiating skills to get a better deal with the EU.</p> \n<p><strong>Best line</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>I just want to say: where is Boris? If his team won\u2019t let him out to debate with five<strong> </strong>pretty friendly colleagues, how is he going to get on with 27 European colleagues?

He distinguished himself mostly by being the only one to call out Johnson for not turning up.<br><strong>Overall rating</strong> 4/5</p> \n<h2><strong>Michael Gove</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Overall pitch</strong> Gove presented himself as a true Brexit believer for whom getting out of the EU is personal, but he also emphasised his history of delivering difficult political goals against the odds.</p> \n<p><strong>Best line</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>You must allow parliament to vote. You cannot leave unless parliament votes for it, Dom [Raab]. I will defend our democracy and you cannot take Britain out of the EU against the will of parliament.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Worst moment</strong> Patronisingly ticking off Channel 4\u2019s moderator Krishnan Guru-Murthy and telling him now was the time for him to listen. There were also a couple of cringeworthy lines about looking for the treasure in everyone\u2019s hearts and wanting to make children his political priority.</p> \n<p><strong>Still in the race?</strong> He is still in contention for second place on the shortlist opposite Johnson and he ratcheted up the passion about Brexit, but this was not a standout performance. His best moments were a fierce defence of Javid over the challenge that he was not a big enough figure to be invited to the Donald Trump state visit dinner, and an attack on Raab for suggesting he could deliver Brexit without the permission of parliament.<br><strong>Overall rating </strong>3/5</p> \n<h2><strong>Sajid Javid</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Overall pitch </strong>Javid set out the case that he is an outsider and not from central casting of the Conservative party as a working class son of a bus driver who has made it to home secretary.</p> \n<p><strong>Best line</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>We are not selecting a dictator of this country. We are choosing a prime minister of this country \u2026 You don\u2019t deliver on democracy by trashing democracy.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Worst moment</strong> He stumbled over his words on a few occasions.</p> \n<p><strong>Still in the race? </strong>Javid gave a strong answer on the need to defeat racism and embrace modern Britain.

      "bodyText": "Five candidates minus Boris Johnson took each other on in the head-to-head debate televised debate on Channel 4. They stayed mostly civil towards each other, but Jeremy Hunt called out Johnson\u2019s no-show and four of them ganged up on Dominic Raab over his openness to forcing through a no-deal Brexit without the permission of parliament. Jeremy Hunt Overall pitch Hunt stressed that he is an entrepreneur with the negotiating skills to get a better deal with the EU. Best line I just want to say: where is Boris? If his team won\u2019t let him out to debate with five pretty friendly colleagues, how is he going to get on with 27 European colleagues? He should be here to answer that question. Worst moment He laid on the reminders that he used to be a successful businessman a bit too thickly. Still in the race? It was a steady but not stellar performance from Hunt who is hoping to stay in second position and make the final two. He distinguished himself mostly by being the only one to call out Johnson for not turning up. Overall rating 4/5 Michael Gove Overall pitch Gove presented himself as a true Brexit believer for whom getting out of the EU is personal, but he also emphasised his history of delivering difficult political goals against the odds. Best line You must allow parliament to vote. You cannot leave unless parliament votes for it, Dom [Raab]. I will defend our democracy and you cannot take Britain out of the EU against the will of parliament. Worst moment Patronisingly ticking off Channel 4\u2019s moderator Krishnan Guru-Murthy and telling him now was the time for him to listen. There were also a couple of cringeworthy lines about looking for the treasure in everyone\u2019s hearts and wanting to make children his political priority. Still in the race? He is still in contention for second place on the shortlist opposite Johnson and he ratcheted up the passion about Brexit, but this was not a standout performance. His best moments were a fierce defence of Javid over the challenge that he was not a big enough figure to be invited to the Donald Trump state visit dinner, and an attack on Raab for suggesting he could deliver Brexit without the permission of parliament. Overall rating 3/5 Sajid Javid Overall pitch Javid set out the case that he is an outsider and not from central casting of the Conservative party as a working class son of a bus driver who has made it to home secretary. Best line We are not selecting a dictator of this country. We are choosing a prime minister of this country \u2026 You don\u2019t deliver on democracy by trashing democracy. Worst moment He stumbled over his words on a few occasions. Still in the race? Javid gave a strong answer on the need to defeat racism and embrace modern Britain. However, he is struggling to win over MPs despite his impressive back story and it does not feel like this performance will move the dial. Overall rating 3/5 Dominic Raab Overall pitch Raab\u2019s refrain is that he is the only candidate who can be trusted to take the UK out of the EU by the end of October. He said politicians need to keep their promises on Brexit and claimed to be the only one who would do so. Best line We\u2019ve got to show people who feel left behind that we\u2019re on their side. This is very tangible ... I want a fairer society, not just a fairer economy. Worst moment Accusing Stewart of wanting to turn the UK into Venezuela over his citizens\u2019 assembly idea was a low point. Still in the race? Raab spoke competently and delivered good answers on opening up education more but had no answer to how he would take the UK out of the EU with no deal without suspending parliament. Overall rating 2/5 Rory Stewart Overall pitch Stewart made the case that a no-deal Brexit is a complete nonsense and painted the other candidates as unrealistic. He also highlighted his efforts to listen to what people in the country during his walking tours of Britain as part of the leadership contest. Best line The fundamental issue here is there is a competition of machismo. Everyone is saying \u2018I\u2019m tougher\u2019. Every time I have this debate everyone is like, \u2018trust me, I\u2019m the guy, I can defeat the impossible odds\u2019. And I\u2019m accused of being a defeatist by trying to be realistic. It reminds me of trying to cram a whole series of rubbish bags into the rubbish bin \u2026 I was tempted to say believe in the bin, believe in Britain. It\u2019s nonsense. Worst moment He repeatedly urged Guru-Murthy and others to let him finish speaking, sounding petulant and wasting valuable debating time. Still in the race? Stewart is not expected to soar past the others into second place to take on Johnson. However, he had the best lines and gave the best challenge, grilling Raab on what the tariff on cheddar would be under a no-deal Brexit. Even though he is unlikely to make the cut, he was the most articulate of the five and got a lot of audience appreciation. Overall rating 5/5",

      "body": "<p><strong>Q</strong> I hope you might be able to provide some insight for me as I begin my (optimistic) search for a first property. I\u2019m 26 years old and single and a couple of years ago, I received a \u00a3150,000 inheritance. I have sat on it since then but have finally come to the decision to buy a one-bedroom flat in London. I was renting until a month ago but am now back living with parents to give me a chance to save enough money for legal costs and furniture while I navigate my options.</p> <p>I am also in the process of finding a new job and expect to have a salary of \u00a332,000, once I have been in the job three months. So sometime in October or November I hope to be in a position to buy a property using the help-to-buy scheme. I expect to pay about \u00a3400,000 split 37.5% deposit, 37.5% help-to -buy and 25% mortgage. I\u2019m nervous that although I would could get a mortgage of 25% of the value of the flat, there\u2019s no guarantee that my salary will increase enough to cover the repayments when they kick in on the help-to-buy equity loan in five years\u2019 time and this may effect my chances of getting the mortgage. I have separate funds that will cover the stamp duty and upfront costs and so on, so this is not an issue. I\u2019m very lucky to have this deposit but due to my salary I\u2019m not sure home ownership is available to me.<br><strong>LH</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Home ownership won\u2019t be an option until you are confirmed as having a permanent position in your new job because even with your sizeable deposit, you wouldn\u2019t be able to get a mortgage. And without a mortgage, you wouldn\u2019t qualify for a help-to-buy equity loan. To qualify for 40% equity loan assistance from London help-to-buy, you have to take out a first mortgage for at least 25% of the value of the property you want to buy. And that mortgage plus your cash deposit must be a minimum of 60% of the purchase price. The mortgage-plus-deposit minimum is 80% for help-to-buy outside London.</p> <p>But as well as waiting until you have a permanent job, there\u2019s no point formally applying for a mortgage until you have been assessed and approved by your local help-to-buy agent (although it would be worth talking to a mortgage adviser to get an idea of the size of mortgage you could afford). The assessment is used to ensure that you are in a position to afford your mortgage and the agent works to a guideline to check that your monthly mortgage costs \u2013 plus service charges and fees \u2013 are no more than 45% of your take-home pay. The mortgage must also not be more than 4.5 times your household income which is good news for you as a \u00a3100,000 mortgage would be only 3.125 times your \u00a332,000 salary.</p> <p>You don\u2019t need to worry about your chances of getting a mortgage being affected by the interest charges on the help-to-buy equity loan because for the first five years the equity loan is interest-free. In year six, the interest on the equity loan \u2013 plus the monthly management fee of \u00a31 which is charged from day one of having the loan \u2013 is paid to Homes England and is separate from your main mortgage. The interest charged in year six is 1.75% of the original equity loan so, in your case \u2013 with an equity loan of \u00a3150,000 - you would pay \u00a32,625 in interest which works out at \u00a3218.75 a month.

I\u2019m very lucky to have this deposit but due to my salary I\u2019m not sure home ownership is available to me. LH A Home ownership won\u2019t be an option until you are confirmed as having a permanent position in your new job because even with your sizeable deposit, you wouldn\u2019t be able to get a mortgage. And without a mortgage, you wouldn\u2019t qualify for a help-to-buy equity loan. To qualify for 40% equity loan assistance from London help-to-buy, you have to take out a first mortgage for at least 25% of the value of the property you want to buy. And that mortgage plus your cash deposit must be a minimum of 60% of the purchase price. The mortgage-plus-deposit minimum is 80% for help-to-buy outside London. But as well as waiting until you have a permanent job, there\u2019s no point formally applying for a mortgage until you have been assessed and approved by your local help-to-buy agent (although it would be worth talking to a mortgage adviser to get an idea of the size of mortgage you could afford). The assessment is used to ensure that you are in a position to afford your mortgage and the agent works to a guideline to check that your monthly mortgage costs \u2013 plus service charges and fees \u2013 are no more than 45% of your take-home pay. The mortgage must also not be more than 4.5 times your household income which is good news for you as a \u00a3100,000 mortgage would be only 3.125 times your \u00a332,000 salary. You don\u2019t need to worry about your chances of getting a mortgage being affected by the interest charges on the help-to-buy equity loan because for the first five years the equity loan is interest-free. In year six, the interest on the equity loan \u2013 plus the monthly management fee of \u00a31 which is charged from day one of having the loan \u2013 is paid to Homes England and is separate from your main mortgage. The interest charged in year six is 1.75% of the original equity loan so, in your case \u2013 with an equity loan of \u00a3150,000 - you would pay \u00a32,625 in interest which works out at \u00a3218.75 a month. The interest rate rises by the increase in the Retail Prices Index plus 1%. Want expert help finding your new mortgage?

The artist, who passed away last year, has been noted for capturing her subjects with \u201cfrank empathy and humanism\u201d. \u201cShe celebrates people in the margins, not polished airbrushed people we see everywhere today,\u201d said Esparza. \u201cIt\u2019s her and her body and her friends, not these archetypal supermodels, there\u2019s beauty in that.\u201d \u201cShe inspired me with her diligence and despite the fact that she could barely afford to live, she made prints, editions \u2026 she never stopped making work,\u201d he adds. There\u2019s also the works of performance artist and activist Patrisse Cullors, a photographer who co-founded the Black Lives Matter movement and whose photography was crucial to include, as much of LGBT art that makes its way to the mainstream is by white men. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of great art and stories to tell, we\u2019re forging that territory,\u201d said Esparza. Carlos Almaraz, a Mexican American painter who was a pioneer of the Chicano street art movement, is showing The Struggle of Mankind, a work from 1989 which shows an act of violence. There are also works by Maurice Harris, a photographer who puts black subjects alongside intricate floral arrangements. \u201cThey\u2019re a celebration of the African American diaspora,\u201d said Esparza. \u201cWhen we see people of color in the news, there\u2019s usually some kind of turmoil, but Maurice is countering that with these beautiful black folks in beautiful settings, an antidote to the poison out there.\u201d Then there\u2019s Nao Bustamante, whose work celebrates the women who fought in the Mexican Revolution from 1910 and beyond, as soldiers who fought during the civil war, as well as nurses who took care of others. \u201cIt\u2019s celebrating the women; documenting these women,\u201d said Esparza. \u201cIt\u2019s not really recorded and there were hard-hitting women from that time.\u201d The exhibition opening falls on the same week as the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, where the LGBT community fought against police raids of New York City\u2019s Stonewall Inn in 1969. However, the artists here are based in California, so there are references to historic gay activism on the west coast. That includes the Black Cat riots, where the Black Cat Tavern gay bar in Los Angeles held the country\u2019s first gay rights protest in 1967, and the rarely remembered Cooper Do-nuts riot from 1959 in Los Angeles, where the gay and trans community rioted against police harassment at a 24-hour Cooper Do-nuts cafe. \u201cI want to make sure we bring the whole spectrum and respect the people of color in the queer community, it\u2019s important to have that balance,\u201d said Esparza. \u201cOnce in a while, it\u2019s great to bring together brown and black people where people connect and see something in each other and create great friendships. These exhibitions are builders of great community. I\u2019m just doing my part to tell those stories and push those stories out.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 21 June 2019 to correct a suggestion in the first paragraph that the exhibition was on display in San Francisco rather than San Diego.",

      "bodyText": "Nancy Mart\u00ednez was 17 when she went into labour. Though her age meant she was considered a high-risk pregnancy, she was left alone for several hours without monitoring or pain medication. Nurses told Mart\u00ednez to be quiet and put up with the pain, while doctors mocked her mother, Nancy Ceron Diaz, denying her information about her daughter\u2019s condition. \u201cMy daughter was screaming, but it was only when her face turned green that she was transferred to the maternity hospital,\u201d says Diaz, 41. Mart\u00ednez\u2019s baby boy, who suffered asphyxia as a result of being trapped unaided in the cervix for hours, was left with permanent brain damage. Now 30 months old, he cannot sit unaided or eat solid food, and will need full-time care for the rest of his life. Mart\u00ednez\u2019s case, which dates back to January 2017, is among a growing number reported to Mexican human rights officials in an effort to hold hospitals to account for the violent treatment afforded mainly poor and indigenous women and girls when they give birth. Mart\u00ednez is from Tlapa, the biggest town in the rural La Monta\u00f1a region of Guerrero \u2013 one of Mexico\u2019s poorest states, with high rates of teenage pregnancy, infant and maternal mortality and gender-based violence. There were five maternal deaths in La Monta\u00f1a during the first three months of 2019, compared with nine in the entire preceding year. Obstetric violence is a legal term coined in Latin America to describe cruel, degrading and negligent treatment during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period. Such treatment, which happens in both private and public hospitals, leads to unnecessary pain and suffering, humiliation, ill-health, sterility and even death. The prevalence of obstetric violence is unknown in Mexico \u2013 the same applies globally \u2013 but, according to the World Health Organization, teenagers, impoverished women, those living in rural areas, and women of colour are more likely to experience abusive treatment. In Mexico, the problem is historically rooted in racist health policies that systematically turned normal pregnancies into high-risk ones, according to medical historian Elizabeth O\u2019Brien. \u201cAs long as they got the baby out and baptised so it could become part of God\u2019s kingdom, the woman\u2019s life and her capacity to give birth in the future didn\u2019t matter,\u201d O\u2019Brien says. This pattern of medical care is ongoing. In 2013, images of an indigenous woman, Irma L\u00f3pez, giving birth in an Oaxaca hospital courtyard after being turned away by staff sparked outrage. Meanwhile, almost 50% of babies are delivered by caesarean in Latin America \u2013 a surgery that increases the risk of life-threatening complications for women \u2013 compared with an optimal rate of 10-15%, according to the World Health Organization. The general and maternity hospitals in Tlapa have officially endorsed zero-tolerance policies against discrimination, yet some women from communities without running water are denigrated for being unclean and refused attention until they bathe. Others are reprimanded for screaming in pain during labour, according to midwife Elizabeth Melgar, the clinical coordinator at the state school of midwifery. \u201cObstetric violence keeps happening, especially to indigenous women who don\u2019t speak Spanish,\u201d says Melgar Consuela Moreno, 32, went to hospital with a piercing headache, nausea and cold sweats, barely able to stand. Tests revealed that she was pregnant and Moreno, already the mother of two children, told the duty doctor something was very wrong. Her symptoms were dismissed as typical pregnancy complaints. After seven hours in the emergency room, Moreno begged her husband to take her home. \u201cI\u2019d rather die at home than here.\u201d Her husband says Moreno was mocked by the doctor, who insisted she was fine \u2013 until a colleague discovered her blood pressure was dangerously high. She was transferred to the maternity hospital and rushed to surgery with an ectopic pregnancy. It is unclear what happened in theatre, but doctors told the family that while Moreno wouldn\u2019t be able to have more children, she would recover. But Moreno never regained consciousness. She died a couple of days later, in December 2018, leaving the family devastated and questioning the care she received. \u201cNo one took her temperature or blood pressure for seven hours, they just let my wife die,\u201d says Fidel Leon, 56. \u201cI feel so guilty for not having money to take her to a private hospital.

      "body": "<p>For more than nine months, Alex Whitecross\u2019s routine on waking was to check the data about his sleep on his fitness tracker. And then he would feel quite anxious. \u201cI started getting paranoid about how much sleep I was getting,\u201d he says. Whitecross, a computer-aided-design technician from south Wales, says he bought his tracker in order to measure exercise, but became interested in the sleep-monitoring function. \u201cI\u2019m a lighter sleeper than my fiance so I thought it would help me, but it ended up having the opposite effect.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sometimes he would check it in the night and feel panicked about how many hours he had until his alarm would go off. In the morning, \u201cI would wake up and look at it, and it would say I\u2019d had five hours and 44 minutes sleep, and spent an hour and 25 minutes awake at night. It made me feel more tired, knowing how little sleep I\u2019d got.\u201d He noticed, as time went on, \u201cI was getting less and less sleep as I was wearing it\u201d. </p> \n<p>We are chronically underslept \u2013 in the UK, the average person is getting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/01/uk-hours-sleep-night-report-average-royal-society-for-public-health\" title=\"\">an hour less than they need</a> \u2013 and the market has taken notice. The sleep aids market is predicted by the market-research firm Persistence to be <a href=\"http://www.sbwire.com/press-releases/global-sleep-aids-market-to-reflect-a-modest-cagr-of-57-by-2020-867354.htm\" title=\"\">worth $81bn (\u00a364bn) by next year</a>. There are a wealth of gadgets, aids and apps that claim to improve and monitor your sleep. You can buy a mattress that <a href=\"https://www.sleepnumber.com/sn/en/beds/Performance-Series-Beds/p/p6\" title=\"\">adjusts to your needs</a> throughout the night, anti-snoring masks and headbands that are claimed to track your brainwaves.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"245d5abc-f063-496c-ad89-1aede156ffa6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rJ2mkv5GJhc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Alongside this booming industry is a rise in what has become known as orthosomnia, a term coined in a <a href=\"http://jcsm.aasm.org/viewabstract.aspx?pid=30955\" title=\"\">2017 case report</a> in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine. The researchers chose the term, they wrote, \u201cbecause the perfectionist quest to achieve perfect sleep is similar to the unhealthy preoccupation with healthy eating, termed orthorexia\u201d.</p> \n<p>Although orthosomnia is not a formal diagnosis yet, Alanna Hare, a consultant in sleep and ventilation at the Royal Brompton hospital, says it is something she is familiar with in her clinic. \u201cI\u2019ve seen patients coming in with their sleep trackers and telling me they have a sleep problem because their tracker tells them they\u2019re not having enough sleep, or that all their sleep is light sleep.\u201d When she asks how they feel, many of them say they feel fine, but they are worried about what the data from their tracker is telling them.</p> \n<p>She is seeing people, she says, \u201cwho probably didn\u2019t have a problem until they started to become overly focused on their sleep. A hallmark of insomnia is \u201ceffortful\u201d sleep, or trying to get to sleep, and that is what will happen if you become overly focused on getting eight hours and a particular type of sleep. It can cause a problem that was never there in the first place.\u201d</p> \n<p>Guy Leschziner, a consultant neurologist and the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/nocturnal-brain-9781471176357.html\" title=\"\">The Nocturnal Brain</a>, says that about 20% of his patients show signs of orthosomnia. Michael Farquhar, a consultant in paediatric sleep medicine at Evelina London children\u2019s hospital, says he has seen parents who have put a sleep tracker on their child\u2019s wrist, or teenagers who use them. \u201cThey\u2019re quite tempting \u2013 they give nice graphs, pictures, numbers,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are trying to metricise their sleep and really think about it in a way we didn\u2019t before. I think that has positives and negatives.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sleep trackers can be helpful in making an effort to get a good night\u2019s sleep, says Hare. \u201cThey can be part of a move towards appreciating how important it is to get sleep. It\u2019s only a problem if people read more into the data than the data can give them.\u201d And much of it depends on the personality and sleep habits of an individual. For someone who is not getting enough sleep because they are staying up bingeing box sets rather than because they are vulnerable to sleeplessness, says Leschziner, \u201cit\u2019s unlikely sleep trackers will have any negative consequences. In those individuals, it may have a beneficial effect because it highlights they are spending very little time in bed.\u201d</p> \n<p>There have long been <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4531402/\" title=\"\">serious doubts</a> about the accuracy of the data from sleep trackers, most of which rely on sensing movement, heart rate and even the sounds you make. \u201cWhen we assess sleep, we do something called a polysomnogram, and that includes monitoring brainwave activity, eye movement, muscle tension, movement, breathing,\u201d says Hare. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of data that you have to have to be able to say what sleep stage that person is in and how much sleep they have had.\u201d </p> \n<p>Another problem with trackers is that sleep requirements are unique to each person. The \u201cideal\u201d eight hours sleep a night is an average \u2013 some people will need more, some less; being told you are falling short can cause anxiety. \u201cThe population level data would suggest most adults need somewhere between seven and nine hours sleep a night, on average,\u201d says Hare. \u201cEight hours just happens to be in the middle. As an individual, you need whatever sleep it takes to wake up feeling refreshed.\u201d</p> \n<p>If you have sleep problems, or are the sort of person who might be worried your sleep isn\u2019t as good as it should be, tracking how much you are getting can become an unhealthy fixation. \u201cIf you have a device that is telling you, rightly or wrongly, that your sleep is really bad then that is going to increase your anxiety and may well drive more chronic insomnia,\u201d says Leschziner. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that, but we\u2019re also seeing people saying: \u2018My sleep tracker is telling me I\u2019m awake at night,\u2019 but when you talk to them, they have no recollection of being awake and they sleep well, they wake up feeling refreshed. They start becoming concerned that their sleep tracker is telling them they have been awake for half the night.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sleep trackers, he adds, could \u201chave quite significant opportunities [and] different roles in research, clinical medicine and as consumer devices.\u201d Or, as <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2019/05/16/sleepless-in-silicon-valley\" title=\"\">an article in the Economist last month</a> put it: \u201cSleep-tracking is at exactly the stage that fitness-tracking technology was at a decade ago.\u201d The article predicted that people will soon be sharing their sleep stats on Facebook the way they share their fitness data.</p> \n<p>Despite Silicon Valley\u2019s best efforts, it is worth remembering that sleep, as Leschziner points out, is \u201can objective brain state, [but] is also subjective, so can be influenced by your expectations of sleep, by environmental factors, behavioural factors, a whole range of things. If your sleep tracker is telling you something, that may well influence your subjective experience of sleep as well.\u201d</p> \n<p>Whitecross recognises this. Seeing what his fitness tracker was telling him each morning about his supposed lack of sleep \u201cmade me feel more tired than if I\u2019d just woken up and thought: \u2018Last night was a bit restless.\u2019\u201d It took a couple of weeks, but once he had stopped using it, he started to sleep much better.</p>",

Whitecross, a computer-aided-design technician from south Wales, says he bought his tracker in order to measure exercise, but became interested in the sleep-monitoring function. \u201cI\u2019m a lighter sleeper than my fiance so I thought it would help me, but it ended up having the opposite effect.\u201d Sometimes he would check it in the night and feel panicked about how many hours he had until his alarm would go off. In the morning, \u201cI would wake up and look at it, and it would say I\u2019d had five hours and 44 minutes sleep, and spent an hour and 25 minutes awake at night. It made me feel more tired, knowing how little sleep I\u2019d got.\u201d He noticed, as time went on, \u201cI was getting less and less sleep as I was wearing it\u201d. We are chronically underslept \u2013 in the UK, the average person is getting an hour less than they need \u2013 and the market has taken notice. The sleep aids market is predicted by the market-research firm Persistence to be worth $81bn (\u00a364bn) by next year. There are a wealth of gadgets, aids and apps that claim to improve and monitor your sleep. You can buy a mattress that adjusts to your needs throughout the night, anti-snoring masks and headbands that are claimed to track your brainwaves. Alongside this booming industry is a rise in what has become known as orthosomnia, a term coined in a 2017 case report in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine. The researchers chose the term, they wrote, \u201cbecause the perfectionist quest to achieve perfect sleep is similar to the unhealthy preoccupation with healthy eating, termed orthorexia\u201d. Although orthosomnia is not a formal diagnosis yet, Alanna Hare, a consultant in sleep and ventilation at the Royal Brompton hospital, says it is something she is familiar with in her clinic. \u201cI\u2019ve seen patients coming in with their sleep trackers and telling me they have a sleep problem because their tracker tells them they\u2019re not having enough sleep, or that all their sleep is light sleep.\u201d When she asks how they feel, many of them say they feel fine, but they are worried about what the data from their tracker is telling them. She is seeing people, she says, \u201cwho probably didn\u2019t have a problem until they started to become overly focused on their sleep. A hallmark of insomnia is \u201ceffortful\u201d sleep, or trying to get to sleep, and that is what will happen if you become overly focused on getting eight hours and a particular type of sleep. It can cause a problem that was never there in the first place.\u201d Guy Leschziner, a consultant neurologist and the author of The Nocturnal Brain, says that about 20% of his patients show signs of orthosomnia. Michael Farquhar, a consultant in paediatric sleep medicine at Evelina London children\u2019s hospital, says he has seen parents who have put a sleep tracker on their child\u2019s wrist, or teenagers who use them. \u201cThey\u2019re quite tempting \u2013 they give nice graphs, pictures, numbers,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are trying to metricise their sleep and really think about it in a way we didn\u2019t before. I think that has positives and negatives.\u201d Sleep trackers can be helpful in making an effort to get a good night\u2019s sleep, says Hare. \u201cThey can be part of a move towards appreciating how important it is to get sleep. It\u2019s only a problem if people read more into the data than the data can give them.\u201d And much of it depends on the personality and sleep habits of an individual. For someone who is not getting enough sleep because they are staying up bingeing box sets rather than because they are vulnerable to sleeplessness, says Leschziner, \u201cit\u2019s unlikely sleep trackers will have any negative consequences. In those individuals, it may have a beneficial effect because it highlights they are spending very little time in bed.\u201d There have long been serious doubts about the accuracy of the data from sleep trackers, most of which rely on sensing movement, heart rate and even the sounds you make. \u201cWhen we assess sleep, we do something called a polysomnogram, and that includes monitoring brainwave activity, eye movement, muscle tension, movement, breathing,\u201d says Hare. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of data that you have to have to be able to say what sleep stage that person is in and how much sleep they have had.\u201d Another problem with trackers is that sleep requirements are unique to each person. The \u201cideal\u201d eight hours sleep a night is an average \u2013 some people will need more, some less; being told you are falling short can cause anxiety. \u201cThe population level data would suggest most adults need somewhere between seven and nine hours sleep a night, on average,\u201d says Hare. \u201cEight hours just happens to be in the middle. As an individual, you need whatever sleep it takes to wake up feeling refreshed.\u201d If you have sleep problems, or are the sort of person who might be worried your sleep isn\u2019t as good as it should be, tracking how much you are getting can become an unhealthy fixation. \u201cIf you have a device that is telling you, rightly or wrongly, that your sleep is really bad then that is going to increase your anxiety and may well drive more chronic insomnia,\u201d says Leschziner. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that, but we\u2019re also seeing people saying: \u2018My sleep tracker is telling me I\u2019m awake at night,\u2019 but when you talk to them, they have no recollection of being awake and they sleep well, they wake up feeling refreshed. They start becoming concerned that their sleep tracker is telling them they have been awake for half the night.\u201d Sleep trackers, he adds, could \u201chave quite significant opportunities [and] different roles in research, clinical medicine and as consumer devices.\u201d Or, as an article in the Economist last month put it: \u201cSleep-tracking is at exactly the stage that fitness-tracking technology was at a decade ago.\u201d The article predicted that people will soon be sharing their sleep stats on Facebook the way they share their fitness data. Despite Silicon Valley\u2019s best efforts, it is worth remembering that sleep, as Leschziner points out, is \u201can objective brain state, [but] is also subjective, so can be influenced by your expectations of sleep, by environmental factors, behavioural factors, a whole range of things. If your sleep tracker is telling you something, that may well influence your subjective experience of sleep as well.\u201d Whitecross recognises this. Seeing what his fitness tracker was telling him each morning about his supposed lack of sleep \u201cmade me feel more tired than if I\u2019d just woken up and thought: \u2018Last night was a bit restless.\u2019\u201d It took a couple of weeks, but once he had stopped using it, he started to sleep much better.",

Reagan\u2019s successor, George HW Bush, pardoned the six leading figures of the Iran-Contra affair because, he said, \u201cwhether their actions were right or wrong\u201d, they were motivated by \u201cpatriotism\u201d.

(The public recognized that the charges were politically motivated, Clinton\u2019s popularity only rose, and the Senate ultimately voted to acquit.)</p> <p>But when George W Bush, a Republican, took office, Republicans once again deferred to executive lawlessness. In order to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq, administration officials falsely argued that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. To silence opposition, a member of the administration unmasked a CIA officer. \u201cScooter\u201d Libby, chief of staff to Dick Cheney, was ultimately convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice in the ensuing investigation; no one was held criminally responsible for the disinformation used to justify the Iraq war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people.</p> <p>During the Obama administration, partisanship once again trumped the law.

Exhibited in Sin Fronteras at the Palacio de la Magdalena PhotoEspana, Madrid\u2019s annual celebration of photography, offers an extensive programme of exhibitions to suit all tastes. The work of established figures such William Klein, Berenice Abbott, and Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo is on display alongside shows introducing young, emerging European photographers. The subjects of the exhibitions are equally diverse, ranging from rare Soviet photobooks to snapshots bought on eBay, from collective projects decades in the making to solo undertakings completed in months. USSR in Construction magazine, from the exhibition Avant-garde and Propaganda, Russian Books and Magazines from the Archivo Lafuente 1913-1941 at C\u00edrculo de Bellas Artes. Portraits by Diana Markosian await the hang at Casa de America International Women\u2019s Day march, Madrid, 2019 by Donna Ferrato. From the exhibition Holy at C\u00edrculo de Bellas Artes Among the many highlights is a comprehensive overview of photography projects by Stephen Shore, Josef Koudelka, Lewis Baltz, Sophie Ristelhueber and Raymond Depardon, who were officially commissioned to chart the changing landscapes of Europe from the early 1980s to the present day. Two exhibitions celebrate Donna Ferrato\u2019s tireless work in combating domestic abuse. And the late Leila Alaoui\u2019s sympathetic portraits of The Moroccans are displayed to sober effect at Casa \u00c1rabe. From the series Like by Eduardo Nave, at Galer\u00eda Juan Sili\u00f3 We are here, Seclin, 2001, from the series Lille Metropolis by Ralph Hinterkeuser, at Museo Ico Esauira, 2012 by Leila Alaoui from The Moroccans at Casa \u00c1rabe At the heart of the festival are five exhibitions of art photography, gathered under the heading deja vu because of their dependence on antecedent traditions, ideas and works, which reflect on the current nature, limits and possibilities of the medium. Elina Brotherus, for example, produces work that engages with the legacy of conceptual art of the 1960s and 70s. Clare Strand makes painted versions of tabloid photographs. Patrick Pound and D\u00e9lio Jasse reinterpret archival material to radically different ends. Laura Letinsky and Sharon Core use the still life as a means of raising questions about genre, tradition and reproduction. Untitled 49 (detail) by Laura Letinksy, from the series Ill Form and Void Full, 2013 at Museo Nacional del Romanticismo The Discrete Channel with Noise: Information Source #7, 2018 by Clare Strand, at Fern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez Centro Cultural de la Villa; 1828 (from the series 1606-1907) 2012 by Sharon Core at Museo Nacional del Romanticismo Six to see William Klein School\u2019s Out, Dakar 1963 (painted 2000), at Espacio Fundaci\u00f3n Telef\u00f3nica A vibrant retrospective of the work of the US photographer William Klein presents his pictures in a display as energetic, innovative and brash as the photographs themselves. Included here are rarely seen early paintings as a student of Fernand L\u00e9ger, uncompromising street photography, iconoclastic fashion work, starkly abstract scientific studies, painted contact sheets and vivid film work.

The duration of the project, the intensity of its focus and the rigour of the fieldwork are evident in the imposing and magisterial works on show. Aerial imagery outlines the development of the Maladeta over time. And ground level pictures, assembled as collages, reveal the scarred surfaces of the glacier. Their presentation suggests tectonic plates perhaps, and the fragmentary nature of Vallhonrat\u2019s subject Tienda negra, 2016 Perfil, 2016 Elina Brotherus At Least One Egg, 2016, at Fern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez Centro Cultural de la Villa Elina Brotherus exhibits a body of work that follows the protocols and strictures of conceptual artists of the 1960s and 70s, especially the Fluxus group.

      "bodyText": "Support for LGBT rights has come from a surprising quarter after Top Gear sprayed two cars used in filming in Brunei in rainbow colours in opposition to the country\u2019s threat to make homosexuality punishable by stoning to death. Thought to be the first time the BBC Two motoring programme has shown solidarity with the LGBT community, the move appears to back the claim made by the new lineup of Freddie Flintoff, Paddy McGuinness and Chris Harris that they would bring a \u201cdifferent vibe\u201d to the revamped show \u2013 which returned on Sunday night. Flintoff told the Guardian he and his colleagues were horrified after hearing the announcement about the imposition of the death penalty by the south-east Asian country just after they filmed a segment there at the end of March. \u201cWe would never have filmed in Brunei had the law been announced beforehand. Like millions of other people around the world, I utterly condemn Brunei\u2019s actions. No one deserves to be stoned to death, whoever they love. Love is love,\u201d said Flintoff. In the segment he and McGuinness drive two rare cars across Borneo with the aid of Gurkha soldiers to the palace of the Sultan of Brunei, a car collector, where guards give them a lukewarm reception. As the Top Gear team landed in the UK after the filming they heard Brunei had just announced it planned to impose death by stoning as a punishment for gay sex and adultery, as part of the country\u2019s implementation of sharia law. Following international outcry led by celebrities including George Clooney and Elton John, last month Brunei\u2019s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah extended a moratorium on the death penalty, saying that it would not be enforced. However, writing in the Guardian, Flintoff said: \u201cEven though it has since been claimed that the laws will not be enforced, the threat still stands, and even the threat is an appalling abuse of human rights.\u201d The Top Gear team considered dropping the segment but, instead, in an unusual move for the show \u2013 which has a history of culturally insensitive jokes under former presenters Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond \u2013 they decided to spray the cars used in the film in the colours of the rainbow flag and display them on air later in the series. \u201cIn the last couple of months we have thought very hard about dropping the film entirely but we shot it before the change in the law, and both the Gurkhas and other Bruneians worked incredibly hard to make it happen. We don\u2019t want all their efforts to be for nothing. So we\u2019ve decided to go ahead and show it [and] we\u2019ve given the cars a little makeover,\u201d explained Flintoff. The message of tolerance contrasts with Amazon\u2019s car show The Grand Tour, presented by Clarkson, May and Hammond, which the singer Will Young criticised in January for its \u201cshaming homophobic narratives\u201d. Top Gear\u2019s new presenting team is aiming to modernise the BBC\u2019s multimillion-pound brand by showing \u201cemotional depth\u201d, with hugs amid the competitive physicality, car reviews and boyish banter. With the third new lineup in as many years \u2013 after Clarkson was sacked for punching a producer \u2013 BBC Studios is gambling that the chemistry of the new trio can halt a ratings decline and get its series back on track. As Harris, who was in the two previous iterations of Top Gear, explained: \u201cWe live in a different world. The new Top Gear will embrace all sorts of emotions.\u201d",

Boeing, he added, had work to do \u201cto re-earn the public\u2019s trust\u201d.</p> <p>Victims\u2019 families are also highly attuned to efforts to shift blame to the pilots for the crash. Last month, the Missouri Republican Sam Graves cited pilot error as a factor in the crash \u2013 which was rejected by Ethiopian Airlines. Boeing\u2019s Muilenburg <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/facing-sharp-questions-boeing-ceo-refuses-to-admit-flaws-in-737-max-design/\">also implicated \u201cforeign\u201d pilots in the crashes </a>and denied flaws in the 737 Max.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t give us confidence,\u201d said Stumo. \u201cYou don\u2019t blame the pilots that the plane overpowered, and you can\u2019t just have the pilots as the last piece of redundancy before a crash.\u201d</p> <p>An Ethiopian Airlines representative said any effort \u201cto divert public attention from the flight control system problem of the airplane is a futile exercise because it is not based on factually correct analysis\u201d.</p> <p>Nader, Milleron\u2019s mother\u2019s brother, has come out against the jet ever returning to service. He says placing larger engines on an airframe designed in the 1960s represents a basic design flaw.</p> <p>The 737 Max \u201cmust never fly again\u201d, Nader <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-04/nader-says-boeing-737-max-is-flawed-and-should-never-fly-again\">said at an aviation safety event in Washington </a>earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of software. It\u2019s a matter of structural design defect: the plane\u2019s engines are too much for the traditional fuselage.\u201d</p> <p>But arguing for permanent grounding risks cutting victims\u2019 families out of the safety process, an outcome Stumo and his wife are reluctant to consider because it could exclude them from the deliberative process of reapproval.</p> <p>Instead, they maintain, instead of being guided by financial interests, Boeing needs to go back to being a premier, safety-at-all-costs, manufacturer.</p> <p>If that requires a change of leadership, so be it, said Stumo. \u201cBoeing needs to come clean. It needs to say: something went wrong with this plane. It grabbed control multiple times and tried to run it into the ground. It overpowered the pilots, and we need to figure out how this will not happen again.\u201d</p>",

Boeing\u2019s Muilenburg also implicated \u201cforeign\u201d pilots in the crashes and denied flaws in the 737 Max. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t give us confidence,\u201d said Stumo. \u201cYou don\u2019t blame the pilots that the plane overpowered, and you can\u2019t just have the pilots as the last piece of redundancy before a crash.\u201d An Ethiopian Airlines representative said any effort \u201cto divert public attention from the flight control system problem of the airplane is a futile exercise because it is not based on factually correct analysis\u201d. Nader, Milleron\u2019s mother\u2019s brother, has come out against the jet ever returning to service. He says placing larger engines on an airframe designed in the 1960s represents a basic design flaw. The 737 Max \u201cmust never fly again\u201d, Nader said at an aviation safety event in Washington earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of software. It\u2019s a matter of structural design defect: the plane\u2019s engines are too much for the traditional fuselage.\u201d But arguing for permanent grounding risks cutting victims\u2019 families out of the safety process, an outcome Stumo and his wife are reluctant to consider because it could exclude them from the deliberative process of reapproval. Instead, they maintain, instead of being guided by financial interests, Boeing needs to go back to being a premier, safety-at-all-costs, manufacturer. If that requires a change of leadership, so be it, said Stumo. \u201cBoeing needs to come clean. It needs to say: something went wrong with this plane. It grabbed control multiple times and tried to run it into the ground. It overpowered the pilots, and we need to figure out how this will not happen again.\u201d",

A particularly alarming example has just been seen in London, where the grandly-named Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/14/kensington-and-chelsea-vetoes-flagship-road-safety-scheme\">in effect pulled the plug on a flagship plan</a> from Transport for London to improve walking and cycling on a particularly feral stretch of west London roads between Notting Hill and Wood Lane.</p> <p>Yes, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s another example from London, but please do bear with me. The events from last week are illustrative of the ways safer, cleaner transport is being undermined in towns and cities, largely through myths.</p> <p>So here\u2019s some selected thoughts and lessons from the ongoing battle. Feel free to add your own below.</p> <h2>Opponents claim to support cycling in principle. Really?</h2> <p>RBKC\u2019s decision to block safer cycling and walking on a route that has seen 275 collisions in three years <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillgateRes/status/1139267359817031682\">came, amid loud applause</a>, at a meeting of opponents on Thursday night. Beforehand the council\u2019s cabinet member for transport reportedly said he was \u201chugely supportive\u201d of cycling, but did not support this particular scheme.</p> <p>This seems deeply peculiar. If he does support cycling, then why not work with TfL on improving the scheme, rather than blocking the entire thing, without warning and before a consultation was finished (more on that later), with no plans for a replacement?</p> <p>There is something of a pattern to this. The wise and indefatigable New York blogger and podcaster Doug Gordon <a href=\"https://brooklynspoke.com/2011/06/14/but-some-of-my-best-friends-are-bike-lanes/\">once compiled a long list of people</a> who insist they simply <em>love </em>cycling, but have a unique, unfixable problem with one particular bike lane, namely the one in their city or neighbourhood. See also: \u201cI\u2019m a cyclist\u201d; \u201cI own a bicycle\u201d.</p> <h2>Many of the arguments against bike lanes are misleading or false</h2> <p>One of the most depressing elements of events in west London has been the spread of the myth that protected bike lanes cause more pollution (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/05/house-of-lords-peers-criticised-for-propagating-bike-lane-myths\">\u00a9 Professor Robert Winston</a>). This has now reached the mainstream, with elected politicians repeating it as fact.</p> <p>It is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jun/16/myth-bike-lanes-congestion-pollution-debunked\">a complex issue</a>, one often reduced to an asinine series of assertions (\u201cless space for motor traffic must equal worse congestion, which must equal more pollution\u201d), one blithely repeated by RBKC.</p> <p>While the TfL modelling does indicate some journeys in one direction of travel could take longer after the work, a series of other factors need to be considered, not least the primary cause of congestion \u2013 too many motor vehicles \u2013 and the aim of eventual modal shift to other means of transport.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s also the fact that when similar routes have already been built in London, actual measured pollutions levels <a href=\"https://aseasyasridingabike.wordpress.com/2017/04/13/polluted-thinking/\">have stubbornly </a><em><a href=\"https://aseasyasridingabike.wordpress.com/2017/04/13/polluted-thinking/\">not</a></em><a href=\"https://aseasyasridingabike.wordpress.com/2017/04/13/polluted-thinking/\"> risen</a>.</p> <p>Opponents also cited worries from shops and companies along the route. Again, these are common with other plans, but invariably ill-founded. For a variety of reasons, cycle infrastructure is almost always good for business.</p> <p>A more easily-comprehensible objection was the fate of up to two dozen trees of various sizes that would have been felled to make way for bike routes. It\u2019s worth remembering that trees can be replanted, and also that the route could have been adjusted to save the trees \u2013 instead of taking more space from cars.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ecddb55defe0aa0fb2219f9311143179f8d63634\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecddb55defe0aa0fb2219f9311143179f8d63634/0_16_2301_1382/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A computer-generated image of the planned layout at Wood Lane.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A computer-generated image of the planned layout at Wood Lane.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Transport for London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Opponents don\u2019t have any plans of their own</h2> <p>Chris Boardman, the saintly walking and cycling guru for Greater Manchester, has an inevitable response to those who oppose schemes for safer, more human-friendly streets: OK, so now what? Without proper cycling infrastructure, how will you ease gridlock, reduce pollution, lower the road casualty toll?</p> <p>In my experience what usually follows is silence or platitudes. In the case of RBKC, I\u2019m afraid, they\u2019re offering both. The council has, as far as I can see, no scheme on the table to improve the main roads on which the ditched scheme was due to run.</p> <p>It does have <a href=\"https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/parking-transport-and-streets/kensington-high-street-notting-hill-cycleway-consultation\">another planned bike scheme</a>, one that was intended to be an addition, not an alternative \u2013 a convoluted quietway-type route via back roads, roughly twice as long, and with few planned safety interventions beyond some speed bumps and tweaks to junctions. It\u2019s not what you\u2019d call ambitious.</p> <h2>\u201cConsultation\u201d too often means vetoes from nimbys</h2> <p>Perhaps the oddest part of the RBKC debacle is the fact that the council said it was acting on behalf of local residents, but blocked the scheme before <a href=\"https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/roads/wood-lane-notting-hill/\">a consultation run by TfL</a> even closed, long before it had any results.</p> <p>I repeatedly asked the council\u2019s press team how they could know the scheme was opposed by residents without a formal method of assessing local views. They were unable to tell me.</p> <p>The council did receive, I was told, 450 emails opposing the scheme \u2013 which amounts to 0.28% of the borough\u2019s population. The press team angrily insisted there had been \u201chundreds\u201d more residents getting in touch via other means. Even if you give a generous final total of 1,000, that\u2019s 0.6% of the population. It\u2019s almost the dictionary definition of nimbyism.</p> <p>Two other things are worth noting on consultations. Firstly, even when they are strongly in favour of new bike schemes, the opponents <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/18/westminster-council-accused-of-playing-politics-over-bike-route\">often do not back down</a>.</p> <p>Secondly, there is a strong argument that safer walking and cycling isn\u2019t something people should have a veto over anyway. To paraphrase the argument of another tireless New York cycling advocate, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/psteely?lang=en\">Paul Steely White</a>, when the Victorians were building London\u2019s sewage system they didn\u2019t endlessly consult on whether separating drinking water and human waste was OK with local people. It saved lives and so it was the right thing to do, so they did it.</p> <h2>Labour are at fault as well</h2> <p>RBKC is a Conservative-run council, and a famously dysfunctional one, as the appalling tragedy of Grenfell Tower showed. But worryingly, both the local Labour MP, Emma Dent-Coad, and her constituency party, not only <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emmadentcoad/status/1127938182908141569\">failed to support</a> the safer walking and cycling scheme, they \u2013 in the case of the party \u2013 openly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KensingtonCLP/status/1139912676480618499\">celebrated its demise</a>.</p> <p>This might seem weird, that a left-leaning party would oppose the most equitable forms of urban transport available and choose instead to favour the needs of drivers. But it shows how far the anti-cycling myths have penetrated.</p> <h2>People die as a direct result of campaigns like these</h2> <p>London\u2019s walking and cycling commissioner, Will Norman, is generally a patient and measured man. But in a furious reaction to what he called a \u201ccynical political stunt\u201d by RBKC he said: \u201cPeople will die and suffer serious injuries as a direct result of this.\u201d</p> <p>This is perfectly possible. Among those who have expressed alarm at the council\u2019s decision is Kate Cairns, whose younger sister, Eilidh, a 30-year-old television producer, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-15354914\">was run over by a lorry</a> in Notting Hill in 2009. Kate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KCairns1/status/1140219373925347328\">has said</a> she is happy to meet local officials to see if there is a way to build the separated cycle lane, which she says would have saved her sister\u2019s life.</p> <p>The stakes could hardly be higher. Having cities still dominated by motor vehicles is heavily contributing to a climate emergency; to deadly pollution and endless noise disproportionately <a href=\"https://twitter.com/peterwalker99/status/1014525777088573440\">caused by richer people</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/06/london-fatal-lung-conditions-more-likely-in-deprived-boroughs\">visited on poorer ones</a>; and daily peril for more vulnerable road users.</p> <p>It\u2019s simply not good enough to say you support walking and cycling in theory, but then block every effort to make it actually happen. People are, and will be, judged by their actions. And they should remember that.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is a world away from the grandiose high-rises that bear his name. A sleepy, crumbling hamlet of fewer than a dozen Israeli residents surrounded by sun-parched fields of crisp hay. Weeds punctuate the cracked asphalt of a basketball court, its rusted hoops leaning at angles. This hinterland settlement in the Golan Heights has become the next recipient of the Trump brand empire. Built on land captured from Syria in a war fought half a century ago, it is some of the most contentious real estate on the planet. Israel\u2019s claim to the strategic volcanic plateau that overlooks Lebanon, Jordan and the Sea of Galilee has been rebuked by the UN and never internationally recognised. For decades, Israeli settlement in the Golan Heights had been globally shunned. That was until Trump heard about it and recognised Israel\u2019s claim with a tweet. To thank his benefactor, Benjamin Netanyahu said he would name a settlement after the US president. On Sunday, the Israeli prime minister and his cabinet convened in the tiny outpost for the inauguration of its new title, emblazoned on a giant billboard: \u201cRamat Trump\u201d \u2013 or Trump Heights. The US president thanked Netanyahu with another tweet: Plans have begun to extend the hamlet of Bruchim, first established in 1991 but almost forgotten until now. Haim Rokach, head of the Israeli Golan regional council, hopes that it will eventually comprise 400 houses, with construction of a first phase of 100 homes set to begin later this year. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s decision to build a new place in the Golan Heights is a revolution.

Israel\u2019s government offered citizenship to the few thousand remaining Syrians, mostly Druze Arabs, but most reject it, opting instead for resident status.

      "body": "<p>In 1998, Peter Andre disappeared. This was at the peak of his early fame, when he couldn\u2019t have appeared more confident in his own skin \u2013 a sun-kissed, six-packed beefcake singing cheesy songs. He had made his name in the UK with the reggae single Mysterious Girl, had two No 1 hits (Flava and I Feel You), and four that reached the Top 10. \u201cThat\u2019s when the panic attacks started,\u201d he says. For six years, no one heard a thing from him. He became so invisible, so swiftly, that radio shows ran Have You Seen Peter Andre? competitions.</p> <p>Now he is a boyish 46 \u2013 black hair and stubble, not an ounce of fat on him, wearing his skinny jeans with conviction. We meet in a London hotel where he is promoting Grease the Musical. Andre is playing the Teen Angel \u2013 his first theatrical performance since he was a 17-year-old in Australia. But he also has a lot to say about reality TV and mental health, two subjects he knows a lot about. It was on I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here that he met the former glamour model Katie Price, they married on their reality show, their children Junior and Princess Tiaamii grew up on reality TV, and he started a new chapter on his own reality show after their divorce. Reality TV allowed him to reinvent himself after a breakdown, gave him a huge profile, considerable wealth and a second chance at celebrity. So when he says reality TV can be dangerous, it\u2019s worth listening.</p> <p>For the best part of two decades he has been on and off medication, in and out of therapy, trying to understand the roots of his mental health problems. Only recently, he says, have the panic attacks stopped. He thinks it all goes back to his early years in Australia.</p> <p>Andre was born in Harrow, north-west London, to Greek-Cypriot parents. When he was six, the family emigrated to Australia \u2013 first Sydney, then the Gold Coast when Andre was nine. That is when the problems started. \u201cWhen I moved to the Gold Coast, we were the only ethnic family I knew. It was all blond-haired, blue-eyed Australians. At school one day they tied me to the fence and took turns throwing stones to see who was going to hit me in the head. I was petrified.\u201d</p> <p>He says it was pointless going to the teachers because they were just as bad. \u201cI remember a teacher saying to me: \u2018Listen here, you greasy wog, if you think you\u2019re going to do well in my class, you\u2019ve got another think coming. You sit in the back corner. I don\u2019t want to see your face.\u2019 That\u2019s how they talked. <em>The teachers!</em>\u201d Years later, he met the teacher again. \u201cI actually gave him a hug. And he said: \u2018Listen mate, I\u2019m so proud of you.\u2019\u201d Didn\u2019t you want to hit him \u2013 or at least remind him? \u201cNo. I had no grudge against him because I knew that\u2019s what it was like back then.\u201dPerhaps it\u2019s not surprising that one of Andre\u2019s favourite films is The Truman Show \u2013 the movie starring Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, a 29-year-old oblivious to the fact that his life is a reality show. Unlike Truman, of course, Andre chose to be a reality star and has cashed in on it. But like Truman, Andre is an innocent in a cynical world \u2013 sweet, trusting and desperately sincere.</p> <p>His teen years were happy. At 16, he appeared on Australia\u2019s New Faces and was offered a contract, live on TV. He had a Top 3 hit, supported Madonna on tour and became a household name in Australia. Then, in his early 20s, he was attacked by a stranger. \u201cThis guy grabbed me in a nightclub in Sydney. He pushed me into the bathroom, pulled out a knife and put it on my neck, and said: \u2018Give me a reason I shouldn\u2019t finish you off.\u2019 He kept picking at me with the knife.\u201d Eventually, he let Andre go. \u201cHe said: \u2018You better watch your every step because when we decide the time\u2019s right, we\u2019re going to finish you.\u2019\u201d Andre says that for every fan, there was somebody who hated him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01dd2597275f6419446289a536064ccf01e701ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01dd2597275f6419446289a536064ccf01e701ae/0_0_2638_3913/674.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Andre in Los Angeles in 1996\" width=\"674\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andre in Los Angeles in 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hogan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He moved to the UK, where he enjoyed his greatest success. But the anxiety never left him. Then, in 1998, the panic attacks began. \u201cI couldn\u2019t breathe. I ended up in hospital, and the panic attacks would come one after another. Years later, after therapy, I realised it all stemmed from that fear of being killed.\u201d He comes to a stop. \u201cI know it sounds dramatic,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Andre told his manager Claire Powell \u2013 who is in the hotel room with us \u2013 that he needed a break. He returned to his parents in Australia, said he was fine but knackered, and stayed in bed for months. Eventually, he headed off to the US, telling his family he was going to make a record. Actually, he was going there to hide. And this time he really did disappear. Not even Powell knew where he was.</p> <p>Finally she came across him one night in a restaurant. \u201cHe came over to the table and it was the most bizarre thing,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d given my life to making him famous in England. Then I\u2019d just not seen him. It was like, oh my God, how has this bloody happened? And he just didn\u2019t seem the same dynamic guy he was.\u201d</p> <p>Powell gradually coaxed him back to work. In 2004, after six years away, he was invited to be on I\u2019m a Celebrity. Powell told him it could be good for him, and it was \u2013 he met Price, and the TV audience loved him. When he emerged from the jungle, Mysterious Girl had been rereleased and was No 1. The whole thing was unbelievable, he says.</p> <p>What strikes me as most unbelievable, I say, is that you chose to return from a massive breakdown by exposing yourself on a reality show. He says things were different back then. He didn\u2019t know anything about reality shows, and there was an innocence to them. \u201cThey said it was a challenge show like Survivor and I thought it may help me overcome my fears.\u201d</p> <p>If you\u2019d just had a breakdown now, would you go straight into reality TV? He shakes his head. \u201cNo.\u201d But he was lucky, he says \u2013 he had good management. He looks at Powell. \u201cWhen I came out I had her, I had my family. If I was left to my own devices I don\u2019t know where I would have gone. Reality really helped me and there\u2019s no way I could say otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>It certainly helped make his relationship with Price. Ultimately, though, does he think it was partially responsible for breaking it? \u201cOh, I won\u2019t talk about this at all.\u201d For a long time he and Price made a fortune from pulling up the blinds on their private life. Now Andre simply says he has promised Junior and Princess that he will not talk about their mother publicly.</p> <p>When he went on I\u2019m a Celebrity, he was still in pieces. He came out a born-again star. But he was still a mess. Four months after leaving the jungle, he released his first album in seven years, The Long Road Back. Powell reminds him of the state he was in when that came out. \u201cWe were at a hotel and you wouldn\u2019t come out of your room because it hadn\u2019t gone into the Top 3. Do you remember?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30805fe41784456b1f8fb68451ba671f7b0f25b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30805fe41784456b1f8fb68451ba671f7b0f25b8/0_0_1179_1488/792.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Andre and Katie Price on I\u2019m a Celebrity in 2004\" width=\"792\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Katie Price on I\u2019m a Celebrity in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cameron Laird/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was going through a really difficult time,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but I remember saying: \u2018Come on!\u2019 I was actually talking to you under the door.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can go a number of ways when this happens,\u201d Andre says. \u201cOne person might turn to the alternate reality \u2013 drugs. My parents were Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, very anti-drugs, I didn\u2019t want to break their hearts. You\u2019ve got the option of doing therapy or doing nothing and just hoping it\u2019s going to sort itself out, or you can top yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Did he ever want to kill himself? \u201cI got to some very dark points where I remember praying to God, please get me through this day, just to get through one more day. That\u2019s how bad it got.\u201d In the end, it was medication and therapy that helped. </p> <p>Last month, Andre appeared to defend Jeremy Kyle after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/may/15/itv-axes-jeremy-kyle-show-after-death-of-participant\" title=\"\">his show was axed</a> following the suspected suicide of a guest. Now he says his comments were misinterpreted. The point he was trying to make was that Kyle was being unfairly singled out. \u201cI thought: what about all these other shows \u2013 Love Island, for example \u2013 where people have died? They were attacking Jeremy Kyle because his name is attached to the show. There has to be a duty of care across the networks. It\u2019s not just one person or one show.\u201d</p> <p>It is only a couple of weeks since a suicide verdict was recorded at the inquest for the former Love Island contestant Mike Thalassitis. Last year another Love Island star, 32-year-old Sophie Gradon, also took her own life. Andre says questions have to be asked about whether such shows are providing adequate support.</p> <p>\u201cLook at a guy like Mike Thalassitis,\u201d he says. \u201cI only met him once or twice, Greek guy, 26 years old, looked in peak condition, good-looking guy, and he went and took his own life because of mental health. Twenty-six years old!\u201d He stops, appalled.</p> <p>He talks about the contestants who spend months dieting for a show, come out and put on weight, and are ripped apart on social media. Then there are those in constant demand until the next season, when they are discarded as reality relics. \u201cYou\u2019re going to fall into some sort of depression if you\u2019ve got one ounce of weakness, which we all have. You\u2019re going to fall.\u201d</p> <p>Was it right or wrong to take Kyle off air? \u201cIt is the most horrific thing that somebody took their own life, we cannot forget that. What I do think is if they are taking that show off, they should be taking a lot of shows off.\u201d</p> <p>What else would you take off? \u201cAny show where there is a reality side. I think they\u2019re all great shows in their own way, but what about the people who have left The Voice or The X Factor who have been devastated because they\u2019ve been told they\u2019re rubbish, and it drives them to drink? You\u2019ve got to go across the board if you\u2019re going to do this. You can\u2019t single out.\u201d What\u2019s the answer? \u201cThey need to look at the whole thing. They need to analyse who\u2019s going on these shows. They should be checked before they go on, they should be talked to after. They should know whether they\u2019re in the right frame of mind to do that sort of thing. How are they going to cope with pressure? They can\u2019t just go, OK, that person looks good. Look at a show like The Undateables. It\u2019s a good show in that it shows that people who are classed as undateable can actually date, but there\u2019s vulnerability there. We need to really care before and after. And I tell you, it\u2019s very easy after to go, right, next!

As with Price, they met in bizarre circumstances. In 2010, Andre had emergency surgery to remove a kidney stone. As a thank you, he gave his surgeon a couple of tickets for one of his shows. The surgeon couldn\u2019t make it, so he passed the tickets on to his student daughter Emily.</p> <p>Now he and Emily have two children \u2013 five-year-old Millie and Theo, two. Andre says Emily is determined the children should lead normal lives. \u201cEmily doesn\u2019t want Theo and Millie in the public eye at all, which I respect because they weren\u2019t born into it. Junior and Princess were born into it.\u201d Do they miss being on television? \u201cYou know, we never really talked about it. I always looked at it when we were filming that we were making fantastic home videos that we\u2019d have for ever. But we still do those videos. We just capture them on our phones now.\u201d</p> <p>So much of his life has been documented, and surprising footage continues to emerge. In March, a scene in Leaving Neverland, the documentary about Michael Jackson and sexual abuse, showed an 11-year-old Andre in the background. He had finished runner-up in a dancing competition where the prize was to meet Michael Jackson. The winner, Wade Robson, alleged Jackson went on to sexually abuse him. Robson was only five years old \u2013 officially you had to be seven to enter the competititon. If he had been disqualified, Andre would have won. Does Andre think: there but for the grace of God? No, he says, he still adores Jackson and does not want to believe he was an abuser. \u201cI\u2019m still thinking: could it have happened? Of course. And if it did, it\u2019s beyond horrific. But what if it didn\u2019t?\u201d Does he still wish \u2026? He answers before the question is out. \u201cYes, I still wish I\u2019d won.\u201d Would you have let your kids go to Neverland? \u201cTo be honest, I wouldn\u2019t let them go anywhere. You can put Michael Jackson out of this equation because I would not leave my seven-year-old child, boy or girl, with anybody unless they were family or I\u2019d known them for years. It\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>He says he is happier now with Emily and his four children than he has ever been in his adult life. But there have been setbacks. In 2012, his brother Andrew died at the age of 54. He hit such a low that he advised Emily to leave him. \u201cI said: \u2018You can either stay and stick with me through this, which personally I wouldn\u2019t, or you can go.\u2019 And she said: \u2018It\u2019s not even a question. We\u2019re going to get through it together.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And they did. Coming out of that trough coincided with the last of his panic attacks. He says he realised he had mistaken grief for another bout of depression, and the realisation that he was simply working his way through his grief liberated him.</p> <p>Now Andre is making up for lost time, career-wise, doing what he would have done a couple of decades ago if his breakdown and reality TV had not intervened. As well as touring the UK with Grease, he recently made his big-screen acting debut in The Inheritance, a short film about a heroin addict for which he received a best actor nomination at the North Hollywood film festival. He tells me, gleefully, how full his diary is. </p> <p>You were supposed to be a here-today, gone-tomorrow pop star, I say \u2013 how come you\u2019re still here? He grins. \u201cI have no bloody idea,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m grateful.\u201d And with that, he is off to Grease rehearsals and to prepare for his third coming.</p> <p><em>Grease the Musical is at Leeds Grand Theatre, 19 June to 20 July, then touring; <a href=\"https://greasethemusicalontour.com\" title=\"\">greasethemusicalontour.com.</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "In 1998, Peter Andre disappeared. This was at the peak of his early fame, when he couldn\u2019t have appeared more confident in his own skin \u2013 a sun-kissed, six-packed beefcake singing cheesy songs. He had made his name in the UK with the reggae single Mysterious Girl, had two No 1 hits (Flava and I Feel You), and four that reached the Top 10. \u201cThat\u2019s when the panic attacks started,\u201d he says. For six years, no one heard a thing from him. He became so invisible, so swiftly, that radio shows ran Have You Seen Peter Andre? competitions. Now he is a boyish 46 \u2013 black hair and stubble, not an ounce of fat on him, wearing his skinny jeans with conviction. We meet in a London hotel where he is promoting Grease the Musical. Andre is playing the Teen Angel \u2013 his first theatrical performance since he was a 17-year-old in Australia. But he also has a lot to say about reality TV and mental health, two subjects he knows a lot about. It was on I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here that he met the former glamour model Katie Price, they married on their reality show, their children Junior and Princess Tiaamii grew up on reality TV, and he started a new chapter on his own reality show after their divorce. Reality TV allowed him to reinvent himself after a breakdown, gave him a huge profile, considerable wealth and a second chance at celebrity. So when he says reality TV can be dangerous, it\u2019s worth listening. For the best part of two decades he has been on and off medication, in and out of therapy, trying to understand the roots of his mental health problems. Only recently, he says, have the panic attacks stopped. He thinks it all goes back to his early years in Australia. Andre was born in Harrow, north-west London, to Greek-Cypriot parents. When he was six, the family emigrated to Australia \u2013 first Sydney, then the Gold Coast when Andre was nine. That is when the problems started. \u201cWhen I moved to the Gold Coast, we were the only ethnic family I knew. It was all blond-haired, blue-eyed Australians. At school one day they tied me to the fence and took turns throwing stones to see who was going to hit me in the head. I was petrified.\u201d He says it was pointless going to the teachers because they were just as bad. \u201cI remember a teacher saying to me: \u2018Listen here, you greasy wog, if you think you\u2019re going to do well in my class, you\u2019ve got another think coming. You sit in the back corner. I don\u2019t want to see your face.\u2019 That\u2019s how they talked. The teachers!\u201d Years later, he met the teacher again. \u201cI actually gave him a hug. And he said: \u2018Listen mate, I\u2019m so proud of you.\u2019\u201d Didn\u2019t you want to hit him \u2013 or at least remind him? \u201cNo. I had no grudge against him because I knew that\u2019s what it was like back then.\u201dPerhaps it\u2019s not surprising that one of Andre\u2019s favourite films is The Truman Show \u2013 the movie starring Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, a 29-year-old oblivious to the fact that his life is a reality show. Unlike Truman, of course, Andre chose to be a reality star and has cashed in on it. But like Truman, Andre is an innocent in a cynical world \u2013 sweet, trusting and desperately sincere. His teen years were happy. At 16, he appeared on Australia\u2019s New Faces and was offered a contract, live on TV. He had a Top 3 hit, supported Madonna on tour and became a household name in Australia. Then, in his early 20s, he was attacked by a stranger. \u201cThis guy grabbed me in a nightclub in Sydney. He pushed me into the bathroom, pulled out a knife and put it on my neck, and said: \u2018Give me a reason I shouldn\u2019t finish you off.\u2019 He kept picking at me with the knife.\u201d Eventually, he let Andre go. \u201cHe said: \u2018You better watch your every step because when we decide the time\u2019s right, we\u2019re going to finish you.\u2019\u201d Andre says that for every fan, there was somebody who hated him. He moved to the UK, where he enjoyed his greatest success. But the anxiety never left him. Then, in 1998, the panic attacks began. \u201cI couldn\u2019t breathe. I ended up in hospital, and the panic attacks would come one after another. Years later, after therapy, I realised it all stemmed from that fear of being killed.\u201d He comes to a stop. \u201cI know it sounds dramatic,\u201d he says. Andre told his manager Claire Powell \u2013 who is in the hotel room with us \u2013 that he needed a break. He returned to his parents in Australia, said he was fine but knackered, and stayed in bed for months. Eventually, he headed off to the US, telling his family he was going to make a record. Actually, he was going there to hide. And this time he really did disappear. Not even Powell knew where he was. Finally she came across him one night in a restaurant. \u201cHe came over to the table and it was the most bizarre thing,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d given my life to making him famous in England. Then I\u2019d just not seen him. It was like, oh my God, how has this bloody happened? And he just didn\u2019t seem the same dynamic guy he was.\u201d Powell gradually coaxed him back to work. In 2004, after six years away, he was invited to be on I\u2019m a Celebrity. Powell told him it could be good for him, and it was \u2013 he met Price, and the TV audience loved him. When he emerged from the jungle, Mysterious Girl had been rereleased and was No 1. The whole thing was unbelievable, he says. What strikes me as most unbelievable, I say, is that you chose to return from a massive breakdown by exposing yourself on a reality show. He says things were different back then. He didn\u2019t know anything about reality shows, and there was an innocence to them. \u201cThey said it was a challenge show like Survivor and I thought it may help me overcome my fears.\u201d If you\u2019d just had a breakdown now, would you go straight into reality TV? He shakes his head. \u201cNo.\u201d But he was lucky, he says \u2013 he had good management. He looks at Powell. \u201cWhen I came out I had her, I had my family. If I was left to my own devices I don\u2019t know where I would have gone. Reality really helped me and there\u2019s no way I could say otherwise.\u201d It certainly helped make his relationship with Price. Ultimately, though, does he think it was partially responsible for breaking it? \u201cOh, I won\u2019t talk about this at all.\u201d For a long time he and Price made a fortune from pulling up the blinds on their private life. Now Andre simply says he has promised Junior and Princess that he will not talk about their mother publicly. When he went on I\u2019m a Celebrity, he was still in pieces. He came out a born-again star. But he was still a mess. Four months after leaving the jungle, he released his first album in seven years, The Long Road Back. Powell reminds him of the state he was in when that came out. \u201cWe were at a hotel and you wouldn\u2019t come out of your room because it hadn\u2019t gone into the Top 3. Do you remember?\u201d \u201cI was going through a really difficult time,\u201d he says. \u201cYeah, but I remember saying: \u2018Come on!\u2019 I was actually talking to you under the door.\u201d \u201cYou can go a number of ways when this happens,\u201d Andre says. \u201cOne person might turn to the alternate reality \u2013 drugs. My parents were Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, very anti-drugs, I didn\u2019t want to break their hearts. You\u2019ve got the option of doing therapy or doing nothing and just hoping it\u2019s going to sort itself out, or you can top yourself.\u201d Did he ever want to kill himself? \u201cI got to some very dark points where I remember praying to God, please get me through this day, just to get through one more day. That\u2019s how bad it got.\u201d In the end, it was medication and therapy that helped. Last month, Andre appeared to defend Jeremy Kyle after his show was axed following the suspected suicide of a guest. Now he says his comments were misinterpreted. The point he was trying to make was that Kyle was being unfairly singled out. \u201cI thought: what about all these other shows \u2013 Love Island, for example \u2013 where people have died? They were attacking Jeremy Kyle because his name is attached to the show. There has to be a duty of care across the networks. It\u2019s not just one person or one show.\u201d It is only a couple of weeks since a suicide verdict was recorded at the inquest for the former Love Island contestant Mike Thalassitis. Last year another Love Island star, 32-year-old Sophie Gradon, also took her own life. Andre says questions have to be asked about whether such shows are providing adequate support. \u201cLook at a guy like Mike Thalassitis,\u201d he says. \u201cI only met him once or twice, Greek guy, 26 years old, looked in peak condition, good-looking guy, and he went and took his own life because of mental health. Twenty-six years old!\u201d He stops, appalled. He talks about the contestants who spend months dieting for a show, come out and put on weight, and are ripped apart on social media. Then there are those in constant demand until the next season, when they are discarded as reality relics. \u201cYou\u2019re going to fall into some sort of depression if you\u2019ve got one ounce of weakness, which we all have. You\u2019re going to fall.\u201d Was it right or wrong to take Kyle off air? \u201cIt is the most horrific thing that somebody took their own life, we cannot forget that. What I do think is if they are taking that show off, they should be taking a lot of shows off.\u201d What else would you take off? \u201cAny show where there is a reality side. I think they\u2019re all great shows in their own way, but what about the people who have left The Voice or The X Factor who have been devastated because they\u2019ve been told they\u2019re rubbish, and it drives them to drink? You\u2019ve got to go across the board if you\u2019re going to do this. You can\u2019t single out.\u201d What\u2019s the answer? \u201cThey need to look at the whole thing. They need to analyse who\u2019s going on these shows. They should be checked before they go on, they should be talked to after. They should know whether they\u2019re in the right frame of mind to do that sort of thing. How are they going to cope with pressure? They can\u2019t just go, OK, that person looks good. Look at a show like The Undateables. It\u2019s a good show in that it shows that people who are classed as undateable can actually date, but there\u2019s vulnerability there. We need to really care before and after. And I tell you, it\u2019s very easy after to go, right, next! Who are we finding next?\u201d Four years ago, Andre got married for the second time, to Emily MacDonagh, a doctor 17 years younger than him. As with Price, they met in bizarre circumstances. In 2010, Andre had emergency surgery to remove a kidney stone. As a thank you, he gave his surgeon a couple of tickets for one of his shows. The surgeon couldn\u2019t make it, so he passed the tickets on to his student daughter Emily. Now he and Emily have two children \u2013 five-year-old Millie and Theo, two. Andre says Emily is determined the children should lead normal lives. \u201cEmily doesn\u2019t want Theo and Millie in the public eye at all, which I respect because they weren\u2019t born into it. Junior and Princess were born into it.\u201d Do they miss being on television? \u201cYou know, we never really talked about it.

Jeremy Hunt said the former foreign secretary could not be relied on to negotiate with Brussels if he wasn\u2019t even prepared to face cross-examination on TV, while Rory Stewart had a dig by saying of the candidates in the studio: \u201cI hope it\u2019s one of us who becomes prime minister.\u201d Ahead of the next round of voting tomorrow, the five men laid out their case for winning the leadership with much focus on how they would repair Britain\u2019s Brexit divisions.

Protesters want a full public apology from Lam for her attempt to force through laws allowing people to be deported to China for trial.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Conservative candidates set out plans to reunite Britain Good morning briefers. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this morning. Boris Johnson may have been missing from last night\u2019s Conservative leadership television debate, but he still managed to dominate proceedings as his five rivals took their chance to attack the frontrunner. Jeremy Hunt said the former foreign secretary could not be relied on to negotiate with Brussels if he wasn\u2019t even prepared to face cross-examination on TV, while Rory Stewart had a dig by saying of the candidates in the studio: \u201cI hope it\u2019s one of us who becomes prime minister.\u201d Ahead of the next round of voting tomorrow, the five men laid out their case for winning the leadership with much focus on how they would repair Britain\u2019s Brexit divisions. But Johnson was boosted after he won the backing of one-time leadership rival, Matt Hancock, on Sunday night. Hunt and Stewart were seen by our political correspondent as having had the best of the debate, but sketch writer John Crace reckons that the empty lectern left for Johnson was the night\u2019s winner. But whoever wins, reckons columnist John Harris, they will inevitably fail unless they first try to fix our broken democracy. * * * Hong Kong tensions \u2013 Hong Kong\u2019s political crisis has entered its second week, with demonstrators demanding that the city\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, stand down over her handling of proposed new extradition laws. An estimated two million people flooded the centre of the city on Sunday in what is believed to be the biggest protest in Hong Kong\u2019s history. Protesters want a full public apology from Lam for her attempt to force through laws allowing people to be deported to China for trial. But many experts see the anti-extradition protests as morphing into a wider challenge to Lam\u2019s pro-Beijing government. Joshua Wong, the prominent activist leader who was released from prison today, stepped up pressure on Lam by calling for her to quit. * * * Wrong path \u2013 Painted cycle lanes are a waste of money and do nothing to make cyclists feel safer on the roads, according to Britain\u2019s cycling and walking commissioners. They say the government has wasted millions of pounds on the schemes and have failed to change people\u2019s travel habits. The commissioners, who include the Olympic champions Chris Boardman and Dame Sarah Storey, are meeting in Manchester today for their first summit and call for an end to car-centric transport planning as well as European-style zebra crossings on side roads to indicate pedestrian priority over cars. * * * Myanmar threat \u2013 The United Nations has threatened to withdraw aid from \u201cclosed\u201d refugee camps in Myanmar\u2019s troubled Rakhine state to avoid complicity in a government \u201cpolicy of apartheid\u201d towards Rohingya Muslims. A letter seen by the Guardian sent from UN resident coordinator Knut Ostby to the country\u2019s rulers relayed a decision by the world body and its humanitarian partners to withhold support \u201cbeyond life-saving assistance\u201d in certain camps, unless changes occur. * * * Heathrow warning \u2013 Psychologists say residents in west London could have their mental health damaged by an increase in the number of planes flying over the area if Heathrow airport is allowed to expand with a third runway. The airport\u2019s owners will tomorrow publish a consultation on its expansion plans, including environmental aspects of building a third runway.

The 1980s and the times we now live in share a certain turbulence, yet the mood of 1989 offers hope that change can, and will, come. \u201cFundamentally the 80s was a very divided, painful decade. The era of Thatcherism, the miners\u2019 strike, nuclear paranoia \u2013 it was a nervy time. Then right at the decade\u2019s end, the mood turned,\u201d says Harris. \u201cCreativity was a reaction to what happened.\u201d</p> <p>As the mood turned, so did the music. The clubs were quickly becoming filled with garish, psychedelic patterns and the city began to move to an electronic beat.

      "bodyText": "Looking back at 1989, Guardian columnist John Harris remembers the spirit of the era: \u201cEverything was changing, in a good way \u2013 the fall of the Berlin wall, the end of the Soviet bloc. It felt like a heady, celebratory time.\u201d At the time, Manchester seemed to be the epicentre of the change. The city was making headlines, local bands were the toast of the music industry, and, as Harris recalls, \u201cthe Ha\u00e7ienda really was the greatest night of your life\u201d. As part of Manchester international festival 2019\u2019s Interdependence line-up, the Guardian is hosting a session exploring the meaning and manifestation of modern revolution, rooted in the unrest and joy of 1989. The 1980s and the times we now live in share a certain turbulence, yet the mood of 1989 offers hope that change can, and will, come. \u201cFundamentally the 80s was a very divided, painful decade. The era of Thatcherism, the miners\u2019 strike, nuclear paranoia \u2013 it was a nervy time. Then right at the decade\u2019s end, the mood turned,\u201d says Harris. \u201cCreativity was a reaction to what happened.\u201d As the mood turned, so did the music. The clubs were quickly becoming filled with garish, psychedelic patterns and the city began to move to an electronic beat. From A Guy Called Gerald to Happy Mondays, Manchester had a new rhythm, and rave was at its heart. Rave is a recurring theme across MIF19, with Skepta\u2019s Dystopia987 inspired by Manchester\u2019s acid house-drenched, late-80s rave scene. \u201cA rave is a place to open your mind,\u201d said the Mercury prize-winning artist, speaking at the festival\u2019s launch. \u201cRave is a place for love \u2026 I feel like clubs in general have turned into places for this new individualism where people are just on their phones to have a \u2018fake good time\u2019, so we\u2019re taking people\u2019s phones away from them.\u201d Insta-individualism may have replaced the community spirit, but Skepta hopes his show can rekindle some of the togetherness: \u201cGoing to a rave was all about love and being together with people. We\u2019re going to bring people together to make a good, good atmosphere.\u201d While Dystopia987\u2019s name hints at a grim vision of the future, it\u2019s the light at the end of the tunnel that most interests Skepta. \u201cI\u2019m talking about getting to utopia,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we have to destroy to rebuild. We have to go down to make things better. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say too much about it, but we\u2019ve brought lots of different people together: creative technology experts, writers and a great team to make a world. So, it won\u2019t just be about rave it will be what I believe rave will be for in the future, why people will come to the rave.\u201d Skepta\u2019s show will infuse the 21st century with the spirit of rave. Similarly, Dave Haslam, an author and former DJ at the Ha\u00e7ienda, is inspired by the lasting impact of that burst of late-80s creativity: \u201cArtistic activity defines the soul of a city in a way blocks of apartments and shiny retail piazzas don\u2019t. I\u2019m proud of the way the Manchester dancefloors drew in people of many different backgrounds. That was part of the spirit of the times \u2013 the inclusivity.

      "body": "<p>In 1997, Radiohead imagined a future in which technological dependency and out-of-control consumerism had merged to form a dark, digital void. OK Computer, the band\u2019s third album, painted prescient pictures of riot police at political rallies and anxious lives lived in suburbs surrounded by endless motorways. The digital advances promising to bring us together, it seemed to warn, would instead corrode and cause chaos.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s big Radiohead news wouldn\u2019t have sounded out of place on that album\u2019s technosceptic vision of tomorrow. The band had been hacked, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/11/radiohead-release-hours-of-hacked-songs-to-benefit-extinction-rebellion\">guitarist Jonny Greenwood revealed on</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/11/radiohead-release-hours-of-hacked-songs-to-benefit-extinction-rebellion\"> Tuesday</a>, and 18 hours of unreleased music from their OK Computer sessions stolen. Pay $150,000, they were warned, or this archive would be uploaded to the internet for free. The only thing more frustrating to frontman Thom Yorke than the situation, fans joked, was the fact he hadn\u2019t thought to mention sinister cybercriminals holding people to ransom on OK Computer in the first place.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We paid for beats. We paid for travel, for food. It\u2019s too depressing to think about</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The group responded to the threats with a shrug. \u201cInstead of complaining \u2013 much \u2013 or ignoring it,\u201d Greenwood wrote on social media, \u201cwe\u2019re releasing all 18 hours <a href=\"https://radiohead.bandcamp.com/\">on Bandcamp</a> in aid of Extinction Rebellion.\u201d Minutes later, a waking day\u2019s worth of untitled, unedited offcuts and demos appeared on the streaming service for fans to sift through. The move was heralded as a victory for artists and a middle finger to pirates, who for two decades have derailed album release campaigns by uploading illegally obtained music, often months in advance.</p> <p>A lot has been written about the financial cost of leaks since the advent of sites such as Napster. <a href=\"https://www.ipi.org/ipi_issues/detail/the-true-cost-of-sound-recording-piracy-to-the-us-economy\">One report</a> by the Institute for Policy Innovation, an American thinktank, estimated that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/09/more-than-one-third-global-music-consumers-pirate-music\">internet users</a> have downloaded $12.5bn worth of pirated music every year since 1999. Less has been made of the emotional trauma of the artists who\u2019ve seen music, often unfinished, stolen from their private vaults and uploaded without consent.</p> <p>This month, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/magazine/madonna-madame-x.html\">Madonna </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/magazine/madonna-madame-x.html\">said she \u201cfelt raped\u201d</a> after her 2015 album Rebel Heart leaked online before she\u2019d even announced it. \u201cThere are no words to describe how devastated I was,\u201d she told the New York Times.

      "bodyText": "In 1997, Radiohead imagined a future in which technological dependency and out-of-control consumerism had merged to form a dark, digital void. OK Computer, the band\u2019s third album, painted prescient pictures of riot police at political rallies and anxious lives lived in suburbs surrounded by endless motorways. The digital advances promising to bring us together, it seemed to warn, would instead corrode and cause chaos. Last week\u2019s big Radiohead news wouldn\u2019t have sounded out of place on that album\u2019s technosceptic vision of tomorrow. The band had been hacked, guitarist Jonny Greenwood revealed on Tuesday, and 18 hours of unreleased music from their OK Computer sessions stolen. Pay $150,000, they were warned, or this archive would be uploaded to the internet for free. The only thing more frustrating to frontman Thom Yorke than the situation, fans joked, was the fact he hadn\u2019t thought to mention sinister cybercriminals holding people to ransom on OK Computer in the first place. The group responded to the threats with a shrug. \u201cInstead of complaining \u2013 much \u2013 or ignoring it,\u201d Greenwood wrote on social media, \u201cwe\u2019re releasing all 18 hours on Bandcamp in aid of Extinction Rebellion.\u201d Minutes later, a waking day\u2019s worth of untitled, unedited offcuts and demos appeared on the streaming service for fans to sift through. The move was heralded as a victory for artists and a middle finger to pirates, who for two decades have derailed album release campaigns by uploading illegally obtained music, often months in advance. A lot has been written about the financial cost of leaks since the advent of sites such as Napster. One report by the Institute for Policy Innovation, an American thinktank, estimated that internet users have downloaded $12.5bn worth of pirated music every year since 1999. Less has been made of the emotional trauma of the artists who\u2019ve seen music, often unfinished, stolen from their private vaults and uploaded without consent. This month, Madonna said she \u201cfelt raped\u201d after her 2015 album Rebel Heart leaked online before she\u2019d even announced it. \u201cThere are no words to describe how devastated I was,\u201d she told the New York Times. Jai Paul, the influential R&amp;B star in the making, was similarly distressed after his debut album was hacked and posted in full online, and he disappeared from public view for six years. Returning with his first music since 2013 this month, he told of how he suffered a \u201cbreakdown of sorts\u201d and \u201cwithdrew from life\u201d, consumed by trauma and grief. \u201cNo one else seemed to view the situation in the same way I did: as a catastrophe,\u201d he wrote in an open letter. \u201cThe hardest thing to grasp was that I\u2019d been denied the opportunity to finish my work and share it in its best possible form \u2026 having [my] dream torn up in front of me hit me pretty hard.\u201d Not everyone, in other words, is able to react with the nonchalance of Radiohead. Mutya Buena says she knows exactly where Jai Paul is coming from. The former Sugababes singer and member of cult pop group MKS was at home for Christmas in 2016 when a demo version of a comeback album surfaced online. \u201cFans started messaging me links to the leak.

      "body": "<p>Hundreds of people packed into the nondescript meeting room in southern Washington state to share the stories of Native American women who vanished years or even decades ago.</p> <p>Many of those who gathered together last October still do not have answers as to what happened to their mothers, aunts, sisters, daughters. Some said they felt failed by authorities; they had been made to wait days by police to report a loved one\u2019s disappearance or had their pleas for help ignored altogether.</p> <p>At this meeting, and nine others just like it across the state, Captain Monica Alexander, of Washington state patrol, the state\u2019s police agency, sat in the front of the room listening and taking notes. She had been tasked by the state legislature to examine the alarming number of deaths and disappearances of Native American women \u2013 for too long brushed aside.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/30/missing-native-american-women-alyssa-mclemore\">'Sister, where did you go?': the Native American women disappearing from US cities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI go home with such a heavy heart after these meetings because I think about if my sister was missing and no one ever found her, no one ever knew what happened to her and no one seemed to care,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a horrible feeling.\u201d</p> <p>This month, Alexander released a report summarizing what was said in these meetings and highlighting some of the especially strong patterns she discovered. Too often, authorities had misidentified the ethnicity of these women and possibly underestimated the potential role sex trafficking could play in these disappearances.</p> <p>Alexander stressed the need for both more coordination between tribal, state, local and federal law enforcement agencies as well as a centralized database that can accurately track this crisis.</p> <p>Her report included findings from the National Crime Information Center, an FBI crime data clearinghouse, which reported 56 currently missing American Indian and Alaska Native women in Washington. Despite Native Americans making up only 2% of the state\u2019s population, they account for 7% of all disappearances.</p> <p>She also included data from the southern Washington Yakama Nation tribe, which reported 24 unsolved or cold cases related to missing or murdered men and women. But since none of the other 28 federally recognized tribes in the state submitted data for the report and the FBI\u2019s numbers probably did not include all tribal cases, some have called these numbers a vast underestimate.</p> <p>\u201cThis is quite disturbing to me as we know there are so many more cases of missing and murdered indigenous women,\u201d said Carol Evans, chairwoman for the Spokane Tribe of Indians, a 3,000-member tribe in north-eastern Washington.</p> <p>The report is a step towards addressing an extremely complex problem. At a time when Native American<em> </em>women and girls disappear at twice the per-capita rate of white Americans, lawmakers have finally begun to answer the many cries for help in an effort to address the issue and help to put a stop to them.</p> <p>A bipartisan team of US lawmakers recently reintroduced Savanna\u2019s Act, a bill dedicated to Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, a Native American woman who was killed in 2017 in North Dakota. The legislation would require the Department of Justice to develop guidelines for how to respond to cases of missing and murdered Native Americans. It would also call on the attorney general to include statistics on missing Native Americans, including their age, gender and tribal affiliation, in an annual report to Congress.</p> <p>A handful of states also recently approved proposals similar to the one in Washington. For example, in Oregon the department of state police was asked to examine how they could boost resources for investigating missing and murdered Native American and Alaskan women, and present their findings to the legislative assembly next fall.</p> <p>Washington has been hit especially hard by these disappearances and deaths. In a report released last year by the Urban Indian Health Institute, the state had the second highest number of cases of missing and murdered women and girls in the country.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the state\u2019s lawmakers passed new legislation to address this issue. It calls on officials to create two liaison positions within the Washington state patrol, whose job will be to build a relationship between governmental agencies and Native communities. It also requires the state patrol to develop a protocol for law enforcement\u2019s response to missing indigenous persons.</p> <p>The legislation is meant to build on the work completed by Alexander. But state officials and tribal leaders have been keen to caution that the research, meetings and the report were in no way perfect.</p> <p>There were questions about whether state officials adequately spread the word about the meetings, and why there were only 10 meetings for the dozens of tribes spread out across the state. Questions were also raised about why Alexander, who is not Native American, was hosting the meetings.</p> <p>Gina Mosbrucker, a Republican representative in Washington who sponsored last year\u2019s legislation, said it would have helped to increase trust by adding someone to the meeting leadership team who was connected with the tribes and completely separate from the government.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re asking [tribal members] to give the government \u2013 that they don\u2019t trust because of intergenerational trauma and the treaty of 1855 and not following through on everything we said we would do \u2013 we\u2019re asking them to share information, data, which is their family members and their daughters and sisters,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But James Rideout, a member of the Puyallup Tribal Council, the elected governing body for the Puyallup Tribe of Indians in western Washington, said he thought the meetings helped to showcase the importance of an issue that has had a noticeable impact on his tribe.</p> <p>\u201cIt empowers our communities and our leaders and our law enforcement and all of our agencies to work together,\u201d said Rideout. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to sit back and accept these things any more, we\u2019re actually going to do something about it.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of people packed into the nondescript meeting room in southern Washington state to share the stories of Native American women who vanished years or even decades ago. Many of those who gathered together last October still do not have answers as to what happened to their mothers, aunts, sisters, daughters. Some said they felt failed by authorities; they had been made to wait days by police to report a loved one\u2019s disappearance or had their pleas for help ignored altogether. At this meeting, and nine others just like it across the state, Captain Monica Alexander, of Washington state patrol, the state\u2019s police agency, sat in the front of the room listening and taking notes. She had been tasked by the state legislature to examine the alarming number of deaths and disappearances of Native American women \u2013 for too long brushed aside. \u201cI go home with such a heavy heart after these meetings because I think about if my sister was missing and no one ever found her, no one ever knew what happened to her and no one seemed to care,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a horrible feeling.\u201d This month, Alexander released a report summarizing what was said in these meetings and highlighting some of the especially strong patterns she discovered. Too often, authorities had misidentified the ethnicity of these women and possibly underestimated the potential role sex trafficking could play in these disappearances. Alexander stressed the need for both more coordination between tribal, state, local and federal law enforcement agencies as well as a centralized database that can accurately track this crisis. Her report included findings from the National Crime Information Center, an FBI crime data clearinghouse, which reported 56 currently missing American Indian and Alaska Native women in Washington. Despite Native Americans making up only 2% of the state\u2019s population, they account for 7% of all disappearances. She also included data from the southern Washington Yakama Nation tribe, which reported 24 unsolved or cold cases related to missing or murdered men and women. But since none of the other 28 federally recognized tribes in the state submitted data for the report and the FBI\u2019s numbers probably did not include all tribal cases, some have called these numbers a vast underestimate. \u201cThis is quite disturbing to me as we know there are so many more cases of missing and murdered indigenous women,\u201d said Carol Evans, chairwoman for the Spokane Tribe of Indians, a 3,000-member tribe in north-eastern Washington. The report is a step towards addressing an extremely complex problem. At a time when Native American women and girls disappear at twice the per-capita rate of white Americans, lawmakers have finally begun to answer the many cries for help in an effort to address the issue and help to put a stop to them. A bipartisan team of US lawmakers recently reintroduced Savanna\u2019s Act, a bill dedicated to Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, a Native American woman who was killed in 2017 in North Dakota. The legislation would require the Department of Justice to develop guidelines for how to respond to cases of missing and murdered Native Americans. It would also call on the attorney general to include statistics on missing Native Americans, including their age, gender and tribal affiliation, in an annual report to Congress. A handful of states also recently approved proposals similar to the one in Washington. For example, in Oregon the department of state police was asked to examine how they could boost resources for investigating missing and murdered Native American and Alaskan women, and present their findings to the legislative assembly next fall. Washington has been hit especially hard by these disappearances and deaths. In a report released last year by the Urban Indian Health Institute, the state had the second highest number of cases of missing and murdered women and girls in the country. Earlier this year, the state\u2019s lawmakers passed new legislation to address this issue. It calls on officials to create two liaison positions within the Washington state patrol, whose job will be to build a relationship between governmental agencies and Native communities. It also requires the state patrol to develop a protocol for law enforcement\u2019s response to missing indigenous persons. The legislation is meant to build on the work completed by Alexander. But state officials and tribal leaders have been keen to caution that the research, meetings and the report were in no way perfect. There were questions about whether state officials adequately spread the word about the meetings, and why there were only 10 meetings for the dozens of tribes spread out across the state. Questions were also raised about why Alexander, who is not Native American, was hosting the meetings. Gina Mosbrucker, a Republican representative in Washington who sponsored last year\u2019s legislation, said it would have helped to increase trust by adding someone to the meeting leadership team who was connected with the tribes and completely separate from the government. \u201cWe\u2019re asking [tribal members] to give the government \u2013 that they don\u2019t trust because of intergenerational trauma and the treaty of 1855 and not following through on everything we said we would do \u2013 we\u2019re asking them to share information, data, which is their family members and their daughters and sisters,\u201d she said. But James Rideout, a member of the Puyallup Tribal Council, the elected governing body for the Puyallup Tribe of Indians in western Washington, said he thought the meetings helped to showcase the importance of an issue that has had a noticeable impact on his tribe. \u201cIt empowers our communities and our leaders and our law enforcement and all of our agencies to work together,\u201d said Rideout. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to sit back and accept these things any more, we\u2019re actually going to do something about it.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Presented with Brexit, a political system apparently breaking apart and the central importance of online networks to just about everything, it is tempting to ignore the past and focus on what seems to be a very modern picture. It is always difficult to zoom out from the daily hurly-burly and understand the true nature of a crisis. But what is happening actually reflects a rule that dates back many centuries: that if an economic slump and its aftermath combine with deep social and economic disruption, people will usually start to loudly question the way they are governed \u2013 chiefly because insecurity and uncertainty always focus our minds on questions of control.</p> <p>Of late, when not asking members of the public about their views on the Brexit mess, I have been rereading Christopher Hill\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/28/archives/the-world-turned-upside-down-radical-ideas-during-the-english.html\" title=\"\">The World Turned Upside Down</a>, a masterful history of the ideas and movements that cohered around the time of the English civil war. For all that it describes an exotic world of Diggers, Ranters and Familists, its story has loud echoes now: the 30 years from 1620 to 1650 described \u201cas economically among the most terrible in English history\u201d, with the aftershocks of the Reformation and the first stirrings of the transition from agrarian feudalism to capitalism combining to drastically undermine England\u2019s systems of power.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/13/mini-trump-across-the-channel-european-media-on-boris-johnson-as-british-pm\">'Mini-Trump across the Channel': EU media on Boris Johnson as British PM</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not that long ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/29/peterloo-britain-kings-queens-mike-leigh-massacre\" title=\"\">I was immersed</a> in the era of the Peterloo massacre and early 19th-century radicalism, when the depression that followed the Napoleonic wars, accelerated industrialisation and the rapid growth of cities caused no end of social unrest, and began the long march to universal suffrage. Two centuries on, the politics of 2019, in the UK and elsewhere, are following a comparable plotline to both those eras: a decade on from the crash of 2008, huge social and economic disruption are once again changing our sense of who we are and what we want \u2013 our work, whether we rejoice in globalisation or fear it, and our dwindling levels of faith in government. The result is rising unease and outrage about broken systems of power, and established political organisations and institutions that are ceasing to function in any credible way.</p> <p>A 19th-century Chartist would instantly understand one of the most blatant examples: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/04/tory-leadership-candidates-likely-to-need-eight-backers\" title=\"\">next prime minister being selected by 160,000</a> of the most unrepresentative people imaginable. Given the opportunity to meaningfully choose between an array of political parties, millions of us now jump at the chance \u2013 but our collapsing voting system still privileges two parties whose joint proportion <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/no-longer-just-big-party-dominance\" title=\"\">of the popular vote peaked back in 1951</a>. Not surprisingly, as most of us spurn any idea of loyally identifying with either the reds or blues, this iniquity feeds into the disaffection that is continuing to push Britain towards a seven-party system (Labour, Tories, Liberal Democrats, Greens, the Brexit party, the SNP and Plaid Cymru), only held in check by the miserable method by which we choose MPs.</p> <p>Such is the British manifestation of a turbulence breaking out across the democratic world. Its arrival here preceded the 2016 referendum, but throwing a binary question into the midst of a body politic that was already brimming with resentment and disconnection was always going to make those things even more uncontrollable. And here we are. Against a backdrop of seemingly endless change, the fact that the online world offers people at least the sensation of voice and influence is cohering into rising hostility towards the very basics of representative democracy. Feeling the resultant panic, the mainstream of the Conservative party \u2013 the Conservative party! \u2013 has now found room for the belief that if parliament proves troublesome, it should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/13/suspending-parliament-break-brexit-deadlock-stretch-constitution\" title=\"\">simply be suspended</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The urge to get Brexit 'sorted' and the machinations of our newly assertive parliament verge on the antithetical</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Which brings us to another book: David Runciman\u2019s recently published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/20/how-democracy-ends-david-runciman-review-trump\" title=\"\">How Democracy Ends</a>, which is actually a more nuanced read than its title suggests. \u201cRepresentative democracy was intended to work against our cognitive biases, dimly though these might have been understood at the time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt puts barriers in the way of immediate gratification and slows down decision-making \u2026 That\u2019s what makes representative democracy so frustrating. It is rarely gratifying. It is not meant to be.\u201d</p> <p>The question of our age, it seems to me, is whether this noble, pragmatic ideal can hold, in the face not only of how technology affects our collective thinking, but also the associated fact that so many of us now feel a deep urgency about so many different things. The urge to get Brexit \u201csorted\u201d and the machinations of our newly assertive parliament verge on the antithetical. Similarly, if you are alarmed by the climate emergency, or the toxic effects of inequality, the slow pace and eternal compromises of traditional decision-making may not be to your taste.</p> <p>The same impatience, in fact, now runs through just about all the insurgent elements of our new politics.

      "bodyText": "Presented with Brexit, a political system apparently breaking apart and the central importance of online networks to just about everything, it is tempting to ignore the past and focus on what seems to be a very modern picture. It is always difficult to zoom out from the daily hurly-burly and understand the true nature of a crisis. But what is happening actually reflects a rule that dates back many centuries: that if an economic slump and its aftermath combine with deep social and economic disruption, people will usually start to loudly question the way they are governed \u2013 chiefly because insecurity and uncertainty always focus our minds on questions of control. Of late, when not asking members of the public about their views on the Brexit mess, I have been rereading Christopher Hill\u2019s The World Turned Upside Down, a masterful history of the ideas and movements that cohered around the time of the English civil war. For all that it describes an exotic world of Diggers, Ranters and Familists, its story has loud echoes now: the 30 years from 1620 to 1650 described \u201cas economically among the most terrible in English history\u201d, with the aftershocks of the Reformation and the first stirrings of the transition from agrarian feudalism to capitalism combining to drastically undermine England\u2019s systems of power. Not that long ago, I was immersed in the era of the Peterloo massacre and early 19th-century radicalism, when the depression that followed the Napoleonic wars, accelerated industrialisation and the rapid growth of cities caused no end of social unrest, and began the long march to universal suffrage. Two centuries on, the politics of 2019, in the UK and elsewhere, are following a comparable plotline to both those eras: a decade on from the crash of 2008, huge social and economic disruption are once again changing our sense of who we are and what we want \u2013 our work, whether we rejoice in globalisation or fear it, and our dwindling levels of faith in government. The result is rising unease and outrage about broken systems of power, and established political organisations and institutions that are ceasing to function in any credible way. A 19th-century Chartist would instantly understand one of the most blatant examples: the next prime minister being selected by 160,000 of the most unrepresentative people imaginable. Given the opportunity to meaningfully choose between an array of political parties, millions of us now jump at the chance \u2013 but our collapsing voting system still privileges two parties whose joint proportion of the popular vote peaked back in 1951. Not surprisingly, as most of us spurn any idea of loyally identifying with either the reds or blues, this iniquity feeds into the disaffection that is continuing to push Britain towards a seven-party system (Labour, Tories, Liberal Democrats, Greens, the Brexit party, the SNP and Plaid Cymru), only held in check by the miserable method by which we choose MPs. Such is the British manifestation of a turbulence breaking out across the democratic world. Its arrival here preceded the 2016 referendum, but throwing a binary question into the midst of a body politic that was already brimming with resentment and disconnection was always going to make those things even more uncontrollable. And here we are. Against a backdrop of seemingly endless change, the fact that the online world offers people at least the sensation of voice and influence is cohering into rising hostility towards the very basics of representative democracy. Feeling the resultant panic, the mainstream of the Conservative party \u2013 the Conservative party! \u2013 has now found room for the belief that if parliament proves troublesome, it should simply be suspended. Which brings us to another book: David Runciman\u2019s recently published How Democracy Ends, which is actually a more nuanced read than its title suggests. \u201cRepresentative democracy was intended to work against our cognitive biases, dimly though these might have been understood at the time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt puts barriers in the way of immediate gratification and slows down decision-making \u2026 That\u2019s what makes representative democracy so frustrating. It is rarely gratifying. It is not meant to be.\u201d The question of our age, it seems to me, is whether this noble, pragmatic ideal can hold, in the face not only of how technology affects our collective thinking, but also the associated fact that so many of us now feel a deep urgency about so many different things. The urge to get Brexit \u201csorted\u201d and the machinations of our newly assertive parliament verge on the antithetical. Similarly, if you are alarmed by the climate emergency, or the toxic effects of inequality, the slow pace and eternal compromises of traditional decision-making may not be to your taste. The same impatience, in fact, now runs through just about all the insurgent elements of our new politics. The Brexit party has clearly been a magnet for people full of the usual prejudices and bigotries, but go to their rallies and ask people why they have come, and you will hear a lot of loud complaints about the urgent need for systemic change. Platform speakers explicitly reject representative democracy, and Nigel Farage trashes MPs, the House of Lords and the civil service, while working behind the scenes on pushing for electoral reform \u2013 and/or a system of party supporters voting for policies online, taken from the Italian Five Star movement, whose logic Farage would like to apply to the our entire system of government. Comparable things sit at the heart of Corbynism: its endless claims of a \u201crigged system\u201d and the promise of activists setting policy and deselecting MPs, rooted in an agenda that first surfaced in Labour in the far-off 1980s, but is now ideally suited to the digital age (something which, when it comes to Brexit, is creating difficulties for Corbyn and his advisers, people now hoist with their own democratic petard). It may be ludicrously optimistic to suppose that the basics of representative democracy can survive the current assault, but if we are not going to head towards the kind of dystopia that now haunts not just politics but popular culture (for the details, see Russell T Davies\u2019s excellent BBC1 series Years and Years ), great alteration is imperative. As my colleague George Monbiot wrote last week, governments are going to have to embrace such innovations as citizens\u2019 assemblies and participatory budgeting. The case for pushing control of health, education, transport and all the rest down to the most local possible level now feels both urgent and unanswerable. In this country, we will soon have to wave goodbye to insisting that whenever a general election comes round, a population now well used to choosing from a wide array of parties should choose from a shortlist of two, or effectively throw their vote away. Anyone who aspires to power needs to understand these realities, or succumb to the fate that will meet whichever candidate for prime minister emerges from the Conservatives\u2019 current farcical ritual \u2013 including the bundle of opportunism, vanity and nastiness who is the odds-on favourite, and has been trying to channel the chaotic public mood to his advantage for the last three years. The inevitable awaits Boris Johnson as surely it once awaited absolutist monarchs and the representatives of rotten boroughs. He will triumphantly strut around for a week or two, before standing revealed as one more hapless pretender, tossed into a ferment he will have no hope of controlling. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Why are we so fixated on economic growth?</strong></h2> <p>Since the mid-20th century, economic growth has taken on a dominant position in the way practically every country arranges its affairs and priorities.</p> <p>Growth has become shorthand for increasing living standards. It often means more people in work and more companies in business. Its opposite, recession, normally means bankruptcies and redundancies.</p> <p>And so growth has become a holy grail for governments seeking re-election.</p> <p>But some people have benefited more from growth than others, despite global gross domestic product (GDP) growing by more than 5,000% since the 1960s. Inequality has boomed in advanced economies since the 1970s, while the mounting risk of catastrophic global warming raises serious questions about the links between growth and carbon emissions.</p> <p>Yet our economies have become structurally dependent on growth. Finance ministries and central banks pursue economic expansion as the primary goal, with rising GDP providing higher taxes. </p> <p>Growth as a metaphor for prosperity has become deeply embedded through language. We like to see our children grow, or our gardens. Growth as a fundamentally human movement is life and progress. But there is another end of the metaphor: that growth can be cancerous.</p> <h2><strong>So what is GDP?</strong></h2> <p>If the concept of economic growth has become central, then the yardstick of success is a three letter acronym: GDP.</p> <p>GDP measures the extent of economic activity. UK GDP was about \u00a32tn last year, placing Britain among the largest economies on earth. It can also be calculated per head, at \u00a330,594 in the UK.</p> <p>The US has the largest economy in the world, worth almost $19.5tn, followed by China, at $12.2tn. The entire world economy is worth roughly $80tn a year \u2013 about $10,500 for every man, woman and child on the planet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2019-06-03T14:02:40/embed.html\" data-alt=\"chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2019-06-03T14:02:40/embed.html\">chart</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>How do you measure it?</strong></h2> <p>In order to measure GDP, statisticians use three approaches: measuring the total value of goods and services produced; the total amount spent in the economy, and the total amount of income from profits and wages. All three methods should, in theory, give the same number.</p> <p>If GDP has increased over a period of time, the economy is growing. If it contracts for two consecutive quarters, the economy is in recession.</p> <p>Despite the apparently scientific approach, the calculation of GDP relies on several assumptions and misses out huge swathes of the economy and wider society that cannot be quantified in monetary terms. Bobby Kennedy once famously said in a speech of GDP: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/may/24/robert-kennedy-gdp\" title=\"\">It measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile</a>.\u201d</p> <p>GDP includes rough estimates for the value of drugs and prostitution, yet fails to take account of unpaid work in the home. In a sign of the scale of what is missing, in 2016, the value of the UK\u2019s unpaid household service work was estimated at \u00a31.24tn, more than the entire non-financial sector.</p> <p>On paper, charities account for only \u00a327bn of the British economy, but Andy Haldane, the chief economist at the Bank of England, reckons this figure could be increased to \u00a3234bn a year if the value of volunteering and the benefits it brings were adequately accounted for.</p> <p>Environmental degradation is not included in GDP. After the Exxon Valdez disaster in 1989, the oil spill showed up as a net economic gain because the money spent on the clean-up effort boosted US GDP \u2013 despite the damage to Alaska\u2019s waters.</p> <p>The measure takes no account of leisure time, meaning that two countries might have equal GDP but one has workers toiling for 12 hour days and the other only eight. Large amounts of output captured by GDP are also wasteful, such as the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of food wasted in Britain each year, or the Christmas jumpers bought for one night, only to degrade in landfill for centuries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/briefing-boxes/GDP1/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Box 1\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/briefing-boxes/GDP1/embed.html\">Box 1</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>Sounds a bit outmoded for the 21st century</strong></h2> <p>Many economists would agree, arguing that GDP is incapable of connecting the economy with social and environmental outcomes that determine our wellbeing and the sustainability of the planet. Should we wish to move away from measuring our success on monetary terms alone, GDP would be inadequate.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have forgotten that it isn\u2019t a real thing, it\u2019s a construct and a lot of judgments went into how it was put together,\u201d says Diane Coyle, an economist at the University of Cambridge who has written books about the failings of GDP and sustainable growth. \u201cThere are lots of things we just don\u2019t have a handle on now. I don\u2019t think the conceptual framework that we have fits the modern economy at all.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Can we safely grow our economies for ever?</strong></h2> <p>Whether our economies can continue to grow forever is open to debate, with the continual rise of living standards, for growing numbers of people, dependent on a multitude of factors.</p> <p>There are three main schools of thought. First, that growth by any means can be justified if it improves the lives of the broadest number of people possible. Second, that growth is OK but it needs to be \u201cdecoupled\u201d from carbon to prevent climate catastrophe. Third, that growth by definition is impossible to sustain for ever given our planetary confines, and therefore that the only solution is \u201cdegrowth\u201d \u2013 a sort of \u2018less-is-more\u2019 credo that emphasises sustainability, solidarity and deceleration.</p> <p>The first is increasingly being challenged, though outright rejection of growth poses problems for the developing world. Almost half of the world\u2019s population \u2013 3.4 billion people \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/05/conflicts-and-poverty-drive-big-jump-in-global-migration-finds-report\" title=\"\">live on less than $5.50 (\u00a34.30) a day</a>, and struggle to meet basic needs. <a href=\"https://www.degrowth.info/en/what-is-degrowth/\" title=\"\">Degrowth</a> is not for these people.</p> <p>Then there is green \u201cdecoupled\u201d growth: some economists believe that the scale of the investment required to save the world from catastrophic climate change means there is plenty of good expansion that can be achieved. This is the economics of the Green New Deal, as espoused by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York democratic congresswoman, in the US.</p> <p>But few economists think that the global economy is decoupling from carbon fast enough to prevent a climate crisis. The world\u2019s wealthiest countries need to consume, on average, <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/greengrowth/green-growth-indicators/\" title=\"\">416kg of materials and 111kg of energy products to generate $1,000 of GDP</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2019-06-03T14:09:32/embed.html\" data-alt=\"chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2019-06-03T14:09:32/embed.html\">chart</a> </figure>  <p>Kate Raworth, an economist at the University of Oxford who has written about the problems of growth for the environment in her book Doughnut Economics, says that despite advances in green technologies, growth is not decoupling from carbon fast enough.</p> <p>\u201cWhile we need to embrace every opportunity to decouple that we can, the desire for green growth to be the new paradigm runs ahead of the evidence,\u201d she says.</p> <h2><strong>What would the alternatives look like?</strong></h2> <p>Replacing the world\u2019s growth model and reliance on GDP as the barometer of success is challenging. It would require people to stop buying stuff and that would put a lot of people out of work. That would only work if income was decoupled from labour, and that feels like an idea that is some way off.</p> <p>The concept of <a href=\"https://degrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Kallis_2012_The-economics-of-degrowth.pdf\" title=\"\">degrowth</a> is promoted by some more radical economists, calling for a focus on wellbeing and pushing for a reduction of production and consumption in developed nations. A focus on sufficiency is demanded, rather than relying on the ability of technology and productivity gains to solve ecological problems. At its core the movement argues that growth is typically unjust, unsustainable for the environment and that there never can be such thing as \u201cenough\u201d.</p> <p>Raworth argues that governments should adopt metrics that assess whether a country is operating sustainably, using her doughnut model. Using a simple diagram, she suggests that the hole in the middle is where people fall short of the essentials of life, where nobody should be. Beyond the outer ring, is a place where the collective use of resources pushes us beyond earth\u2019s life supporting systems.</p> <p>\u201cI am hopeful. Or at least I\u2019m seeing these alternative dashboards of metrics being given a lot more interest,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t have answers to all the questions I\u2019m asking: how you create an economy that thrives whether or not it grows \u2013 I don\u2019t have the answer to the financial, political and social redesign. But I believe these are the existential economic questions of our time. So we need to start asking them, no matter how jarring they are to mainstream policy debate.\u201d</p> <p>Working less is also a possible solution, spending on big environmental projects such as rewilding another. More radical proposals for a total rupture with economics as we know it include ideas like the <a href=\"https://www.resourcebasedeconomy.org/\" title=\"\">resource-based economy</a> and reforming <a href=\"https://positivemoney.org/publications/escaping-growth-dependency/\" title=\"\">the monetary system</a>.</p> <p>New Zealand has become the world\u2019s first major nation to unveil a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/14/new-zealands-world-first-wellbeing-budget-to-focus-on-poverty-and-mental-health\" title=\"\">budget focused on improving wellbeing</a>, while Gus O\u2019Donnell, the former head of the civil service in the UK, is urging Britain to look beyond GDP and instead focus on wellbeing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/briefing-boxes/GDP2/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Box 2\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/briefing-boxes/GDP2/embed.html\">Box 2</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>What if we ditched GDP altogether?</strong></h2> <p>Moving entirely away from GDP could be tricky. Government debt is always measured in relation to the size of the economy, to assess how sustainable national finances are. Without such a benchmark, it could become harder for countries to finance their activities.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to rip it up until you have something to switch to and you have to have enough people to make the switch,\u201d says Coyle, who is researching different ways of measuring the economy, including the way in which natural, social and intangible capital is built, and the amount of time that is used to complete particular goals.</p> <p>\u201cWhat to switch to is an important question. And we\u2019re not there yet with what the answer might be,\u201d she said.</p> <p>With growing numbers of alternative metrics being made available by the ONS, the question is how they could be used better in addition to GDP. Alfie Stirling, head of economics at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, says: \u201cLet\u2019s have a culture of not relying on reducing outcomes to a single metric. Let\u2019s be relaxed about it.</p> <p>\u201cIf our critique of GDP is that it itself is only one metric. The solution is not to find one better metric, it is just to use more metrics.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Further reading</strong></h2> <p>Diane Coyle <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/gdp-343415.html\">GDP: a Brief But Affectionate History</a></p> <p>Kate Raworth <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/doughnut-economics-555361.html\">Doughnut Economics</a></p> <p>Tim Jackson <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/prosperity-without-growth-454431.html\">Prosperity Without Growth</a></p>",

The entire world economy is worth roughly $80tn a year \u2013 about $10,500 for every man, woman and child on the planet. How do you measure it? In order to measure GDP, statisticians use three approaches: measuring the total value of goods and services produced; the total amount spent in the economy, and the total amount of income from profits and wages. All three methods should, in theory, give the same number. If GDP has increased over a period of time, the economy is growing. If it contracts for two consecutive quarters, the economy is in recession. Despite the apparently scientific approach, the calculation of GDP relies on several assumptions and misses out huge swathes of the economy and wider society that cannot be quantified in monetary terms. Bobby Kennedy once famously said in a speech of GDP: \u201cIt measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.\u201d GDP includes rough estimates for the value of drugs and prostitution, yet fails to take account of unpaid work in the home. In a sign of the scale of what is missing, in 2016, the value of the UK\u2019s unpaid household service work was estimated at \u00a31.24tn, more than the entire non-financial sector. On paper, charities account for only \u00a327bn of the British economy, but Andy Haldane, the chief economist at the Bank of England, reckons this figure could be increased to \u00a3234bn a year if the value of volunteering and the benefits it brings were adequately accounted for. Environmental degradation is not included in GDP. After the Exxon Valdez disaster in 1989, the oil spill showed up as a net economic gain because the money spent on the clean-up effort boosted US GDP \u2013 despite the damage to Alaska\u2019s waters. The measure takes no account of leisure time, meaning that two countries might have equal GDP but one has workers toiling for 12 hour days and the other only eight. Large amounts of output captured by GDP are also wasteful, such as the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of food wasted in Britain each year, or the Christmas jumpers bought for one night, only to degrade in landfill for centuries. Sounds a bit outmoded for the 21st century Many economists would agree, arguing that GDP is incapable of connecting the economy with social and environmental outcomes that determine our wellbeing and the sustainability of the planet. Should we wish to move away from measuring our success on monetary terms alone, GDP would be inadequate. \u201cPeople have forgotten that it isn\u2019t a real thing, it\u2019s a construct and a lot of judgments went into how it was put together,\u201d says Diane Coyle, an economist at the University of Cambridge who has written books about the failings of GDP and sustainable growth. \u201cThere are lots of things we just don\u2019t have a handle on now. I don\u2019t think the conceptual framework that we have fits the modern economy at all.\u201d Can we safely grow our economies for ever? Whether our economies can continue to grow forever is open to debate, with the continual rise of living standards, for growing numbers of people, dependent on a multitude of factors. There are three main schools of thought. First, that growth by any means can be justified if it improves the lives of the broadest number of people possible. Second, that growth is OK but it needs to be \u201cdecoupled\u201d from carbon to prevent climate catastrophe. Third, that growth by definition is impossible to sustain for ever given our planetary confines, and therefore that the only solution is \u201cdegrowth\u201d \u2013 a sort of \u2018less-is-more\u2019 credo that emphasises sustainability, solidarity and deceleration. The first is increasingly being challenged, though outright rejection of growth poses problems for the developing world. Almost half of the world\u2019s population \u2013 3.4 billion people \u2013 live on less than $5.50 (\u00a34.30) a day, and struggle to meet basic needs. Degrowth is not for these people. Then there is green \u201cdecoupled\u201d growth: some economists believe that the scale of the investment required to save the world from catastrophic climate change means there is plenty of good expansion that can be achieved. This is the economics of the Green New Deal, as espoused by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York democratic congresswoman, in the US. But few economists think that the global economy is decoupling from carbon fast enough to prevent a climate crisis. The world\u2019s wealthiest countries need to consume, on average, 416kg of materials and 111kg of energy products to generate $1,000 of GDP. Kate Raworth, an economist at the University of Oxford who has written about the problems of growth for the environment in her book Doughnut Economics, says that despite advances in green technologies, growth is not decoupling from carbon fast enough. \u201cWhile we need to embrace every opportunity to decouple that we can, the desire for green growth to be the new paradigm runs ahead of the evidence,\u201d she says. What would the alternatives look like? Replacing the world\u2019s growth model and reliance on GDP as the barometer of success is challenging. It would require people to stop buying stuff and that would put a lot of people out of work. That would only work if income was decoupled from labour, and that feels like an idea that is some way off. The concept of degrowth is promoted by some more radical economists, calling for a focus on wellbeing and pushing for a reduction of production and consumption in developed nations. A focus on sufficiency is demanded, rather than relying on the ability of technology and productivity gains to solve ecological problems. At its core the movement argues that growth is typically unjust, unsustainable for the environment and that there never can be such thing as \u201cenough\u201d. Raworth argues that governments should adopt metrics that assess whether a country is operating sustainably, using her doughnut model. Using a simple diagram, she suggests that the hole in the middle is where people fall short of the essentials of life, where nobody should be. Beyond the outer ring, is a place where the collective use of resources pushes us beyond earth\u2019s life supporting systems. \u201cI am hopeful. Or at least I\u2019m seeing these alternative dashboards of metrics being given a lot more interest,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t have answers to all the questions I\u2019m asking: how you create an economy that thrives whether or not it grows \u2013 I don\u2019t have the answer to the financial, political and social redesign. But I believe these are the existential economic questions of our time. So we need to start asking them, no matter how jarring they are to mainstream policy debate.\u201d Working less is also a possible solution, spending on big environmental projects such as rewilding another. More radical proposals for a total rupture with economics as we know it include ideas like the resource-based economy and reforming the monetary system. New Zealand has become the world\u2019s first major nation to unveil a budget focused on improving wellbeing, while Gus O\u2019Donnell, the former head of the civil service in the UK, is urging Britain to look beyond GDP and instead focus on wellbeing. What if we ditched GDP altogether? Moving entirely away from GDP could be tricky. Government debt is always measured in relation to the size of the economy, to assess how sustainable national finances are. Without such a benchmark, it could become harder for countries to finance their activities. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to rip it up until you have something to switch to and you have to have enough people to make the switch,\u201d says Coyle, who is researching different ways of measuring the economy, including the way in which natural, social and intangible capital is built, and the amount of time that is used to complete particular goals. \u201cWhat to switch to is an important question. And we\u2019re not there yet with what the answer might be,\u201d she said. With growing numbers of alternative metrics being made available by the ONS, the question is how they could be used better in addition to GDP. Alfie Stirling, head of economics at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, says: \u201cLet\u2019s have a culture of not relying on reducing outcomes to a single metric. Let\u2019s be relaxed about it. \u201cIf our critique of GDP is that it itself is only one metric. The solution is not to find one better metric, it is just to use more metrics.\u201d Further reading Diane Coyle GDP: a Brief But Affectionate History Kate Raworth Doughnut Economics Tim Jackson Prosperity Without Growth",

Officials around the globe have banned particularly egregious plastic pollutants, such as straws and flimsy bags, yet America alone generates 34.5m tons of plastic waste each year, enough to fill Houston\u2019s Astrodome stadium 1,000 times.</p> <p>Of the 9% of America\u2019s plastic that the Environmental Protection Agency estimated was recycled in 2015, China and Hong Kong handled more than half: about 1.6m tons of our plastic recycling every year. They developed a vast industry of harvesting and reusing the most valuable plastics to make products that could be sold back to the western world.</p> <p>But much of what America sent was contaminated with food or dirt, or it was non-recyclable and simply had to be landfilled in China. Amid growing environmental and health fears, China shut its doors to all but the cleanest plastics in late 2017<strong>.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"1\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src='https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2019/06/plastics-gifs/v2/hotspots.gif' width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; loop autoplay /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Since the China ban, America\u2019s plastic waste has become a global hot potato, ping-ponging from country to country. The Guardian\u2019s analysis of shipping records and US Census Bureau export data has found that America is still shipping more than 1m tons a year of its plastic waste overseas, much of it to places that are already virtually drowning in it.</p> <p>A red flag to researchers is that many of these countries ranked very poorly on metrics of how well they handle their own plastic waste. A study led by the University of Georgia researcher Jenna Jambeck<strong> </strong>found that Malaysia, the biggest recipient of US plastic recycling since the China ban, mismanaged 55% of its own plastic waste, meaning it was dumped or inadequately disposed of at sites such as open landfills. Indonesia and Vietnam improperly managed 81% and 86%, respectively.</p> <p>\u201cWe are trying so desperately to get rid of this stuff that we are looking for new frontiers,\u201d said Jan Dell, an independent engineer, whose organization The Last Beach Cleanup works with investors and environmental groups to reduce plastic pollution. \u201cThe path of least resistance is to put it on a ship and send it somewhere else \u2013 and the ships are going further and further to find some place to put it,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"where waste goes\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src='https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2019/06/plastics-gifs/v1/map.png' width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; loop autoplay /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2019/06/plastics-updated/v10/plastics_updated.html\" data-alt=\"TKTKTK\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2019/06/plastics-updated/v10/plastics_updated.html\">TKTKTK</a> </figure>  <p>Take Vietnam.

Shipments began making their way to Cambodia, Laos, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya and Senegal, which had previously handled virtually no US plastic.</p> <p>The Guardian found that each month throughout the second half of 2018, container ships ferried<strong> </strong>about 260 tons of US plastic scrap into one of the most dystopian, plastic-covered places of all: the Cambodian seaside town of Sihanoukville, where, in some areas, almost every inch of the ocean is covered with floating plastic and the beach is nothing but a glinting carpet of polymers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"49ca10ae4fb8068a72d99e8cebc11e41d99c4538\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49ca10ae4fb8068a72d99e8cebc11e41d99c4538/0_0_6024_4024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heng Ngy lives in a wooden house over a sea of plastic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heng Ngy lives in a wooden house over a sea of plastic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leonie Kijewski</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI cannot accept plastic being imported into our country,\u201d said a resident, Heng Ngy, 58. Ngy and his wife live in a wooden house on stilts that seems to hover on a sea of plastic. A pungent stench wafts up to the open-aired rooms.</p> <p>Cambodia\u2019s waste problem is believed to stem from its own use of plastic and a lack of any system for dealing with it. No one interviewed in Sihanoukville had any idea that plastic recycling was being exported from the United States, and what happened to the plastic after it arrived is unclear.</p> <p>Experts estimate that 20% to 70% of plastic entering recycling facilities around the globe is discarded because it is unusable \u2013 so any plastic being recycled at Sihanoukville would inevitably result in more waste there.</p> <p>Alex Gonzalez-Davidson, the co-founder of the Cambodian environmental organization Mother Nature, said his organization had not been aware of the issue. But \u201cif it works, they will bring more and more\u201d, he said. For now, shipments of plastic appear to have tailed off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5e646ac14279da5455057f7b75ecc853de501549\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e646ac14279da5455057f7b75ecc853de501549/0_0_4744_3163/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Waste spread on the beach in Sihanoukville, Cambodia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Waste is spread on the beach in Sihanoukville, Cambodia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niamh Peren/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How plastic waste fuels a global business</h2> <p>How does your plastic get from your curbside to a village in south-east Asia? Through a trading network that crosses oceans and traverses continents. It\u2019s a network that is complex, at times nefarious, and in which few consumers understand their role. Now, that network is at a breaking point.</p> <p>Plastic\u2019s first stop on its months-long journey is a recycling facility where it is sorted into bales based on its type \u2013 soda bottles, milk jugs and clamshell-style containers, for instance, are all made of subtly different kinds \u2013 and readied for sale.</p> <p>Waste plastic is a commodity, and recycling brokers search across the US and abroad for buyers who will want to melt the plastic down, turn it into pellets, and make those pellets into something new.</p> <p>In the past, it made economic sense to ship the plastic to Asia, because shipping companies that transport China\u2019s manufactured goods to the US end up with thousands of empty shipping containers to carry back. In the absence of American goods to fill them, the companies have been willing to ship out America\u2019s recycling at rock-bottom rates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5878f6e6759dc77f43684b8ca1c8008033a75223\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5878f6e6759dc77f43684b8ca1c8008033a75223/0_0_4000_6000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Wong links your recycling with international purchasers.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Wong links your recycling with international purchasers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erin McCormick</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Steve Wong, a Hong Kong-based businessman, is one of the middlemen who connects your recycling with international buyers. \u201cAt one time, I was one of the biggest exporters in the world,\u201d he said, worth millions. Now, Wong said, his company, the Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling, was deep in debt.</p> <p>Wong\u2019s problem is hardly a lack of supply. Each month the equivalent of thousands of shipping containers worth of recyclable plastics, which used to be exported, are piling up all over the United States. Nor is his worry a shortage of demand for plastic. It is desperately needed by factories in China for manufacturing into myriad new products \u2013 from toys and picture frames to garden gazebos.</p> <p>What is nearly killing his business is the fact that many countries have soured on the recycling industry, after unscrupulous operators set up shop, operating as cheaply as possible, with no regard for the environment or local residents.</p> <p>\u201cIn our industry, if you do it properly, you save the environment,\u201d Wong said. \u201cIf you do it improperly, you destroy the environment.\u201d</p> <p>As far as profits go, the numbers just barely favor recycling.</p> <p>Wong said he might spend $150 to buy a ton of plastic scrap from a US recycler. Once it is shipped abroad, sold to a processor, turned into pellets and then again shipped to a manufacturer, the seller might ask as much as $800 per ton. </p> <p>Yet the cost of similar virgin plastic, which is often higher quality, is just $900 to $1,000 a ton.</p> <p>Wong believes the answer in the future will be to process the material closer to the United States. That is why he has planned trips to meet with government officials in the Dominican Republic and Haiti, and why, on a recent Wednesday, Wong crisscrossed back and forth through heavy traffic in the Mexican city of Monterrey, located about 150 miles south of Laredo, Texas.</p> <p>Wong, a trim 61-year-old dressed head-to-toe in khaki like a safari hunter, was working to set up a new plastics recycling factory for an investor who hopes to one day process US plastic.</p> <p>At one reseller \u2013 a corrugated-metal warehouse piled floor-to-ceiling with plastic that included shimmery sheaths of wrapping from US retail stores \u2013 Wong wanted to test the quality of the supply. He filled a baggie with ground-up flakes of black plastic from picking crates, then took a cigarette lighter and lit one of the flakes on fire. He carefully sniffed the smoke to get a sense of what variety of plastic it was.</p> <p>At Wong\u2019s next stop, an existing Monterrey recycling processor, you could get a sense of the work the new factory might do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"78e72d776a762fcee84acbd50fa4d3d2ec780450\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78e72d776a762fcee84acbd50fa4d3d2ec780450/0_0_6026_1333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plastic is stretched and chopped into pellets in a variety of colors.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"221\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plastic is stretched and formed into pellets in a variety of colors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erin McCormick/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A rudimentary plastic processing machine stretched 40ft across the bare dirt of the warehouse floor. The processor takes rejected car parts and grinds them up into confetti-sized flakes. Workers feed these flakes into a flume that channels them past a heater to melt them. The melted plastic is pressed into long, white strings, which are stretched across the room and allowed to harden. At that point, they are chopped into pellets a little bigger than rice grains.</p> <p>Wong said he would like to build more modern factories with up-to-date systems for eliminating toxic releases to the air and water. But he said he was sure that many of his less scrupulous competitors would keep exporting on the cheap. He suggested that even in countries that had banned plastic imports, the material continued to be smuggled in.</p> <p>\u201cRecyclers have set up factories in all these countries, but they don\u2019t have enough supply. So, even though it is smuggling, even though it is not legal, they still have to do what it takes to get the plastic.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"break\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">break</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"3\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src='https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2019/06/plastics-gifs/v2/container.gif' width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; loop autoplay /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>With US plastic landing in countries that have never seen it in such quantities, local residents are crying foul.</p> <p>In the Philippines, about 120 shipping containers a month are arriving in Manila and an industrial zone in the former US military base at Subic Bay. Records indicate they were filled with plastic scrap shipped from such places as Los Angeles, Georgia and the Port of New York-Newark.</p> <p>From the Manila port, shipping records and Philippines customs documents show, some of the US plastic was transported to Valenzuela City. The area, on the outskirts of the Philippine capital, is known as \u201cPlastic City\u201d and residents are increasingly concerned about the number of processing factories sprouting in their midst.</p> <p>\u201cYou smell that?\u201d said a shopkeeper, Helen Lota, 47, as she stood in front of her neighborhood convenience<strong> </strong>store at noon one day last month. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing.

The coughing must be caused by the smell.\u201d</p> <p>Noticing Lota complaining about the plastic problem, passersby stopped to chime in. \u201cMy mother\u2019s cough won\u2019t go away, probably because of the smell,\u201d said Renante Bito, 38.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db01d4d4b5e8f1ae91708a72fb7cab89820de9b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db01d4d4b5e8f1ae91708a72fb7cab89820de9b0/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A worker puts styrofoam in a shredder at a recycling plant in Valenzuela City, north of Manila.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A worker puts styrofoam in a shredder at a recycling plant in Valenzuela City, north of Manila.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet recycling is also one of the area\u2019s biggest income sources. Officials and residents interviewed by the Guardian said they had assumed the plastic being processed in their town was the Philippines\u2019 own waste. None realized that some of it was being shipped from the US. Representatives for the factories receiving US waste declined to be interviewed.</p> <p>In Turkey, US plastic imports may be putting an entire profession at risk. Since China closed its doors, the amount of plastic recycling Turkey takes in from abroad has soared, from 159,000 to 439,000 tons in two years.</p> <p>Each month, about 10 ships pull into the ports of Istanbul and Adana, carrying about 2,000 tons of cheap US scrap plastic that is no longer wanted by China. Most of it comes from the ports of Georgia, Charleston, Baltimore and New York. Some of it is described in shipping records as \u201cWalmart film scrap\u201d, the clear cling wrap used to secure huge pallets of products sold by Walmart. (Walmart declined to comment on the issue.) These cargo ships join dozens of others from the UK and other European countries.</p> <p>Their arrival is closely watched by Turkey\u2019s scrap pickers, who number in the hundreds of thousands and travel the streets collecting scraps from houses and businesses to resell to factories for manufacturing into products such as plastic bags.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"20576827e928443ec0390717e09e9ebbdab9c9ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20576827e928443ec0390717e09e9ebbdab9c9ec/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Men search through pieces suitable for recycling at the municipal garbage dump in the south-eastern city of Diyarbakir, Turkey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Men search through pieces suitable for recycling at the municipal garbage dump in the south-eastern city of Diyarbakir, Turkey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sertac Kayar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, the scrap pickers say, the factories are buying cheaper and cleaner plastic from the foreign recycling coming in on ships. Piles of their unsold, locally collected plastic are building up in urban storage yards. They have organized a campaign to stop the flood of foreign plastic, getting friends who work in the port to take videos of materials being offloaded and conducting their own ad hoc investigations.</p> <p>\u201cThere are 500,000 street collectors in Turkey, working almost like ants to collect the waste,\u201d said Baran Bozo\u011flu, head of Turkey\u2019s Chamber of Environmental Engineers. Yet he said the \u201cuncontrolled and unlimited\u201d import of foreign recycling was leaving these local recyclers without markets for the scrap they collect. \u201cIt\u2019s like we have flour and water and, instead of making our own bread, we import bread from abroad!

In the past, \u00c7a\u011flayan, a 20-year-veteran of the scrap-picking trade, was able to feed his family of five with the $800 or so he made every month. But this year, he said, his income was down by about a third due to the competition from cheap, imported recycling.</p> <p>\u2018\u2018I want to tell people in US this: recycle in your own yard,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t bring down our income and put us all in danger of hunger.\u2019\u2019</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b8705f213d2775e32ac1dd0482906d974816ba6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8705f213d2775e32ac1dd0482906d974816ba6c/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Containers filled with plastic waste are seen before being sent back to their countries of origin in Port Klang, Malaysia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Containers filled with plastic waste are seen before being sent back to their countries of origin in Port Klang, Malaysia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How people are fighting for change</h2> <p>The environmental and social ramifications of America\u2019s plastic exports are shocking even to those in the industry. Bob Wenzlau is considered one of the founding fathers of the US curbside recycling system, having helped to launch the program in Palo Alto, California, in 1976.</p> <p>Curbside recycling \u201cwas started with a really good intention; I used to feel so proud,\u201d said Wenzlau. Now, after learning of the effects the nation\u2019s exports are having overseas, he said, \u201cmy heart aches, because the system is doing harm\u201d.</p> <p>Wenzlau recently convinced the Palo Alto city council to pass a measure requiring the city\u2019s recyclers to report on the social and environmental consequences of any recycling that goes to foreign countries.</p> <p>Even in San Francisco, long hailed for the high percentage of waste it is able to recycle, the head of the city\u2019s waste disposal provider has said that the system is failing.</p> <p>\u201cThe simple fact is, there is just too much plastic \u2013 and too many different types of plastics \u2013 being produced; and there exist few, if any, viable end markets for the material,\u201d Michael J Sangiacomo of Recology recently <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/It-is-time-to-cut-use-of-plastics-13489726.php\">wrote</a> in an op-ed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"2\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src='https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2019/06/plastics-gifs/v1/houston.jpg' width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; loop autoplay /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>A <a href=\"https://wastetradestories.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Discarded-Report-April-22.pdf\">study released this spring</a> by the environmental group Gaia documented the human toll of US plastics exports on the countries that receive them.</p> <p>\u201cThe impact of the shift in plastic trade to south-east Asian countries has been staggering \u2013 contaminated water supplies, crop death, respiratory illness from exposure to burning plastic, and the rise of organized crime abound in areas most exposed to the flood of new imports,\u201d the report found.</p> <p>\u201cThese countries and their people are shouldering the economic, social and environmental costs of that pollution, possibly for generations to come.\u201d</p> <p>For many experts, the most frightening example of how an out-of-control recycling industry can overwhelm a country is Malaysia. Immediately following the China ban, it became the go-to destination for US plastic and is still paying the price.</p> <p>In the first 10 months of 2018, the US exported 192,000 metric tons of plastic waste to Malaysia for recycling. Some of the factories had licenses to process foreign waste. Some only had licenses to deal with Malaysian plastic waste but secretly processed foreign waste. Often, such \u201cprocessing\u201d actually meant illegally burning plastic, with the toxic fumes inhaled by Malaysians living near unlicensed factories and dump sites.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"8b89f4edf3b01698774838a592ebe0b99770c706\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b89f4edf3b01698774838a592ebe0b99770c706/0_0_7936_5290/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Containers filled with plastic waste are seen before being sent back to their countries of origin in Port Klang, Malaysia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Containers filled with plastic waste are seen before being sent back to their countries of origin in Port Klang, Malaysia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mohd Rasfan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In October, the Malaysian government announced plans to immediately stop issuing new permits for importing plastic waste, and to end all plastic waste importing within three years. Even so, thousands of tons of junk plastic remain heaped on the landscape, left behind by unscrupulous business operations.</p> <p>On the outskirts of Jenjarom, a town in the district of Kuala Langat, where local authorities shut down 34 illegal factories last July, a land manager struggled to get rid of 10ft-high piles of plastic left under a corrugated roof by illegal importers of foreign waste. Nearby, a huge field of foreign plastic had been abandoned by the former renters: Chinese illegal factory owners, who left without warning following the crackdown.</p> <p>And the illegal importation of US waste is continuing. According to the environmental minister Yeo Bee Yin\u2019s accounts to the local press, many shippers simply change the codes on the documentation for their cargo containers to make it look like they are sending virgin plastic, which isn\u2019t regulated, instead of the same old recycling scrap.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cf610de688eb193ab501e32a0d24657c3261724a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf610de688eb193ab501e32a0d24657c3261724a/0_0_4000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"C.K.

      "bodyText": "What happens to your plastic after you drop it in a recycling bin? According to promotional materials from America\u2019s plastics industry, it is whisked off to a factory where it is seamlessly transformed into something new. This is not the experience of Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb H\u1ed3ng Th\u1eafm, a 60-year-old Vietnamese mother of seven, living amid piles of grimy American plastic on the outskirts of Hanoi. Outside her home, the sun beats down on a Cheetos bag; aisle markers from a Walmart store; and a plastic bag from ShopRite, a chain of supermarkets in New Jersey, bearing a message urging people to recycle it. Tham is paid the equivalent of $6.50 a day to strip off the non-recyclable elements and sort what remains: translucent plastic in one pile, opaque in another. A Guardian investigation has found that hundreds of thousands of tons of US plastic are being shipped every year to poorly regulated developing countries around the globe for the dirty, labor-intensive process of recycling. The consequences for public health and the environment are grim. A team of Guardian reporters in 11 countries has found: Last year, the equivalent of 68,000 shipping containers of American plastic recycling were exported from the US to developing countries that mismanage more than 70% of their own plastic waste. The newest hotspots for handling US plastic recycling are some of the world\u2019s poorest countries, including Bangladesh, Laos, Ethiopia and Senegal, offering cheap labor and limited environmental regulation. In some places, like Turkey, a surge in foreign waste shipments is disrupting efforts to handle locally generated plastics. With these nations overwhelmed, thousands of tons of waste plastic are stranded at home in the US, as we reveal in our story later this week. These failures in the recycling system are adding to a growing sense of crisis around plastic, a wonder material that has enabled everything from toothbrushes to space helmets but is now found in enormous quantities in the oceans and has even been detected in the human digestive system. Reflecting grave concerns around plastic waste, last month, 187 countries signed a treaty giving nations the power to block the import of contaminated or hard-to-recycle plastic trash. A few countries did not sign. One was the US. A new Guardian series, United States of Plastic, will scrutinize the plastic crisis engulfing America and the world, publishing several more stories this week and continuing for the rest of 2019. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to their trash,\u201d said Andrew Spicer, who teaches corporate social responsibility at the University of South Carolina and sits on his state\u2019s recycling advisory board. \u201cThey think they\u2019re saving the world. But the international recycling business sees it as a way of making money. There have been no global regulations \u2013 just a long, dirty market that allows some companies to take advantage of a world without rules.\u201d Where America\u2019s recycling lands Plastic only came into mass consumer use in the 1950s, but in the Pacific Garbage Patch it is already thought to be more common than plankton. Officials around the globe have banned particularly egregious plastic pollutants, such as straws and flimsy bags, yet America alone generates 34.5m tons of plastic waste each year, enough to fill Houston\u2019s Astrodome stadium 1,000 times. Of the 9% of America\u2019s plastic that the Environmental Protection Agency estimated was recycled in 2015, China and Hong Kong handled more than half: about 1.6m tons of our plastic recycling every year. They developed a vast industry of harvesting and reusing the most valuable plastics to make products that could be sold back to the western world. But much of what America sent was contaminated with food or dirt, or it was non-recyclable and simply had to be landfilled in China. Amid growing environmental and health fears, China shut its doors to all but the cleanest plastics in late 2017. Since the China ban, America\u2019s plastic waste has become a global hot potato, ping-ponging from country to country. The Guardian\u2019s analysis of shipping records and US Census Bureau export data has found that America is still shipping more than 1m tons a year of its plastic waste overseas, much of it to places that are already virtually drowning in it. A red flag to researchers is that many of these countries ranked very poorly on metrics of how well they handle their own plastic waste. A study led by the University of Georgia researcher Jenna Jambeck found that Malaysia, the biggest recipient of US plastic recycling since the China ban, mismanaged 55% of its own plastic waste, meaning it was dumped or inadequately disposed of at sites such as open landfills. Indonesia and Vietnam improperly managed 81% and 86%, respectively. \u201cWe are trying so desperately to get rid of this stuff that we are looking for new frontiers,\u201d said Jan Dell, an independent engineer, whose organization The Last Beach Cleanup works with investors and environmental groups to reduce plastic pollution. \u201cThe path of least resistance is to put it on a ship and send it somewhere else \u2013 and the ships are going further and further to find some place to put it,\u201d she said. Take Vietnam. Minh Khai, a village on a river delta near Hanoi, is the center of a waste management cottage industry. Rubbish from across the world, inscribed in languages from Arabic to French, lines almost every street in this community of about 1,000 households. Workers in makeshift workshops churn out recycled pellets amid toxic fumes and foul stench from the truckloads of scrap that are transported there every day. Even Minh Khai\u2019s welcome arch, adorned with bright red flags, is flanked by plastic waste on both sides. In 2018, the US sent 83,000 tons of plastic recycling to Vietnam. On the ground, America\u2019s footprint is clear: a bag of York Peppermint Patties from Hershey, with US labeling, and an empty bag from a chemical coatings manufacturer in Ohio. \u201cWe\u2019re really scared of the plastic fumes, and we don\u2019t dare to drink the water from underground here,\u201d said Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb H\u1ed3ng Th\u1eafm, the plastic sorter, wearing thick gloves, a face mask and a traditional Vietnamese conical hat to protect herself from the sun. \u201cWe don\u2019t have money so we don\u2019t have any choice but to work here.\u201d While the exact health effects of workers\u2019 exposure to plastic recycling operations have not been well studied, the toxic fumes resulting from the burning of plastics or plastic processing can cause respiratory illness. Regular exposure can subject workers and nearby residents to hundreds of toxic substances, including hydrochloric acid, sulfur dioxide, dioxins and heavy metals, the effects of which can include developmental disorders, endocrine disruption, and cancer. Once the plastic is sorted by workers like Tham, others feed the scrap into grinders before putting it through densifiers that melt and condense the scrap so it can be molded into pellets. The Vietnamese prime minister, Nguy\u1ec5n Xu\u00e2n Ph\u00fac, ordered a tightening on scrap standards in July 2018, and legal monthly imports were cut to one-tenth of what they had been. As of April, more than 23,400 shipping containers of scrap remain held up in customs. But business continues to boom in Minh Khai. Tham said that scrap is still arriving from Haiphong, northern Vietnam\u2019s largest port, and other parts of the country every day, and records show a significant rebound in imports. As countries like Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand banned imports, records show the plastic waste fanning out to a host of new countries. Shipments began making their way to Cambodia, Laos, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya and Senegal, which had previously handled virtually no US plastic. The Guardian found that each month throughout the second half of 2018, container ships ferried about 260 tons of US plastic scrap into one of the most dystopian, plastic-covered places of all: the Cambodian seaside town of Sihanoukville, where, in some areas, almost every inch of the ocean is covered with floating plastic and the beach is nothing but a glinting carpet of polymers. \u201cI cannot accept plastic being imported into our country,\u201d said a resident, Heng Ngy, 58. Ngy and his wife live in a wooden house on stilts that seems to hover on a sea of plastic. A pungent stench wafts up to the open-aired rooms. Cambodia\u2019s waste problem is believed to stem from its own use of plastic and a lack of any system for dealing with it. No one interviewed in Sihanoukville had any idea that plastic recycling was being exported from the United States, and what happened to the plastic after it arrived is unclear. Experts estimate that 20% to 70% of plastic entering recycling facilities around the globe is discarded because it is unusable \u2013 so any plastic being recycled at Sihanoukville would inevitably result in more waste there. Alex Gonzalez-Davidson, the co-founder of the Cambodian environmental organization Mother Nature, said his organization had not been aware of the issue. But \u201cif it works, they will bring more and more\u201d, he said. For now, shipments of plastic appear to have tailed off. How plastic waste fuels a global business How does your plastic get from your curbside to a village in south-east Asia? Through a trading network that crosses oceans and traverses continents. It\u2019s a network that is complex, at times nefarious, and in which few consumers understand their role. Now, that network is at a breaking point. Plastic\u2019s first stop on its months-long journey is a recycling facility where it is sorted into bales based on its type \u2013 soda bottles, milk jugs and clamshell-style containers, for instance, are all made of subtly different kinds \u2013 and readied for sale. Waste plastic is a commodity, and recycling brokers search across the US and abroad for buyers who will want to melt the plastic down, turn it into pellets, and make those pellets into something new. In the past, it made economic sense to ship the plastic to Asia, because shipping companies that transport China\u2019s manufactured goods to the US end up with thousands of empty shipping containers to carry back. In the absence of American goods to fill them, the companies have been willing to ship out America\u2019s recycling at rock-bottom rates. Steve Wong, a Hong Kong-based businessman, is one of the middlemen who connects your recycling with international buyers. \u201cAt one time, I was one of the biggest exporters in the world,\u201d he said, worth millions. Now, Wong said, his company, the Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling, was deep in debt. Wong\u2019s problem is hardly a lack of supply. Each month the equivalent of thousands of shipping containers worth of recyclable plastics, which used to be exported, are piling up all over the United States. Nor is his worry a shortage of demand for plastic. It is desperately needed by factories in China for manufacturing into myriad new products \u2013 from toys and picture frames to garden gazebos. What is nearly killing his business is the fact that many countries have soured on the recycling industry, after unscrupulous operators set up shop, operating as cheaply as possible, with no regard for the environment or local residents. \u201cIn our industry, if you do it properly, you save the environment,\u201d Wong said. \u201cIf you do it improperly, you destroy the environment.\u201d As far as profits go, the numbers just barely favor recycling. Wong said he might spend $150 to buy a ton of plastic scrap from a US recycler. Once it is shipped abroad, sold to a processor, turned into pellets and then again shipped to a manufacturer, the seller might ask as much as $800 per ton. Yet the cost of similar virgin plastic, which is often higher quality, is just $900 to $1,000 a ton. Wong believes the answer in the future will be to process the material closer to the United States. That is why he has planned trips to meet with government officials in the Dominican Republic and Haiti, and why, on a recent Wednesday, Wong crisscrossed back and forth through heavy traffic in the Mexican city of Monterrey, located about 150 miles south of Laredo, Texas. Wong, a trim 61-year-old dressed head-to-toe in khaki like a safari hunter, was working to set up a new plastics recycling factory for an investor who hopes to one day process US plastic. At one reseller \u2013 a corrugated-metal warehouse piled floor-to-ceiling with plastic that included shimmery sheaths of wrapping from US retail stores \u2013 Wong wanted to test the quality of the supply. He filled a baggie with ground-up flakes of black plastic from picking crates, then took a cigarette lighter and lit one of the flakes on fire. He carefully sniffed the smoke to get a sense of what variety of plastic it was. At Wong\u2019s next stop, an existing Monterrey recycling processor, you could get a sense of the work the new factory might do. A rudimentary plastic processing machine stretched 40ft across the bare dirt of the warehouse floor. The processor takes rejected car parts and grinds them up into confetti-sized flakes. Workers feed these flakes into a flume that channels them past a heater to melt them. The melted plastic is pressed into long, white strings, which are stretched across the room and allowed to harden. At that point, they are chopped into pellets a little bigger than rice grains. Wong said he would like to build more modern factories with up-to-date systems for eliminating toxic releases to the air and water. But he said he was sure that many of his less scrupulous competitors would keep exporting on the cheap. He suggested that even in countries that had banned plastic imports, the material continued to be smuggled in. \u201cRecyclers have set up factories in all these countries, but they don\u2019t have enough supply. So, even though it is smuggling, even though it is not legal, they still have to do what it takes to get the plastic.\u201d With US plastic landing in countries that have never seen it in such quantities, local residents are crying foul. In the Philippines, about 120 shipping containers a month are arriving in Manila and an industrial zone in the former US military base at Subic Bay. Records indicate they were filled with plastic scrap shipped from such places as Los Angeles, Georgia and the Port of New York-Newark. From the Manila port, shipping records and Philippines customs documents show, some of the US plastic was transported to Valenzuela City. The area, on the outskirts of the Philippine capital, is known as \u201cPlastic City\u201d and residents are increasingly concerned about the number of processing factories sprouting in their midst. \u201cYou smell that?\u201d said a shopkeeper, Helen Lota, 47, as she stood in front of her neighborhood convenience store at noon one day last month. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s worse towards evening. It gets suffocating,\u201d \u201cThere are times it\u2019s really hard to breathe. Many of us here are getting sick,\u201d said Lota. \u201cI had my daughter\u2019s cough checked in the hospital. But the X-ray is clear. The coughing must be caused by the smell.\u201d Noticing Lota complaining about the plastic problem, passersby stopped to chime in. \u201cMy mother\u2019s cough won\u2019t go away, probably because of the smell,\u201d said Renante Bito, 38. Yet recycling is also one of the area\u2019s biggest income sources. Officials and residents interviewed by the Guardian said they had assumed the plastic being processed in their town was the Philippines\u2019 own waste. None realized that some of it was being shipped from the US. Representatives for the factories receiving US waste declined to be interviewed. In Turkey, US plastic imports may be putting an entire profession at risk. Since China closed its doors, the amount of plastic recycling Turkey takes in from abroad has soared, from 159,000 to 439,000 tons in two years. Each month, about 10 ships pull into the ports of Istanbul and Adana, carrying about 2,000 tons of cheap US scrap plastic that is no longer wanted by China. Most of it comes from the ports of Georgia, Charleston, Baltimore and New York. Some of it is described in shipping records as \u201cWalmart film scrap\u201d, the clear cling wrap used to secure huge pallets of products sold by Walmart. (Walmart declined to comment on the issue.) These cargo ships join dozens of others from the UK and other European countries. Their arrival is closely watched by Turkey\u2019s scrap pickers, who number in the hundreds of thousands and travel the streets collecting scraps from houses and businesses to resell to factories for manufacturing into products such as plastic bags. Now, the scrap pickers say, the factories are buying cheaper and cleaner plastic from the foreign recycling coming in on ships. Piles of their unsold, locally collected plastic are building up in urban storage yards. They have organized a campaign to stop the flood of foreign plastic, getting friends who work in the port to take videos of materials being offloaded and conducting their own ad hoc investigations. \u201cThere are 500,000 street collectors in Turkey, working almost like ants to collect the waste,\u201d said Baran Bozo\u011flu, head of Turkey\u2019s Chamber of Environmental Engineers. Yet he said the \u201cuncontrolled and unlimited\u201d import of foreign recycling was leaving these local recyclers without markets for the scrap they collect. \u201cIt\u2019s like we have flour and water and, instead of making our own bread, we import bread from abroad! Does that make any sense to you?\u2019 Every day, Eser \u00c7a\u011flayan, 33, wheels his giant white collecting bag through a booming business district along the shores of the Bosphorus strait, hunting for treasures that people throw out, along with the usual plastic and paper scraps. In the past, \u00c7a\u011flayan, a 20-year-veteran of the scrap-picking trade, was able to feed his family of five with the $800 or so he made every month. But this year, he said, his income was down by about a third due to the competition from cheap, imported recycling. \u2018\u2018I want to tell people in US this: recycle in your own yard,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t bring down our income and put us all in danger of hunger.\u2019\u2019 How people are fighting for change The environmental and social ramifications of America\u2019s plastic exports are shocking even to those in the industry. Bob Wenzlau is considered one of the founding fathers of the US curbside recycling system, having helped to launch the program in Palo Alto, California, in 1976. Curbside recycling \u201cwas started with a really good intention; I used to feel so proud,\u201d said Wenzlau. Now, after learning of the effects the nation\u2019s exports are having overseas, he said, \u201cmy heart aches, because the system is doing harm\u201d. Wenzlau recently convinced the Palo Alto city council to pass a measure requiring the city\u2019s recyclers to report on the social and environmental consequences of any recycling that goes to foreign countries. Even in San Francisco, long hailed for the high percentage of waste it is able to recycle, the head of the city\u2019s waste disposal provider has said that the system is failing. \u201cThe simple fact is, there is just too much plastic \u2013 and too many different types of plastics \u2013 being produced; and there exist few, if any, viable end markets for the material,\u201d Michael J Sangiacomo of Recology recently wrote in an op-ed. A study released this spring by the environmental group Gaia documented the human toll of US plastics exports on the countries that receive them. \u201cThe impact of the shift in plastic trade to south-east Asian countries has been staggering \u2013 contaminated water supplies, crop death, respiratory illness from exposure to burning plastic, and the rise of organized crime abound in areas most exposed to the flood of new imports,\u201d the report found. \u201cThese countries and their people are shouldering the economic, social and environmental costs of that pollution, possibly for generations to come.\u201d For many experts, the most frightening example of how an out-of-control recycling industry can overwhelm a country is Malaysia. Immediately following the China ban, it became the go-to destination for US plastic and is still paying the price. In the first 10 months of 2018, the US exported 192,000 metric tons of plastic waste to Malaysia for recycling. Some of the factories had licenses to process foreign waste. Some only had licenses to deal with Malaysian plastic waste but secretly processed foreign waste. Often, such \u201cprocessing\u201d actually meant illegally burning plastic, with the toxic fumes inhaled by Malaysians living near unlicensed factories and dump sites. In October, the Malaysian government announced plans to immediately stop issuing new permits for importing plastic waste, and to end all plastic waste importing within three years. Even so, thousands of tons of junk plastic remain heaped on the landscape, left behind by unscrupulous business operations. On the outskirts of Jenjarom, a town in the district of Kuala Langat, where local authorities shut down 34 illegal factories last July, a land manager struggled to get rid of 10ft-high piles of plastic left under a corrugated roof by illegal importers of foreign waste. Nearby, a huge field of foreign plastic had been abandoned by the former renters: Chinese illegal factory owners, who left without warning following the crackdown. And the illegal importation of US waste is continuing. According to the environmental minister Yeo Bee Yin\u2019s accounts to the local press, many shippers simply change the codes on the documentation for their cargo containers to make it look like they are sending virgin plastic, which isn\u2019t regulated, instead of the same old recycling scrap. The continued arrival of foreign plastics is no surprise to Pang Song Lim, a 44-year-old civil engineer who lives in Sungai Petani, a town of half a million in the north-west state of Kedah. Officials say there may be 20 illegal plastic-processing factories there. Every evening at sunset, Lim prepares his house and his nose for the onslaught from the burning of foreign plastic waste nearby. Foul smoke engulfs homes and a local school. \u201cIt\u2019s normally after eight o\u2019clock,\u201d Lim said. \u201cBurned plastic \u2026 acidic \u2026 it hurts my chest. I try to seal my windows and block under the door with carpet.\u201d \u201cYou wake up at midnight because of the smell,\u201d said Christina Lai, a Sungai Petani activist. \u201cOne day this land will be taken over by rubbish and not humans.\u201d Lead reporter: Erin McCormick (Oakland, California and Monterrey, Mexico) Reporters: Bennett Murray (Hanoi, Vietnam), Leonie Kijewski (Phnom Penh, Cambodia), Carmela Fonbuena (Manila, Philippines), G\u00f6k\u00e7e Sara\u00e7o\u011flu (Istanbul, Turkey), Jamie Fullerton (Jenjarom and Sungai Petani, Malaysia), Febriana Firdaus (Jakarta, Indonesia), Kimberley Brown (Quito, Ecuador), Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu (Accra, Ghana), Redwan Ahmed (Dhaka, Bangladesh).

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a familiar scene: you stand at the bin, trash in hand, and wonder: \u201cCan I recycle this?\u201d We tend to throw it in the recycling bin anyway, in the hope that some unknown person, somewhere else, will sort it out. Recyclers call this aspirational recycling, or wish-cycling. While recycling continues to be an essential tool for dealing with the flood of plastic inundating the planet, it\u2019s time for a reality check. 1. Your coffee cup probably isn\u2019t recyclable Items composed of different kinds of materials present a big challenge for recyclers. The billions of single-use coffee cups discarded each year are a classic example: a thin, plastic coating inside the cup may prevent leakage, but it\u2019s extremely difficult to separate it from the paper cup itself. That means the cups can\u2019t be recycled as paper, nor can they be recycled as plastic. Their ultimate destination is usually the landfill. Coffee cup lids don\u2019t fare much better \u2013 due to the low quality of the plastic, they aren\u2019t particularly attractive to buyers of secondhand plastic, and in any event they tend to fragment into small, unusable pieces. Some curbside programs recommend putting them straight in the trash bin. The best solution is to get your own reusable coffee cup. 2. Toothpaste tubes need special treatment Clean teeth, yes. Clean planet, questionable. Toothpaste tubes are another troubling composite: while the bulk of the tubes may be made of plastic, they can contain other materials such as a thin coating of aluminum. Tubes and toothbrushes also contain different kinds of plastics mixed together (hard handle, soft bristles), increasing the challenges of separating and processing each type individually. Most curbside programs don\u2019t accept oral care products but new schemes, such as a partnership between Colgate and Terra Cycle, are encouraging people to send in their old tubes, toothbrushes and floss containers for proper processing. Metal tubes, glass jars and tins of toothpaste are more widely recyclable than their plastic counterparts, and plastic-free, compostable bamboo toothbrushes are becoming increasingly popular. 3. Don\u2019t be fooled by food containers It\u2019s bad enough that fruit and vegetables, which come pre-packaged in their own nutritious skins, are sold in plastic containers.

The bad bank would house or sell assets valued at up to \u20ac50bn (\u00a345bn), consisting mainly of long-term trades that have been a major drag on the struggling bank\u2019s balance sheet, the Financial Times reported, citing four people briefed on the plan. The creation of the bad bank \u2013 a tactic used by failed UK banks after the 2008 crisis \u2013 would enable chief executive Christian Sewing to shift the lender away from the highly profitable but risky world of investment banking and focus instead on mainstream banking and private wealth management. As part of the restructuring, the lender\u2019s stocks and interest rates trading units outside continental Europe would be shrunk or closed entirely, the report said.

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government is continuing efforts to court the Senate crossbench over its income tax package, with talks with the Centre Alliance in Perth on Monday about measures to relieve high energy prices. While the Coalition has played down the idea of wheeling and dealing with the crossbench to get the tax package passed, the Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick has gone to Perth for talks with the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, about measures the government could take to lower gas prices. Centre Alliance wants the Coalition to activate the existing Australian domestic gas security mechanism, which has not been used, that prevents companies exporting gas without first obtaining permission from the government. Patrick told Guardian Australia on Monday that gas consumers were paying 20% more than customers in Asia, and the Asian market was already characterised by high gas prices. \u201cThe system as it stands is broken,\u201d he said. The senator said Monday\u2019s talks were connected to the passage of the tax package once parliament resumes in July, but it was his view the Morrison government needed to produce a fix on gas prices regardless of whether a deal was struck with the crossbench on this legislation. The government will need the Centre Alliance Senate bloc for legislative votes where Labor and the Greens oppose its policy. The One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, who has already signalled her Senate team is \u201cnot sold\u201d on the income tax package, said on Monday infrastructure remained her priority, rather than tax relief. She said she had not yet had a conversation with Cormann about the package but her office had met Treasury officials last Friday. \u201cNow, the feedback that I have got is that they can do it one of two ways,\u201d Hanson told the Nine Network. \u201cWe can either go with the tax cuts or we can go with infrastructure projects, which will do exactly the same. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we are going to end up with infrastructure that will deliver us cheaper electricity, security, and also the water security that we need as well for the country,\u201d she said. Hanson said the government needed to focus on the regions. \u201cHow many more farmers are we going to see destitute because they don\u2019t have the water? This is what I am saying, make the right decisions now for the future generations. \u201cI think governments are being too gutless to go into these huge big projects because they\u2019re looking after their mates \u2013 the multinationals, the big end of town that are making a lot of money out of the sacrifices of people themselves.\u201d The government is continuing to insist it has a mandate to pass the whole package, but Labor is still on the fence about what it will support. The Coalition\u2019s income tax package is divided into three parts: the first stage provides a tax offset to benefit low- and middle-income earners from 2019 to 2022; the second stage raises the 19% tax bracket threshold from $41,000 to $45,000 from 2022; and the third stage flattens tax brackets from 2024 so everyone earning between $45,000 to $200,000 would pay a marginal rate of 30%. While Labor has agreed to the first stage and is open to the second, so far it has balked at stage three, demanding to know how much of the tax cuts will flow to high-income earners in a bid to pressure the government to split the bill. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has written to the government seeking to quantify the total cost of the package and how much will flow to high income earners \u2013 people earning $180,000 or more. On Monday the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, brushed off questions from reporters about Labor\u2019s position on the package, saying the opposition first needed information from the government. \u201cWe\u2019re after some facts,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Ken Wyatt says he is \u201chopeful\u201d of finding a resolution to the copyright and licensing issues surrounding the Aboriginal flag, as politicians join the call for a solution. \u201cThe Aboriginal flag is a strong symbol for Aboriginal Australians and is respected by many non-Aboriginal Australians,\u201d the minister for Indigenous Australians said in a statement. \u201cMy hope is to find a way to respect the rights of the flag\u2019s creator and for the flag to continue to play a unifying role.\u201d Labor\u2019s spokesperson on Indigenous affairs, Linda Burney, said she had spoken with the minister and shared the view that \u201cwe need to find a way so that the flag remains the property of First Nations people\u201d. \u202cIn a social media video released last week, Burney said she has a tattoo of the flag on her left arm. \u201c\u202aThe Aboriginal flag is an important symbol to Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians alike. \u201cThe controversy around it at the moment are difficult and often legalistic issues,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope that we can find a resolution to the present issue.\u201d Federal MP Bob Katter said he had written to the prime minister requesting the government claim copyright ownership of the Aboriginal flag. \u201cIt is outrageous that this great symbol which is respected throughout Australia has been used for commercial gain as is the case currently with the Queensland non-Indigenous, privately owned organisation which currently owns the clothing licence,\u201d Katter said in a statement. A leading copyright lawyer has suggested the federal government could buy the rights from Harold Thomas so the design could be made public. The former CEO of the Australian Copyright Council, Fiona Phillips, said the legal status of the Aboriginal flag was a \u201cunique situation\u201d that required a public policy solution. \u201cThe Aboriginal flag is not just an artistic work, it\u2019s a national symbol and is particularly important to Indigenous Australians,\u201d said Phillips, who has also worked at the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and as a government adviser on copyright law. A spokesperson for Wam Clothing, which has worldwide exclusive rights to reproduce the flag on clothing, said it welcomed anyone, \u201cincluding the government, to contact us with respect to the use of the Aboriginal flag under our licence\u201d. Copyright of the flag rests with its designer, Luritja artist Harold Thomas, after the federal court found he was the sole copyright owner in 1997. Thomas entered into a number of licensing arrangements over the years, most recently with the non-Indigenous-owned company Wam Clothing in November 2018. Last week Wam Clothing sent notice to at least one company, the Aboriginal-owned social enterprise Spark Health, to stop producing clothing featuring the design. Spark Health produced a range called \u201cClothing the gap\u201d, the profits from which go towards Aboriginal health education programs. Spark Health said it was currently seeking legal advice. Wam Clothing is part-owned by Queensland businessman Ben Wooster, who has had a long association with Harold Thomas, as a licensee of the flag. A spokesperson for Wam Clothing said the company \u201chas a strong desire to promote the Aboriginal flag in a positive light\u201d, and \u201chas been actively inviting any organisations, manufacturers and sellers who wish to use the Aboriginal flag on clothing to contact us and discuss their options\u201d. Wooster was sole owner of Birubi Art, a now-defunct company found by the federal court to have \u201cmade false or misleading representations that products it sold were made in Australia and hand-painted by Australian Aboriginal persons, in breach of the Australian consumer law\u201d. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is seeking a $2m to $2.5m penalty against Birubi Art, to signify the \u201cserious cultural harm\u201d done by fake Aboriginal art. These harms were \u201cgrave and far-reaching\u201d and involved \u201cnot just direct economic loss but a weakening of the value of the authentic products\u201d and an \u201cerosion of consumer confidence in the entire sector\u201d, the ACCC told the court. Katter acknowledged the problems arising from ownership by the government and suggested the rights be handed to a respected body. He also said a legal situation should be avoided where anyone at all could use the flag. \u201cI specifically reference one example where the Aboriginal flag was used in a nefarious way by an American racist organisation that had branches in Australia,\u201d Katter\u2019s statement said.",

It was some of the best ball-striking I\u2019ve had in a tournament. Unfortunately I wasn\u2019t able to make the putts, but Gary did, and hats off to him! That was a cool way to see him finish it off, and go out in style like that. I thought we had a ball game early on! We closed the gap, got it to within three going into the last nine, but I made bogey and missed a few putts. But I\u2019m pleased with the way I played, and I don\u2019t regret anything. I gave my heart out, and it just wasn\u2019t good enough this week. The Open will be awesome, and special for Rick [his caddie] to play in his home town. It\u2019ll be a fun week and I\u2019m really looking forward to it.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d06f2b18f08532f138d2f02\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-17T01:57:49.117Z\">2.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>More from Woodland. </strong>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what to say! I probably feel more nervous now than I was all day today. I really felt good all week. We\u2019ve been preparing for this, we\u2019ve worked hard. I\u2019ve hit the golf ball pretty good for a long time, but the short game\u2019s just taken pressure off the ball striking, and the putting is taking pressure off everything. When I can do that, it adds up to a pretty good week. I was trying to enjoy the moment. It\u2019s obviously uncomfortable to be in the lead at a major, but I am trying to enjoy being uncomfortable! I tried to enjoy the pressure, and really thrived on it. Rosey\u2019s a good buddy, so playing with him helped me. And Koepka, what he\u2019s done lately is unbelievable. He got off to a hot start, and I was just trying to keep that cushion.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d06f1c68f08374cc578f5e7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-17T01:53:11.320Z\">2.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The new champion on those three signature shots. </strong>\u201cThe drive on 14 was huge. I slipped a little bit, realised my footwork was off, so I refocused. I hit a great second shot there. We played to win, I could have laid up. But we decided to hit 3-wood, and my caddie gave me a lot of confidence there. That birdie kind of separated me a bit. I had the chip on 17 earlier this week, it\u2019s the second time I\u2019ve got it up and down. But I was just trying to get it over the hump, and take four if I had to. I was just trying to eliminate the big number. It came off perfectly. I didn\u2019t allow myself to dream, I never got ahead. Once the putt on 18 went in, I let it come out of me, it\u2019s special to win here at Pebble Beach.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d06f1058f08532f138d2efe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-17T01:49:45.525Z\">2.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Then the Jack Nicklaus Gold Medal and the US Open Trophy goes to Gary Woodland!</strong> The medal round his neck, he raises the famous old cup aloft; the gallery does its thing.

The chip on the 17th green, so delicately played when nerves must have been jangling, to set up a kick-in par when bogey was a distinct possibility? Or that putt across 18, allowing him to finally celebrate a deserved victory? How about all three?

Two putts, and the 2013 winner ends the day at -7 after a very disappointing final round of 74. But despite his own personal misery, Rose smiles broadly, genuinely, to congratulate the new champion! He hugs Woodland, who finally allows himself to celebrate.

Meanwhile Aaron Wise - who was right in the mix after his weekday work of 66 and 71, only to fall away spectacularly yesterday, shooting 79 in the penultimate group - has come out with a devil-may-care attitude now his US Open dream is over.

But recently something\u2019s clicked. A tie for sixth at last year\u2019s PGA - in which he held the 36-hole lead - was followed by a good showing at Augusta this April and a tie for eighth at the PGA last month. Throw in victory at last year\u2019s Phoenix Open, as intense an event as you\u2019ll get on the regular Tour, and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s been in top form for some time.</p> \n  <p><strong>He\u2019s been magnificent so far this week. </strong>That record-equalling 65 on Friday, of course. But what about his chip-in at 12 and monster putt on 14 yesterday, saving precious pars when all looked lost? Or the way he\u2019s plotted his way around Pebble Beach, a track where booming drives are not the be-all and end-all? His calm demeanour? His resilience? His clutch putting? His heat-seeking approach play? He\u2019d be a worthy winner of the 119th United States Open Championship.</p> \n  <p><strong>Only problem is, this is the first time he\u2019s led a major after 54 holes. </strong>Pressure ahoy! And he\u2019s got some big names on his tail. Justin Rose, the 2013 champion, has been making an absurd amount of one-putts, the sort of behaviour that wins US Opens. And he looks happy and relaxed. Louis Oosthuizen, the 2010 Open winner, is refusing to give up the chase, and is known for his final-day birdie blitzes in the majors. Rory McIlroy, the 2011 winner, isn\u2019t out of the hunt and is due a special round this week.</p> \n  <p><strong>And then there\u2019s Brooks Koepka, bidding to become the first person to three-peat in the US Open since Willie Anderson in 1905.</strong> \u201cI enjoy the pressure,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s fun for me.\u201d Clearly. Who\u2019d bet against him?! Factor in the uber-determined Chez Reavie and Matt Kuchar, plus a fair few other big names who\u2019ll consider themselves within striking distance should Woodland and Rose have a bad day and come back towards the pack, and we\u2019ve got quite the experience ahead of us. It\u2019s the US Open! It\u2019s the final round! It could go to a two-hole play-off!

      "bodyText": "So in the end, Gary Woodland won his first major by three shots from the two-time defending champ Brooks Koepka. Congratulations to Gary; commiserations to Brooks, Justin, Xander, Justin et al. Next year the US Open pitches up at Winged Foot; next month our attention switches to the Open at Portrush. Hope to see you here for those. Thanks for reading. Nighty night! -13: Woodland -10: Koepka -7: Schauffele, Rahm, Reavie, Rose -6: Scott, Oosthuizen -5: Stenson, Hadley, McIlroy -4: Hovland (a), Fitzpatrick, Wallace, Willett -3: Simpson, Molinari, An, McDowell, Kuchar -2: Casey, Prugh, Woods, Day, Hatton, Matsuyama, Cantlay -1: Straka, Lowry, Furyk, Lashley E: Kinhult, Reed, Horschel And now a word with the vanquished champion, the two-time winner Brooks Koepka. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of my defence, I played good the whole week. It was some of the best ball-striking I\u2019ve had in a tournament. Unfortunately I wasn\u2019t able to make the putts, but Gary did, and hats off to him! That was a cool way to see him finish it off, and go out in style like that. I thought we had a ball game early on! We closed the gap, got it to within three going into the last nine, but I made bogey and missed a few putts. But I\u2019m pleased with the way I played, and I don\u2019t regret anything. I gave my heart out, and it just wasn\u2019t good enough this week. The Open will be awesome, and special for Rick [his caddie] to play in his home town. It\u2019ll be a fun week and I\u2019m really looking forward to it.\u201d More from Woodland. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what to say! I probably feel more nervous now than I was all day today. I really felt good all week. We\u2019ve been preparing for this, we\u2019ve worked hard. I\u2019ve hit the golf ball pretty good for a long time, but the short game\u2019s just taken pressure off the ball striking, and the putting is taking pressure off everything. When I can do that, it adds up to a pretty good week. I was trying to enjoy the moment. It\u2019s obviously uncomfortable to be in the lead at a major, but I am trying to enjoy being uncomfortable! I tried to enjoy the pressure, and really thrived on it. Rosey\u2019s a good buddy, so playing with him helped me. And Koepka, what he\u2019s done lately is unbelievable. He got off to a hot start, and I was just trying to keep that cushion.\u201d The new champion on those three signature shots. \u201cThe drive on 14 was huge. I slipped a little bit, realised my footwork was off, so I refocused. I hit a great second shot there. We played to win, I could have laid up. But we decided to hit 3-wood, and my caddie gave me a lot of confidence there. That birdie kind of separated me a bit. I had the chip on 17 earlier this week, it\u2019s the second time I\u2019ve got it up and down. But I was just trying to get it over the hump, and take four if I had to. I was just trying to eliminate the big number. It came off perfectly. I didn\u2019t allow myself to dream, I never got ahead. Once the putt on 18 went in, I let it come out of me, it\u2019s special to win here at Pebble Beach.\u201d Then the Jack Nicklaus Gold Medal and the US Open Trophy goes to Gary Woodland! The medal round his neck, he raises the famous old cup aloft; the gallery does its thing. Time for an interview, and how does Gary Woodland, 2019 US Open champion sound? \u201cIt sounds really really good, I like that!\u201d A huge smile of childlike joy plays across his face. It\u2019s a lovely moment. First up, the silver medal for low amateur is awarded to Viktor Hovland of Norway. He\u2019s going to turn professional tomorrow. Not a bad way to bow out from the amateur scene. And having broken the low-scoring record for an amateur at a US Open to boot: 280. He finished the week at -4. We\u2019ll be hearing from him again soon, I\u2019ll be bound. Before today, Woodland had previously held the 54-hole lead at seven tournaments ... and not won a single one of them. Not a bad time to break your duck. It makes his steely demeanour this afternoon, and steadfast refusal to buckle at any point, even more impressive than it already is. What a performance! And he\u2019s about to pick up the trophy he so richly deserves. That was a wonderful round of golf by Gary Woodland. He attacked when he could, played it safe when he needed to, and always selected - then executed - the smart play. It\u2019s difficult to decide what the signature shot of the round of Woodland\u2019s life was. The 3-wood at 15 to set up birdie that put two-time defending champion behind the eight-ball? The chip on the 17th green, so delicately played when nerves must have been jangling, to set up a kick-in par when bogey was a distinct possibility? Or that putt across 18, allowing him to finally celebrate a deserved victory? How about all three? He\u2019s a very worthy winner of the 119th United States Open Championship! Woodland raises both arms in triumph after his successful putt and allows himself a punch of the air. But he quietens his celebrations down quickly enough, because his partner Justin Rose has to finish up. Two putts, and the 2013 winner ends the day at -7 after a very disappointing final round of 74. But despite his own personal misery, Rose smiles broadly, genuinely, to congratulate the new champion! He hugs Woodland, who finally allows himself to celebrate. Like Graeme McDowell on this green nine years ago, he looks in something of a daze ... but he\u2019s soon smiling broadly as he hugs his mom, then his dad ... the perfect gift on Fathers\u2019 Day! As Woodland makes his way to the green, the gallery at 18 rises as one to acclaim America\u2019s new champion-elect. The job isn\u2019t quite complete yet, of course, so while Woodland politely acknowledges them with a wave of his cap, he doesn\u2019t crack a smile yet. This is the steely attitude that got him into this position in the first place. He\u2019s been immense today. Woodland three putts to win. But he only needs one! He trundles it in for birdie, and Gary Woodland is the 2019 US Open champion! -13: Woodland -10: Koepka Woodland sends his third into the middle of the green from 146 yards. He\u2019s got three putts from 30 feet for the US Open! Woodland sends a crisp iron down the right of the fairway. He\u2019s taking no chances with the Pacific Ocean out on the left. He carefully draws his second around the big tree and into the centre of the fairway. No point at trying to swashbuckle your way down the last with a two-shot lead; look at what happened to poor old Jean van de Velde at Carnoustie all those years ago when he tried to win the 1999 Open \u201clike d\u2019Artagnan\u201d. Back on 18, Koepka\u2019s putt dies to the right. Also expiring, surely, his dreams of becoming only the second player to win three consecutive US Opens, since Willie Anderson completed in 1905 what was almost certainly not contemporaneously referred to as a three-peat. He signs for a 68, and will most likely become the first player in US Open history to post four rounds in the sixties - 69, 69, 68, 68 - yet not win the title. Woodland tidies up at 17 for his amazing par, and he\u2019s just got to take things easy up the last. The US Open Trophy is within touching distance for the 35-year-old from Kansas! -12: Woodland (17) -10: Koepka (F) Koepka\u2019s chip from the second cut at 18 comes out soft. For a second it looks like it\u2019s going to stop well short of the flag, but there\u2019s just enough energy in the ball for it to trickle to ten feet. But he really needs to make that. Although it might not make much difference, because Woodland chips crisply off the green, over the mound in his way, and lands the ball on the downslope. A little check, and it rolls out to three feet. That is quite delicious, and it\u2019s surely going to be the shot that won this US Open! Koepka whips a long iron into the 18th from 230 yards. It lands on the portion of the green near the flag, back left, but takes a hot bounce and goes through the back. He\u2019s just in the second cut. He\u2019ll have a chip for eagle, but birdie is the realistic best outcome. Back on 17, Woodland draws his 5-iron ... and hits a very nervy one into the green, short and right. \u201cInto the green\u201d sounds OK, but the green is hourglass-shaped, and there\u2019s no direct route from where his ball has ended up to the pin. A chance he\u2019ll have to chip it from there. This isn\u2019t over quite yet. Woodland paces around his 30-foot birdie putt. There\u2019s a gentle right-to-left break on it. And he reads the line perfectly. If only he\u2019d given it one extra joule of energy, it\u2019d have been in. But par will more than suffice in these circumstances. Up on 18, par for Oosthuizen, who like Rose let his challenge slip after the turn. He\u2019s -6. Then McIlroy, who never got going at all, makes birdie for a 72. He ends the week at -5 ... and it\u2019s yet another top-ten finish in a major. But the five-year wait for number five goes on. Woodland simply refuses to put a foot wrong. His tee shot at 16 has found a divot, but that\u2019s happened twice already this week, and on both occasions he\u2019s made birdie. This time he\u2019s not seeking out the flag, merely the middle of the green, the safe play. And the middle of the green\u2019s what he finds. It\u2019s probably down to Koepka to force a mistake by making at least a birdie down 18, an eagle if at all possible. He starts this quest by lashing a 3-wood down the track. Koepka likes to play fast, but he takes his time over this 25-footer on 17. He really needs it. But he doesn\u2019t hit it, an uncharacteristically weak putt from the two-time champion. He\u2019ll stay two behind Woodland, who sends another stinger down the centre of the fairway, at 16. Meanwhile a birdie at the last for the 2010 champion here at Pebble Beach, Graeme McDowell. He signs for a 72, a slightly disappointing final round. But it\u2019s been a good week, and he ends it -3 overall. Only Koepka has a chance to deny Woodland now. He launches a 4-iron into the middle of 17, and will have a 25-foot look at birdie. Back on 15, Woodland\u2019s birdie putt from 20 feet turns to the right at the last. Just a par. Just! It\u2019s all he needs right now. Bogey for Rose, his fourth since the 8th hole. He\u2019s dropping right back into the pack. -12: Woodland (15) -10: Koepka (16) -7: Schauffele (F), Rahm (F), Reavie (16), Rose (15) Woodland finds the heart of the 15th green. He\u2019s hit 12 out of 15 greens in regulation. This is how you win US Opens. Rose finds more sand with his second, and can\u2019t splash out close. His game has collapsed since the turn. A 68 meanwhile for Jon Rahm, and he ends his week at -7, in a tie for fourth. Woodland continues to saunter around Pebble Beach like he\u2019s out for his Sunday constitutional. He\u2019s a study in nonchalance. Under the circumstances - he\u2019s chasing his first major, for goodness sake - this is quite incredible to watch. He made birdies when the chances were there, early in the round; since hitting the tougher stretch, he\u2019s scrambled with cool determination. Unless the jitters start to hit him, or if he starts dreaming about wrapping his arms around the US Open Trophy too early, all signs today suggest he\u2019ll close this out. He sends a stinger down the centre of 16, while Rose pulls his drive into sand on the left. Koepka meanwhile reaches 16 in two, but faced with a big right-to-left curler, can\u2019t convert for birdie from 30 feet. Woodland doesn\u2019t really commit to his chip. He nervously flops his ball out to six feet, but that\u2019s not a gimme. He marks. Rose paces around his 18-footer. He really needs this one. But his putter\u2019s been so cold. There\u2019s a big left-to-right swing on it. And he misses it on the low side. No birdie for Rose, whose dreams are slipping away. Especially as Woodland knocks in his birdie effort! Ice-cool. -12: Woodland (14) -10: Koepka (15) -8: Rose (14) Woodland draws his 3-wood back ... and fizzes an arrow straight at the flag! It makes it over the bunker guarding the front of the green - just - and settles in the long grass to the left. He\u2019s 15 feet from the flag! A chance to bump in for eagle, but a really fine opportunity for birdie. Could that be the decisive blow in this year\u2019s US Open? Rose is on the green in three, with a 20-footer left for his birdie. Up on 15, Koepka does what he has to do and secures his par. -11: Woodland (13) -10: Koepka (15) -8: Rose (13) -7: Schauffele (F), Reavie (15) Trouble for Koepka down 15, as he sails an iron from the tee into deep filth along the right. He might have no route in, with a tree in the road. Ah but! He does have a path to the green. From 150 yards, he lashes into the heart of the green and just about holds the putting surface, though he\u2019s a way from the flag. A left-to-right 40-footer is what\u2019s left. The best he could do. But he races the putt eight feet past. This is a huge putt coming up, because Woodland is in prime position in the centre of the par-five 14th fairway. Par for Xander Schauffele at the last, and he\u2019s signing for a fine round of 67. It could have been so much better as well. But that\u2019s yet another high finish in a major for the 25-year-old from San Diego. He\u2019s got the game to reel in a big one soon enough. He\u2019s the current clubhouse leader at -7. His partner Adam Scott ends with a 68; now that one really could have been a whole lot better. Flaying that one out of bounds on 13 scuppered his hopes. He finishes at -6, having given up four shots in the last six holes. Koepka gets up and down from the curly kale to the left of 14. Only a par, but that didn\u2019t look on the cards when his approach was sailing off towards danger. Back on 13, Woodland is so close to draining his 30-footer from the fringe, a lovely touch that guarantees his par. But Rose can\u2019t get up and down from the sand, and it\u2019s beginning to look like this won\u2019t be his year. His putter\u2019s cold today. That\u2019s three shots gone in the last six holes. All the one-putts of the first three days are very much a thing of the past. -11: Woodland (13) -10: Koepka (14) -8: Rose (13) Koepka takes his medicine and chips back out onto the fairway at 14. Another reason to love Brooks: he plays quickly, flatly refusing to make a drama out of every decision. But then from the centre of the fairway, he tugs his wedge left, onto the bank to the left of the green. His ball disappears in a world of rough. Back on 13, Rose slam-dunks his second from the fairway into greenside sand, while Woodland lashes from the rough and onto the green. His ball squeaks through and onto the fringe at the back, but from where he was, that was delightful. A bit of luck with his lie after the wild drive, but he\u2019s grabbed it with both hands and is now in prime position to salvage this. He\u2019s been absolutely sensational today, a scrapping masterclass since Pebble Beach has started to bear its teeth. This is a proper US Open now. Pars at a premium. Woodland flays a dreadful drive at 13 towards Scott Land. Gary\u2019s ball doesn\u2019t fly out of bounds like Adam\u2019s did earlier, but that\u2019s a wild one, miles wide of the fairway. He might have got lucky with the lie, because he\u2019s so far wide the ground has been trodden down. Still. Rose finds the fairway. But up on 14, Koepka\u2019s drive finds thick grass down the right. A whole lot of struggling going on at the minute. Woodland can\u2019t escape this time. His par putt is always staying on the high side, and he makes bogey for only the fourth time this week. Rose can\u2019t get up and down from sand, clipping out to four feet but letting his dribbly downhill putt slip away to the right. He doesn\u2019t look on his game today. Those were the par savers he was making every other hole yesterday. Meanwhile Schauffele can\u2019t make his par at 17; his chip was gorgeous, but his putter let him down from four feet. And then there were three. -11: Woodland (12) -10: Koepka (13) -9: Rose (12) -7: Schauffele (17), Reavie (13) -6: Scott (17), Rahm (15), McIlroy (14) How quickly the mood music can change. Koepka is able to go for the green from the sand at 13, and takes his opportunity with both hands, whipping an iron from 160 yards to 15 feet. He can\u2019t guide the big left-to-right breaker into the cup for birdie, but par will do. Woodland meanwhile sends an awful tee shot into the par-three 12th, in tousled hell to the right and behind a bunker. He does extremely well to whip out onto the green, but he\u2019s left with a 20-footer to save his par. Viktor Hovland wins the low amateur medal! His record-breaking total of 280 does the job, as his nearest challenger Brandon Wu shoots 74 today, ending five shots back at +1. What a way for Hovland to end his amateur career; he\u2019ll be turning professional tomorrow. Hovland joins a select group with his victory today: past US Open low amateurs in recent years include Jordan Spieth, Patrick Cantlay, Matt Fitzpatrick and Jon Rahm. Rose\u2019s chip is no good. Ten feet short. Woodland\u2019s birdie effort is always dying off to the right, but it\u2019s a kick-in par. Rose then shows his grit once more by making the par saver. Another modest air punch; he\u2019s hanging on in there. But this is still looking good for Woodland, who is simply refusing to buckle, despite having had several opportunities today to do so. Koepka can\u2019t make his par putt on 12, then finds sand with his drive down 13, while Schauffele finds the thick rough to the side of 17, and the leader board looks like this: -12: Woodland (11) -10: Koepka (12), Rose (11) -8: Schauffele (16) A three-foot par putt for Adam Scott on 16. He yips it to the left and sends it ten feet past! That is astonishing. He does extremely well to gather himself and make the bogey putt coming back. But he\u2019s -7 now, and with holes running out, that might be his faint chances gone. Back on 11, Rose bashes towards the front of the green. His ball squeaks into the thick stuff, but from where he was, that\u2019s not too bad. However he\u2019ll still have work getting up and down for par. Then Woodland finds the heart of the green with a stunning power lob from the rough. He\u2019ll have a look at birdie from 25 feet! \u201cNo chance.\u201d That\u2019s Justin Rose\u2019s capsule review of his 3-wood from the 11th tee. It\u2019s in the middle of acres of filth down the right. Gary Woodland, having witnessed that, inexplicably unsheathes the driver and follows him in. Both will have their work cut out finding the green, unless they\u2019re very fortunate with their lies. Meanwhile up on 12, Brooks Koepka finds the big bunker at the front. He nearly hits the flagstick with his splash out, but the ball doesn\u2019t connect and flies 20 feet past. Bogey ahoy, unless he can do something special with the flat stick. A Mickelsonesque rush of blood on the 12th from Louis Oosthuizen. He slices wildly towards a camera tower on the right. His ball lands on the roof, and nearly careers out of bounds. He ends up behind the tower, so receives a free drop, but it\u2019s still a part of the course he really shouldn\u2019t be visiting, and he can\u2019t get up and down. Bogey, and at -6 the 2010 Open champion\u2019s race is run. Rose is OK, in so much as his ball hasn\u2019t toppled over the edge. But he is in a lot of tangled nonsense. He can only punch it up onto the green to ten feet. But he nails the par saver, and allows himself a little determined air punch by way of celebration. Woodland meanwhile has a downhill 45-footer for birdie. A nice lag so he can make his par is more realistic, and that\u2019s exactly what he does. He\u2019s playing some very careful, considered stuff out there. For a man who\u2019s never won a major, he\u2019s holding his nerve exceptionally well. So far. Uh-oh. Trouble for Rose, who sends his second at 10 towards the ocean on the right. Perhaps spooked, Woodland plays his second into the left-hand portion of the green, well away from the flag, but also well away from danger. Rose will be hoping his ball has snagged on the rough just before the cliff edge. All the while, up on 11, Koepka curls in his left-to-right birdie putt, and closes to within one! -12: Woodland (9) -11: Koepka (11) -10: Rose (9) The leaders reach the turn ... so please may we welcome you to the Business End of the 2019 US Open! Rose and Woodland bash their drives down the middle of 10, while Koepka sends a wedge over the flag at 11 and spins it back to ten feet. The fight is on! Koepka is one turn away from rolling in his 25-foot birdie putt on 10. He waves his putter around in great frustration. But a chink of light appears from the direction of the 9th green, where Woodland fails to hit his par putt, prodding nervously at the ball, and that\u2019s his first bogey of the day, and only his third of the entire week. His sensational third shot didn\u2019t deserve that; his first, second and fourth however did. Par for Rose. -12: Woodland (9) -10: Koepka (10), Rose (9) -8: Scott (14), Schauffele (14) Woodland is hitting three into the green from 168 yards. He\u2019s in trouble. But he arrows a quite outstanding iron into the heart of the green, and he\u2019ll have a ten-foot uphill putt to save his par. Holding the green at all wasn\u2019t certain from there, so what control! Meanwhile birdies for Schauffele and Scott (both -8) at 14. Woodland\u2019s chasing his maiden major, though, and the nerves are bound to jangle at some point. He\u2019s been cool as a stick of cucumber in a delicious tumbler of gin, but now he\u2019s given himself quite a poser on 9, sending his tee shot into the gallery down the left. Instead of nestling on trodden-down grass, the ball takes a break back inside off someone\u2019s bag/head and into the thick stuff. And he can only hack back out on the fairway. He\u2019s not the only one in bother, though, as Oosthuizen\u2019s travails down 10 lead to double bogey. He drops to -7. After the birdie-blitz antics of the first seven holes, this is turning into a classic US Open grind now. Which is probably why Koepka - on the 10th in regulation, after two determined shots - fancies his chances. Majors don\u2019t begin until the back nine on Sunday. So they say. Well, here we are, pretty much. It\u2019s beginning to look like Gary Woodland\u2019s US Open to lose, though Brooks Koepka is on record saying he\u2019d have been quite happy to be within three of the lead when teeing it up on 10. So have a little look-see at this! -13: Woodland (8) -10: Koepka (9), Rose (8) -9: Oosthuizen (9) -7: Scott (13), Schauffele (13), Stenson (12), Rahm (12), Reavie (9) -5: Wallace (13), Willett (11), Hadley (10), McIlroy (9) Koepka does exceptionally well to get up and down from the fringe at 9 to salvage his par. He turns in 32. Woodland takes two careful putts for par at 8. Rose can\u2019t get up and down from the rough; bogey. And on 10, Oosthuizen finds sand from the tee, then sends his second into awful rubbish down the left. Par is beginning to look like a pipe dream. Speaking of which, Scott had to reload on the 13th tee, and ended up with a double-bogey six. He crashes back to -7, so much of his good work undone in one foul swish of the big stick. This is beginning to look very promising for Gary Woodland as he chases his first major title. He\u2019s not made a misstep yet. Tiger may not have repeated his Pebble Beach cakewalk of 2000, but he\u2019s in a pretty good mood after coming home in 32. Happy enough to join Phil Mickelson in giving the USGA some credit for the way the links has been playing. \u201cThe week\u2019s been fantastic. It\u2019s nice to have the golf course set up fair again. It could be had, or you could get hammered. So well done!\u201d Oosthuizen reaches the turn in 33. He\u2019s been quiet since those birdies at 1 and 4, but pars are valuable currency at a US Open. He remains at -9. Woodland finds the tricky 8th in regulation, but it\u2019s a poor second by Rose, who sends his 7-iron into thick stuff front right. And back up on 9, Koepka shoves another approach to the right, toying dangerously with the rocks cascading down to the Pacific Ocean. But his ball holds the fringe on the right. He\u2019s become a little loose since missing that short birdie putt on 7. Woodland by comparison is the calmest man in California right now. There\u2019s nobody quite like Tiger Woods. He was a shell of himself through the first six holes, four over for his round. Since then, he\u2019s birdied 7, 8, 13, 14, 16 and now 18, and that\u2019s a 69, his best of the week! It\u2019s also his lowest final round at a US Open for ten years. He finishes his week at -2, the love pouring down from the stands. Even when he\u2019s nowhere near winning, the great man can still find ways to electrify the galleries. Can\u2019t wait to see him tackle Portrush! Adam Scott - six under for his round and with the wind in his sail - has just sent a huge slice out of bounds down the right of 13. Oh Adam. Back on 7, Woodland makes his par save, and that\u2019s some escape after a very nervy tee shot. Par for Rose too, albeit a much less dramatic one. -13: Woodland (7) -11: Rose (7) -10: Koepka (8) -9: Scott (12), Oosthuizen (8) Woodland sends a hot one through the short par-three 7th and into a pot bunker at the back. He splashes out well, given he\u2019s right up against the face, but doesn\u2019t want to leave himself a downhill putt so he gives it plenty of welly. Over the flag it goes, and he\u2019s left with a ten-footer coming back for his par. Koepka meanwhile cleans up at 8 and that\u2019s his first bogey in his last 36 holes. Given the nonsense he made of that hole, that\u2019s a pretty good result for the champion. Woodland\u2019s lob wedge up to the 6th green is no good. Way too strong. He can\u2019t make the birdie putt coming back. Just the par. Rose\u2019s eagle putt shaves the hole; birdie. He closes the gap between the pair to two, joining Koepka at -11. Though the champ won\u2019t be staying there long, because his second into 8 found the hazard on the right. He was able to chop out, but only into a bunker. However, he splashes out to four feet, and should limit the damage. The 21-year-old amateur Viktor Hovland birdies the last, and that\u2019s a 67. He\u2019s just posted the lowest 72-hole score by an amateur in US Open history - 280 - yet at -4 still isn\u2019t sure of the low-amateur medal. That\u2019s because Brandon Wu is currently -2 through 13. We\u2019ll keep our eyes peeled for that. Meanwhile birdie for Scott at 12, the result of a tee shot bundled into the front of the green and up to four feet. He\u2019s -9. Koepka passes up a huge opportunity to halve Woodland\u2019s lead. He screws his wedge at the short, iconic par-three 7th to six feet ... but pushes his birdie putt wide right. He gets the one coming back, but that\u2019s a rare mistake with the flat stick from the reigning champ. Meanwhile back on 6, Rose finds the green in two big booms, and will take a look at eagle from 25 feet. But Woodland looks in total control of his game and his emotions right now. Two easy strokes up the hole, and while he\u2019s not reached the green yet, he\u2019s not far away and an up-and-down for birdie looks very much on the cards the way he\u2019s been playing today. The way he\u2019s been playing all week. Bogey for Stenson at 9. He\u2019s still out in 33, but the 2016 Open champion can\u2019t afford that. He slips to -6, now seven off Woodland\u2019s lead. -13: Woodland (5) -11: Koepka (6) -10: Rose (5) -9: Oosthuizen (7) -8: Scott (11), Schauffele (10) -7: Rahm (9) -6: Stenson (9), McIlroy (7), Reavie (6) Koepka takes a little too much sand and is fortunate that his ball makes it over the face of the bunker and the tufts of rough, and onto the green. But it\u2019s there, and he\u2019ll have a putt from 20 feet for birdie. But he doesn\u2019t give it enough. Par, and a good birdie chance goes by. Par for Oosthuizen at 7, though his 30-foot birdie effort is a cigarette paper away from dropping. And pars for Rose and Woodland at 5, neither man\u2019s mid-range birdie putts ever looking like dropping. Woodland sends his tee shot into the middle of the par-three 5th. He\u2019s where Koepka was for his birdie. Rose follows him, a couple of feet outside. So he\u2019ll be giving Woodland a teach. Up on 6, Koepka\u2019s second slam-dunks into the sand to the right of the green, but refuses to plug, a good break for the champ. And on the tiny 7th, McIlroy nearly spins his wedge back into the cup for a hole-in-one, but he\u2019ll have to settle for birdie. He\u2019s back where he started, at -6, and will be cursing the 2nd hole right now. No ... though he\u2019s so unfortunate. It\u2019s a gentle right-to-left slider, and Rose looks to have got the pace and line exactly right. But it drifts a couple of millimetres left on the last turn, and horseshoes out at slow speed. Par. And it\u2019s par for Oosthuizen at the par-five 6th, the opportunity lost when his approach disappeared into greenside rough. Unable to control the chip out, he couldn\u2019t get close. Meanwhile birdies at 10 for Scott and Schauffele, and this really is a quite sensational leader board! -13: Woodland (4) -11: Koepka (5) -10: Rose (4) -9: Oosthuizen (6) -8: Scott (10), Schauffele (10) -7: Stenson (8), Rahm (8) Woodland takes iron off the tee at the short par-four 4th, then sends his second to the back of the green. Nowhere near the pin, but there\u2019s no need to force it right now. Especially as Rose, in going for the green with driver, finds tangled rough to the left, a bunker in between his ball and the flag. Rose is forced to lash through the grass and lob high ... and he does so very neatly. His ball drops softly below the hole, and he\u2019ll have a straight uphill 20-footer for birdie. Woodland has a 35-foot downhill dribbler to deal with. And he judges it almost perfectly, the ball stopping just to the right of the hole. A no-bother par. Can Rose make his birdie and close the gap? Rose is left with a downhill 20-footer. It stops one dimple short of the hole. So frustrating for the 2013 champion, especially as Woodland converts his birdie chance from five feet. Birdie for Matt Wallace at 8, the reward for a fine 30-foot right-to-left curler. That\u2019s his third birdie in six holes, and he\u2019s -6. Up on 9, Scott and Schauffele pepper the flag with outrageous second shots, and the simple birdie putts take them both to -7. And Koepka races in his birdie putt on 5! This might not be typical US Open scoring ... but it is a whole lot of fun. -13: Woodland (3) -11: Koepka (5) -10: Rose (3) -9: Oosthuizen (5) -7: Scott (9), Schauffele (9), Stenson (7), Rahm (7) A good up and down from a tight spot to the side of 5 by Oosthuizen. He stays at -9. Coming behind is Koepka, who whips a 7-iron into the centre of the green. He\u2019ll have an uphill birdie putt from 20 feet. Meanwhile on 3, the leader Woodland sticks another approach close. He\u2019ll have a look at another birdie that\u2019d give him a three-shot advantage. Rose is on in two, but a good distance outside his rival. Koepka\u2019s ball control is something to behold. Another short wedge, this time at 4, lands 20 feet past the flag and spins back to five feet. He\u2019s got the thing on a length of string. In goes the putt, and the two-time champ means business here. This is golf right out of the top drawer. Meanwhile Henrik Stenson clips his tee shot at 7 to ten feet and rolls in the putt. That\u2019s three birdies in four holes, and he\u2019s -7, not out of this yet. Ditto Jon Rahm, who was half the distance inside his playing partner. -12: Woodland (2) -10: Koepka (4), Rose (2) -9: Oosthuizen (4) -7: Stenson (7), Rahm (7) The 2nd hole is one of the hardest on the course. Gary Woodland birdies it barely breaking sweat: driver, 7-iron at flag, putt. Meanwhile his partner Justin Rose, having just drawn level, sends his approach into greenside sand and he can\u2019t get up and down. Suddenly there\u2019s a two-shot lead at the top ... though the pack are closing in, with Louis Oosthuizen making birdie at 4. Right now, Xander Schauffele dropping a shot at 8, it looks like a four-horse race. Many furlongs to travel, mind you. -12: Woodland (2) -10: Rose (2) -9: Oosthuizen (4), Koepka (3) -6: Scott (8), Schauffele (8), Stenson (6), Rahm (6) -5: Wallace (7), McIlroy (4) Brooks Koepka is a sensation. Having wriggled his way out of bother on 2, he immediately gets back down to business at 3, wedging to kick-in distance from 80 yards. He\u2019ll move to -9, just a couple off the lead. Meanwhile on 4, McIlroy nearly chips in from the edge of the green for eagle. His ball hits the flagstick and somehow stays out. That could have perhaps reignited his bid. Birdie, but he\u2019s still just -5 and needs everything he can get. While Koepka was making his daft par - and that little girl\u2019s day - his playing partner Chez Reavie was making bogey. He slips to -6. Chesson Hadley and Matt Kuchar are also going the wrong way, having both earlier bogeyed that same hole. They\u2019re -4. Matt Wallace has responded to bogey at 2 with birdies at 3 and 6; he\u2019s -5. And the 2012 champion Webb Simpson is in with a 66, equalling Marcus Kinhult\u2019s best-of-day. He ends the week at -3. One of the moments of the week at 2. Koepka sends a massive slice towards loads of bother down the right. He hits a cart path, and his ball nearly bounces out of bounds. It stays in, but snags in thick rubbish. Even with his power, he can only gouge out to the other side of the hole, where there\u2019s more cabbage. He\u2019s in a lot of trouble. But then he plays one of the shots of the week, stabbing his ball from the lush rough into the green, and rolling up to three feet. He tidies up for one of the most adventurous pars you\u2019ll ever see. There\u2019s a reason he keeps winning these things. And as he wanders off, he picks out a little girl in the gallery and gives her the ball he\u2019s just crafted that escape with. Koepka gets a lot of stick for his supposed indifference to the punters, but that was a sweet and spontaneous moment of warmth, and the little girl wears a face of shocked wonder and awe. As far as she\u2019s concerned, Brooks Koepka has just hung the moon. Good old Brooks. Oh, he stays at -8, by the way. A solid start for the leader Gary Woodland, who reaches the 1st green in regulation and takes two careful putts for par. But he\u2019s got to share that lead now, because Justin Rose arrows his second to six feet, and strokes in the birdie putt. What a start for the 2013 champ! Meanwhile birdie for Rahm at 5. He\u2019s -6. There\u2019s going to be a lot of movement on the leader board in the next hour or so. -11: Rose (1), Woodland (1) -8: Oosthuizen (2), Koepka (1) -7: Schauffele (7), Reavie (1) -6: Scott (6), Rahm (5) Thanks Will. So I\u2019m back just in time to see McIlroy\u2019s race run. A miserable double on 2 and he drops to -4. Too much left to do. He\u2019ll always have Congressional, and Portrush is up next. His partner Oosthuizen is well in it, though, after tickling in a beautiful snaky putt from the back of 1. Adam Scott has eagled 6. Brooks Koepka opens up with as fuss-free a birdie as you\u2019ll ever witness. And Xander Schauffele has carded three birdies in a row, at 4, 5 and 6, to whizz up the standings. Let\u2019s take stock. -11: Woodland -10: Rose -8: Oosthuizen (2), Koepka (1) -7: Schauffele (6), Reavie (1) -6: Scott (6), Rahm (5) -5: Stenson (5), Willett (4) There\u2019s a brief \u201cWooooo!\u201d form someone in the crowd after McIlroy tees off. He just about misses the bunker but it\u2019s in some long grass just above the sand. He tries to get it out but sends the ball roughly a yard straight into the bunker. This is less than ideal. His third shot is lifted from one bunker to another when he sends it right of the green. Oosthuizen avoids all the issues and is on the green in two but gets the job done in four. McIlroy on the other hands is in a bit of a pickle and putts for a Bogey which has too much on it. Great news for absolutely everyone as Scott back mercifully. McIlroy is up for his first shot of the day, whacking one off the tee and straight down the fair to cheers of \u2018The King of the North\u2019. Louis Oosthuizen follows suit as both men start well. McIlroy holds his nerve with a par putt from 7ft. Casey polishes off 16 in his cap which looks like he has spent the morning painting someone\u2019s living room. The US military are using their money wisely by flying a helicopter around the course with a flag hanging out the back. Not a clue why. Speaking of Woods, he\u2019s missed a Birdie putt at 10. Hovland at 11 relies on gravity to take his ball into the hole but it just doesn\u2019t have enough gas. Reed is not snapping clubs today, instead he chips a lovely shot but it just does not have the accuracy. I have to say, this is a lovely photo. Good evening! I am here to tell you about the people who almost certainly will not win this, so many to choose from. You don\u2019t get runs like Hideki Matsuyama\u2019s sequence of 2-8-2 very often. It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s dropped just the one shot over those three holes, but that\u2019s what he\u2019s done. Birdies at the par-three 5th and 7th, sandwiching a triple-bogey eight at the par-five 6th. He\u2019s level par for the tournament now. Better news for Patrick Cantlay, though. Many people\u2019s dark horse for this tournament was always behind the eight-ball after his opening day 73, but he slowly worked his way back up the ladder and has started well today. Birdies at 3, 4 and now 7, and he\u2019s -4. And with that, I\u2019m off for a quick break before things start getting truly hectic. Will Unwin will take you in his loving arms and see you right. See you again soon! Jon Rahm starts with a birdie after tickling in a downhill 25-footer. He joins the group at -5, one that also now includes his partner today Henrik Stenson, who also birdies 1 after sticking his second to eight feet. A lot of players making hay over the opening seven holes. One exception: Dustin Johnson, who is busy staging an ersatz recreation of his total collapse here on Sunday in 2010. Bogey at 2, then double at 4, a short bogey putt yipped at the latter. No 2010-style triple yet, but there\u2019s time. He\u2019s crashed down to +1 already, one of the pre-tournament favourites totally kaput. -11: Woodland -10: Rose -7: Koepka, Reavie, Oosthuizen -6: McIlroy -5: Molinari (5), Stenson (1), Rahm (1), Kuchar, Hadley -4: Hovland -a- (9), Fitzpatrick (7), Scott (3), Schauffele (3), Wallace (1), Willett, McDowell Matt Fitzpatrick is making a move up the leader board with quiet stealth. Birdies at 4, 6 and 7 have elevated him to -4. The 24-year-old from Sheffield finished in a tie for 12th last year at Shinnecock Hills, and he\u2019s currently on his way to another high finish. \u201cIt is soon midnight here in Finland and the sun is shining bright,\u201d reports Raili Itavuori. \u201cPlease keep up your reporting and I will try to stay awake for as long as possible.\u201d People, let the teachings of Raili be a lesson to you all. We\u2019ve a long way to go. Aaron Wise finally made it home in 69 strokes. Yesterday\u2019s miserable 79 ruins an otherwise fantastic week, because he was right in the mix having shot 66-71 on the opening two rounds. A 69 for Andrew Putnam too. He finishes at +2 alongside Rory Sabbatini, who shot 70 today. A memorable week for the South Africa-born Slovakian, who aced 12 on Thursday and nearly did the same today. There have been 69s too for Kevin Kisner and Justin Walters. Sepp Straka finishes the week with a 67, having started it with a 68. He ends up at -1, a US Open debut to remember. Meanwhile birthday boy Jurgen Klopp Phil Mickelson finishes with a birdie, and that\u2019s a 72. He leaves the stage at +4. No career slam for Lefty, but one of the loudest ovations of the day nonetheless. And on 8, Tiger begins to piece together a preposterous round: having bogeyed four of the first six holes, it\u2019s now two birdies on the bounce after lashing his second at the extremely difficult 8th to four feet. He\u2019s +2, and there\u2019s nobody quite like him. The gallery around 7 explodes with joy, as Tiger drains a 15-foot putt for a much-needed birdie. He\u2019s +3. And the folk gathered up ahead at 8 nearly combust as Viktor Hovland very nearly holes his second from the fairway. What a class act this young man is! He\u2019s -4. An opening birdie for Xander Schauffele. And a third birdie in the first four holes for Molinari! Time for our first updated leader board, then. -11: Woodland -10: Rose -7: Koepka, Reavie, Oosthuizen -6: McIlroy -5: Molinari (4), Kuchar, Hadley -4: Hovland -a- (8), Schauffele (1), Willett, McDowell, Rahm, Stenson, Wallace Last year\u2019s runner-up Tommy Fleetwood has been a bit of a non-event this year, sad to say. This time 12 months ago he was going round in 63; today he\u2019s taken ten strokes more. He ends the week at +6, well down the field. Ah well, he\u2019ll always have Sunday at Shinnecock Hills. Tiger Woods is having a complete shocker today. His drive at the par-five 6th flies into the thick rough down the left. He whips out ... then leaves his wedge coming in short of the green. Another weak chip, followed by a pushed putt from eight feet, and that\u2019s a bogey on the easiest hole on the course this week. He\u2019s +4. But there\u2019s a fast start by Francesco Molinari, who adds to that birdie at 1 with another at 3. He rises to -4 and must be seriously ruing that double bogey, bogey finish on Friday. Viktor Hovland keeps on truckin\u2019. He screws his wedge at the 102-yard par-three 7th to 20 feet. Two putts and he remains at -3. On the one hand, this is an astonishing performance, however it ends. Then again, he won the 2018 US Amateur here, beating Devon Bling 6&amp;5, so you could say he\u2019s something of a Pebble Beach specialist. His opening-day 69 was testament to that. As Wu slips back, Hovland steps on the pedal! Birdie at 6, his third in four holes, and the Norwegian has taken early control of the battle for low amateur. It\u2019s not going to be as exhilarating as the tussle for the title, of course ... but it\u2019s not going to be far off! Hovland got as high as -4 on Thursday; he\u2019s just one stroke off reaching that mark again now. What quality in the amateur ranks this year. A shaky start for poor Wu. Having sent his second at 1 to 15 feet, it looks as though he\u2019s tickled in the putt for birdie. But the ball breaks off to the left, and he\u2019s got a testing four-footer coming back. He lets that one horseshoe out, and suddenly what looked for a millisecond like -3 is -1. Golf, dear friends, right there. A different sort of example is set out by the Scientist: Bryson DeChambeau, four under after 8, has since bogeyed 9, 10, 12 and 13, a birdie at 11 failing to lift the mood. He tumbles all the way back down the table to +2. It\u2019s three bogeys in the first five holes for Tiger. His tee shot bounces into the long stuff to the left of the green, and there\u2019s no safe route straight to the flag. He chips down, through the green and off the other side, from where he fails to get up and down. He\u2019s +3, and it really hasn\u2019t been a week to remember for one of the pre-tournament favourites. Scott Piercy and Francesco Molinari come down the 1st. Both make birdie in very different manners. Molinari splits the fairway and whips an iron to four feet; Piercy struggles his way up the hole and trundles in a chip from the rough. They both count the same. They\u2019re -3. A brisk start for the amateur Viktor Hovland as well: the 21-year-old Norwegian birdies 3 and 5, and he\u2019s -2. It looks like the battle for the low-amateur medal will be between Hovland and the 22-year-old Californian Brandon Wu, who starts out at -2 and has just creamed an iron down the centre of 1. Chandler Eaton, of the famous Duke University in North Carolina, is currently level par for his round through 10, but at +2 currently is very much the outside bet for the medal. Alex Prugh, a 34-year-old journeyman from Washington state, is playing in only his second US Open. His first, way back in 2007 at Oakmont, saw him miss the cut. His best round that week was 81. This time round, his efforts are altogether more rewarding: rounds of 75, 69 and 70, and now he\u2019s birdied 1, 3, 4 and 6 to rise to -2. With only one win to his name on the Nationwide Tour - the 2009 New Zealand Open - this is shaping up to be his most memorable performance as a pro. Here\u2019s to a strong finish. Sepp Straka shot a 68 on Thursday, and he\u2019s currently threatening to bookend his US Open with wonderful rounds. Having started out today with back-to-back bogeys, he\u2019s since birdied 3, 6, 7 and 12, and now eagled 14 after smashing a fairway wood from 264 yards to 30 feet, then draining the putt. The 26-year-old, who moved from his native Austria to the States when he was 14 and now represents the US, is the first Austrian-born player to earn a PGA Tour card, and only the second to tee it up at the US Open after Bernd Wiesberger - who, for the record, followed up yesterday\u2019s 78 with a 72, and ends the week +10, in 76th place out of 79. Straka, at -1, is set to do a whole lot better. Billy Horschel played his first major as a professional at Merion in the 2013 US Open, and held the 36-hole lead along with Phil Mickelson. He finished in a tie for fourth, and must have thought this lark was easy. To be fair, he did win the FedEx Cup the following year, but that romp around Merion remains his only top-ten finish at a major. The 32-year-old Floridian has a chance of righting that wrong today, if he posts something low, and he\u2019s going about things the right way, with birdies at 2, 5, 6 and 7 launching him up the standings to -3. He\u2019s currently tied for 14th, where one more birdie will catapult him into the top ten. Marcus Kinhult pars the last, and he\u2019s signing for a stunning 66. He finishes the week at level par, a mark that\u2019s an achievement at any US Open, and on debut too. What the leading pack would give for that later on. Meanwhile on 14, Aaron Wise is struggling his way up the track, wedging in his fourth from distance. He lands his ball 30 feet past the hole, and screws it back with pace. Into the hole it drops! What a thoroughly surreal birdie. He\u2019s +1. Tiger\u2019s struggles continue. A perfectly placed tee shot at 2. A short approach finds the green, but he\u2019s snookered himself behind the knuckle of a bunker, and so out comes the wedge. He chips gently to six feet, but then pulls the par putt, and that\u2019s two shots gone in the first two holes. He\u2019s +2, and 2000 seems ... well, is ... a long, long time ago. Rory Sabbatini made a hole-in-one on Thursday at 12. A two-bounce lash with a five-iron. Today he very nearly does it again, sending a gentle draw into the front of the green, chasing his ball up to a couple of feet. When a hole suits your eye, it suits your eye. Just like me and the 12th at Bramley. Another stuttering start by Tiger Woods. His iron at 1 finds the first cut down the right, then his approach snags some thicker stuff. A weak chip in, and that\u2019s an opening bogey that drops him back to +1. Meanwhile on 13, his old sparring partner Phil Mickelson looks like dropping a shot, only just on the green in three. Never mind, the gallery try to cheer him up with a lovely rendition of Happy Birthday to Yoooo-oooou. Perhaps mulling over the fact that he\u2019s passed up perhaps his last chance to win a US Open this week, at 49 on a course he loves so much, there\u2019s no trace of a smile, though you can tell he\u2019s trying to politely crack one. Oh Phil. It could break your heart. The 2012 champion Webb Simpson - whose fine win down the road at Olympic Club in San Francisco denied G-Mac a second title in three years - is busy turning an average week into a good one. An eagle at 6 followed by birdie at 7, and he whistles up the standings to level par. Two birdies in a row from the 2013 PGA champ Jason Dufner, at 3 and 4, and everyone\u2019s favourite Somnambulist is quietly mooching his way up the leader board to -1. And news of Rickie Fowler, who ground out a par on 1 after that wayward tee shot, and has just birdied 4 by raking one in from off the green. He\u2019s level par overall. Marcus Kinhult bounces straight back! Birdie on the second-hardest hole on the course, the long, hourglass-shaped and iconic par-three 17th. He cracks his tee shot to the back of the green, allowing the camber to gather his ball back towards the hole. He\u2019s got a ten-footer left, and in it goes. He\u2019s five-under for his round, and he could sell all this for ready money to one of the later starters, were that not strictly against the laws of both the USGA and the space-time continuum. He\u2019s level par. It couldn\u2019t continue: Marcus Kinhult makes his first bogey of the day at 16. He slips back to +1, but he\u2019s already done more than enough to show the way ahead for the chasing pack. Andrew Putnam returns to three under for his round after birdie at 11. Sepp Straka, the Austria-born American, is two under through 12, a return to the form that gave him an opening-day 68. And the ever-entertaining Patrick Reed won\u2019t be snapping any clubs over his knee like they were made out of wet balsa wood at the moment: he\u2019s followed up an opening bogey with birdies at 2, 3 and 6, and last year\u2019s Masters champ is two under for his round and +1 overall. Plenty of evidence that there are birdies out there, over the opening stretch especially. Here comes PR\u2019s Matt Kuchar, arriving on the premises carrying his own clubs. Probably a cost-cutting measure, hourly rates and all that, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s got a chap lined up for his round on an economically viable stipend. Currently at -5, Kuchar\u2019s one of the players who will be looking at the low scoring of Kinhult and licking his lips: if he can get off to a fast start, he might be able to put a bit of scoreboard pressure on the leaders. He\u2019ll also be looking to DeChambeau, who follows up his eagle at 6 with birdie at 8. He\u2019s four under today already, and -1 for the tournament. Another birdie for young Marcus Kinhult! The British Masters champion eases a wedge from 130 yards at 15 to three feet, and he\u2019s five under for his round today. That\u2019s whisked him all the way up the standings to level par, and his positive carry-on will give plenty of hope to plenty of folk further up the leader board, as they prepare to go out to face their destiny in the next couple of hours. Bryson DeChambeau could sell this later on for a few pretty pennies: a 25-foot rake across the par-five 6th green for eagle! That follows a birdie at 5, and the Scientist springs up the leader board to level par. Sergio\u2019s out, by the way, having ruined his slim chances of glory yesterday with a dismal 75. Birdie at 2, and he\u2019s moving in the right direction early on, level for the week as well. Rickie Fowler, a three-time runner-up in the majors, takes to the 1st tee in his trademark Sunday orange. Having shot that opening round of 66, he\u2019ll have harboured hopes of breaking that major duck, and shaking off the tag of Best Active Player Yet To Win A Major. But an awful second-day 77 put paid to that notion. As a result, he doesn\u2019t look particularly happy as he prepares to tee off, perhaps because he knows everyone\u2019s looking on feeling so desperately sorry for him. It\u2019s no surprise, then, when he sends his iron way right and into the deep stuff down the side of 1. Ah well, there\u2019s always Portrush. The romantic pound will be on Rory or G-Mac, of course, but few would begrudge the extremely likeable Fowler the Claret Jug. How about it, golfing gods? The first man out today makes it back to the clubhouse. It\u2019s the 17-year-old US amateur Michael Thorbjornsen, who has recovered from yesterday\u2019s experience-banking 84 by posting a most acceptable valedictory round of 76. His best work was done in the week, with rounds of 71 and 73, and the young man receives a very warm and supportive ovation indeed from the gallery at 18. Finishing the week at +20, he won\u2019t be winning the low-amateur medal, unless Chandler Eaton (+2), Viktor Hovland (E) and Brandon Wu (-2) have all decided to bunk off for the day. More on that scrap anon. But congratulations to Thorbjornsen, whose week at Pebble Beach will prove invaluable in the years to come. The weather today: much the same as yesterday. Overcast and gloomy, a little bit of wind, but nothing more dramatic than a gentle sea breeze. Some light rain in the morning has made the course receptive for the early starters. Just like yesterday, the greens will most likely firm up a tad as the day goes on, though that didn\u2019t stop the leading lights posting some red numbers in round three. The best hope for those in the chasing pack is psychological rather than meteorological: perhaps Gary Woodland and Justin Rose will drag each other down as the pressure tells. It\u2019s happened to the final group in a major often enough before. Then again, Sky analyst Paul McGinley reckons a third 65 of the week is out there for someone in the pack, and if they post a score, anything could happen. There\u2019ll be no career slam this week (or most likely ever) for Phil Mickelson. But the USGA\u2019s newest biggest fan looks in the mood to go out with a bang. Yesterday\u2019s 75 scuppered his faint hopes of getting his hands on that elusive US Open Trophy, but he\u2019s still putting on a show for his faithful fans. The birthday boy - 49 today - makes back-to-back birdies at 6 and 7, and he\u2019s +1 overall. Happy birthday, Lefty! Kinhult isn\u2019t the only one to have started fast this morning. Andrew Putnam, the 30-year-old from Washington state playing in his first US Open since missing the cut here at Pebble Beach in 2010, birdied 4, 6 and 7, though a dropped shot at 8 has taken a little shine off his efforts; he\u2019s +2. Meanwhile Aaron Wise - who was right in the mix after his weekday work of 66 and 71, only to fall away spectacularly yesterday, shooting 79 in the penultimate group - has come out with a devil-may-care attitude now his US Open dream is over. Birdies at 1, 2, 4 and 6, slightly offset by a bogey at 5, and he\u2019s three under for his round and back to level par for the championship. There\u2019s always one player who flies out of the blocks early doors on Sunday. The 22-year-old Swede Marcus Kinhult, recent winner of the British Masters, is playing in his first US Open. Rounds of 74, 70 and 74 ensured he was rising with the lark today, but he\u2019s taking advantage of the (comparatively) receptive early conditions, a little dew still slowing down the greens. Birdies at 1. 3. 6 and now 10, and he\u2019s four under for his round, whistling up the standings to +1 overall. It took a while for Gary Woodland to locate his major mojo. He\u2019s 35 years old now, and for a while back there it was looking like the big hitter from Kansas would never fulfil his potential in one of golf\u2019s biggest championships. But recently something\u2019s clicked. A tie for sixth at last year\u2019s PGA - in which he held the 36-hole lead - was followed by a good showing at Augusta this April and a tie for eighth at the PGA last month. Throw in victory at last year\u2019s Phoenix Open, as intense an event as you\u2019ll get on the regular Tour, and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s been in top form for some time. He\u2019s been magnificent so far this week. That record-equalling 65 on Friday, of course. But what about his chip-in at 12 and monster putt on 14 yesterday, saving precious pars when all looked lost? Or the way he\u2019s plotted his way around Pebble Beach, a track where booming drives are not the be-all and end-all? His calm demeanour? His resilience? His clutch putting? His heat-seeking approach play? He\u2019d be a worthy winner of the 119th United States Open Championship. Only problem is, this is the first time he\u2019s led a major after 54 holes. Pressure ahoy! And he\u2019s got some big names on his tail. Justin Rose, the 2013 champion, has been making an absurd amount of one-putts, the sort of behaviour that wins US Opens. And he looks happy and relaxed. Louis Oosthuizen, the 2010 Open winner, is refusing to give up the chase, and is known for his final-day birdie blitzes in the majors. Rory McIlroy, the 2011 winner, isn\u2019t out of the hunt and is due a special round this week. And then there\u2019s Brooks Koepka, bidding to become the first person to three-peat in the US Open since Willie Anderson in 1905. \u201cI enjoy the pressure,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s fun for me.\u201d Clearly. Who\u2019d bet against him?! Factor in the uber-determined Chez Reavie and Matt Kuchar, plus a fair few other big names who\u2019ll consider themselves within striking distance should Woodland and Rose have a bad day and come back towards the pack, and we\u2019ve got quite the experience ahead of us. It\u2019s the US Open! It\u2019s the final round! It could go to a two-hole play-off! It\u2019s on!

Don\u2019t read on unless you have watched episode one.</em></p> \n<h2>\u2018Are we people who keep secrets from each other? Is that our thing now?\u2019</h2> \n<p>The message this week is clear: buy your children earplugs, and make them mandatory. The multiple secrets being carried by the women bubbled up to the surface abruptly, because children listen, and talk. It all tumbled out as the episode progressed: Perry\u2019s violence towards Celeste; Jane being \u201csalted\u201d (how heartbreaking) by Perry; Ziggy and the twins learning that Perry was Ziggy\u2019s father; and Madeline\u2019s affair with the theatre director. The kids may be all right, but they\u2019re terrible at keeping anything to themselves.</p> \n<p>Family relationships were at the heart of the episode. Celeste has no family to speak of, and the isolation of her situation appealed to Perry, as a horrible flashback revealed. Eventually, when Mary Louise learned the truth about Ziggy, Celeste tried to tell her mother-in-law about Perry\u2019s violence, but she wasn\u2019t having any of it, and barely even seemed to listen. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t capable,\u201d she insisted, using the fact that Celeste did not go to the police as evidence that she was lying. The show can be very clever at examining the idea of complicity; it\u2019s something that also comes up in Celeste\u2019s therapy sessions, where she is clearly continuing to see herself as responsible for Perry\u2019s violence.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6a74ae4cc176065fe34da87f6f581a1fbf4f9f7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6a74ae4cc176065fe34da87f6f581a1fbf4f9f7/0_359_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Big Little Lies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Headbutting ...

Zoe Kravitz is doing an excellent job of showing Bonnie being haunted by her conscience (the title of the episode, of course, is a nod to Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s classic story of a murderer consumed by guilt), and it rectifies one of the only flaws in the first season, which was that Bonnie was underwritten and underused.</p> \n<p>For all of the emotional subtleties of Bonnie and Celeste\u2019s storylines, there is a kind of light relief in Renata\u2019s fury at losing everything thanks to her feckless husband \u2013 Laura Dern really goes for it \u2013 and in Madeline butting heads with Mary Louise, while Ed and Nathan\u2019s rivalry continues to be pleasingly silly. But for the most part, this was a gut-wrenching week for the Monterey Five. Jane\u2019s distress at having to tell Ziggy about Perry, particularly after that sense of freedom she had last week, that she was moving on with her life, was sad, and kudos to Shailene Woodley for that performance.</p> \n<h2>Notes and observations</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09b72f1930b38c00bbcde7a865ee35546481d00f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09b72f1930b38c00bbcde7a865ee35546481d00f/0_210_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Big Little Lies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goes for it ...

      "bodyText": "Spoiler alert: this blog is for people watching season two of Big Little Lies, which airs on HBO in the US, Sky Atlantic in the UK and on Foxtel\u2019s Showcase in Australia. Don\u2019t read on unless you have watched episode one. \u2018Are we people who keep secrets from each other? Is that our thing now?\u2019 The message this week is clear: buy your children earplugs, and make them mandatory. The multiple secrets being carried by the women bubbled up to the surface abruptly, because children listen, and talk. It all tumbled out as the episode progressed: Perry\u2019s violence towards Celeste; Jane being \u201csalted\u201d (how heartbreaking) by Perry; Ziggy and the twins learning that Perry was Ziggy\u2019s father; and Madeline\u2019s affair with the theatre director. The kids may be all right, but they\u2019re terrible at keeping anything to themselves. Family relationships were at the heart of the episode. Celeste has no family to speak of, and the isolation of her situation appealed to Perry, as a horrible flashback revealed. Eventually, when Mary Louise learned the truth about Ziggy, Celeste tried to tell her mother-in-law about Perry\u2019s violence, but she wasn\u2019t having any of it, and barely even seemed to listen. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t capable,\u201d she insisted, using the fact that Celeste did not go to the police as evidence that she was lying. The show can be very clever at examining the idea of complicity; it\u2019s something that also comes up in Celeste\u2019s therapy sessions, where she is clearly continuing to see herself as responsible for Perry\u2019s violence. Then there\u2019s Bonnie\u2019s mother, invited to stay by Nathan in an attempt to get through to her, though her presence is unsettling and there are hints that all is not well between them \u2013 a mention of previous alcoholism here, a crystal and a feather there. Zoe Kravitz is doing an excellent job of showing Bonnie being haunted by her conscience (the title of the episode, of course, is a nod to Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s classic story of a murderer consumed by guilt), and it rectifies one of the only flaws in the first season, which was that Bonnie was underwritten and underused. For all of the emotional subtleties of Bonnie and Celeste\u2019s storylines, there is a kind of light relief in Renata\u2019s fury at losing everything thanks to her feckless husband \u2013 Laura Dern really goes for it \u2013 and in Madeline butting heads with Mary Louise, while Ed and Nathan\u2019s rivalry continues to be pleasingly silly. But for the most part, this was a gut-wrenching week for the Monterey Five. Jane\u2019s distress at having to tell Ziggy about Perry, particularly after that sense of freedom she had last week, that she was moving on with her life, was sad, and kudos to Shailene Woodley for that performance. Notes and observations Last week\u2019s premiere gave the world the Scream, which has already fuelled countless Meryl Memes. Competing for the crown this week, though, is Nicole Kidman\u2019s guttural \u201cNooooooo\u201d, followed closely by Laura Dern\u2019s \u201cI will not not be rich!\u201d. Memes, surely, are imminent. \u201cBabe, you gotta be careful with Ambien.\u201d Madeline\u2019s advice to Celeste might have served Roseanne Barr well. I\u2019m finding Meryl\u2019s teeth a little distracting, and I am not the only one. One solution to everyone\u2019s woes might be to ban communal eating in Monterey. Every time a family sits down for a meal, it ends in something terrible coming out. If Bonnie\u2019s mother truly has the vision, then who is in danger of drowning? Playlist The BLL Spotify playlist can be found here and is extremely comprehensive. As Bonnie was being tailed in her car, she was listening to Brenton Wood\u2019s Great Big Bundle of Love. Charles Bradley\u2019s Let Love Stand a Chance was playing while Jane and Bonnie are at yoga. Madeline chopped tomatoes to Elle King\u2019s Good Thing Gone. Renata really is over What Becomes of the Broken-Hearted, isn\u2019t she? Mary Louise\u2019s insult of the week \u201cI don\u2019t like her ... well, I have tried, but she\u2019s not a likable person.\u201d Here\u2019s to the inevitable Mary Louise/Madeline showdown in the penultimate episode.",

That\u2019s because after missing finals in the first two seasons of Super Netball \u2013 and retaining an almost-unchanged roster heading into the third \u2013 the Swifts were meant to be the also-rans of 2019; the tough battlers that weren\u2019t up to it, again.

Although Proud succumbed to an ACL injury last week, ending her season, after eight rounds and seven wins \u2013 including an incredible four-goal come-from-behind win over the Giants late yesterday \u2013 the Swifts sit comfortably atop the Super Netball ladder.

Twenty-four year-old Klau ranks fifth for most defensive rebounds, eight behind Collingwood captain Mentor, and neither shooter makes the cut for most offensive rebounds \u2013 mainly because they don\u2019t miss much, shooting at a combined 91% accuracy.

The West Australians currently sit sixth on the ladder after a one-goal win over Adelaide on Saturday. The fact Klau and Hadley were named in the Australian Diamonds squad for July\u2019s World Cup tells the story of the rise and rise of the Swifts. But now the question arises, can they maintain it or do old habits die hard? In the last round before the World Cup-enforced break next weekend, the Swifts should easily account for the lowly-placed Thunderbirds.

Currently, Ostby said, the policy by the Myanmar government \u201crisks entrenching segregation\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/may/02/we-will-lose-any-hope-of-going-home-rohingya-live-in-fear-of-resettlement-myanmar-rakhine-state\">'We will lose any hope of going home': Rohingya live in fear of resettlement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2017, the Myanmar government vowed to begin closing the IDP camps, where 128,000 Rohingya and Kaman Muslims have been forced to live in squalid, insanitary conditions with their freedom of movement severely restricted after their homes were destroyed in violence in 2012.</p> <p>The government agreed to follow recommendations of a commission led by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan which called for the displaced people to be rehoused in a voluntary and consultative manner, where possible, near their original villages, and with access to livelihoods.</p> <p>However, internal UN reports seen by the Guardian, and accounts from humanitarian agencies on the ground, have demonstrated the reality of the \u201cclosures\u201d is that the living conditions for the relocated Rohingya remain dire and virtually unchanged, with their basic human rights, particularly freedom of movement and access to livelihoods, almost entirely denied.</p> <p>The letter, sent to Dr Win Myat Aye, Myanmar\u2019s minister of social welfare, relief and resettlement, pointed out that those in the old \u201cclosed\u201d camps or newly built camps were still suffering the same indignities, with no access to \u201cbasic services\u201d or \u201clivelihood opportunities\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The United Nations in Myanmar has warned it will withdraw support in Rakhine state to avoid complicity in a government \u201cpolicy of apartheid\u201d for Rohingya Muslims. A letter seen by the Guardian, sent from UN resident coordinator, Knut Ostby, to the Myanmar government, relayed a decision by the UN and its humanitarian partners to withhold support \u201cbeyond life-saving assistance\u201d in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps deemed \u201cclosed\u201d by the government, unless fundamental changes occur. UN agencies have worked continuously in camps for Muslim communities displaced by violence in Myanmar\u2019s restive Rakhine state seven years ago The letter, dated 6 June, said that from now on, UN assistance could only be provided when it was \u201clinked to tangible progress made on the fundamental issue of freedom of movement\u201d. Currently, Ostby said, the policy by the Myanmar government \u201crisks entrenching segregation\u201d. In 2017, the Myanmar government vowed to begin closing the IDP camps, where 128,000 Rohingya and Kaman Muslims have been forced to live in squalid, insanitary conditions with their freedom of movement severely restricted after their homes were destroyed in violence in 2012. The government agreed to follow recommendations of a commission led by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan which called for the displaced people to be rehoused in a voluntary and consultative manner, where possible, near their original villages, and with access to livelihoods. However, internal UN reports seen by the Guardian, and accounts from humanitarian agencies on the ground, have demonstrated the reality of the \u201cclosures\u201d is that the living conditions for the relocated Rohingya remain dire and virtually unchanged, with their basic human rights, particularly freedom of movement and access to livelihoods, almost entirely denied. The letter, sent to Dr Win Myat Aye, Myanmar\u2019s minister of social welfare, relief and resettlement, pointed out that those in the old \u201cclosed\u201d camps or newly built camps were still suffering the same indignities, with no access to \u201cbasic services\u201d or \u201clivelihood opportunities\u201d. Even the location of the camps has remained virtually unchanged. Explaining the decision, a senior UN official in Myanmar, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: \u201cThe government plan to build permanent housing on or next to the camps makes it very clear that the apartheid-like separation will be permanent and therefore crosses a red line for continual support to the camps.\u201d The Rohingya have long been one of the most persecuted ethnic groups in Myanmar. The 2012 violence, which saw hundreds of thousands of Rohingya homes destroyed, was followed in October 2016 and August 2017 by security operations that drove around 800,000 people over the border to Bangladesh. About half a million are estimated to remain in Myanmar. This is the first known attempt by the UN to adopt a tougher policy on camp closures, following months of warnings contained in a series of damning internal assessments on the government\u2019s actions and the risk of complicity in abuses if international agencies continued to provide assistance. A UN document written in September 2018, noted that \u201cthe only scenario that is unfolding before our eyes is the implementation of a policy of apartheid with the permanent segregation of all Muslims, the vast majority of whom are stateless Rohingya, in central Rakhine.\u201d \u201cThe government\u2019s current strategy would essentially formalise and entrench a system of segregation that would perpetuate human rights violations for years to come,\u201d it added. Laura Haigh, Amnesty International\u2019s Myanmar Researcher, said: \u201cRakhine has been an apartheid state for years\u201d. \u201cThe international community remains paralysed,\u201d she said. \u201cThe status quo cannot continue, and unless we see concrete progress towards restoring Rohingya rights, those providing support or assistance in Rakhine \u2013 aid agencies, donor states, or others \u2013 risks being complicit in the state\u2019s enforced segregation and crimes against humanity.\u201d The Guardian understands that the UN has for months sought to bring government policy on camp closures in line with international standards.

As a result, Ostby is stepping down in the coming months. The Guardian understands that the new Myanmar UN resident co-ordinator will be Ola Almgren, current resident co-ordinator of the Philippines. Soe Aung, deputy minister of social welfare, relief and resettlement, said that the government had not seen Ostby\u2019s letter as a warning for the withdrawal of UN support and that the correspondence had instead demonstrated \u201cthe willingness and readiness of UN Agencies and its humanitarian partners to support the government of Myanmar in implementations towards reintegration in camp closed sites.\u201d \u201cUN Agencies in Myanmar and our ministry communicate very closely and we discuss openly and frequently about the collaboration in humanitarian assistance, peace, stability and development,\u201d said Soe Aung. When contacted by the Guardian for comment, a UN spokesperson confirmed that it had \u201csent a letter on behalf of the Humanitarian Country Team to the government on 7 June 2019,\u201d but declined to comment on its contents. \u201cWe wish to reiterate our commitment to implementing durable solutions for the IDPs in central Rakhine in cooperation with the government and in accordance with international principles,\u201d they added.",
