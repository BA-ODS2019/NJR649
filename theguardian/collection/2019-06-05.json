      "bodyText": "Surrogacy laws should be updated to allow intended parents to assume the status of legal parents as soon as a baby is born, the Law Commission has recommended. A consultation by several law reform organisations also calls for the establishment of a national register to allow those born through surrogacy arrangements to uncover information about their origins and how they were conceived. The current legal process surrounding surrogacy is cumbersome because new parents have to wait until a court grants them a parental order; that can take many months to complete. Subject to the surrogate mother retaining a right to object for a short period after the birth, the report by the Law Commission of England and Wales and the Scottish Law Commssion proposes a new \u201cpathway\u201d to legal parenthood. A regulator should be created to oversee organisations involved in future surrogacy agreements created through the new pathway, it is recommended. The proposals form part of a public consultation being launched today. The requirement that intended parents have a genetic link to the child should be ended, the report proposes, halting discrimination against individuals and couples who are infertile and thereby prevented from having children through surrogacy. The ban on profit-seeking, commercial surrogacy agencies should remain, it is suggested, although the consultation is seeking public views on surrogacy payments. The laws governing surrogacy have not changed since they were introduced in the 1980s. The precise number of surrogate births is unknown, but there were around 400 parental order proceedings in 2016 to regularise such births. Sir Nicholas Green, chair of the Law Commission said: \u201cMore and more people are turning to surrogacy to have a child and start their family.

The accumulation of emotional truths had lifted The Virtues up to a peak where the air was barely breathable \u2026 then it plummeted, taking us with it, strapped in and helpless as one scene led with dread inevitability to the next, and the next, and the next, each of them a devastatingly intimate two-hander exploring a new aspect of the horror pouring out. Graham\u2019s performance, when Joseph finally unlocked the repressed memory of what happened to him as a nine-year-old, had a primal physicality that is rare in television acting.

In those last throes The Virtues distilled itself down to drama in one of its purest forms: whether humans have something deep within that will save them when they face the source of all their pain, with God and their loved ones unable or unwilling to help, and with the lure of the self-destruct button stronger than ever.</p> <p>The skill of Meadows was evident throughout, from the episode one scene in which Joseph fell off the wagon, so evocative of an out-of-control drunk that you felt hungover watching it and so tense with the possibility of violence that you wanted to run, to the decision to render Joseph\u2019s percolating memories of the children\u2019s home \u2013 liminal at first, vivid at the end \u2013 as fuzzy 1980s videotape.

He said he wanted to \u201cslay the unicorn\u201d that the next Tory leader had to have voted to leave the EU in 2016.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need a Brexiteer as prime minister.

We win by appealing to the next generation and appealing to people who haven\u2019t voted Conservative before,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Hancock trails Boris Johnson, Gove and Hunt by a significant margin, judging by public declarations of support from Conservative MPs.</p> <p>But his argument about appealing to the centre-ground was given some credence on Tuesday by an analysis from the Conservative peer and polling expert Robert Hayward. He said it would be impossible for the Tories to win an election with a leader who was not \u201ctransfer friendly\u201d, and able to attract swing voters who were neither committed leavers nor remainers.</p> <p>\u201cA Tory prime minister or leader can\u2019t win without Brexiteers; but you actually can\u2019t win without the people who don\u2019t strongly identify with one side or the other, and are looking for good government,\u201d he said.</p> <p>And he said Johnson may not be the right person to do that because many voters have a \u201cdistinct antipathy\u201d towards him.</p> <p>He said that while Johnson was very popular with a section of the electorate, he was also the leadership frontrunner who voters were most likely to say would make a bad prime minister.</p> <p>Hayward pointed to <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/05/24/mays-resignation-has-sparked-long-awaited-tory-lea\">a recent YouGov poll</a> that suggested as many as 23% of respondents who had voted Conservative in 2017 thought Johnson would be a \u201cvery bad\u201d prime minister.</p> <p>In the same poll, 28% of the public thought he would make a good prime minister, outstripping any of the other eight candidates they asked about, but 54% thought he would do a bad job. For Gove, the equivalent numbers were 16% and 47% \u2013 and for Hunt, 13% and 42%.</p> <p>\u201cGove and Hunt have similar problems; but the voters don\u2019t appear to be so antipathetic, particularly to Hunt, and to some extent to Gove,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/04/boris-johnson-tories-must-deliver-brexit-or-face-extinction\">told MPs</a> at Tuesday night\u2019s private hustings: \u201cWe are facing an existential crisis and will not be forgiven if we do not deliver <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> on 31 October.\u201d</p> <p>But Hayward argued that Johnson must also show what he could do to win over non-Brexiters.</p> <p>At Wednesday\u2019s hustings Raab, who told MPs he was \u201cthe only candidate that has set out a credible negotiating plan,\u201d refused to rule out proroguing parliament if MPs seek to block a no-deal.</p> <p>The former Brexit secretary hopes to achieve a revised agreement, but has made clear he would pursue a no-deal Brexit if that could not be achieved by the October deadline.</p> <p>He told MPs, \u201cwe don\u2019t just need a conviction Brexiteer. We need someone who is resolute, but someone who can navigate the rocky path ahead and get Brexit delivered.\u201d</p> <p>Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said, \u201cThis is as disturbing as it is ludicrous. Anyone proposing to shut down Parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit is not fit to be prime minister.\u201d </p> <p>Gove risked a backlash from hard Brexiters by saying he would be willing to delay leaving the EU by a few weeks or months beyond the October deadline if it proved necessary to finalise a deal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/tory_leadership_rules/giv-39022eAcDu8TvtjU/\" data-alt=\"Guide to leadership race\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/tory_leadership_rules/giv-39022eAcDu8TvtjU/\">Guide to leadership race</a> </figure>  <p>George Eustice, the former farming minister, who backs Gove, said he had sought to be \u201chonest\u201d about the choices that might face the next leader.</p> <p>\u201cIf we get to a point where we have nearly got a deal, where we\u2019re 95% of the way there, you just need a few more weeks or a few more months, it would be foolhardy to flounce off,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Hunt\u2019s pitch at the event involved highlighting the lessons the Tories could learn from the US president. \u201cTrump focuses more on communicating with his base than we do.

We win by appealing to the next generation and appealing to people who haven\u2019t voted Conservative before,\u201d he said. Hancock trails Boris Johnson, Gove and Hunt by a significant margin, judging by public declarations of support from Conservative MPs. But his argument about appealing to the centre-ground was given some credence on Tuesday by an analysis from the Conservative peer and polling expert Robert Hayward. He said it would be impossible for the Tories to win an election with a leader who was not \u201ctransfer friendly\u201d, and able to attract swing voters who were neither committed leavers nor remainers. \u201cA Tory prime minister or leader can\u2019t win without Brexiteers; but you actually can\u2019t win without the people who don\u2019t strongly identify with one side or the other, and are looking for good government,\u201d he said. And he said Johnson may not be the right person to do that because many voters have a \u201cdistinct antipathy\u201d towards him. He said that while Johnson was very popular with a section of the electorate, he was also the leadership frontrunner who voters were most likely to say would make a bad prime minister. Hayward pointed to a recent YouGov poll that suggested as many as 23% of respondents who had voted Conservative in 2017 thought Johnson would be a \u201cvery bad\u201d prime minister. In the same poll, 28% of the public thought he would make a good prime minister, outstripping any of the other eight candidates they asked about, but 54% thought he would do a bad job. For Gove, the equivalent numbers were 16% and 47% \u2013 and for Hunt, 13% and 42%. \u201cGove and Hunt have similar problems; but the voters don\u2019t appear to be so antipathetic, particularly to Hunt, and to some extent to Gove,\u201d he said. Johnson told MPs at Tuesday night\u2019s private hustings: \u201cWe are facing an existential crisis and will not be forgiven if we do not deliver Brexit on 31 October.\u201d But Hayward argued that Johnson must also show what he could do to win over non-Brexiters. At Wednesday\u2019s hustings Raab, who told MPs he was \u201cthe only candidate that has set out a credible negotiating plan,\u201d refused to rule out proroguing parliament if MPs seek to block a no-deal. The former Brexit secretary hopes to achieve a revised agreement, but has made clear he would pursue a no-deal Brexit if that could not be achieved by the October deadline. He told MPs, \u201cwe don\u2019t just need a conviction Brexiteer. We need someone who is resolute, but someone who can navigate the rocky path ahead and get Brexit delivered.\u201d Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said, \u201cThis is as disturbing as it is ludicrous. Anyone proposing to shut down Parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit is not fit to be prime minister.\u201d Gove risked a backlash from hard Brexiters by saying he would be willing to delay leaving the EU by a few weeks or months beyond the October deadline if it proved necessary to finalise a deal. George Eustice, the former farming minister, who backs Gove, said he had sought to be \u201chonest\u201d about the choices that might face the next leader. \u201cIf we get to a point where we have nearly got a deal, where we\u2019re 95% of the way there, you just need a few more weeks or a few more months, it would be foolhardy to flounce off,\u201d he said. Hunt\u2019s pitch at the event involved highlighting the lessons the Tories could learn from the US president. \u201cTrump focuses more on communicating with his base than we do. The Trump base has remained solid because he arrives at work knowing what the world is thinking and the world knows what he is thinking,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 6 June. Top stories The brother of the Australian racing legend Winx is one of thousands of exported thoroughbreds killed for meat in Korea under conditions the RSPCA has called \u201cvery distressing\u201d, a Guardian Australia investigation has found. Footage filmed secretly at the Nonghyup abattoir in South Korea last year shows horses being repeatedly beaten on the head with lengths of black polyethylene pipe in an attempt to herd them into the facility. That treatment would be in breach both of Australian animal welfare laws and of the requirements imposed on abattoirs that process live export animals if it was part of a formal Australian supply chain, the RSPCA said. In the past five years Australia has exported 158 racehorses to South Korea. But the Australian government says responsibility for the horses is out of its hands. After two police raids on media outlets in two days, the Greens and Centre Alliance have accused the government of a double standard.The Greens senator Nick McKim accused the government of \u201cleaking sensitive information like a sieve when it suits them\u201d while Centre Alliance\u2019s Rex Patrick said it was \u201cabhorrent\u201d that public interest reports applying scrutiny to officials\u2019 actions were now being investigated. Over the last three years referrals to the police resulted in raids investigating leaks about the national broadband network and Peter Dutton\u2019s ministerial intervention in the case of two foreign au pairs. NSW Labor will stop accepting political donations from the fossil fuel industry and ban them altogether when it wins government, one of the candidates for the NSW Labor leadership, Chris Minns, has announced. In a pitch designed to burnish his credentials on the climate crisis, Minns is today sending emails to branch members explaining his policy. \u201cWe can\u2019t just put it in the too-hard basket,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe time to take climate change action is running out.\u201d NSW already has bans on political donations from property developers, tobacco, liquor and gambling industries. World Donald Trump has started his visit to Ireland by comparing its post-Brexit border with Northern Ireland to the US border with Mexico, along which he wants to build a permanent wall. \u201cI think it will all work out very well, and also for you with your wall, your border,\u201d he said at a joint press conference. A visibly uncomfortable taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, interjected that Ireland wished to avoid a border or a wall, a keystone of Irish government policy. A severely ill Dutch girl widely reported by international media as having been \u201clegally euthanised\u201d in a clinic in the Netherlands died at home, apparently after voluntarily refusing to eat or drink and with no evidence that her death was assisted. Paramilitaries in Khartoum threw dozens of bodies into the Nile to try to hide the number of casualties inflicted during a dawn attack on pro-democracy protesters in the Sudanese capital this week, doctors and activists have said. Voters looked set to return the third left-leaning government in a year to the Nordic region, after exit polls suggested Denmark\u2019s Social Democrats had secured victory in parliamentary elections with more than 25% of the vote. Ancient Siberia was home to previously unknown humans, scientists say, with DNA analysis revealing hardy groups genetically distinct from Eurasians and east Asians. Opinion and analysis A media freedom act that positively puts the role of the press in the middle of our legal system is the solution to the increasing criminalisation of the legitimate work of journalists, writes Peter Greste in response to two federal police raids on Australian media in two days: \u201cAt the moment, there is nothing in Australian law that explicitly protects press freedom in the way that the First Amendment does in the US constitution. Such an act would recognise the fundamental importance of national security and the protection of certain commonwealth activities and the identities of key employees, whilst still providing a basis for journalists to investigate and report on government misconduct.\u201d In the last year the economy had the slowest growth since 2009, and for the first time in 36 years GDP per capita has gone backwards in three consecutive quarters, writes Greg Jericho. \u201cThe big message from the GDP figures is that the biggest lie during the election campaign was not the death tax but that the LNP has managed a strong economy. In reality they have run it into the ground.\u201d Sport On the eve of the Women\u2019s World Cup, the Matildas captain, Sam Kerr, talks exclusively to Richard Parkin about her initial reluctance to embrace the game after growing up in an AFL-dominated environment in Perth, and the challenges of swapping a Sherrin for a round ball. Given her current status as one of the world\u2019s best footballers, it\u2019s perhaps surprising that, by her own admission, she was \u201ctotal crap\u201d in her first season. Queensland opened the 2019 State of Origin series with victory at Suncorp Stadium, in a win that will be remembered as much for a multitude of missed opportunities as for their ability to overcome a talent deficit with energy, cohesion and will. Thinking time: The rise of body-positive swimwear From larger-cup bikinis to modest beachwear, fashion is finally beginning to cater for a range of women\u2019s bodies after decades of limiting choices to itsy bitsy bikinis in one size fits all. \u201cI buy swimwear about once every 10 years,\u201d says Sasha Khan, a London charity worker who wears a size 10/12 and has a 32FF bust. \u201cI always put it off. I hate it. It\u2019s like having to go to the dentist or get your eyes tested.\u201d Stephanie Boland, 28, agrees. \u201cIt fits into the narrative, which I think a lot of us have internalised, that your body is wrong for the clothes, rather than the clothes being wrong for your body \u2026 it\u2019s depressing to buy things that are supposedly in your size and find they don\u2019t fit at all.\u201d Now though, in part thanks to the rise of online shopping, retailers are beginning to sharpen up. \u201cIf we think about online providers, in effect they have endless aisles, which means that they can store unlimited inventory,\u201d explains Jonathan Reynolds, a retail expert at the University of Oxford. According to market researchers Mintel, 18% of women buy plus-size clothing. Online-only retailers have proved particularly adept in targeting these consumers. And, even for women who are not plus-sized, online shopping takes the sting out of buying swimwear. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is people purchasing multiple swimsuits online, trying them on in their own home and sending the remainder back,\u201d says Steven Wright, a senior lecturer in fashion design at the University of South Wales. Media roundup Experts are divided on whether the \u201csophisticated operator\u201d behind the data breach at the Australian National University can be attributed to China, the Canberra Times reports. \u201cWar on truth\u201d is the headline on the front page of the Daily Telegraph, with a report saying the Scott Morrison government is attempting to distance itself from raids by the AFP on media organisations. And dingos\u2019 diets are widening during drought as food and water become increasingly scare, a report in the ABC says, with the predators hunting and eating larger animals such as cattle. Coming up Scott Morrison winds up his trip to the UK before heading for Singapore. Cardinal George Pell\u2019s appeal continues against his convictions for sexually abusing two boys in the 1990s.",

Everyone is training well, they\u2019re really up for the game and we\u2019re not thinking further ahead than tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about what kind of game he was expecting against Portugal, Santos didn\u2019t beat around the bush. \u201cIt will be a very hard match, with two teams that like to hold onto the ball, that like possession,\u201d he said. \u201cSwitzerland also like to play long balls, utilising the characteristics of players like [Haris] Seferovi\u0107; then there\u2019s [Xherdan] Shaqiri, who likes to hold the ball up. They are full of quality players. Our job is to think about ourselves \u2026 and to impose our game. The Portuguese national team, playing at home, want to bring joy to their fans.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9122eb31be0cd9e33b79c7cc2c7cdbb8ce4f7fba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9122eb31be0cd9e33b79c7cc2c7cdbb8ce4f7fba/0_162_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fernando Santos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portugal head coach Fernando Santos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lukas Schulze/UEFA via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-05T18:37:14.006Z\">at 7.37pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5cf7b4ee8f08066241118c75\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-05T16:09:21.772Z\">5.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Nations League semi-final: Portugal v Switzerland</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Porto\u2019s Estadio Do Drago is the venue, where European Champions Portugal are hosting Switzerland for a place in the final of the inaugural Nations League.

      "bodyText": "Daniel Taylor, our chief football correspondent, was at the Estadio Do Drago to see Cristiano Ronaldo secure his country\u2019s berth in the inaugural Uefa Nations League final with his 53rd career hat-trick. Sean Ingle was on hand to see travelling England fans disgrace themselves again, incurring the well-earned, occasionally violent wrath of the local constabulary in the process. Read on ... VAR: It may have ended up as little more than a consolation, but the manner in which Switzerland scored their goal will be a talking point in the wake of tonight\u2019s game. Here\u2019s how it unfolded ... Steven Zuber claims a penalty after a coming together with Portugal\u2019s Nelson Semedo. Referee Felix Brych doesn\u2019t see it as penalty and waves play on. Portugal sweep up the field and Bernardo Silva is fouled in the Switzerland penalty area by Fabian Schar. Brych awards a penalty. The VAR official let\u2019s Brych know he needs to have a look at the original incident and he does so on his pitchside monitor. Noticing the Semedo clip on the heels of Zuber he reverses his decision and awards Switzerland the penalty from which they score. CR7 It\u2019s been some night for Cristiano Ronaldo, who had a fairly quiet night by his own high standards, but will still leave the Estadio do Dragao with the match-ball after scoring yet another hat-trick. His clinical finishing was the difference between the two sides and Switzerland will rue the fact that, by contrast, they had to make do with Haris Seferovic up front. The striker got himself in decent goalscoring positions on a number of occasions and could have put this game beyond Portugal in the first half with less wayward finishing. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeep!!! It\u2019s all over. Portugal are through to the final of the inaugural Uefa Nations League, courtesy of Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s 53rd career hat-trick for club and country. They\u2019ll play England or the Netherlands in the Estadio do Drago on Sunday night. 90+5 min: Switzerland plug on gamely, but they know the jig is up. They win a corner, from which nothing comes. Kevin Mbabu sends a cross into the Portugal penalty area, but it\u2019s headed clear. 90+3 min: Back to Ronaldo\u2019s third goal. Portugal embarked up the field on a counter-attack after Xhaka lost the ball in midfield. With a couple of team-mates to his right, Ronaldo chose to ignore them and, with Manuel Akanji standing off him, curled a perfectly placed, utterly unstoppable shot past Yann Sommer from just inside the penalty area. Portugal substitution: Joao Moutinho on for Bruno Fernandes. Switzerland substitution: Josip Drmic on for Remo Freuler. Hat-trick! With his team attacking on the counter, the Portugal captain takes on a defender, sizes up the task in hand, makes a half-yard for a shot and curls a shot from just inside the Switzerland penalty area inside the upright and into the bottom right-hand corner. 89 min: Bernardo Silva provided the assist, crossing low from the right. Cristiano Ronaldo swept the ball into the bottom right-hand corner from a tight angle with his first touch. Portugal take the lead, with Ronaldo bagging his second of the night in what has been - as ridiculous as this sounds - a fairly lacklustre performance. 86 min: For Portugal, Semedo gets a vital touch on a Mbabu cross from the right that was heading for Steffen at the far post. 84 min: Xherdan Shaqiri is penalised for a foul on Goncalo Guedes. Schar tries his luck from distance, firing high and wide. 83 min: Switzerland substitution: Steven Zuber makes way for Wolfsburg winger Renato Steffen. 80 min: The game enters its final 10 minutes, unless nobody scores in which case we\u2019ll have extra time and possibly penalties. There will, presumably, be a few minutes of added time to make up for the time lost as referee Felix Brych consulted his pitch-side monitor before awarding Switzerland the controversial penalty from which they scored their equaliser. 78 min: Raphael Guerreiro curls a cross into the Swiss penalty area, where Manuel Akanji clears with an agricultural hoof up the field. 77 min: Portugal enjoy a lengthy spell of possession, which comes to an abrupt end when Bernardo Silva loses the ball high up the field. 74 min: For Switzerland, Remo Freuler shoots hopelessly high and wide from distance. 72 min: Ruben Neves shoots well wide with an opportunistic drive from distance. Portugal substitution: Joao Felix off after a quiet debut, Goncalo Guedes on. Switzerland substitution: Denis Zakaria is replaced by Edimilson Fernandes. 69 min: Fabian Schar is booked for a late challenge on Joao Felix. The needle-factor in this match has definitely upped a couple of notches since that VAR decision. While referee Felix Brych was well within his rights to review the \u201cfoul\u201d on Steven Zuber in the Portugal penalty area, there will be those who say he got his decision wrong. If he hadn\u2019t decided to give Switzerland that penalty, would he have then consulted VAR for the decision he originally gave at the other end? 66 min: Granit Xhaka is booked for getting a little too up close and personal with Bernardo Silva, holding him back with an arm over each shoulder. 65 min: More excellent play from Shaqiri who sends a cross fizzing towards Seferovic at the far post. Not for the first time this evening, the striker shakes off his marker, but fails to hit the target with his header. If Switzerland had a decent striker they\u2019d be about four goals ahead tonight. 62 min: Bruno Fernandes takes a corner and Ruben Dias gets his head to it at the back post. Granit Xhaka clears for Switzerland. There follows a break in play for medical treatment for Pepe, who appears to have hurt his arm or shoulder. He is helped from the pitch holding his right arm like somebody who has broken their collar-bone and is replaced by Jose Fonte. 59 min: To say the largely Portuguese crowd in the Estadio Do Dragao are unhappy with the events as they just unfolded would be quite the understatement. They\u2019re whistling and jeering German referee Felix Brych, who appears to have made the correct decision in a very difficult situation with the aid of VAR. He adjudged Semedo to have clipped the heels of Steven Zuber in the penalty area as the Swiss midfielder attempted to get on the end of an exquisite delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri. Rui Patricio guesses correctly, but is unable to keep out Ricardo Rodriguez\u2019s penalty. He beats the ground in frustration as the Swiss defender celebrates a controversial equaliser with his team-mates. Scenes in Porto! The referee has reversed his original decision to give Portugal a penalty and awarded one to Switzerland instead. THE STUFF OF VAR NIGHTMARES! Having awarded a penalty to Portugal, the referee, Felix Brych, is now at the touchline studying his monitor to see what happened in the Portugal penalty area moments previously, where Semedo appeared to foul Zuber. Steven Zuber appeals for a penalty at one end after being shoved in the back. Portugal sweep down the other end of the field and are awarded a penalty of their own when Schar trips Bernardo Silva in the Swiss penalty area. Sort that one out, VAR. 50 min: End to end stuff in Porto. This time Bernardo Silva tees up Cristiano Ronaldo, who is off balance when shooting from outside the Swiss penalty area and sends his effort well wide of the left upright. 49 min: A good move from Switzerland, which comes to naught when Seferovic is only able to head a cross from the right from Zakaria up in the air. Rui Patricio collects the ball with a minimum of fuss. 48 min: Pepe heads the ball out for a corner at the near post, putting it out of play from a Steven Zuber cross from the left. Ronaldo gets his head to the subsequent corner, before Guerreiro finishes the clean-up. 47 min: Moments later, it\u2019s Ricardo Rodriguez who is called upon to do some defending. The Swiss is on hand to take the ball off Cristiano Ronaldo and clear his lines. 46 min: Shaqiri finds the ball in a good position on the right side of the Portugal penalty area, but is dispossessed by Raphael Guerreiro, who ambles a few strides down the pitch before booting the ball forward. 46 min: Switzerland get the ball rolling for the second half, a goal down and in need of a centre-forward who can hit the target. There are no changes in personnel on either side. Portugal lead at the break. A Cristiano Ronaldo free-kick is the difference between the sides as they march in for their half-time refreshments. They\u2019re in the box-seat to qualify for Sunday\u2019s Nations League final, but Switzerland have plenty to be positive about on the evidence of that first half. Xherdan Shaqiri has been a constant menace, while striker Haris Seferovic has missed one sitter and gone close on a couple of other occasions. 45 min: Nineteen! He\u2019s 19! Not 9. 44 min: Joao Felix ghosts in behind Ricardo Rodriguez to get on the end of a curled through-ball from Ronaldo and hook the ball over the bar under pressure from the defender. He was outmuscled there, which is not entirely surprising as he\u2019s only 9 and looks like a gust of wind would blow him over. 41 min: As they have so many times tonight, Shaqiri and Mbabu combine down the right to get in behind the Portugal left-back Raphael Guerreiro and fashion a cross for Seferovic. The striker is forced to dig the ball out from under his feet before unleashing a shot that hits the cross-bar and goes over. 40 min: Bernardo Silva tries to pick out Ronaldo in the Switzerland penalty area with a looping cross from the inside left, but it\u2019s cleared. Elsewhere in Porto ... Our chief sports reporter Sean Ingle is lucky enough to be in the company of some \u201cboisterous\u201d travelling England fans. 36 min: Ronaldo twists the blood of Mbabu on the left touchline, dumping the right-back on his backside twice in quick in succession with some nifty footwork and earning a couple of loud cheers from the crowd for his troubles. 35 min: Shaqiri has been a busy boy tonight and gets on the ball again, before helping the ball on its way back into the Portugal penalty area in the direction of Seferovic again. Pepe clears up for the hosts. 32 min: Bruno Fernandes picks up the ball on the right flank for Portugal and wastes no time in trying to pick out Joao Felix with a cross. He overcooks his delivery. 31 min: Switzerland win a free-kick about 25 yards from the Portugal goal, a little right of centre. Xherdan Shaqiri tries his luck, but his effort hits the defensive wall and Portugal clear the two corners that follow. 29 min: Rui Patricio gets marooned on the edge of his own penalty area after a mix-up with his defenders but Xherdan Shaqiri tries to take the ball around the goalkeeper rather than shoot first time. The Swiss have to settle for a corner, from which nothing comes. 26 min: While Ronaldo was fouled on the edge of the Swiss box (although Mbabu will claim with some justification he got the ball as well as the man), he took the free-kick from several yards further back. Yann Sommer\u2019s wall placement was questionable, to say the least and the Swiss goalkeeper also looked to be wrong-footed when Ronaldo sent the ball fizzing past him into the bottom right-hand corner from 25 yards. Portugal lead! Kevin Mbabu is penalised for a foul on Ronaldo right on the edge of the Swiss penalty area. Ronaldo picks himself off the ground and scores with the free-kick. 23 min: Portugal right-back Nelson Semedo sends a cross into the Switzerland penalty area from the right touchline, aiming for Cristiano Ronaldo, the only Portugal player in it. He\u2019s unable to pick out his man. 22 min: Carvalho tries to pick out Joao Felix with a high ball towards the edge of the Swiss penalty area from midfield. Fabian Schar wins the ball and clears. 19 min: Switzerland attack down the right flank and the ball is played to Shaqiri about five metres outside the Portugal penalty area, a little right of centre. He sends a shot fizzing high and wide of the target. 17 min: It\u2019s been a lively enough start, which Switzerland dominated in the early stages, but Portugal have since come into the game. Seferovic, who plays his club football with Benfica, gets ahead of Pepe to get his head to a cross from Mbabu, but sends his weak downward effort straight at Rui Patricio from about 10 metres out. 15 min: Another mistake from Akanji leads to a Portugal corner. And then another, when Kevin babu puts the ball out of play with an unconvincing attempt at a clearance. The ball\u2019s curled into the Switzerland penalty area, where Pep heads a difficult chance high and wide. 13 min: Haris Seferovic fails to make contact with the ball as he tried to get on the end of a beautiful;ly whipped cross from the right by Xherdan Shaqiri. If he\\\u2019d made contact, he\u2019d almost certainly have scored. The ball came perilously close to creeping in at the far post regardless. 10 min: Your minute-by-minute reporter experiences minor technological problems as he kicks the plug of his computer out of it\u2019s socket, swears loudly and has to wait for it to reboot. While that was happening, Bernardo Silva shot narrowly wide after a hideously misplaced pass from Manuel Akanji. A let-off for the Swiss. 7 min: Cristiano Ronaldo wins a corner for Portugal, from which nothing comes. 4 min: A good start by the Swiss, who go close again. Denis Zakaria squares the ball across the face of the Portugal goal after making a lung-bursting run up the right flank, only for striker Haris Serferovic to shank the ball over the ball from close range. 2 min: There was some speculation over whether the Swiss would line up with a back three or four and they appear to have gone for the former. Shaqiri sends a cross into the Portugal penalty area, Pepe makes a hash of his clearance and the ball breaks to Shaqiri, now on the left side of the penalty area. He attempts to lift it over Rui Patricio from the edge of the six-yard box, but fails to get enough height on the ball to clear the goalkeeper. 1 min: After a perfectly observed minute\u2019s silence for the late Lennart, Portugal get the ball rolling. Their players wear red shirts, red shorts and green socks. The Swiss are kitted out in white shirts, shorts and socks. There\u2019s a minor early scare for the Swiss as Joao Felix chases down a back-pass to goalkeeper Yann Sommer, who makes a bit of a mess of his clearance, but gets away with it. Not long now: Cristiano Ronaldo and Granit Xhaka lead their teams out on to the Esradio Do Dragao sward, where giant flags of each country are being held alongside one featuring the tournament logo. It\u2019s time for the national anthems,after which there\u2019ll be a minute\u2019s silence for former Uefa president, Lennart Johansson, who passed away on Tuesday aged 89. Portugal: Rui Patricio, Semedo, Pepe, Ruben Dias, Guerreiro, Carvalho, Neves, Bruno Fernandes, Bernardo Silva, Ronaldo, Joao Felix. Switzerland: Sommer, Mbabu, Rodriguez, Schar, Akanji, Zakaria, Xhaka, Freuler, Steven Zuber, Shaqiri, Seferovic. Referee: Felix Brych (Germany) Some team news: Joao Felix starts for Portugal. The 19-year-old Benfica striker, who scored 18 goals last season, will make his debut for his country tonight. Vladimir Petkovic speaks \u201cTo play for your national team is an honour,\u201d said Switzerland\u2019s coach during his pre-match media briefing. \u201cTo play against top teams is an opportunity to improve and gain experience. It\u2019s a good opportunity to win the tournament.\u201d Asked about tonight\u2019s opponents and how his own players would approach them, he was honest in his appraisal. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that Portugal don\u2019t concede many goals,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re tough to break down. We need to focus on what we can do to beat them. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do anything differently in terms of preparation. We need to be ready for them. We\u2019ve analysed their strengths and weaknesses. It\u2019s not all about Felix, Silva or Ronaldo.\u201d Fernando Santos speaks The main talking point surrounding the Portuguese camp in the build-up to this game has been the call-up of Benfica striker Joao Felix, who is a target for several Premier League clubs this summer. So persistent was the line of questioning over whether or not the 19-year-old will start tonight, that Fernando Santos became visibly exasperated at his pre-match press conference. \u201cHe\u2019s been called up for a reason,\u201d said the Portugal boss. \u201cWe need to call up players who can contribute, he has great qualities, he has been showing it at club level and he\u2019s one of 23 players who are here on merit. And if he\u2019s here it\u2019s because he\u2019s ready to play and contribute. Everyone is training well, they\u2019re really up for the game and we\u2019re not thinking further ahead than tomorrow.\u201d Asked about what kind of game he was expecting against Portugal, Santos didn\u2019t beat around the bush. \u201cIt will be a very hard match, with two teams that like to hold onto the ball, that like possession,\u201d he said. \u201cSwitzerland also like to play long balls, utilising the characteristics of players like [Haris] Seferovi\u0107; then there\u2019s [Xherdan] Shaqiri, who likes to hold the ball up. They are full of quality players. Our job is to think about ourselves \u2026 and to impose our game. The Portuguese national team, playing at home, want to bring joy to their fans.\u201d Porto\u2019s Estadio Do Drago is the venue, where European Champions Portugal are hosting Switzerland for a place in the final of the inaugural Nations League. Scheduled for Sunday night, it will pit the winners of tonight\u2019s game against whoever emerges victorious between England and the Netherlands in Guimaraes tomorrow night. The losers will contest a third-place play-off on Sunday afternoon. Kick-off this evening is at 7.45pm (BST), but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.",

Ronaldo had to hand over the ball and watch, hands on hips, as Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez levelled the game from 12 yards. It was mystifying what infringement Brych had seen when, in reality, Zuber had tripped himself up. The referee had got it wrong, just as he did earlier in the match when Portugal\u2019s Bruno Fernandes and the Swiss captain, Granit Xhaka, should have been sent off for a pair of wild challenges.</p> <p>At 1-0, Switzerland could consider themselves unfortunate to be behind when they had been the more dangerous side for long spells. Xherdan Shaqiri thrived in his central role, operating just behind Haris Seferovic, who clipped the top of the crossbar with one effort late in the first half.</p> <p>All the time, however, there was the possibility that Ronaldo could conjure up some more of his precious magic. One moment, in particular, stood out: a no-look pass to split open the Swiss defence and send Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix running through the middle. It was a brilliant piece of deception and deserved a better finish than the 19-year-old debutant could provide.</p> <p>Ronaldo was also guilty of a bad miss in the first half but it would be remarkably po-faced to dwell on that for too long when, ultimately, it was another night that left a football crowd in thrall of his enduring qualities. Ronaldo had the ball as a souvenir and, on this evidence, he will take some stopping when Portugal return to this stadium on Sunday.</p>",

Ronaldo had the ball in his hands at the time, waiting to take the penalty, but Brych had decided to penalise Nelson Semedo for an innocuous\u2011looking challenge on Steven Zuber in Switzerland\u2019s previous attack. Ronaldo had to hand over the ball and watch, hands on hips, as Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez levelled the game from 12 yards. It was mystifying what infringement Brych had seen when, in reality, Zuber had tripped himself up. The referee had got it wrong, just as he did earlier in the match when Portugal\u2019s Bruno Fernandes and the Swiss captain, Granit Xhaka, should have been sent off for a pair of wild challenges. At 1-0, Switzerland could consider themselves unfortunate to be behind when they had been the more dangerous side for long spells. Xherdan Shaqiri thrived in his central role, operating just behind Haris Seferovic, who clipped the top of the crossbar with one effort late in the first half. All the time, however, there was the possibility that Ronaldo could conjure up some more of his precious magic. One moment, in particular, stood out: a no-look pass to split open the Swiss defence and send Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix running through the middle. It was a brilliant piece of deception and deserved a better finish than the 19-year-old debutant could provide. Ronaldo was also guilty of a bad miss in the first half but it would be remarkably po-faced to dwell on that for too long when, ultimately, it was another night that left a football crowd in thrall of his enduring qualities. Ronaldo had the ball as a souvenir and, on this evidence, he will take some stopping when Portugal return to this stadium on Sunday.",

This is good cricket from both sides: settle in for a belter, I reckon. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cf7b8a78f08fbcfe9d50dd5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-05T12:44:50.976Z\">1.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>4th over: Bangladesh 15-0 (Tamim 11, Soumya 4) </strong>Tamim nails a cut which extra cover half stops, enough to allow them through for a couple.

They are, man for man, just a better team than the Proteas, who as we speak are being ground into a fine dust by the well-rested Indians. Can you say the same about New Zealand, though?</p> <p><strong>Again, they are a side routinely underestimated,</strong> pegged as dark horses in basically every tournament they enter, despite being runners-up last time and getting to the semi-final in six previous editions of the tournament. Their batting might not be enormously star-studded this time but their bowling attack is deadly, as the hapless Sri Lankans discovered in Cardiff. </p> <p><strong>Might this be Bangladesh\u2019s last chance of doing something serious at a World Cup for a while, though?</strong> The players that have been the core of their team for a decade and more are all now in their 30s - Tamim Iqbal is 30, Mushfiqur Rahim is 31, Shakib-al-Hasan is 32, Mahmudullah is 33, Mashrafe Mortaza is 35. Beating New Zealand today could set them on the way to doing that something serious. </p> <p><strong>So a game between underdogs who aren\u2019t really underdogs and dark horses who aren\u2019t really dark horses.</strong> Should be good.

      "bodyText": "And with that, my race is run. Thanks for sharing these moments with me. Bye! You can find the latest table here: Kane Williamson is a relieved man: I thought the first innings was outstanding, the fielding from both teams was outstanding. We knew that 250 was potentially challenging. It wasn\u2019t our most clinical effort with the bat. It was nice to hold on and get over the line. It was just one of those surfaces that tends to make for a good game of cricket. A match that looked pretty humdrum for a long while, and turned into a tension-packed dramafest in the final hour. In the end, however, the team that always seemed likely to win, won. If Mishfiqur hadn\u2019t messed up that run-out, though... While you wait for a report on this game, here\u2019s a report on today\u2019s other one: New Zealand become the only team (so far) to win their first two matches, and top the fledgling table. Ross Taylor is named player of the match. We were very nervous at the end there. They put a lot of pressure on us and it could have gone either way. We thought maybe 270, 280 was a good total out there, but they kept putting pressure on us and kept taking wickets. It was good to get over the line at the end of the day. This just about sums it up: 48.1 overs: New Zealand 248-8 (Santner 16, Ferguson 4) Santner hits the first ball of Mustafizur\u2019s over through midwicket, and it\u2019s all over! 47th over: New Zealand 244-8 (Santner 13, Ferguson 4) Having taken a wicket with a full toss Shaifuddin tries it again first up to Lockie Ferguson, who is saved by an edge into his pads. The tension! Then he decides to end the over with a bouncer, which is too high and called wide! Bangladesh do not want to be handing out freebies! And then another wide down leg! And then Ferguson edges the third last ball of the over, which rolls away for four! The scores are level! Henry plays across a slow full toss, and it floats right into middle stump! 46th over: New Zealand 235-7 (Santner 10, Henry 6) Now Bangladesh turn to the Fizz, and Henry half-volleys to the long-off boundary! Then one goes just wide of the blue line, handing the Kiwis a bonus run. They\u2019re just 10 away now! 45th over: New Zealand 227-7 (Santner 7, Henry 2) Saifuddin gets one to rap Santner\u2019s pads, but the appeal lands on deaf ears. It flicks the front pad and thuds the back, and perhaps the two sounds save him ... nope, turns out it pitched fractionally outside leg, great decision from Paul Reiffel! The next ball is edged, and there\u2019s no slip to stop it going for four! Just 18 needed, from 30 balls! 44th over: New Zealand 220-7 (Santner 1, Henry 1) On Sky the commentators are befuddled at the decision to bring back Mosaddek when Mustafizur has overs in the bank. Two runs and a wicket later, it seems a pretty wise move. Incredible scenes! Neesham chips the ball straight to long off! 43rd over: New Zealand 218-6 (Neesham 25, Santner 0) 27 runs needed. They couldn\u2019t, could they? A slow-ball bouncer, and De Grandhomme makes a last-moment decision to push the ball over Mushfiqur as it passes his chin. Bad move, bud: the pace he thought he was using doesn\u2019t actually exist, and he sends it looping into the keeper\u2019s gloves! 42nd over: New Zealand 212-5 (Neesham 24, De Grandhomme 10) The Fizz is back, and Neesham hits through cover for four. Then there\u2019s a wide - the last three overs have featured two wides and a no-ball, which isn\u2019t exactly ideal - and finally De Grandhomme miscues the ball in the air right over the head of the fielder at short midwicket! 41st over: New Zealand 205-5 (Neesham 19, De Grandhomme 9) There are actual fireworks happening but not at the Oval, but somewhere near the Palace of Westminster. Shakib completes his allocation, which has cost 47 runs and brought the wickets of both Kiwi openers. 40th over: New Zealand 200-5 (Neesham 18, De Grandhomme 6) Mortaza oversteps, and De Grandhomme cracks the free hit over extra cover for four! 200 up, 45 needed, 10 overs to go. 39th over: New Zealand 193-5 (Neesham 17, De Grandhomme 1) Nerves! Welcome back, we\u2019ve been missing you! New Zealand need 52, with 11 overs remaining. They could, you know! Taylor gets a slight nick on a ball heading down leg, and Mushfiqur collects! 38th over: New Zealand 191-4 (Taylor 82, Neesham 16) Four more for the Kiwis. Could Bangladesh possibly engineer another breakthrough? 37th over: New Zealand 187-4 (Taylor 81, Neesham 13) Though recent events have added some welcome tension to proceedings New Zealand are only a few good, aggressive shots from taking this game away from Bangladesh for good, and Neesham seems ready to provide them, hitting successfully if not very handsomely through midwicket. Then Taylor edges, and Mustafizur chases it down, leans over and flicks the ball away from the rope just as his toe lands upon it. Another four! 36th over: New Zealand 177-4 (Taylor 76, Neesham 8) Runs! From nowhere, Neesham sends the ball steepling over midwicket, the ball landing on the rope for six! 35th over: New Zealand 169-4 (Taylor 75, Neesham 1) Two singles and a brace off the last, the second run not without risk - a more accurate throw and Taylor would have been in trouble. 34th over: New Zealand 165-4 (Taylor 72, Neesham 0) Five dots off Mehidy and then very nearly a suicidal single off the last, which is nudged to short leg, well fielded and the stumps hit, but Neesham is in by the riskiest, whiskiest whisker. 33rd over: New Zealand 164-4 (Taylor 71, Neesham 0) A single and a wide off Mosaddek Hossain\u2019s over. In this innings New Zealand have either been focused on consolidation, in which case their progress has been slow but safe, or on self-destruction. 32nd over: New Zealand 162-4 (Taylor 70, Neesham 0) That was technically poor from Williamson, who takes his top hand off the handle and gets nothing like the power he needed on that kind of shot. Bangladesh bring a slip in for Latham, and the first ball he faces drifts and turns and slides past the edge! And then he scoops the last ball of the over straight to a fielder! Two wickets in the over, and that has changed everything (potentially)! What is going through Latham\u2019s head here? He heaves the ball to deep square leg, where it\u2019s well caught by Saifuddin, running forwards and diving to complete the catch. New Zealand were strolling and now Kane Williamson is strolling back to the hutch, after hoisting the ball to deep midwicket where it\u2019s easily caught! 31st over: New Zealand 160-2 (Williamson 40, Taylor 69) You want fireworks? I\u2019ll give you fireworks! New Zealand, meanwhile, score two singles. 30th over: New Zealand 158-2 (Williamson 39, Taylor 68) Mehidy bowls, and Taylor drives deliciously through extra cover. 87 runs needed now, and 120 balls to play with. 29th over: New Zealand 153-2 (Williamson 39, Taylor 63) Shaifuddin bowls, and three more singles go on the board. This is turning into the most slow-paced and predictably-concluded cricketing stroll since Ian Botham set off from John o\u2019Groats. 28th over: New Zealand 150-2 (Williamson 38, Taylor 61) At this stage New Zealand are sauntering to their target. Shakib bowls and they take five, in more ways than one. Three singles and a brace is plenty enough. Will their focus turn at some stage towards their net run rate, or are they happy to bag some patient points? 27th over: New Zealand 145-2 (Williamson 37, Taylor 57) New Zealand need 100 runs now, and have plenty of time to get them. 26th over: New Zealand 138-2 (Williamson 35, Taylor 54) After half the over the win predictor gives New Zealand a 99% chance of success. If only Bangladesh had been given a chance to break this partnership before it really got going, eh? 25th over: New Zealand 138-2 (Williamson 35, Taylor 53) Taylor lifts the ball over point to complete a 39-ball 50. It\u2019s his first ODI half-century. He has averaged an unlikely 80.71 over the last two years. \u201cAddng to Abhijato Sensarma\u2019s thoughts, Tilda Swinton was also the Angel Gabriel in Constantine. Bringer of big news, and all that,\u201d writes Damian Clarke. \u201cMakes you think, eh?\u201d 24th over: New Zealand 127-2 (Williamson 32, Taylor 46) Mosaddek bowls, and four more singles will do for the Black Caps, who need 4.5 an over from here on in. 23rd over: New Zealand 123-2 (Williamson 30, Taylor 44) Taylor cuts the first ball of Mustafiz\u2019s over for four, and cameras cut to a group of Guardian sports desk staff in the Oval crowd. Hi guys! Williamson then edges the last ball of the over, but the ball lands a foot short of the keeper. He\u2019s got some full-on fairy godmother wicket-protecting magic happening today. 22nd over: New Zealand 116-2 (Williamson 29, Taylor 38) Four more runs in ones and twos, off Mosaddek Hossain. 21st over: New Zealand 110-2 (Williamson 27, Taylor 34) Mustafizur fizzes in, and concedes a brace of singles. This is all a bit sober at the moment. 20th over: New Zealand 110-2 (Williamson 27, Taylor 34) Mosaddek Hossain now, and Taylor cuts his first ball past point for four. He\u2019s later presented with an opportunity to repeat the shot, misses it completely and pounds his bat with his fist in frustration. 19th over: New Zealand 105-2 (Williamson 27, Taylor 29) Four more singles. New Zealand have wisely scaled back the fireworks, and the idiotic running. \u201cKeep in mind that Tilda Swindon can see the future in the MCU,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cIf she somehow does the same here ... Does she know something about Bangladesh we don\u2019t?\u201d 18th over: New Zealand 101-2 (Williamson 25, Taylor 27) Shakib continues, and Taylor thumps the ball through the covers for four. Add a three, a couple of twos and a single and you get a profitable over and New Zealand into triple figures. 17th over: New Zealand 90-2 (Williamson 23, Taylor 18) A lovely shot from Williamson, pure economy of effort as he sends the ball past point, just too far from any fielder for it to be worth them trying to stop it. 16th over: New Zealand 85-2 (Williamson 18, Taylor 18) The actor Tilda Swinton is in the audience, and unexpectedly wearing a Bangladesh shirt. A quick internet search suggests she has visited the country at least twice, but I can\u2019t find any evidence that she has ever said anything enthusiastic about cricket. 15th over: New Zealand 82-2 (Williamson 16, Taylor 17) Shaifuddin now. Williamson edges, and the ball passes through a vacant cordon and down to third man. Four singles, and then Taylor pulls the final ball of the over for four. 14th over: New Zealand 74-2 (Williamson 14, Taylor 11) New Zealand go for another crazy single, and Taylor slides home by an inch. Given the state of the game, there is some very strange decision-making going on. \u201cThe Kiwis want to choke desperately, but Bangladesh want to choke even more,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cIncredible nerves!\u201d 13th over: New Zealand 70-2 (Williamson 11, Taylor 10) Though what Ross Taylor was doing calling that completely idiotic run is beyond me. All in all, that was totally amateurish cricket from both teams. The ground has gone quiet, and Williamson has a go at waking them up again by steering the ball straight to point, but it lands just short of the fielder. 12th over: New Zealand 67-2 (Williamson 9, Taylor 9) The really galling thing about that missed run-out chance is that if Mushfiqur had just left he ball alone, if he had walked the other way and not got involved, the ball would have hit middle stump. That was a howling cock-up of the most egregious kind. New Zealand go for a suicide run and Williamson is run out by three yards! But Mushfiqur gets excited about whats about to happen, throws his hands through the stumps, dislodges both bails before the ball gets to him and the batsman is thus saved! 11th over: New Zealand 60-2 (Williamson 7, Taylor 4) Mortaza bowls too wide at Taylor, who sends it bouncing past point for four. The game is nicely poised right now but New Zealand could whip it away in short order unless more wickets fall. 10th over: New Zealand 55-2 (Williamson 6, Taylor 0) I can only think of one genuinely attacking shot played by New Zealand since Guptill got out, and Munro basically paid the price for holding back, prodding at a ball he could have thwacked. Another one! Munro clips the ball to midwicket, where Mehidy dives forward to catch the ball just before it lands! 8th over: New Zealand 53-1 (Munro 23, Williamson 5) A couple more singles off Mehedi. Still no hurry. Meanwhile it\u2019s all over in Southampton, where India have inflicted another defeat on South Africa, winning by six wickets. 8th over: New Zealand 51-1 (Munro 22, Williamson 4) Just the single run off Shakib. No hurry. 7th over: New Zealand 50-1 (Munro 22, Williamson 3) Munro sweeps the final ball of Mehedi\u2019s over to deep square leg, where it bounces once before clearing the rope. New Zealand are going to canter to this total unless a few more wickets fall fairly sharpish. 6th over: New Zealand 43-1 (Munro 17, Williamson 1) Well that was all action. Shakib comes on, takes a wicket with his first ball, and his second is thumped down the ground for six by Munro. Then Bangladesh reckon they\u2019ve got Williamson first ball, but it turns out they don\u2019t. The ball was clearing leg stump by a few inches, and Bangladesh surrender their review in an act of pure optimism. Didn\u2019t look like it to me, but Bangladesh think it\u2019s worth a spin! Guptill tries to punish the first ball of another owner, but sends it down the throat of Tamim at long off! 5th over: New Zealand 35-0 (Guptill 25, Munro 10) Mustafizur Rahman now, and Munro produces his best shot so far, driving through cover for four. The Fizz responds with the best delivery so far, an excellent yorker. 4th over: New Zealand 30-0 (Guptill 24, Munro 6) Now Guptill sweeps, and that\u2019ll be another four. When Guptill has faced the first ball of an over, it\u2019s gone for four, six and four. The batsmen have faced precisely 12 balls each, and are scoring at precisely two and 0.5 a ball respectively. 3rd over: New Zealand 25-0 (Guptill 19, Munro 6) Guptill pulls the ball through midwicket, and that is gorgeous! The next, another shortish delivery and another pull, comes off the splice but lands safe. Then Munro gets in on the boundary act, diverting the ball past point for four. 2nd over: New Zealand 15-0 (Guptill 14, Munro 1) Mehedy Hasan brings some early spin, and his first delivery disappears into the stands. Guptill is in the mood for dancing. Munro has faced two balls more than he has, and scored one. \u201cFor Bangladesh to defend this successfully they will need to bowl and field like tigers,\u201d notes Brian Withington. \u201cAnd possibly post a machine gun nest at extra cover to keep the NZ batsmen pinned down?\u201d 1st over: New Zealand 7-0 (Guptill 7, Munro 0) Guptill mistimes his pull from the first ball, but the ball limps to the rope anyway, with midwicket practically deserted. The next ball heads in a similar direction, but even more slowly. All the runs come from the first half of the over. Mashrafe Mortaza has the ball and is standing, hands on hips, waiting to be waved into action by the nearest umpire. Out come the batsmen. The players are just lurking on the boundary, waiting for their moment to take centre stage. I\u2019m not sure the other match is much of a thriller, with India basically needing a run a ball off the last 60 with plenty of wickets in hand, but it has certainly had its moments. We\u2019ll see if this one earns that status, but fingers crossed. Hello world! It\u2019s 13 years since a team successfully defended a score below 300 at the Oval, and 244 is quite a long way below 300. Add No2, No9 and No13 in the ODI batting rankings, and it is clear which team will be the most chuffed at this point. A neutral, I think, always quite likes a first-innings total which can only win the game if the team commits fully to attacking when it\u2019s their turn to bowl. The signposts are clear, and all directions lead to fun. That\u2019s all from me. It\u2019s over to Simon Burnton to guide you gently through the New Zealand innings. Direct your emails to him here, or tweet @Simon_Burnton. This is about The Other Sport, but Ben Fisher has written about the Bangladesh football team, and the Englishman in charge of them. Ah, the old cardinal sin of not batting out the overs. Might be slightly harsh to blame Bangladesh too much for all of that, because New Zealand were absolutely terrific with the ball, particularly Santner, Ferguson in spells and Boult. You\u2019d expect them to knock these off, but it will be interesting to see how they cope with the extra spin options from Bangladesh. Shaifuddin, knowing he has five balls to swing from his toes and get this total up, does indeed swing from those toes but alas misses the ball entirely, and he\u2019s knocked over. Boult had spent the time between over frantically waving at his captain and bowler asking where he needed to be, but found exactly the right spot eventually, pouching down at third man after Mortaza gets a big, thick outside edge up in the air. 49th over: Bangladesh 244-8 (Shaifuddin 29, Mortaza 1) Boult tries another slowie but gets it wrong, and it flicks off Shaifuddin\u2019s knees and down for four leg-byes. He then tries a yorker, gets it absolutely right but Shaifuddin digs it out and it deflects down for another boundary to the same spot. Mehidy tries to come down the track, Boult drops one short and at his body, he swings himself off his toes trying for a big hook, but gets a faint nick through to the keeper. 48th over: Bangladesh 235-7 (Shaifuddin 25, Mehidy 7) Henry is on to bowl. The batsmen scamper through for a couple of twos, Mehidy tries to get funky by stepping about three feet outside off stump and clipping one to short fine-leg, Shaifuddin slaps one to point but they can\u2019t get the boundaries they badly need at this stage. 47th over: Bangladesh 228-7 (Shaifuddin 24, Mehidy 2) A series of leg-glanced singles completes the over from Boult. Five runs from it in total, which isn\u2019t enough, you\u2019d imagine. Here\u2019s Trent Boult, who has two overs left in the bank. Mosaddek tries to hit him over the Thames, but sends it vertical and Guptill settles \u2018neath it and takes the catch in the calm manner of someone you\u2019d trust to catch your baby if you had to throw it from a burning building. 46th over: Bangladesh 223-6 (Mosaddek 11, Shaifuddin 21) Ferguson mixes up his pace, some quick ones and a slower ball bouncer, but Shaifuddin takes one of them downtown, a big slap over cow corner for four. They\u2019re starting to get a wriggle on now, but you suspect it\u2019s too little, too late. 45th over: Bangladesh 215-6 (Mosaddek 9, Shaifuddin 16) Having survived the review, Shaifuddin celebrates by sticking the last ball of Santner\u2019s spell way over cow corner for six gratefully received runs. There was the featheriest of feather edges on the ball before it reached the pad, and in any case it was probably missing off stump. Santner\u2019s in for his last over, and Shaifuddin takes a big hoik across the line, then goes down on one knee to try a fine sweep but misses. It hits the pad, the umpire says no lbw but the take it upstairs... 44th over: Bangladesh 205-6 (Mosaddek 8, Shaifuddin 7) Ferguson takes the pace off one to Mosaddek, who jabs an edge just, just, just short of Latham behind the stumps. Another tight over though, three from it and Bangladesh\u2019s expectations are dropping by the minute. 43rd over: Bangladesh 202-6 (Mosaddek 7, Shaifuddin 5) Four runs for Shaifuddin and it\u2019s thanks to a rare bit of iffy fielding, as he back cuts, Henry chases, reaches the ball but can only scoop it onto the boundary marker. Lovely bowling from Santner, who has got most of his success by angling things in on a tight line, but switches things up with a slower, looping, wide ball that Mahmudullah has to reach for, but can only toe-end the thing to Williamson in the covers. 42nd over: Bangladesh 195-5 (Mahmadullah 19, Mosaddek 6) Mahmadullah backs away and exposes his stumps to Ferguson, which is a bold strategy, and only gets a single from it, carved through the covers. Mosaddek tries the same and doesn\u2019t even get one thanks to some spiffing fielding by Santner. 41st over: Bangladesh 192-5 (Mahmadullah 17, Mosaddek 5) Santner\u2019s back, from the Vauxhall end this time when his previous seven overs had all been from the Pavilion. He gets a bit of turn and induces an edge, but an edge through a vacant slip region and Mosaddek picks up two. 40th over: Bangladesh 188-5 (Mahmadullah 14, Mosaddek 4) Bowling change, as Ferguson gets another blast. His first spell was terrific, his second ropey: which will we get here? The answer is lots of stuff outside off, and most of the shots are directed towards Guptill at point, which he broadly deals with, one smacking him rather painfully on the forearm. Just two runs from the over, though. 39th over: Bangladesh 186-5 (Mahmadullah 13, Mosaddek 3) They need to push things somehow here, and one option is to go for rapid singles. They do just that twice, possibly saved by a couple of just askew throws by Guptill. Just. 38th over: Bangladesh 182-5 (Mahmadullah 11, Mosaddek 1) Bit of a pickle for Bangladesh. They\u2019ll be doing well to get 250 from here. Ooof: ugly. Mithun takes a step or two down the track, Henry sees him coming and bowls short, Mithun tries the hook anyway but sends it high, high into the south London air and de Grandhomme casually pouches the steepler. 37th over: Bangladesh 179-4 (Mithun 26, Mahmadullah 10) Boult keeps things relatively tight for three balls, then concedes a leg-bye, a wide, then Mithun plays the most delicate dab through what would have been about third slip for a boundary, then a less delicate hook that might have got more than a single had it been a yard or two wide of the fielder. A good over for Bangladesh, in the scheme of things. 36th over: Bangladesh 172-4 (Mithun 21, Mahmadullah 10) Double pacers now, as Matt Henry returns to the attack. Williamson wants a wicket to really apply boot to throat. But hello! Mithun drops to one knee and ramps him for a one-bounce four, perhaps not quite directed as he\u2019d like but they\u2019ll 100% take it. He tries a lofted one over mid-on, but doesn\u2019t get all of it, the ball plugs over the fielder\u2019s shoulder and they settle for two. 35th over: Bangladesh 166-4 (Mithun 15, Mahmadullah 10) Oh look, it\u2019s Trent Boult back into the attack, for the first time since the 10th over. Two runs from the over, exactly the same as the number of eyebrow-shaving bouncers that Boult sent down at serious pace. 34th over: Bangladesh 164-4 (Mithun 14, Mahmadullah 9) Tricky situation for Bangladesh here. They can\u2019t really afford to take too many more risks, but equally they need to get the run rate above five, and it\u2019s currently below. Three runs from that over, delivered by Santner. 33rd over: Bangladesh 161-4 (Mithun 13, Mahmadullah 7) If de Grandhomme was a club cricketer he\u2019d probably be nicknamed \u2018toothache\u2019. His deliveries aren\u2019t much more than dobbers, but they\u2019re accurate dobbers and Bangladesh struggle to get them away, three runs this time, all to Mahmadullah. 32nd over: Bangladesh 158-4 (Mithun 13, Mahmadullah 4) Mahmadullah goes this close to chopping onto his stumps off Santner, but it misses. Another terrific over from the left-armer, who Bangladesh are finding very difficult to pick up. 31st over: Bangladesh 155-4 (Mithun 12, Mahmadullah 2) De Grandhomme looks a bit like a Hollywood leading man from the 50s, all broad shoulders and strong jaw and swept, black hair. Would Cary Grant be able to take a crucial wicket and concede a relatively economical four runs from an over at a crucial stage of the game? Not likely. Huge. De Grandhomme might have been lucky to stay on after his last over, but stay on he does and Shakib rocks back, tries to cut and feathers one through to Latham. He looks thoroughly vexed as he stalks off the field. 30th over: Bangladesh 151-3 (Shakib 64, Mithun 11) Santner back to the economical stuff as the batsmen nudge him around for three singles. This really is a terrific match: really good bowling and some excellent counter-attacking batting. 29th over: Bangladesh 148-3 (Shakib 62, Mithun 10) Ferguson is given the hook, de Grandhomme in his place, but he drops down a lovely gentle long hop that Shakib gives the treatment, out to deep mid-wicket. Another is slashed just - just - over short third man and Shakib is on a one-man mission to get this total up. He\u2019s on 62 from 62 balls now, and the run rate is up above five. 28th over: Bangladesh 137-3 (Shakib 51, Mithun 10) Shakib does the seemingly implausible and gets Santner off the square, going to his half century with a cut that Ferguson dashes around to third man and keeps them to three. Seven runs from that Santner over, nearly double what they got from his previous three. 27th over: Bangladesh 130-3 (Shakib 46, Mithun 8) Ferguson hasn\u2019t looked quite as spicy since returning: Shakib deals with him reasonably well, taking three simple runs before he sends three down Mithun\u2019s leg side for wides, the last being a touch harsh given how far he\u2019d stepped across his stumps. Mithun then gets every little bit of a pull and sends it flying to the square leg fence for a boundary. 26th over: Bangladesh 120-3 (Shakib 43, Mithun 4) More watertight bowling from Santner, the only runs being a dabbed/edged two by Mithun from his first ball. He\u2019s conceded four runs from three overs. 25th over: Bangladesh 118-3 (Shakib 43, Mithun 2) With a new man in Williamson goes for the throat: probably quite literally, given the pace and lengths Ferguson has been bowling. BUT WAIT: Bangladesh actually deal with it pretty well, pushing some singles (which the batsmen almost run into each other completing) and then Shakib tickles a four off his hip, down to fine leg. His fastest has been 148.3 kph apparently, with an average of 143.6 - that\u2019s about 92/88 mph. Rapid. 24th over: Bangladesh 110-3 (Shakib 37, Mithun 0) Another terrific over from Santner, just two runs coming from it and the pressure from his bowling probably contributing to the ludicrous run-out. Oh boy. Mushfiqur pushes one between extra cover and point for what looks for a sharp but relatively straightforward single, but Shakib rather bafflingly decides against it, sends him back but far too late, and he\u2019s not even in the frame as Latham completes the formalities from Guptill\u2019s throw. 23rd over: Bangladesh 108-2 (Shakib 36, Mushfiqur 18) Neesham comes back for a second over, and it might well just be one more as Bangladesh - and in fairness have no choice here - target him. Shakib takes his first three balls for four, the first a pull in front of square and the other two slashes between deep point and third man. A wide, two singles and a two caps a Bangladesh\u2019s best over of the match, 17 runs coming from it. 22nd over: Bangladesh 91-2 (Shakib 21, Mushfiqur 17) The Neesham Experiment lasted one over, and it\u2019s a complete change of pace with Mitchell Santner\u2019s left arm spin into the attack. There\u2019s not much actual spin, but Santner\u2019s angle from round the wicket and bounce from his height proves tricky to shift off the square. Shakib sets off for a single but is immediately sent from whence he came, and requires a little treatment after taking some skin off his elbow with the dive that got him home safely. A maiden over is completed, a rare, rare thing these days, smart captaincy from KW. 21st over: Bangladesh 91-2 (Shakib 21, Mushfiqur 17) Now then. After a barren run Mushfiqur is getting the taste for it, wandering outside off stump to ramp de Grandhomme over the keeper\u2019s head for four. Some singles, and a clip off Shakib\u2019s pads for a couple means it\u2019s nine from that over, meaning they have now scored more in the last two overs than they did in the previous five. 20th over: Bangladesh 82-2 (Shakib 18, Mushfiqur 11) Huh. A bowling change, which I wasn\u2019t exactly expecting, as Jimmy Neesham replaces Ferguson. Maybe Williamson is keeping him fresh with short spells and bring him back for some wickets later, but there is a danger of relieving the pressure they\u2019ve built up over the last few overs. And sure enough, Shakib spins on a long hop and sends it to the deep backward square boundary, topping up the three relatively straightforward singles they\u2019d picked up earlier in the over. 19th over: Bangladesh 75-2 (Shakib 13, Mushfiqur 9) De Grandhomme obviously doesn\u2019t have Ferguson\u2019s pace, but he\u2019s just as economical, only the one run coming from his latest over, meaning Bangladesh\u2019s run rate has dropped below four an over. 18th over: Bangladesh 74-2 (Shakib 13, Mushfiqur 8) Ferguson tries around the wicket to the right-handed Mushfiqur with slips leg and conventional, which is interesting. And it almost pays off: one jumps at Mushfiqur, loops up off the shoulder of his bat and just goes over Martin Guptill. One almost gets trapped between Shakib\u2019s legs and nearly goes back onto his stumps, but there\u2019s so much spin the ball stops dead beneath him. Really, really good over, two runs from it. I would consider it a personal insult if you chose to follow India chasing 228 to beat South Africa with Tim de Lisle, but I also must present you with the options. 17th over: Bangladesh 72-2 (Shakib 13, Mushfiqur 7) Latham stands up to Shakib in order to keep him from stepping down the track, but not for Mushfiqur who uses the opportunity to advance and launch one high towards deep mid-wicket. He doesn\u2019t quite nail it, and Boult sprints around, dives, but just can\u2019t get to the catch and it bounces once before reaching the fence. Now, drinks. 16th over: Bangladesh 66-2 (Shakib 12, Mushfiqur 2) Ferguson sends down a snorter that jumps up at Mushfiqur and in the end he does well to drop his hands far enough not to take the edge. Otherwise, more tight stuff from Ferguson who now has figures of 3-0-5-1. Not bad. A little reading to accompany this game: England Women\u2019s big summer starts against West Indies on Thursday, so here\u2019s Raf Nicholson to set the scene. 15th over: Bangladesh 64-2 (Shakib 11, Mushfiqur 1) Tom Latham is standing up to de Grandhomme when Shakib is facing, gentle pace in comparison to the lightning Ferguson. Mushfiqur plays no shot to one that ducks in and smacks into his front knee, but it wasn\u2019t ducking far enough and they sensible decide not to review the not out call. 14th over: Bangladesh 62-2 (Shakib 10, Mushfiqur 0) Obviously this is not news, but there\u2019s some serious wheels on Ferguson. The only other runs from the over come via Mushfiqur\u2019s thigh pad, down to fine leg for a couple. Ferguson has three goes at a short ball: the first a wide, the second good but goes through, the third Tamim tries to hook but cloths it, and the ball loops gently to mid-wicket where Boult strolls in and takes the catch. 13th over: Bangladesh 59-1 (Tamim 24, Shakib 10) Another bowling change, with Colin de Grandhomme on, and another tight over. Really good contest this, a terrific quick bowling attack against some of the most exciting bats in the world, a contest that New Zealand are currently just on top of. 12th over: Bangladesh 56-1 (Tamim 22, Shakib 9) Bowling change, and here\u2019s slippery ol\u2019 Lockie Ferguson. Shakib nudges one out to square leg and Tamim wants a dicey second, but is sent back and just makes it but probably would have been on his way with a better throw from Boult. That and another single are the only two runs from a tight over from Ferguson, finished off with a typically vicious bumper. 11th over: Bangladesh 54-1 (Tamim 21, Shakib 8) Here\u2019s OB Jato: \u201cBangladesh are sensibly laying a platform in the initial overs, respecting the good balls which have been bowled. This is the mature cricket we need to see from them. Tamim and Shakib now need to play \u2018anchoring blinders\u2019, laying the platform for an end-overs assault from the likes of Mahmadullah, Mushfiqur and Mosaddek. Reaching 350+ is a must if they want to win. Let\u2019s see!\u201d That\u2019s reflected in this over, Shakib and Tamim not doing anything too flamboyant, nudging Henry all around the outfield to the tune of five runs from the over. 10th over: Bangladesh 49-1 (Tamim 20, Shakib 4) Couple of really good overs for New Zealand. Shakib struggles to get Boult through the infield and can only get three from it, although he connected pretty nicely with a pull to mid-wicket that arrowed in on a fielder. 9th over: Bangladesh 46-1 (Tamim 20, Shakib 1) \u201cArmchair Verdict,\u201d writes Abhijato Sensarma from his La-Z-Boy, \u201cI am calling this the Clash Of The Dark Horses. This will swing the momentum of both teams\u2019 campaigns. Against stronger teams like India, England and Australia, winning will be very tough. That leaves six matches for each side, out of which one has been played and won respectively. Hence, whoever takes the two points today has a much greater chance of winning the rest of the four required matches to make the semi-finals.\u201d Ah, the over-by-overer\u2019s curse. Henry pitches one up, Soumya plays a bit of a hacky shot across the line and loses his middle stump. Shame really. 8th over: Bangladesh 44-0 (Tamim 19, Soumya 25) Soumya thinks he has a boundary, admiring a fine flick that scoots towards the ropes, but de Grandhomme Klinsmanns across the turf to save two runs. Tamim then jumps onto a short ball and thrashes a shot to the mid-wicket fence with almost super-human speed: these two are getting going now, which should be terrific fun. 7th over: Bangladesh 36-0 (Tamim 14, Soumya 22) Henry nearly gets through Tamim with an in-dipper, but follows it up with one too wide and Soumya flays him through the covers, and after a couple of singles waits for a slower ball and batters it behind point. Two boundaries and some smart running, and Bangladesh take 12 from the over. 6th over: Bangladesh 24-0 (Tamim 12, Soumya 12) Terrific over from Boult: lots of tight lines, a nasty old short ball thrown in, just a couple of singles from it. They\u2019ll be delighted at restricting these two to four an over, you\u2019d imagine. 5th over: Bangladesh 22-0 (Tamim 11, Soumya 11) Soumya is batting like a man who skulled a pint of Red Bull with a pint of Monster as a chaser before the start of play. He jabs at a drive which flies off the inside edge, just missing the stumps for a couple, then hits a technically perfect, arrow-straight shot over the keeper\u2019s head for a one-bounce four. After Soumya nails a couple of shots perfectly but straight at fielders, Henry takes a bit off one that is edged to third man for a single. This is good cricket from both sides: settle in for a belter, I reckon. 4th over: Bangladesh 15-0 (Tamim 11, Soumya 4) Tamim nails a cut which extra cover half stops, enough to allow them through for a couple. Boult tickles his nose with a rapid short one, then follows it up with a classic one-two and a fuller one on the stumps, but Tamim flicks it off his pads and to the mid-wicket fence. Lovely stuff all round. 3rd over: Bangladesh 9-0 (Tamim 5, Soumya 4) Soumya picks up a couple with a nice shove through the covers but follows it up with a hideous hoik that he misses entirely. A bit like serving a urinal cake as pudding to a rib eye steak. Another tight over, that brace being the only two runs from the over, and you suspect that with these Bangladeshi batsmen fond of a hit, they\u2019ll be getting twitchy already. 2nd over: Bangladesh 7-0 (Tamim 5, Soumya 2) Trent Boult is on from the Vauxhall End, giving Soumya the perfect wide sighter, but he jerkily jabs at it, which might have been a little dangerous, but he gets himself a single to fine leg. A couple more singles from a neat over, and it\u2019s a pretty quiet start from Bangladesh. 1st over: Bangladesh 4-0 (Tamim 4, Soumya 0) Tamim peers at the first couple of balls from Henry, playing them with due caution, them jumps all over a straight one, flicking it off his pads to a very fine leg. Henry comes back nicely though, as you might expect, and that\u2019s the only scoring shot from the over. We\u2019re on. Matt Henry has the ball, Soumya Sarkar and Tamim Iqbal are ready to face up. The players are out, standing for the anthems, accompanied by a bunch of kids/mascots, some of whom are nearly taller than the more diminutive members of the Bangladesh side. Do New Zealand have the best set of fast bowlers in the tournament? Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins might have a word, Bhuvi Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah have a case, Jofra Archer has burst onto the international scene but it\u2019s tricky to beat Trent Boult, Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson. Tim Southee still isn\u2019t quite fit but he\u2019s barely missed with those three blasting away at the top. Bangladesh Tamim, Soumya, Shakib, Mushfiqur (wk), Mithun, Mahmudullah, Mosaddek, Shaifuddin, Mehidy, Mortaza (c), Mustafizur. New Zealand Guptill, Munro, Williamson (c), Taylor, Latham (wk), Neesham, de Grandhomme, Santner, Henry, Ferguson, Boult ...and will bowl. New Zealand have won the last three ODIs between these two, but they were all games in New Zealand in February. Arguably a more relevant encounter was on these shores in 2017, during the Champions Trophy, when Bangladesh chased down 266 with relative comfort, despite being pegged back to 33-4 in the 12th over. Centuries from Shaqib-al-Hasan and Mahmudullah did the trick, putting on a record 224 for the fifth wicket at better than a run a ball. We\u2019re into the guts of the World Cup now. After a few initial games that were troublingly one-sided, we\u2019ve now enjoyed some proper contests, and this one is likely to be no different, a couple of sides who sashayed to victories over fading giants in their first games but who now face more equal opponents. It\u2019s slightly difficult to get out of the mindset that Bangladesh are underdogs whoever they play, particularly against a team like South Africa, but their convincing victory at the Oval on Saturday wasn\u2019t really a particular shock. They are, man for man, just a better team than the Proteas, who as we speak are being ground into a fine dust by the well-rested Indians. Can you say the same about New Zealand, though? Again, they are a side routinely underestimated, pegged as dark horses in basically every tournament they enter, despite being runners-up last time and getting to the semi-final in six previous editions of the tournament. Their batting might not be enormously star-studded this time but their bowling attack is deadly, as the hapless Sri Lankans discovered in Cardiff. Might this be Bangladesh\u2019s last chance of doing something serious at a World Cup for a while, though? The players that have been the core of their team for a decade and more are all now in their 30s - Tamim Iqbal is 30, Mushfiqur Rahim is 31, Shakib-al-Hasan is 32, Mahmudullah is 33, Mashrafe Mortaza is 35. Beating New Zealand today could set them on the way to doing that something serious. So a game between underdogs who aren\u2019t really underdogs and dark horses who aren\u2019t really dark horses. Should be good. Stick around. Start: 13.30 BST",

It used to favour a soft version of Brexit (which is still the position of the overall Labour party in London) but now it has concluded that the option is no longer obtainable, and it is campaigning for remain. <strong>Jeremy Miles</strong>, the Welsh government\u2019s Brexit minister, made the announcement<a href=\"http://record.assembly.wales/Plenary/5662#A51426\"> in the Welsh assembly yesterday afternoon </a>(when many of us were focused on Donald Trump). He explained that the European elections, and the events in the Conservative party, where a new leader is likely to push for a no-deal Brexit, had persuaded the Welsh government to change its mind. He told AMs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The negotiations between the government and the opposition have broken down, destroyed by the jockeying for prominence of would-be Conservative leaders, and we know that there is no appetite in the parliamentary Conservative party for a form of Brexit that we had consistently advocated, one that retains participation in the single market and a customs union.</p> \n   <p>The prime minister is quitting and her deal is in tatters. It seems inevitable, given the bizarre process and the wholly unrepresentative electorate that will provide us with her successor, that in July we will have a prime minister who will demand, in a show of bravado, if nothing else, that the EU27 reopens negotiations of the withdrawal agreement. This will be rejected, and the government will set a course to a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit ...</p> \n   <p>We sought to reconcile the result of the 2016 referendum with the least damaging kind of Brexit, but that effort has now reached the end of the road.</p> \n   <p>The European elections have shown that the electorate remains profoundly divided, and, indeed, the split has widened, with many of those who voted for Brexit in the 2016 referendum now supporting no deal, and many, probably a majority, wanting us to remain within the European Union. Faced by this sort of binary choice, we are clear that, almost three years on from the referendum, and more than two years after we put forward \u2018Securing Wales\u2019 Future\u2019, we as a government must recognise these realities and change course ...</p> \n   <p>So, as a government, we will now campaign to remain in the EU. And to make that happen, parliament should now show the courage to admit it is deadlocked and legislate for a referendum, with \u2018remain\u2019 on the ballot paper. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Welsh government\u2019s new stance has been welcomed by the Scottish government, which is also anti-Brexit.

Stewart is strongly opposed to a no-deal Brexit. But the Brexiters in the contest have said they would accept no deal and Johnson has said the UK must leave the EU by 31 October, with or without a deal. Stewart told the Emma Barnett Show on Radio 5 Live:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m afraid [other leadership candidates] are misleading themselves and others, and that\u2019s going to be catastrophic, because the reality is that Europe is barely sitting through to the end of October.</p> \n   <p>Let\u2019s take a candidate like Boris.

But this week Corbyn gave the job to Long-Bailey. The party has not said why, but there is a suspicion that Thornberry (who has leadership aspirations) angered Corbyn\u2019s inner circle by pushing support for a second referendum after the European election results further than they would like. And Long-Bailey, a protege of John McDonnell, has for a while now been seen as the Corbynites\u2019 preferred candidate in the leadership contest that will take place when Corbyn retires. Giving her the PMQs slot will raise her profile.</p> \n  <p>That would have backfired if she had done badly, but she didn\u2019t.

Casualty figures on all sides were immense, with hundreds of thousands of soldiers, sailors, aviators and civilians killed or wounded in the days and weeks that followed.</p> \n   <p>We stand together today to honour the memory of those who paid the ultimate sacrifice on D-Day, and those many millions of men and women who lost their lives during the Second World War, the largest conflict in human history.</p> \n   <p>We affirm that it is our shared responsibility to ensure that the unimaginable horror of these years is never repeated.</p> \n   <p>Over the last 75 years, our nations have stood up for peace in Europe and globally, for democracy, tolerance and the rule of law. We re-commit today to those shared values because they support the stability and prosperity of our nations and our people. We will work together as allies and friends to defend these freedoms whenever they are threatened.</p> \n   <p><strong>We commit to work constructively as friends and allies to find common ground where we have differences of opinion and to work together to resolve international tensions peacefully.</strong></p> \n   <p>We will act resolutely, with courage and tenacity, to protect our people against threats to our values and challenges to peace and stability.</p> \n   <p>In this way, we salute the surviving veterans of D-Day and we honour the memories of those who came before us.</p> \n   <p>We will ensure that the sacrifices of the past are never in vain and never forgotten.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Mostly this is a conventional and rather bland restatement of democratic values. But the paragraph I\u2019ve highlighted in bold about working constructively together \u201cto find common ground ... and ... to resolve international tensions peacefully\u201d can be seen as an attempt to nudge President Trump away from isolationism and back towards upholding what is described as the rules-based international order (RBIO).</p> \n  <p>The Queen delivered a similar message to Trump <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/queens-subtle-message-donald-trump-16251317\">in her speech at the state banquet on Monday.</a></p> \n  <p>The 16 nations who have backed the

      "bodyText": "Tory leadership contenders further set out their stalls this evening. The health secretary Matt Hancock claimed that if elected Jeremy Corbyn would be \u201cthe first antisemitic leader of a western nation since the second world war\u201d. The comments were swiftly condemned by Labour, which claimed the Conservatives had \u201csupported governments that actively promote antisemitic policies in Hungary and Poland\u201d. At a One Nation hustings event, Michael Gove, Matt Hancock, Jeremy Hunt and Dominic Raab (see 7.04pm) elaborated on their Brexit plans. Gove said the UK\u2019s end of October Brexit deadline is \u201carbitrary\u201d and that he is \u201cnot wedded\u201d to it, Hancock appealed to the centre ground and seemed to focus less on Brexit, and Hunt talked up his skills as a \u201clifelong entrepreneur\u201d and said the leader needed to negotiate a better agreement than no-deal, while Raab told Tory MPs he would be prepared to temporarily shut down parliament to make sure Brexit happens by the deadline. Health secretary Hancock declared he would roll back some of the Tory reforms to the NHS which have seen large swathes of the health service privatised. (see 7.24pm) Donald Trump flew from Shannon airport to his golf resort in Doonbed, Co Clarewhere amid protests against the US military\u2019s use of Irish soil to transport military equipment and personnel. (see 8.20pm) Earlier in the day, Trump compared Ireland\u2019s post-Brexit border with Northern Ireland to the US border with Mexico, along which he wants to build a permanent wall. Veteran parachutists jumped over Normandy, 75 years since they did so as paratroopers on D-Day. Trump told Leo Varadkar that he was confident the Irish border situation would be fine after Brexit because some \u201cgood minds\u201d were working on it. However, yesterday afternoon, the US president met the Brexit party leader Nigel Farage and the Tory Brexiters Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson. All three claim that there is no reason why the Irish border should be a problem after Brexit, even in the event of no-deal. (see 6.19pm) The Labour-run government in Wales is now officially committed to remaining in the EU, and is campaigning for remain. (see 4.59pm) Rory Stewart, the international development secretary and a long-shot candidate for the Conservative party leadership, has said the Brexit policies being promoted by many of his rivals, such as Boris Johnson, would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the UK. I\u2019m afraid [other leadership candidates] are misleading themselves and others, and that\u2019s going to be catastrophic, because the reality is that Europe is barely sitting through to the end of October. D-day veterans and world leaders took part in an emotional ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of the Normandy landings, with a vast security operation safeguarding dignitaries including the Queen, Donald Trump and Theresa May. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and May\u2019s de facto deputy, has said the NHS \u201cis not and will not be up for sale\u201d in trade talks with the United States. Speaking at PMQs, in response to a question from Labour\u2019s Rebecca Long-Bailey, who was standing in for Jeremy Corbyn (quite successfully \u2013 see 2.16pm), Lidington said: The prime minister has been very clear and she spoke for everyone in the Government and on this side of the House - when it comes to trade negotiations, the NHS is not and will not be up for sale. Yesterday, at a news conference, President Trump said the NHS would be on the table in any trade talks with the UK. But in an interview broadcast this morning, he retracted that, saying: I don\u2019t see [the NHS] being on the table. Somebody asked me a question today and I say everything is up for negotiation, because everything is. But that\u2019s something I would not see as part of trade. That\u2019s not trade. The Brexit party\u2019s candidate in the Peterborough byelection was criticised for profiteering from buying and selling freeholds of hundreds of new homes. A one-woman show by the new Brexit party MEP Ann Widdecombe was cancelled in protest at her apparent endorsement of gay conversion therapy. We\u2019re now going to wrap up the live blog today. Thanks for reading, and for all your comments. Have a nice evening. Here is our report on tonight\u2019s Tory leadership hustings, courtesy of the Guardian\u2019s Heather Stewart and Rowena Mason. Meanwhile, Labour has challenged frontrunner Boris Johnson to disavow his previous denial of climate science. A peace camp was set up outside Shannon airport to demonstrate against Trump\u2019s arrival, with more than one hundred protesters listening to speeches, poems and music throughout the day. Many criticised Shannon Airport\u2019s use by the American military. In 2002, the Irish government agreed to provide landing and refuelling facilities to the US military at the airport, and close to three million US troops and their weapons have passed through in the years since. Wednesday\u2019s protest was organised by local group Shannonwatch, who hold bi-weekly demonstrations at the airport protesting the military. Politicians Catherine Connolly, the independent TD for Galway, newly elected MEP Clare Daly, and Labour TD for Limerick, Jan O Sullivan, were among the crowd who carried the flags of Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Palestine as well as signs and banners protesting Trump. Speaking at the event \u2013 amid a counter protest by about 20 Trump supporters \u2013 Connolly said she felt it important to stand against Trump\u2019s policies. I think President Trump\u2019s policies are not acceptable and it\u2019s unacceptable that we\u2019re using Shannon Airport to traffic American soldiers to wars all over the world, it\u2019s important to stand up for our neutrality. We should be a force for peace in the world. There\u2019s no doubt we have strong relations with America, but that doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that we should stand up for what is right. Saoirse Exton, 13, said the peace camp was her 15th protest and that she was there to stand against Trump\u2019s policies on climate change. I think climate change needs to be stopped and there\u2019s not enough action being taken on it. President Trump doesn\u2019t recognise climate change as a real cause, he pulled out of the Paris Climate agreement, and America has the biggest carbon emissions, and they\u2019re one of the biggest countries that need to take action. I want to preserve this earth for future generations, my generation are going to be the last generation if we don\u2019t do something about it. During the protests, letters were handed to a senior police officer to be passed on to Trump and the taoiseach Leo Varadkar. The letters called for an immediate end to the US military use of Shannon, and what they called \u201cIrish complicity in US military operations, and the environmental destruction of the planet\u201d. Donald Trump defended his environmental record after he was questioned over criticism from his Irish counterpart Michael D Higgins who claimed the US president\u2019s stance on climate change was \u201cregressive and pernicious\u201d. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard those comments,\u201d Trump said amid protests outside Shannon airport before boarding Marine One to fly to his five-star golf resort in Doonbed, Co Clare. But we have the cleanest air in the world in the United States and it\u2019s gotten better since I became president, we have the cleanest water, it is crystal clear, I always say I want crystal clear water and air, so I haven\u2019t heard his comments, but we are setting records environmentally. In a speech in Dublin on Tuesday night, Higgins criticised the US decision to withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate change accord. While the EU has a set of binding emissions targets for 2020 and 2030, we must now plan for full decarbonisation of our European economies by 2050, encouraging the rest of the world to follow suit, and urging in the strongest possible terms the USA to re-consider its regressive and pernicious decision to leave the global Paris Agreement. Environment secretary Michael Gove has said his three Cabinet positions were effectively an \u201capprenticeship\u201d for the top job. According to the Telegraph\u2019s deputy political editor, Steven Swinford, he claimed that he is no longer the neo-conservative he once was and highlighted criticism from Donald Trump over his \u201cweak kneed, lily-livered approach\u201d approach to Iran as evidence of how he has \u201cevolved\u201d. He also said that in hindsight the invasion of Iraq was the wrong decision. Gove went on to say that the deadline of 31 October to leave the EU is \u201carbitrary\u201d. \u201cIf we get to October, let\u2019s say we\u2019re 95% there, say we default to no deal. That would be a mistake,\u201d he is reported to have said \u2013 in opposition to Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab\u2019s positions on the issue. He warned that if government is \u201clocked on\u201d to a no deal, then that would lead to a confidence vote and possibly a general election. \u201cWe would lose that. We would have Corbyn propped up by Sturgeon. Therefore we must deliver Brexit\u201d. Suggesting some of his fellow candidates do not believe in the UK, Gove reportedly said: If you believe in this country then saying I\u2019m going to default to no deal actually isn\u2019t having confidence we will get a deal \u2018It\u2019s because I have confidence in this country and it\u2019s capacity to succeed that I believe we will get a deal. The Guardian\u2019s political correspondent Peter Walker has been examining the register of MP\u2019s interests ahead of the Tory leadership election. Elsewhere, wildcard candidate Rory Stewart is trumpeting his ability to draw a crowd. As one of the more social media savvy candidates, the secretary for international development livestreamed his event. Matt Hancock has told HuffPost UK that as PM he would repeal part of the government\u2019s reforms to privatise the NHS and end a requirement to tender services for outside work It follows calls from NHS bosses to scrap the controversial legislation, which has seen profit-driven health firms win health service contracts in England worth about \u00a310.5bn in the five years since the act came into force. As prime minister, the legislation to improve the way that the NHS works would be a priority for me. We are putting the bill together now, the proposals are very much borne of the NHS. The legislation includes removing some of the legal requirements to go to tender where that isn\u2019t appropriate. With time, it\u2019s been shown that it\u2019s better done a different way. I believe very strongly in the NHS free at the point of use, according to need not ability to pay, that it should be well funded. The central thrust is to try to remove some of the admin burdens and the overbearing legal requirements that have come as a consequence of the last set of reforms. The health secretary also pledged to partly reverse the student nursing bursary axed by the government in 2016, leading to a 30% fall in nursing degree applications. Hancock said there would be new \u201ctargeted support\u201d for mature students, mental health and community nurses under his leadership. There\u2019s a question of how you make sure the money we\u2019ve got goes as far as possible. There\u2019s an overall shortage of nursing. It isn\u2019t as big as the headline vacancy figures suggest. But there are acute shortages, especially in some specific areas like mental health nurses, and community nursing. I want to make sure that the approach we take is to support and incentivise people into those areas where we\u2019ve got shortages. Declaring that he doesn\u2019t need to see Donald Trump after his apparent U-turn over whether the NHS would be \u2018on the table\u2019 in a post-Brexit trade deal, Hancock said: I haven\u2019t sought [a meeting with Trump], I haven\u2019t been granted one. It\u2019s neither here nor there. As the President has confirmed this morning the NHS is not on the table for trade talks so there would be no reason to. He also said cyberflashing could be made illegal. Cyberflashing is absolutely disgusting and it\u2019s a really good case in point where what is illegal offline should also be illegal offline. If a man walked down the street and exposed himself to people who didn\u2019t want that to happen there are laws about that. And yet online it seems increasingly to happen and we need to tackle it. Yes the companies have got a responsibility and frankly their artificial intelligence algorithms should be able to work out what is and isn\u2019t an inappropriate picture but there\u2019s also a legal aspect here where we have the law and it needs to be applied properly. Should we change the law? If need be, like we did on upskirting yes. But the basis should be if it\u2019s illegal offline, it\u2019s illegal online too. I think in this area there\u2019s more work that can be done. Varadkar has spoken to reporters following his meeting with Trump. [Trump] said in the meeting he was aware that the sticking point in negotiations, one of the most difficult points in the negotiations, is the issue of the Irish border and he wants to keep that open and believes that can be done. We didn\u2019t go into any particular detail as to how he thinks it can be done but he understands that that has to be a shared objective - that if the UK is going to leave with a deal, that deal must involve legally-operable guarantees that we won\u2019t see the emergence of a hard border between north and south. [Trump] didn\u2019t elaborate on why he thinks Brexit would be good for Ireland. We very much discussed the different nature of the border and I explained that 20 or 30 years ago we did have a hard border between north and south, particularly when the Troubles were happening and there were customs posts and so on, and that everyone in Ireland - north and south, unionist and nationalist - want to avoid a return to a hard border, but that Brexit is a threat in that regard and an unintended consequence that we can\u2019t allow. Tory leadership contenders Michael Gove, Matt Hancock, Jeremy Hunt and Dominic Raab have been speaking at a One Nation group hustings this evening with chancellor Phillip Hammond in attendance. Former Brexit secretary Raab has been talking up his negotiating skills, arguing that he is the only contender with a credible plan. He said he had \u201cseen the EU upfront and personal\u201d and \u201cas Brexit secretary I looked our EU opposite numbers in the eyes\u201d. I know the strengths but also the weaknesses of their positions. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t just need a conviction Brexiteer. We need someone who is resolute, but someone who can navigate the rocky path ahead and get Brexit delivered. I\u2019m the candidate you can trust, who will give us the best shot of getting a better deal for the UK. Education minister Nadhim Zahawi, a supporter of Raab\u2019s campaign, said he would not rule out anything \u2013 except delaying Brexit once again, which would leave the UK with \u201czero credibility\u201d. In contrast, Gove is said to have suggested the October 31 Brexit deadline could be extended in order to secure a deal, according to George Eustice. He added that candidates offering \u201ceasy, simple answers\u201d by promising to leave on October 31 in any circumstance would \u201ccome unstuck\u201d. An MP who attended the Tory leadership hustings and did not wish to be named said: \u201cHe said that that is the date, but if it needs to move a day or a week in order to avoid something, then we shouldn\u2019t be wedded to a single date.\u201d On a no-deal scenario, the MP said of Gove: \u201cHe said it wouldn\u2019t be ideal, quite obviously. He\u2019s looking for movement on the back stop.\u201d An MP supportive of Hancock said the health secretary had warned the hustings about the possibility of a Labour government. The MP, who also did not want to be named, told reporters: \u201cHe said there would be a danger that we would have an anti-Semitic party with its hands on the levers of power.\u201d This was swiftly rebuffed by Labour, with a source calling it a \u201cbaseless political attack\u201d, according to the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar. Foreign Secretary Hunt told the hustings that parliament would block a no-deal Brexit, and therefore the Tories needed a leader who could negotiate a better agreement. Referring to himself as a lifelong entrepreneur, he suggested that could be him. At the moment we only have bad choices. We risk Parliament blocking no deal and the EU blocking a better deal, so we need a leader who can negotiate a new approach. I\u2019m an entrepreneur who has been doing deals all my life. I negotiated the new BBC licence fee and the new doctors\u2019 contract. I won\u2019t pretend this will be easy. I met (Emmanuel) Macron and (Angela) Merkel today in Portsmouth and a hardline approach will lead to a hardline response. They will wait for Parliament to block no deal. Here is a snapshot from the lobby: Tonight\u2019s hustings follows a similar event last night. The Spectator\u2019s Katy Balls was the only journalist allowed inside, as she chaired the meeting. Here\u2019s her report. Veteran parachutists are jumping over Normandy, 75 years since they did so as paratroopers on D-Day. Veterans Harry Read, 95, and John \u201cJock\u201d Hutton, 94, followed 97-year old fellow second world war survivor Tom Rice to descend upon Sannerville, in western France. \u201cIt went perfect, perfect jump,\u201d Rice said after his jump into roughly the same area, in fields of wildflowers outside Carentan, that he landed in on D-Day. \u201cI feel great. I\u2019d go up and do it all again.\u201d Rice jumped with the U.S. Army\u2019s 101st Airborne Division on that day 75 years ago, landing safely despite catching himself on the exit and a bullet striking his parachute. He called the 1944 jump the worst he had ever had. Read and Hutton arrived hours later than expected after their plans became fraught with technical difficulties, which then delayed the clearance they needed to enter French airspace. Speaking with reporters afterwards, Read said: I feel good. My health is good and my mind is still ticking away very nicely. I thought the jump was brilliant. I just had thoughts of anticipation after looking forward to it. Everything is worth the wait. The jump was wonderful in every way. I couldn\u2019t believe the drop was going to be postponed in any way because I had his assurance from God. If that had happened, I was going to be examining my faith. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll do another jump again. President Trump told Leo Varadkar that he was confident the Irish border situation would be fine after Brexit because some \u201cgood minds\u201d were working on it. He also said that in Britain he had met some \u201cvery good people\u201d who were heavily involved in Brexit. (See 5.55pm.) He did not say who these very good minds were, or what their solution to the border problem was. But we do know that yesterday afternoon, at the US ambassador\u2019s residence in London, he met the Brexit party leader Nigel Farage and the Tory Brexiters Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson. All three claim that there is no reason why the Irish border should be a problem after Brexit, even in the event of no-deal. And Duncan Smith and Paterson have been heavily promoting the \u201calternative arrangements\u201d border plan promoted by the Tory European Research Group, a new version of which was published by Steve Baker earlier today. (See 3.37pm.) So it is possible that Farage, Duncan Smith and Paterson were the \u201cgood minds\u201d whose plan for the Irish border has impressed Trump. But what do other experts think? Since the new ERG paper was published by Baker today, various experts have been commenting. And they have been damning. David Henig, director of the UK Trade Policy Project, has written a Twitter thread about it starting here. He concludes by saying the plan amounts to a \u201ctotal refusal to face up to the real world\u201d. And here is a Twitter thread from Steve Peers, a law professor. He says \u201canyone producing such dishonest [crap] in any other line of work would lose their professional reputation.\u201d And here is a Twitter threat from Peter Foster, the Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor. That is all from me for tonight. My colleague Mattha Busby is now taking over. This is what President Trump said when he spoke to reporters alongside Leo Varadkar, the Irish PM. We will be discussing various things. Probably you\u2019ll ask me about Brexit because I just left some very good people who are very much involved with Brexit, as you know. And I think that will all work out very well, and also for you with your wall, your border. I mean, we have a border situation in the United States, and you have one over here. But I hear it\u2019s going to work out very well ... It is an honour to be in Ireland with my friend, and he is doing a great job as your prime minister. Varadkar then explained that, actually, having a wall at the Irish border was precisely what he wanted to avoid. Trump accepted this. He went on: I think you do, I think you do. The way it works now is good, you want to try and to keep it that way. I know that\u2019s a big point of contention with respect to Brexit. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to work out very well. I know they\u2019re focused very heavily on it. In answer to a question about whether Brexit would be bad for Ireland, Trump said: I think it should be good. The big thing is going to be your border, and hopefully that\u2019s going to work out, and I think it will work out. There are a lot of good minds thinking about how to do it. And it\u2019s going to be just fine. I think ultimately it could even by very, very good for Ireland. But the border will work out. Here is a clip of President Trump talking to Leo Varadkar. I will post the quotes in a moment. President Trump has arrived in Ireland where he is holding talks with Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach (prime minister) before heading off to his golf course. As the BBC\u2019s Jayne McCormack reports, Trump claimed the border issue would not be a problem after Brexit. The Labour-run government in Wales is now officially committed to remaining in the EU. It used to favour a soft version of Brexit (which is still the position of the overall Labour party in London) but now it has concluded that the option is no longer obtainable, and it is campaigning for remain. Jeremy Miles, the Welsh government\u2019s Brexit minister, made the announcement in the Welsh assembly yesterday afternoon (when many of us were focused on Donald Trump). He explained that the European elections, and the events in the Conservative party, where a new leader is likely to push for a no-deal Brexit, had persuaded the Welsh government to change its mind. He told AMs: The negotiations between the government and the opposition have broken down, destroyed by the jockeying for prominence of would-be Conservative leaders, and we know that there is no appetite in the parliamentary Conservative party for a form of Brexit that we had consistently advocated, one that retains participation in the single market and a customs union. The prime minister is quitting and her deal is in tatters. It seems inevitable, given the bizarre process and the wholly unrepresentative electorate that will provide us with her successor, that in July we will have a prime minister who will demand, in a show of bravado, if nothing else, that the EU27 reopens negotiations of the withdrawal agreement. This will be rejected, and the government will set a course to a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit ... We sought to reconcile the result of the 2016 referendum with the least damaging kind of Brexit, but that effort has now reached the end of the road. The European elections have shown that the electorate remains profoundly divided, and, indeed, the split has widened, with many of those who voted for Brexit in the 2016 referendum now supporting no deal, and many, probably a majority, wanting us to remain within the European Union. Faced by this sort of binary choice, we are clear that, almost three years on from the referendum, and more than two years after we put forward \u2018Securing Wales\u2019 Future\u2019, we as a government must recognise these realities and change course ... So, as a government, we will now campaign to remain in the EU. And to make that happen, parliament should now show the courage to admit it is deadlocked and legislate for a referendum, with \u2018remain\u2019 on the ballot paper. The Welsh government\u2019s new stance has been welcomed by the Scottish government, which is also anti-Brexit. This is from Michael Russell, the Scottish Brexit minister. Under devolution the Welsh Labour party is free to divert from policy set in London, but nevertheless this development will encourage Labour MPs who want the national party to commit to supporting remain in a referendum. At the moment Jeremy Corbyn remains committed to getting a better version of Brexit, not to stopping it. (Thanks to philipphilip99 in the comments for flagging this up.) Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, claims that, if elected Tory leader, he would be \u201cthe first prime minister to have been an entrepreneur\u201d. He made the claim in a statement to the ConservativeHome website, responding to seven challenging questions it has set him. Here is the relevant question and answer. Q: There is a crisis of trust in the Tory party. And you are very much part of the party establishment \u2013 accomplished, long-serving, moderate, conventional. Are you the transformative leadership that the country needs right now? A: People often confuse continuity with loyalty. Throughout my nine years in cabinet, I\u2019ve always been a loyal team player, but as the first prime minister to have been an entrepreneur, I would take a very different approach. This is an exceptionally serious moment for our country. I think many of our members, supporters and the public are looking for an experienced leader with entrepreneurial flair to help us get the deal we need and look beyond Brexit. Hunt would certainly not be the first PM to have had a successful career \u2013 Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain both spring to mind \u2013 but Hunt\u2019s claim may be true if you define entrepreneur as someone who has set up a successful business. The ConservativeHome challenging questions for Tory leadership candidates are good. They have also come up with some for Boris Johnson and for Michael Gove, although so far neither Johnson nor Gove has replied. Steve Baker, the Tory Brexiter and deputy chair of the European Research Group, which is pushing for a harder Brexit, has published a new Brexit plan today. Called \u201cA Clean Managed Brexit\u201d (pdf), it is a new version of the standard Brexiter demand \u2013 an agreement with the EU without the backstop, with the UK resorting to no-deal if necessary, using \u201calternative arrangements\u201d to avoid a hard border in Ireland. But Northern Ireland businesses and academics have dismissed the paper as \u201cmore of the same\u201d in relation to its plans to guarantee an invisible border between the region and the Republic of Ireland post Brexit. Aodh\u00e1n Connolly, head of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: \u201cIf it was homework I would give it an F minus.\u201d He said their report showed no proper solutions for the border and failed to provide any detail on key issues including health checks on animals which are mandatory and must be done on the border under EU laws. The EU has already indicated that milk from Northern Ireland could not cross over to the republic in a post-Brexit scenario unless there was a clear deal keeping regulations the same north and south of the border, something the DUP is implacably opposed to. Rory Stewart, the international development secretary and a long-shot candidate for the Conservative party leadership, has said the Brexit policies being promoted by many of his rivals, such as Boris Johnson, would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the UK. His rivals were misleading voters, he claimed. Stewart is strongly opposed to a no-deal Brexit. But the Brexiters in the contest have said they would accept no deal and Johnson has said the UK must leave the EU by 31 October, with or without a deal. Stewart told the Emma Barnett Show on Radio 5 Live: I\u2019m afraid [other leadership candidates] are misleading themselves and others, and that\u2019s going to be catastrophic, because the reality is that Europe is barely sitting through to the end of October. Let\u2019s take a candidate like Boris. He\u2019s saying that he\u2019s going to go to Europe, and he\u2019s going to negotiate a new deal before October 31, and if he doesn\u2019t get a new deal by 31 October he\u2019s going to go no deal. Anyone who knows anything about Europe can assure you there is not the slightest hope of getting a new deal through Europe by October 31. Not a hope. D-day veterans and world leaders have taken part in an emotional ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of the Normandy landings, with a vast security operation safeguarding dignitaries including the Queen, Donald Trump and Theresa May. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and May\u2019s de facto deputy, has said the NHS \u201cis not and will not be up for sale\u201d in trade talks with the United States. Speaking at PMQs, in response to a question from Labour\u2019s Rebecca Long-Bailey, who was standing in for Jeremy Corbyn (quite successfully \u2013 see 2.16pm), Lidington said: The prime minister has been very clear and she spoke for everyone in the Government and on this side of the House - when it comes to trade negotiations, the NHS is not and will not be up for sale. Yesterday, at a news conference, President Trump said the NHS would be on the table in any trade talks with the UK. But in an interview broadcast this morning, he retracted that, saying: I don\u2019t see [the NHS] being on the table. Somebody asked me a question today and I say everything is up for negotiation, because everything is. But that\u2019s something I would not see as part of trade. That\u2019s not trade. Many voters have a \u201cdistinct antipathy\u201d towards Boris Johnson, which could hamper his chances of winning a future general election even if he delivered Brexit, the Conservative peer and polling expert Robert Hayward has said. Channel 4 has announced it is holding a Tory leadership hustings on Sunday week. Steve Baker, the Tory Brexiter and deputy chair of the European Research Group, which represents Conservatives pushing for a harder Brexit, has said he will stand for the party leadership if colleagues ask him to. Asked about his intentions, he said: I am in the hands of my colleagues ... If we get to the opening and closing of nominations on Monday and we collectively agree there must be somebody willing to do this, then I would be willing to be the person who gets nominated. Nigel Farage has said his Brexit party will not join the far-right Europe of Nations and Freedom Group in the European parliament. The ENF includes various far-right parties from across Europe including Italy\u2019s the League, France\u2019s National Rally and Austria\u2019s Freedom party. Farage said: Following a brief social meeting with a member of the ENF Group last week there has been much speculation, fuelled by that individual, that the Brexit party will join them in their European parliament group. I can confirm that this is not the case and that the Brexit party will not be joining the ENF group. The Brexit party\u2019s candidate in the Peterborough byelection has been criticised for profiteering from buying and selling freeholds of hundreds of new homes, it has emerged. A one-woman show by the new Brexit party MEP Ann Widdecombe has been cancelled in protest at her apparent endorsement of gay conversion therapy. Women born in the 1950s whose retirement age was increased from 60 to 65 have gone to court seeking a judicial review of how the government raised the retirement age and to try to force the government to repay their lost pensions. I was not covering PMQs as it happened because we were focusing on the D-day commemorations. That means I missed what colleagues tell me was a good PMQs debut by Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, who was standing in for Jeremy Corbyn. Normally Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, leads for Labour at PMQs when Corbyn is not there. But this week Corbyn gave the job to Long-Bailey. The party has not said why, but there is a suspicion that Thornberry (who has leadership aspirations) angered Corbyn\u2019s inner circle by pushing support for a second referendum after the European election results further than they would like. And Long-Bailey, a protege of John McDonnell, has for a while now been seen as the Corbynites\u2019 preferred candidate in the leadership contest that will take place when Corbyn retires. Giving her the PMQs slot will raise her profile. That would have backfired if she had done badly, but she didn\u2019t. This is what some journalists are saying about her performance. From my colleague Heather Stewart From the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith From my colleague Dan Sabbagh From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg From the blogger Guido Fawkes (who never normally has anything positive to say about Labour MPs, especially Corbynites) From CBS\u2019s Mark Knoller Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has issued this statement about the D-day commemoration. She said: It is a great honour to represent the people of Scotland at the commemorations marking the 75th anniversary of the D-day landings. Scotland owes a great debt of gratitude to all those who served during the second world war, especially to those who made the ultimate sacrifice. It is important that current and future generations continue to learn of the events that took place on this day 75 years ago, so that we can strive to ensure that such conflict is never repeated. It is also important the generations to come understand and recognise that it is the actions of those who served that allow us to enjoy the freedoms we now take for granted. Here are some more pictures from the D-day event. Theresa May is holding a series of bilateral meetings with world leaders at the D-day event. Downing Street said she had met her Polish counterpart, Mateusz Morawiecki, and was due to have talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, and Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau. \u201cThe main theme of the talks today is about shared security,\u201d a Downing Street spokeswoman said. Here is the \u201cfamily photo\u201d for leaders attending the D-day commemorations. In the back row, from left to right: the Slovakian deputy prime minister, Richard Rasi; the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki; the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau; Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister, Xavier Bettel; the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg; the Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel; the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babis; the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison; and the Danish ambassador to the UK, Lars Thuesen. And in the front row, from left to right: New Zealand\u2019s governor general, Patsy Reddy; the French president, Emmanuel Macron; Britain\u2019s prime minister, Theresa May; Prince Charles; the Queen; the US president, Donald Trump; the Greek president, Prokopis Pavlopoulos; the German chancellor, Angela Merkel; and the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte. There were some reminders of historical details during the commemoration. Many American troops were based in Portsmouth and other towns and cities across southern England. A letter home from Private Arthur Pranger of the 86th Chemical Mortar Battalion dated 6 May 1944 was read out: Dear Mom, Somebody is always shoving a cup of tea in my fist. People even stop us on the street and invite us for tea and cake. The kids around here are always asking for chewing gum and candy. They can\u2019t get that over here and everything is rationed. There\u2019s hardly any automobiles here and everybody rides a bicycle. The chief of the defence staff, General Sir Nicholas Carter, paid tribute to the tactical ingenuity that lead to the success of the Normandy landings: The marvellous range of technology that helped to make the landings succeed and ensured that over two million men and half a million vehicles could be landed in the ensuing months included amphibious and mine clearing tanks, Mulberry harbours, gliders, undersea pipelines, self-heating soup cans, air-portable motor-bikes \u2013 all reflected British ingenuity and innovation at its best. Flags from the 14 allied nations that took part in the Normandy Landings were displayed during the event. The flags are historically accurate for 1944 so in many instances were not the same as they appear today. For example, the French flag displayed was the Free French Flag. Another example was the Canadian flag, which only adopted a maple leaf in 1965. Music was provided by, among others, a 70-piece orchestra and a 90-strong choir. Hymn to the Fallen, composed by John Williams \u2013 the track that opens the film Saving Private Ryan \u2013 was played and the actor and singer Sheridan Smith performed the song made famous by Vera Lynn, We\u2019ll Meet Again. Linda Spence, a university worker from Portsmouth who was carrying a home-made placard stating \u201cKeep your tiny, groping hands off our NHS \u2018Mr\u2019 president\u201d, tried to speak to one of the men who attempted to disrupt the anti-Trump protest in the centre of the town. \u201cI just asked him why he was so angry and then he just started shouting, and then his mate tried to grab my placard,\u201d said Spence, who spoke to a man wrapped in a US flag seconds after he snapped a protest placard in two and waved part of it around. He was saying that it was a disgrace that we were here and that we should be down at the D-day commemorations. I said that I would have loved to have been there but I felt it was important to protest and send a message in support of the NHS services that he and all of us use, and which could be under threat if Trump has his way in trade talks. One of the speakers at the D-day event was Sergeant John Jenkins MBE, 99, from Portsmouth, who was in the Pioneer Corps on D-day and landed on Gold beach on 8 June. He said: I was 23 years old when I landed on Gold beach. I was terrified, I think everyone was. I look back on it as a big part of my life. I was just a small part in a very big machine. Jenkins said he was honoured to be at the service along with other D-day veterans. You never forget your comrades because we were all in it together. It is right that the courage and sacrifice of so many is being honoured 75 years on. We must never forget. The events on the stage end with Sheridan Smith singing the wartime classic We\u2019ll Meet Again. Now an RAF flypast is taking place. The Queen is speaking now. She says when she attended the 60th anniversary D-day event some people thought it would be the last event of its kind. But the wartime generation, \u201cmy generation\u201d, is resilient, and she is delighted to be here. She says 75 years ago hundreds of thousands of soldiers, sailors and airmen left these shores in the cause of freedom. At the time her father, King George VI, said what was required was more than courage; it was a revival of spirit. She says many of those young people never returned. It is with humility and pleasure, on behalf of the country and the whole free world, that she says thank you. The Portsmouth commemoration also paid tribute to the secret agents who worked behind enemy lines in the build up to D-day and to the French resistance. Of the several hundred Special Operations Executive agents working behind enemy lines, 55 were women. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, read the last letter of a young resistance fighter Henri Fertet, executed at just 16 years old: My dear parents, I am going to die for my country. I want France to be free and the French to be happy \u2026 The soldiers are coming to get me. I must hurry. My handwriting may look wobbly but it is just because I am using a small pencil. I am not afraid of death, my conscience is completely clear ... A thousand kisses. Long live France. Some of those who survived appeared at the event. There was warm applause for a group of British veterans when they took to the stage. A video was shown of Eugene Deibler, an American veteran who served as a sergeant in the 501st Airborne Regiment, and parachuted into Normandy at 01.30 on 6 June, behind Utah beach. He said he had never jumped in conflict before. We did what we had to do. We jumped in there. I\u2019m glad I did it, went from a boy to a man. One note of disappointment \u2013 there are scores of unoccupied seats in the official commemoration event, which seems a shame. Some locals have expressed disappointment that they have been kept away because of the tight security. At the D-day commemoration the audience have just been watching an extract from Pressure, the play by David Haig about James Stagg, the chief meteorologist who advised General Dwight Eisenhower about the weather ahead of D-day. Amid the pomp and ceremony it was the stories of the real people who took part in D-Day that shone out during the commemoration in Portsmouth. Theresa May read a letter from Captain Norman Skinner of the Royal Army Service Corps, written to his wife Gladys on 3 June 1944. The letter was still in his pocket when he landed on Sword Beach on 6 June. Skinner was killed the day after, leaving his wife and two young daughters. The letter read: My thoughts at this moment, in this lovely Saturday afternoon, are with you all now. I can imagine you in the garden having tea with Janey and Anne getting ready to put them to bed. Although I would give anything to be back with you, I have not yet had any wish at all to back down from the job we have to do. There is so much that I would like to be able to tell you. Nearly all of which you\u2019ve heard many, many times. But just to say that I mean it even more today. I\u2019m sure that I will be with you again soon and for good. Please give my fondest love to my Anne and my Janey. God bless and keep you all safe for me. A telegram was shown on screen, accompanied by a voice over: Dear Mrs Skinner, it is with the upmost difficulty that I write to offer you my most profound sympathies on the untimely death of your husband. All the time he had been under my command, he had done a grand job of work. Piper Alastair Parks, who serves with 4 SCOTS, The Highlanders, 4th Battalion The Royal Scottish Regiment, read an extract from the autobiography of piper Bill Millins recounting his experience of playing on the Normandy beaches: I jumped off the ramp as quickly as possible holding the bagpipes above my head, and landed in the water up to my waist ... I placed the bagpipes on my shoulder, blew them up, and started to play Highland Laddie as I waded the few yards to the beach. Here is the text of the letter read out by Theresa May. (See 12.15pm.) Theresa May is now reading out a letter written by a Captain Skinner to his wife two days for before D-day. In it, Skinner said this was a difficult letter to write. Anyone with imagination must worry about what will happen, Skinner said. He said he had had some lovely years with his wife. He could imagine his family in the garden. He would give anything to be with them, but would not back down from the job he had to do. He asked his wife to give his love to his children. After May finishes, the text of a telegram later sent to Mrs Skinner announcing her husband\u2019s death was read out. Here is the translation of the letter from a French resistance fighter read out by Emmanuel Macron, the French president. (See 12.03pm.) My dear parents, My letter is going to cause you great sorrow, but I have seen you so full of courage in the past that I do not doubt that you will remain courageous, if only out of love for me. I am going to die for my country. I want France to be free and the French to be happy. I do not want France to be arrogant and the world\u2019s leading nation but hard-working, industrious and honest. Scuffles broke out in the centre of Portsmouth today after groups of football casuals marched through a protest against the US president\u2019s presence in the city during D-day commemorations. A few dozen men marching behind a banner with the crest of Portsmouth Football Club at the centre of a Union flag chanted \u2018scum, scum, scum\u2019 as they arrived midway through speeches by trade unionists and others who had organised a gathering of a few hundred people in the city\u2019s Guildhall Square. Police stepped in as the men scattered and tried to square up to those in the protest, who broke into chants of \u2018nazi scum off our streets. Amid some pushing and shoving, one man with a US flag wrapped around his waist grabbed one of the protest placards and snapped after waving part of it around. The group then adjourned to a pub as the rally continued with speakers evoking the sacrifice of veterans who had fought to liberate Europe from nazism. I will be focusing on the D-day commemoration for the next half an hour, and will pick up PMQs later. In Portsmouth Emmanuel Macron, the French president, is now reading out a letter written by a French resistance fighter. He starts by thanking the other countries on behalf of his nation. Then he reads out the letter, in French. In it, the fighter says he does not fear death because his conscience is clear. These are from my colleague Ben Quinn who is in Portsmouth. President Trump is speaking now at the D-day event. He is reading from a D-day prayer written by FD Roosevelt, the US president in 1944. World leaders attending the D-day commemoration in Portsmouth include: the French president, Emmanuel Macron; the prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau; the US president, Donald Trump; Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison; the prime minister of Belgium, Charles Michel; the Czech Republic\u2019s prime minister, Andrej Babis; the Greek president, Prokopis Pavlopoulos; Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel; the prime minister of Luxembourg, Xavier Bettel; the Dutch PM, Mark Rutte; Norway\u2019s PM, Erna Solberg; Poland\u2019s PM, Mateusz Morawiecki; and Slovakia\u2019s deputy prime minister, Richard Rasi. At the commemoration Trudeau has just read out the citation from the first Canadian to receive the Victoria Cross in the second world war, a soldier who led his men across a bridge under heavy fire saying \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to worry about here\u201d. The D-day commemoration is mostly ceremonial, but it does have a political edge to it. To coincide with it, Downing Street has got the 16 nations who are attending to sign something called the \u201cD-day proclamation\u201d. Here is the text in full. Seventy five years ago, our countries were about to embark on a decisive battle. On 6 June 1944, 160,000 Allied troops landed at Normandy, signalling the beginning of the end of the war in Europe. Casualty figures on all sides were immense, with hundreds of thousands of soldiers, sailors, aviators and civilians killed or wounded in the days and weeks that followed. We stand together today to honour the memory of those who paid the ultimate sacrifice on D-Day, and those many millions of men and women who lost their lives during the Second World War, the largest conflict in human history. We affirm that it is our shared responsibility to ensure that the unimaginable horror of these years is never repeated. Over the last 75 years, our nations have stood up for peace in Europe and globally, for democracy, tolerance and the rule of law. We re-commit today to those shared values because they support the stability and prosperity of our nations and our people. We will work together as allies and friends to defend these freedoms whenever they are threatened. We commit to work constructively as friends and allies to find common ground where we have differences of opinion and to work together to resolve international tensions peacefully. We will act resolutely, with courage and tenacity, to protect our people against threats to our values and challenges to peace and stability. In this way, we salute the surviving veterans of D-Day and we honour the memories of those who came before us. We will ensure that the sacrifices of the past are never in vain and never forgotten. Mostly this is a conventional and rather bland restatement of democratic values. But the paragraph I\u2019ve highlighted in bold about working constructively together \u201cto find common ground ... and ... to resolve international tensions peacefully\u201d can be seen as an attempt to nudge President Trump away from isolationism and back towards upholding what is described as the rules-based international order (RBIO). The Queen delivered a similar message to Trump in her speech at the state banquet on Monday. The 16 nations who have backed the D-day proclamation are: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, Slovakia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. In Portsmouth the D-day commemoration event is just starting. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, and Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, are both at the D-day commemoration. President Trump and his wife, Melania, have arrived at Portsmouth for the D-day commemoration. And here is the Queen arriving. There\u2019s a festival atmosphere in the public viewing area on Southsea Common ahead of the D-Day commemoration in Portsmouth. Residents and visitors are separated from the official area by fences and walls and armed police survey are observing the scene from a temporary tower. But people have brought in deckchairs and picnics and grabbed spots in front of the big screens that will relay the official commemoration event when it begins on the other side of the barricades. There are burger stands and beer tents and merchandise stalls selling everything from souvenir mugs to fridge magnets and tea towels. Very British. There are a few grumbles from local people that they are not going to see the Queen or Donald Trump in person because of the tight security. No sign of demonstrators on the common as yet. A mile away from Southsea Common, some anti-Trump protestors are gathering in Portsmouth\u2019s Guildhall Square. The idea is that they don\u2019t want it to appear that they are protesting against the veterans. One of the organisers, Simon Magurian from Portsmouth Stand Up To Racism, said: Thousands of local people have signed a petition opposing his involvement. We are protesting against a racist who aligns with the far right. He supports the very forces women and men died to defeat. Donald Trump will be greeted by images of the baby blimp effigy of himself when he visits Portsmouth on the final day of his state visit, the Press Association reports. A campaign group which \u201chacks\u201d advertising boards has plastered images of the balloon, which flew over Parliament Square on Tuesday, to bus shelters in the city. A Special Patrol Group spokesman said: The Trump Baby has relentlessly trolled the president across the world, from London to Paris to Buenos Aires, and we wanted to make sure that he got a look-in at Portsmouth too. D-day is about commemorating the fight against fascism, but Trump is pursuing a dangerous far-right agenda and fanning the flames of hatred. President Trump has been tweeting again about his state visit. @IngrahamAngle is Laura Ingraham, a Fox News broadcaster. Jeremy Hunt has had a one-to-one meeting with Donald Trump, a source close to the foreign secretary said. As the Press Association reports, the talks took place on Tuesday night, towards the end of the second day of the US president\u2019s state visit. Trump is expected to meet fellow Tory leadership contender Michael Gove today and has already spoken by telephone to Boris Johnson. Yesterday at this press conference Trump said he did not know what Gove was like. But in his interview with Good Morning Britain, Trump was more positive about Gove. He said: I don\u2019t know him. I met him last night [ie, Monday night] at the dinner for the first time. I thought he was very good. You have a lot of good people running. I was saying to the Queen last night, the choice of your next prime minister is very important. On the subject of the Conservative leadership, here is the latest ConservativeHome tally of how many MP endorsements each candidate has. And here are the numbers. Boris Johnson - 46 Jeremy Hunt - 32 Michael Gove - 29 Dominic Raab - 24 Sajid Javid - 17 Matt Hancock - 11 Esther McVey - 6 Mark Harper - 5 Rory Stewart - 5 Andrea Leadsom - 3 Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary, has been giving interviews today ahead of the D-day commemoration. But she has been refusing to say whether she will enter the contest for the Conservative leadership. \u201cI think, today, this is not about me or the Conservative party, it is about these amazing veterans. We should have the focus on them, please,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Like Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn will be missing PMQs today because he is attending the D-day commemoration in Portsmouth. D-day may be the only American-led invasion in history that he has endorsed. This morning he released this statement paying tribute to the people who took part in it. He said: The troops that landed on the beaches of France 75 years ago showed unimaginable heroism. Many laid down their lives in the fight against fascism. People will have heard the recent serialisation of Anne Frank\u2019s Diaries on BBC radio. It was heart-breaking to hear her excitement and optimism about the Allied landings in Normandy, shortly before she was transported to Auschwitz, and then Bergen-Belsen. It was a poignant reminder of the evils of Nazism, and why its defeat by the Allied forces was so essential for humanity. We must not just commemorate those who fought, and died, but honour them by opposing the forces of hatred today. Only by standing up to hate, oppression and war can we protect international cooperation and peace. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has released his Tory leadership campaign video this morning. It is slightly reminiscent of a famous Conservative party election broadcast in 1992 which featured John Major returning to Brixton, where he grew up, and reminiscing about his modest upbringing there. At one point, Major wonders if a house he used to live in is still there and, as his car approaches it, declares \u201cit is, it is\u201d. Hunt\u2019s \u201cit is\u201d moment comes at the start of the video, when he returns to the garage where he set up his publishing business 25 years ago. He explains: Now that might look like any old garage but to me it actually means something because above that garage is where I set up my publishing business. And coming back here for the first time in 25 years it looks a bit small. That business actually grew to more than 200 people. But this is where I employed the very first one. Unlike Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, his two main rivals, Hunt was a successful entrepreneur before he became an MP and he focuses on this in his video, claiming that this shows he has the skills needed to be PM. In the video he says: If you want to make it [running a business], you\u2019ve got to show leadership, negotiating skills and confidence. And that\u2019s what we need to do as a country right now with the Brexit challenge that we face. It is the final day of Donald Trump\u2019s state visit to the UK and he will join other world leaders for what is likely to be a sombre and moving event in Portsmouth to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-day. But this morning ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain has been broadcasting an interview Trump did with Piers Morgan yesterday, and various important lines have emerged. As Rowena Mason reports, Trump has gone back on the comment he made in his press conference yesterday about how he would want access to the NHS to be part of a US-UK trade deal. As Matthew Weaver and Kate Lyons report, Trump also revealed that Prince Charles spent 75 minutes longer than scheduled trying to convince him of the dangers of climate change. In a tweet this morning Trump has also reverted to his habit of lying about the reception he has received on the streets in London. He has already twice claimed, falsely, that there were large crowds of people supporting him (see here and here) but now he is claiming that the \u201ccorrupt\u201d media is suppressing the truth. Because it is so obviously a symptom of vanity, it it tempting to laugh, but disregarding the truth so blatantly is straight out of Orwell\u2019s 1984. Here is the agenda for the day. 8.30am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary and a Tory leadership candidate, gives a speech to the Policy Exchange thinktank. 9am: Esther McVey, the former work and pensions secretary and a Tory leadership candidate, holds a phone-in on LBC. 9.50am: Equality and Human Rights Commission chairman David Isaac and its chief executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, give evidence to the Commons women and equalities committee. 11am: The Queen, Theresa May, Donald Trump and other world leaders attend the D-day commemoration event at Portsmouth. 12pm: David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, takes PMQs. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, is for the first time standing in for Jeremy Corbyn. 12.30pm: Steve Baker, the Tory Brexiter and deputy chair of the European Research Group, publishes a paper on Brexit. 2.15pm: Michael Gove, the environment secretary and a Tory leadership candidate, gives evidence to the Scottish affairs committee on post-Brexit agriculture. 4.50pm: Trump arrives at Shannon airport in Ireland, where he will hold talks with Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach, before going to his golf course at Doonbeg where he will be staying the night. 5pm: Gove, Hancock, Jeremy Hunt and Dominic Raab speak at a private hustings organised by the One Nation group of Tory MPs. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on the D-day commemoration and developments in the Tory leadership contest. I plan to post a summary at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

It was codenamed Operation Neptune, and it aimed to push Nazi Germany out of occupied France. Five beaches in Normandy, codenamed Omaha, Utah, Juno, Sword and Gold, were the main targets for landing a large number of troops by sea.</p>\n    <p>At 10pm on 5 June 1944, troops began departing from British shores to head across the Channel. Five assault groups set sail under darkness in an armada of about 7,000 vessels. Just after midnight on 6 June, aerial bombardment of enemy positions on the Normandy coast began. Special operations troops were also parachuted into France.</p>\n    <p>US troops landed on Omaha and Utah beaches at about 6:30am. About an hour later Canadian forces landed at Juno, and British troops landed at Gold and Sword. Soldiers had to get off their boats, wade through the water, and seize control of the beach, all the while under heavy and sustained fire from German defensive positions.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How was the plan kept secret?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Despite involving a large number of troops, keeping D-day secret was vital to the success of the operation. A disinformation campaign had led the Germans to believe that Operation Fortitude was the main plan for the allies to invade the continent, via a two-pronged attack involving Norway and Calais. Even once the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/d-day\">D-day</a>&nbsp;landings had begun, German commanders were convinced they were just a diversionary tactic before the real invasion.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is it called D-day?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The D in D-day actually has no particular significance to Operation Neptune. It was common practice in the military to make plans that used the term, where the D stands for the day when operations commenced. Military planners also set H-hour, the time at which a plan was to begin.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What happened next?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>By the end of the day, the allies had disembarked more than 135,000 men and 10,000 vehicles on to the beaches, and established bridgeheads of varying depths along the Normandy coastline. This came at the cost of 4,400 allied troops being killed, with thousands more injured or missing. There were also heavy casualties among German troops and French civilians.</p>\n    <p>By 19 August, the allied forces had pushed down far enough to begin the battle to liberate Paris. German troops surrendered the French capital on 25 August 1944, two and a half months after D-day.</p>\n    <p><b>Martin Belam</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On Wednesday, the veterans followed next. Accompanied by a team of 12 Red Devils, they jumped from a Beech 99 and a Cessna Caravan aircraft, which had crossed the channel.</p> \n<p>The two aircraft had to be hastily arranged by the Ministry of Defence at the 11th hour to save the day because of issues over the availability of the civilian plane that was to transport them. At one point it looked as though the jumpers would not get to fulfil their wish. But flight plans for the substitute aircraft were submitted just two hours before being approved by the French authorities.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0659b0f719fdcfb77ded42746293f10103b8e61b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0659b0f719fdcfb77ded42746293f10103b8e61b/153_285_2885_1985/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Read, 95, (left) and Jock Hutton, 94, after completing their parachute jumps.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry Read, 95, (left) and Jock Hutton, 94, after completing their parachute jumps.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Barlow/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Many on D-day paid the ultimate price.

In Operation Deadstick, Howard\u2019s troops landed on target and on time, at 00.16. After a fierce 10-minute firefight, the action was over by 00.26 \u2013 a full six hours before the beach landings. Ninety minutes after taking off from Britain, Howard was able to send the code words \u201cHam and Jam\u201d indicating that both bridges, critical to defending the invasion force\u2019s left flank, had been successfully taken. Since then the bridge over the Caen canal has been known as Pegasus Bridge, after the winged mythical stallion that is the defining symbol of the British airborne forces, and in tribute to what has been described as \u201cthe most outstanding flying achievements of the war\u201d. On the eve of the 75th anniversary, paratroopers from the 16th Air Assault Brigade and their French counterparts joined the mass jump into Sannerville, dropping from the RAF Hercules aircraft and a C-47 Dakota. Among them was a British army officer whose grandfather fought for the German forces during the second world war. Warrant officer Maik Briggs said he was born and raised in Germany and his grandfather had been an infantry officer. \u201cFor me this is a huge occasion. I just jumped French there, under a French parachute, it\u2019s all about collaboration. It\u2019s a huge occasion for myself because of my German links, but also to pay tribute to what the Allies did as well 75 years ago.\u201d On Wednesday, the veterans followed next. Accompanied by a team of 12 Red Devils, they jumped from a Beech 99 and a Cessna Caravan aircraft, which had crossed the channel. The two aircraft had to be hastily arranged by the Ministry of Defence at the 11th hour to save the day because of issues over the availability of the civilian plane that was to transport them. At one point it looked as though the jumpers would not get to fulfil their wish. But flight plans for the substitute aircraft were submitted just two hours before being approved by the French authorities. Many on D-day paid the ultimate price. Men were lost in swamps and flooded trenches, dragged down to their deaths by heavy equipment. Some gliders crash-landed, scouring deep wakes of furrowed soil. Many paratroopers were blown off course, landing alone miles from their allotted rendezvous points. Just minutes into D-day, the first house on French soil was liberated, and the first Allied soldier of the invasion, Lt Den Brotheridge, 28, was killed, cut down by enemy machine-gun fire. This year, as every year, a vigil and silent march by 1 Battalion the Rifles and the Army Air Corps will be held at Pegasus bridge at midnight, and a bottle of champagne will be opened at Cafe Gondr\u00e9e, the site of the first combat of the invasion in those first minutes of the longest day.",

Long a benchmark for welfare, the Nordic social model has come under increasing pressure in recent years due to ageing populations. In Denmark, reforms have led to economic growth above the EU average, but successive budget cuts have left more people paying for services that used to be free.

William Littleton, described in court papers as a vice-president and one of the bank\u2019s most senior LGBTQ leaders, claims he was excluded from a client call because \u201che sounded too gay\u201d. In another incident, the eight-year employee was allegedly asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Do you act this way because you\u2019re gay?\u201d The complaint, filed in New York state court, claims that \u201cdespite years of \u2018outstanding\u2019 performance reviews filled with near-endless praise regarding Mr Littleton\u2019s bright future at the Bank, he was abruptly fired by those who he complained engaged in discriminatory conduct\u201d. The suit names Goldman Sachs and two senior bank employees in the US product strategy group, Rachel Schnoll and Sirion Skulpone. The suit will come as unwelcome news to Goldman, which is typically seen as a leading supporter of LGBTQ rights on Wall Street. The bank scored a perfect 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, which measures a company\u2019s overall internal and external support of LGBT employees. In 2013, two years before same-sex marriage became legal nationwide in the US, Goldman was among nearly 300 of the country\u2019s biggest companies that urged the US supreme court to strike down restrictions on same-sex marriage when the then chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, said he believed marriage equality benefits a business environment. Blankfein called it an important issue because he understood how it related to recruiting and retaining people at Goldman. \u201cIt\u2019s a civil-rights issue, but it\u2019s also a business issue,\u201d Blankfein told CBS at the time. In his complaint, Littleton claims he was subjected to demeaning remarks and that his compensation decreased in his later years at the bank, despite promotions and increased responsibilities. He complained to the bank\u2019s employee relations department in May 2018. He later received a performance review with criticisms he claims were part of \u201ca belated attempt to create a paper trail\u201d. His last day at the bank was 31 January this year. According to Littleton\u2019s attorney, David Gottlieb, his client\u2019s termination from Goldman is not an isolated incident or exception to the rule at the bank or on Wall Street more broadly. \u201cWall Street continues to struggle to create an environment that is inclusive and accepting of LGBTQ+ employees,\u201d Gottlieb said in a statement. Citing an Institutional Investor article titled Gay on Wall Street: An Investigation, the complaint states \u201ca veil of vulnerability unifies LGBT experiences in financial services, and sets the group apart from many straight professionals\u201d. Further, Littleton alleges that the bank\u2019s efforts to hold itself out \u2013 \u201cpresumably for public relations purposes\u201d \u2013 as a friendly environment for LGBTQ employees is false. The complaint states that after Littleton was allegedly excluded from a client call for sounding too gay, supervisor Skulpone, \u201cprovided no support other than to say, in sum and substance: \u2018That sucks\u2019.\u201d The complaint states that as a result of the alleged discrimination, Littleton\u2019s pay and performance benefits dropped \u201cnearly 20%\u201d. \u201cThe reality is that the bank does little more than provide lip-service to LGBTQ diversity,\u201d the complaint states, alleging \u201ceveryday reality does not measure up\u201d to Goldman\u2019s claims that the \u201ccrux of our efforts is a focus on cultivating and sustaining a diverse work environment and workforce\u201d.

      "bodyText": "For 28 years, the chili peppers that made Huy Fong Foods\u2019 world-famous Sriracha hot sauce came from one southern California grower. One year after that partnership ended, in the midst of a spicy legal battle, that grower, Underwood Ranches, came out with its own line of sriracha sauce. As they hurtle toward trial, a once multimillion-dollar alliance between an immigrant success story and a homegrown California farm owner has devolved in a fashion as fiery as the sauce in question. Huy Fong Foods\u2019 Sriracha sauce has a worldwide following, with many devoted hot sauce lovers swearing by the green-tipped bottle with the rooster logo for all their flavor needs. Founded by David Tran, an officer in South Vietnam\u2019s army who fled with his family to California after communist North Vietnam reunited the country, he named the company after the freighter he sailed in from Vietnam. In 1988, he found the perfect counterpart in Craig Underwood and his peppers at Underwood Ranches. The first year, Underwood grew only about 50 acres of peppers. By 2016, the last year the two worked together, he was planting on about 1,700 acres for Huy Fong. According to court documents, the two parties operated under an agreement that was \u201cpartly oral, partly written and partly established by the parties\u2019 practice\u201d. Under this agreement, Underwood would estimate the cost of equipment and chili production ahead of each harvest season and Huy Fong would pay in installments. After each season, Underwood would tally the actual cost, and Huy Fong would pay in full. Attorneys for both parties either did not return requests for comment or declined to comment, but Tran and Underwood were unable to negotiate a new agreement in 2017, according to court documents. In an online post Huy Fong Foods claims that Underwood Ranches ended its partnership \u201cwithout any warning\u201d. In a cross-complaint, Underwood Ranches accused Huy Fong of trying to cut costs by establishing a new legal entity to procure peppers called Chilico, and attempting to convince Underwood\u2019s chief operating officer to work for Chilico instead.

In the midst of the legal proceedings, Underwood began producing its own sriracha sauce during the 2018 harvest season, selling and marketing the bottles locally. Huy Fong did not respond to the grower\u2019s new business venture until March, when the company posted the same message to its Instagram and Twitter feed. \u201cUnderwood Ranches came out with their own Sriracha Sauce but is suing Hf for damages in excess of $20m,\u201d Huy Fong Foods wrote. \u201cUnderwood expects HF to pay back the \u2018golden goose\u2019 that they themselves killed.\u201d In January, Underwood Ranches tweeted its own dig at Huy Fong Foods, implying that the sauce wasn\u2019t anything without Underwood\u2019s peppers. \u201cThe Pepper Makes the Product,\u201d Underwood Ranches tweeted in January, under the hashtag \u201csriracha\u201d. \u201cWithout Underwood\u2019s pepper, it\u2019s just another condiment.\u201d The case is expected to head to trial within the next few weeks.

If granted, every other retailer on the same high street or in the same shopping centre would want the same concession.

      "bodyText": "The Instagram \u201cinfluencer\u201d Sophie Hinchliffe is being investigated by the Advertising Standards Authority after allegedly failing to disclose adverts on her social media account. The 29-year-old, known by her moniker Mrs Hinch, gained 2.5 million followers on Instagram with her cleaning tips, turning herself into a valuable \u201cbrand ambassador\u201d able to charge thousands of pounds for product endorsement. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it had received three complaints in April concerning the labelling of adverts in her Instagram posts. The posts promoted the Procter &amp; Gamble cleaning products Flash and Febreze. Under advertising rules, social media influencers must make it clear that they have been paid or rewarded to promote, review or talk about a product in their social media feeds. Under the Consumer Rights Act it is illegal for brands or individuals to post sponsored content without disclosing it. Hundreds of influencers have fallen foul of the rules and Hinchliffe was given advice by the ASA on two occasions prior to the investigation on how to stay within the law. Hinchliffe, whose social media following has made her one of the best-selling authors in the UK, shifting hundreds of thousands of copies of her debut book, said: \u201cI take the responsibility that comes with having a large social media following very seriously, and, for me, being authentic and transparent is incredibly important.

The 40-year-old law bars the US government from paying for abortion services, even when recommended by doctors.

Biden, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president in the 2020 election, has changed his views on abortion in recent decades and his position has evolved increasingly as a defender of a woman\u2019s right to choose. But his presidential campaign confirmed on Wednesday that Biden still supports the Hyde amendment, NBC first reported. The report also noted that this stance sets him apart from the rest of his 2020 Democratic competitors. The campaign team said Biden would be open to repealing the Hyde amendment if abortion rights were threatened. Biden\u2019s position was later confirmed to the Hill.

This would include \u201cinherently discriminatory\u201d videos promoting Nazi ideology or content denying that well-documented violent events took place, such as the deaths of millions of Jews in the second world war or the Sandy Hook school shooting in the US.

YouTube banned a handful of high-profile extremists, including Alex Jones of Infowars, in the last year. Much of the criticism has been aimed at YouTube\u2019s algorithm-driven recommendation system, which helps keep people on the site by suggesting new videos they might be interested in.

The changes could face challenges from conservative politicians, who have risen to power under the social media free-for-all. Donald Trump and leading Republican senators have expressed concern about the prospect of censorship by sites such as YouTube, and the White House has launched a tool encouraging people to contact the government if they feel they have been banned or suspended from a social media service for political reasons. The company also confirmed on Wednesday that it would not be taking action against a prominent rightwing YouTuber who repeatedly targeted homophobic abuse at a journalist, arguing that the \u201ccriticism\u201d counted as debate rather than harassment.

      "bodyText": "The latest GDP figures released yesterday put beyond doubt that the Turnbull-Morrison government\u2019s management of the economy has been completely incompetent. The economy is barely growing, and for the first time in 36 years GDP per capita has gone backwards in three consecutive quarters. The big message from the GDP figures is that the biggest lie during the election campaign was not the death tax but that the LNP has managed a strong economy. In reality they have run it into the ground. In seasonally adjusted terms the economy grew just 1.8% in the past 12 months, and it was a mere 1.7% in the less erratic trend terms. Either way it is the slowest growth since 2009. The quarterly trend growth of 0.26% is the slowest quarter of growth since March 2003, and the annual growth of GDP per capita of just 0.09% is the worst for a decade: In seasonally adjusted terms GDP per capita fell 0.03% which after falls in December and September quarters last year marks the first time that has happened since June 1983. Now sure quarterly growth figures can bounce around, but it is hard to spin that as being a sign of strength in the economy. What growth there was came from government spending both in infrastructure and areas such as the NDIS. If we took away government consumption and investment in the March quarter, GDP would have fallen 0.05% in trend terms. The construction sector also remains very weak. Dwelling construction fell in the March quarter and both it and non-dwelling construction fell over the past year: Over the past year government consumption and investment contributed 1.4% points towards total GDP growth of 1.7%. That effectively means government spending accounted of 79% of GDP growth in the past year \u2013 a level only marginally below what happened during the massive stimulus years of the GFC: It points to an incredibly weak private sector - despite the fact that company profit grew 9.8% in the past year \u2013 the strongest growth for nearly two years. But of course the disconnect between company profits and household incomes continues. Over the past three years, company profits have grown on average by 10.1%, well above the 4.3% growth in compensation of employees \u2013 a level that is actually falling: The lack of household disposable income is brought into very sharp relief when looking at the growth of household consumption. The annual growth of 1.7% is the worst for six years and is more than half the long-term average of 3.5%: It is no surprise to anyone that this is happening. Living in the real world unpopulated by political spin, we know that the economy is faltering and that employee wages are barely keeping up with inflation. In the past year the average compensation of employees grew just 1.5%: Because inflation in that period grew by a pathetic 1.3% it means that average compensation grew in real term, but even with the slight increase it still sees real compensation per employee 1.6% below the level it was when the LNP took office in 2013: A similar story occurs for household living standards, where despite a slight increase, households still have less disposable income in real terms than they did at the end of 2010: The story is even worse when we look at productivity \u2013 which over the past three years has average lower growth than any time since the 1990s recession.

Right now the level is the lowest it has been since the 1990s recession \u2013 equal with a point reached during the GFC: This is a shocking state of affairs. And it makes an absolute mockery of the government\u2019s claims of economic management expertise.

Those who borrow as an owner-occupier get better rates than those borrowing as an investor.</p> <p>RateCity\u2019s research director Sally Tindall said there are four tiers of rate available: owner-occupiers paying off their principal and interest (the lowest rate), owner-occupiers paying interest only, investors paying principal and interest, and investors paying interest only (the highest).</p> <p>This can then be split into three sub-categories: the standard rate (currently around 5.15%), the discounted rate (around 4.39%), and the lowest rate (around 3.6%).</p> <p>Very few people are actually on the standard rate, Tindall says. It is better known as a bank\u2019s \u201cheadline\u201d rate.</p> <p>The majority of customers are using a discounted rate. This is also known as a package rate. \u201cThey give you a discount off the standard variable rate, and usually include an offset account, and offer a credit card,\u201d Tindall said.</p> <p>And finally, the lowest rate a bank offers is usually known as a basic rate. These are \u201cno-frills\u201d loans with no offset account, and no credit card.</p> <p>Currently, the average discounted rate of the big four banks is 4.39%. The average lowest rate is 3.6%.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the lowest interest rate loan out there?</strong></p> <p>Currently, the lowest rate available is from Reduce Home Loans, a small online-only lender, who are offering 3.19%.</p> <p><strong>How can I get a better deal?</strong></p> <p>No matter what deal you have, the rate cut is a good chance to get a discount, according to the CEO of Choice, Alan Kirkland.</p> <p>Customers should do research, shop around and directly ask their bank for a new deal. You can either stay with your current bank, and use competitor rates to haggle, or change banks entirely.</p> <p>\u201cEven before the rate cut we knew that if you are an existing customer of a bank, you are probably already paying more than what they are offering to new customers,\u201d Kirkland said.</p> <p>\u201cThe ACCC revealed last year that existing customers are paying $850 a year more than what they need to for an average mortgage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should always try to bargain. Quite often the lending staff have the ability to discount an interest rate, but it can depend on your level of income. Always ask.\u201d</p> <p>Tindall said it was a good tactic to \u201cprove to your bank you are prepared to take your business elsewhere\u201d. Ask your bank for a mortgage discharge form, or get an offer in writing from another bank.</p> <p>And don\u2019t be afraid to switch banks.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as hard as people think,\u201d Kirkland said. \u201cTo switch your mortgage you don\u2019t have to switch all your other accounts \u2013 you can simply just switch your mortgage account.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEvery experience is different and it\u2019s a bit of paperwork and time,\u201d said Tindall, \u201cbut sit down and do the sums, work out what fees you might be paying in discharge fees and application fees with the new lender. In many cases people will find refinancing is worth that extra work.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Should I go with a small bank? How do I find the best one?</strong></p> <p>Kirkland said that smaller lenders and credit unions often offered better deals than the large banks.</p> <p>\u201cPeople sometimes think they are less safe, but they benefit from all the protections of the major banks. So long as you are going with someone who has a banking licence, it\u2019s safe to bank with them.</p> <p>\u201c[But] we would discourage people from going to a mortgage broker because they typically offer loans based on which lenders pay them money.\u201d</p> <p>Comparison sites are necessary to assess the dozens of small banks, but you have to be careful of sponsored content.</p> <p>\u201cBy default most comparison sites list the vendors who pay them for customers,\u201d Kirkland said. \u201cYou often need to check an option that will show all the loans on the markets, rather than just the paid links.\u201d</p> <p><strong>What if I\u2019m on a fixed rate?</strong></p> <p>If you are on a fixed rate, looking enviously at the dropping variable rate, you have a few options, but it could be costly.</p> <p>\u201cBanks can charge you a break fee for breaking out of your fixed rate contract,\u201d Tindall said. \u201cThat may be cost-prohibitive. Some people opt for a split loan \u2013 part variable part fixed. They have a bit more flexibility.\u201d</p> <p>Again, it is worth it to talk to your bank to try and negotiate.</p> <p><strong>What will happen in future?</strong></p> <p>Economists are predicting more cuts to the interest rate soon. This means banks like ANZ could pass on more of the next cut \u2013 and banks like Commonwealth might not pass on the full cut next time.</p> <p>Tindall said she couldn\u2019t predict what the banks would do, but it was likely the Reserve Bank would cut again.</p> <p>\u201cThe RBA has often done things in twos or threes. The last time in 2016 we had a rate cut in May, it was closely followed by a rate cut in August. Looking ahead we are expecting the RBA to cut once again this year, and potentially as much as two times in 2020.\u201d</p> <p>Either way, it is good news for borrowers.</p> <p>\u201cGrowth in home lending is slowing down and banks are keen for new business,\u201d Tindall said. \u201cWhat we are seeing at the moment is bigger banks are forced to be more competitive than they used to.\u201d</p> <p><strong>What if I don\u2019t have a loan, but do have a savings account?</strong></p> <p>It is generally bad news for you.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tough time for people trying to save,\u201d Kirkland said. \u201cWhen interest rates are cut, they tend to be cut on term deposits and savings accounts. [But] there are still differences in the interest rates you can get. It is definitely worth shopping around.\u201d<br></p>",

So long as you are going with someone who has a banking licence, it\u2019s safe to bank with them. \u201c[But] we would discourage people from going to a mortgage broker because they typically offer loans based on which lenders pay them money.\u201d Comparison sites are necessary to assess the dozens of small banks, but you have to be careful of sponsored content. \u201cBy default most comparison sites list the vendors who pay them for customers,\u201d Kirkland said. \u201cYou often need to check an option that will show all the loans on the markets, rather than just the paid links.\u201d What if I\u2019m on a fixed rate? If you are on a fixed rate, looking enviously at the dropping variable rate, you have a few options, but it could be costly. \u201cBanks can charge you a break fee for breaking out of your fixed rate contract,\u201d Tindall said. \u201cThat may be cost-prohibitive. Some people opt for a split loan \u2013 part variable part fixed. They have a bit more flexibility.\u201d Again, it is worth it to talk to your bank to try and negotiate. What will happen in future? Economists are predicting more cuts to the interest rate soon. This means banks like ANZ could pass on more of the next cut \u2013 and banks like Commonwealth might not pass on the full cut next time. Tindall said she couldn\u2019t predict what the banks would do, but it was likely the Reserve Bank would cut again. \u201cThe RBA has often done things in twos or threes. The last time in 2016 we had a rate cut in May, it was closely followed by a rate cut in August. Looking ahead we are expecting the RBA to cut once again this year, and potentially as much as two times in 2020.\u201d Either way, it is good news for borrowers. \u201cGrowth in home lending is slowing down and banks are keen for new business,\u201d Tindall said. \u201cWhat we are seeing at the moment is bigger banks are forced to be more competitive than they used to.\u201d What if I don\u2019t have a loan, but do have a savings account? It is generally bad news for you. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough time for people trying to save,\u201d Kirkland said. \u201cWhen interest rates are cut, they tend to be cut on term deposits and savings accounts. [But] there are still differences in the interest rates you can get. It is definitely worth shopping around.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The brother of the Australian racing legend Winx is one of thousands of exported thoroughbreds killed for meat in Korea under conditions the RSPCA has called \u201cvery distressing\u201d. Footage filmed secretly at the Nonghyup abattoir in South Korea last year shows horses being repeatedly beaten on the head with lengths of black polyethylene pipe in an attempt to herd them into the facility. That treatment would be in breach both of Australian animal welfare laws and of the requirements imposed on abattoirs that process live export animals if it was part of a formal Australian supply chain, the RSPCA said. But because the horses were exported to race or breed, rather than for slaughter, and because horses are not classified as livestock in Australia, they are outside the protection of laws that govern the live export industry. In the past five years Australia has exported 158 racehorses to South Korea, mostly two-year-olds purchased in the Magic Millions sales for the purpose of racing or breeding. Analysis of a single year, 2014, shows that of 58 horses exported, 12 were confirmed to have been slaughtered and a further 11 were also likely to have been used in the meat trade. The Greens and animal welfare group have called on Australian racing authorities to halt exports until conditions in the slaughterhouse meet Australian standards. But the Australian government says responsibility for the horses is out of its hands. The footage shows three Australian thoroughbreds, each purchased at the Magic Millions, where the median sale price is $45,000, being trucked in to be killed. One of the horses, a four-year-old gelding named Road to Warrior, had been in South Korea for just 15 months and won just one race before he was sent to Nonghyup. Another, a chestnut gelding named Dynamic Tank, the son of the Kentucky Derby winner Big Brown, raced for three years after being exported as a two-year-old in 2014 and won A$257,856 before he was sent to Nonghyup. According to his entry in the Korean studbook, which lists birth-to-death details for all horses, he was slaughtered in the fourth quarter of 2018. Bareul Jeong was exported to South Korea in 2008, three years before Winx was born. He shares a sire, the Irish stallion Street Cry, with Winx, the championship mare that was named Australian of the year by Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph in 2019. In the racing industry, they would only be called half-siblings if they shared the same dam but would be listed as sharing the same sire. Winx was retired in April after a 33-race winning streak that made her one of the most feted horses in Australian racing history. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, presented a copy of her best-selling biography to the Queen on Monday. The final entry on Bareul Jeong\u2019s page in the Korean studbook reads \u201cdeath for meat processing\u201d.

On two occasions in the extended footage provided to Guardian Australia, two horses were herded down the race together. On both occasions the second horse became distressed when the horse ahead of them was killed and hoisted up. \u201cThe second horse struggled a lot more than the first horse,\u201d the Peta investigator told Guardian Australia. Allowing horses to see each other being killed is a breach of Korean animal welfare laws and, as of last month, it was being investigated by police in Jeju. The RSPCA\u2019s chief scientist, Dr Bidda Jones, said the treatment of the horses as they were being unloaded would be in breach of animal welfare laws if it occurred in Australia or at an international facility subject to Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System requirements, which govern conditions in international facilities that receive live export sheep and cattle. \u201cIt would not meet Escas standards for cattle,\u201d Jones told Guardian Australia. \u201cThat facility would not meet supply chain requirements.

Racing Australia maintains that less than 1% of Australian racehorses are recorded as going to slaughter upon retirement but independent figures are not made public. On the industry\u2019s compulsory retirement forms, 90% of horses are recorded as going into breeding, another equine pursuit or export. All the horses killed in Korea were among that 90%.

      "bodyText": "Labor\u2019s Mark Dreyfus has joined a growing group of critics who have accused the government of a double standard over two police raids on media outlets investigating embarrassing leaks. On Thursday the shadow attorney general said Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton \u201ccan\u2019t hide behind the police\u201d because \u201cthe government\u201d referred the matters for investigation. \u201cIt\u2019s the government which made a decision that these leaks, not all the other leaks that occur within government administration, warrant investigation,\u201d he told Radio National. It comes after the Greens senator Nick McKim accused the government of \u201cleaking sensitive information like a sieve when it suits them\u201d and Centre Alliance\u2019s Rex Patrick said it was \u201cabhorrent\u201d that public interest reports applying scrutiny to officials\u2019 actions are now being investigated. The comments were prompted by two raids in two days: targeting Annika Smethurst of News Corp Australia on Tuesday over a story about a leaked plan for greater powers to spy on Australians; and the ABC on Wednesday for an investigation about alleged unlawful killings in Afghanistan by Australian special forces. Morrison has reasserted that the raids occurred at arm\u2019s length from the government but conceded that they were part of investigations commenced after department heads referred leaks to the AFP. Morrison said the raids were the result of \u201ca process of investigations being pursued by independent law enforcement agency, and they are acting in accordance with the laws that govern their behaviour\u201d. \u201cThis is not a matter that has been directed or in any way involves government ministers and it would be inappropriate if it did.\u201d The prime minister suggested he is \u201copen to discussing\u201d concerns about security laws\u2019 impact on the press. Dreyfus accused the prime minister of \u201chollow words\u201d by claiming to believe in press freedom but refusing to explain the \u201cextraordinary\u201d raids which targeted Smethurst in her home and included authority to delete material found at the ABC. \u201cCan we expect further raids? Why did these happen now when Mr Morrison and Mr Dutton were out of the country.\u201d Dreyfus suggested Labor could support a Senate inquiry, which the Greens have proposed, into the raids. Dreyfus said it was \u201cabsurd\u201d that plans to extend Australian Signals Directorate spying powers to Australians should not be publicly discussed, because the matter would have had to come before parliament anyway. Australia\u2019s laws criminalise unauthorised disclosures by public servants, and provisions that prohibit publication of proscribed information also apply to journalists \u2013 even before new offences were added in espionage laws that passed in 2018. Over the last three years referrals to the police resulted in raids investigating leaks about the national broadband network and Peter Dutton\u2019s ministerial intervention in the case of two foreign au pairs. A report in the Australian quoting home affairs department advice about the medevac legislation was referred to the police and earned an extraordinary rebuke from Australia\u2019s top spy chief for misrepresenting the advice as from Asio. Dreyfus noted there \u201chasn\u2019t been a raid\u201d in relation to the leak of that material \u201cthat suited the government\u201d. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any further action taken in respect of it,\u201d he said. Police investigated a leak from the then employment minister Michaelia Cash\u2019s office tipping media off about an imminent raid on the Australian Workers\u2019 Union, resulting in a brief to prosecutors who then declined to prosecute. McKim told Guardian Australia the raids \u201care yet more evidence that Australia is lurching towards a police state\u201d. \u201cThese raids were made possible by the steady flow of laws which have consolidated power, eroded privacy and removed rights, all supported by the LNP and ALP,\u201d he said. \u201cThis government leaks sensitive information like a sieve when it suits them, yet disgracefully pursues journalists and media outlets which embarrass them. \u201cAustralia needs stronger whistleblower protections, a charter of rights and better protections for journalists and citizens from government overreach.\u201d Patrick said the public had a \u201cright to know\u201d about discussions between the heads of the defence and home affairs ministries discussing extending spying powers to Australian citizens. He said Smethurst\u2019s report was \u201csimply embarrassing\u201d to the agencies rather than supplying information that could harm national security. Allegations against Australian troops were similarly \u201cmatters that there should be public scrutiny of\u201d. \u201cBoth relate to national security, but they were both issues that dealt with uncomfortable conversations \u2013 the conduct of officials \u2013 that\u2019s the bit I find abhorrent in this instance.\u201d Patrick agreed there was a double standard about how vigorously certain leaks were pursued, citing the example of the police refusing to investigate a leak to journalist Niki Savva about the decision to prosecute former Asis spy Witness K and his lawyer for disclosing that Australia spied on East Timor. Savva told the ABC\u2019s Insiders that the commonwealth director of public prosecutions made a \u201cstrong recommendation\u201d to prosecute Witness K, suggesting that the attorney general, Christian Porter, did not have \u201cany choice but to proceed\u201d by giving approval. On 2 July 2018 the independent MP Andrew Wilkie wrote to the AFP seeking an investigation into the \u201cimproper disclosure to a journalist of protected information\u201d. Superintendent Mark Colbran wrote back on 18 July 2018 declining to investigate on the basis that there was \u201cinsufficient information to determine whether a commonwealth offence has been committed\u201d. Colbran explained that an operations committee makes an assessment based on \u201cthe nature of the alleged crime, the gravity of the matter, the sensitivity of the matter, the effect of the alleged criminality\u201d, among other factors. Lawyer Bernard Collaery, who represents Witness K and is also being prosecuted, said the law \u201cmust be applied equally\u201d, citing the \u201cnumerous leaks\u201d that have not been investigated. Collaery noted that before she became foreign affairs minister the then shadow minister Julie Bishop disclosed in 2010 that Australia forges passports, which he described as a \u201chuge breach of security\u201d. Emily Howie, the Human Rights Law Centre legal director, said the raids were \u201cclearly a show of force\u201d which sent a \u201creally worrying\u201d message to whistleblowers and journalists working on national security stories. \u201cWe\u2019re really concerned with the chilling effect this has on others coming forward. \u201cI think there\u2019s been a clear and worrying trend of governments trying to silence whistleblowers and journalists who want to reveal information in the public interest.\u201d",

In a pitch designed to burnish his credentials on climate change, Minns is today sending emails to branch members explaining his policy on climate change and his proposal to ban fossil fuel donations. \u201cThis is an important message to convey; we need a clean environment and clean politics,\u201d he says in his email. \u201cWe can\u2019t just put it in the too-hard basket. The time to take climate change action is running out. \u201cThat is why I\u2019m announcing that under my leadership NSW Labor will refuse donations from the fossil fuel industry and in state government, we\u2019ll change the law so no political party can received donations from those companies.\u201d NSW already has bans on political donations from property developers, tobacco, liquor and gambling industry. Minns said the new ban would include companies producing coal, crude oil and natural gas. Minns is one of two candidates running for the leadership after former leader, Michael Daley resigned following his loss to Gladys Berejiklian\u2019s Coalition government at the March state election. The leadership will be decided by a ballot of the rank and file who have 50% of the votes and by the Labor caucus which has the other 50%. Rank and file must vote by 21 June and the caucus will vote on 29 June, with a result expected the next day. Minns, the current water spokesman, is from the right faction, and has made action on climate change a central part of his pitch to the party. In the email he tells Labor members he plans to build a publicly-owned renewable energy company to create new jobs in the sector and that he will support strong renewable energy targets for the state. It is understood he\u2019s backing Labor\u2019s current policy of 50% renewable energy by 2030 and 100% by 2050. \u201cThe impacts of climate change are felt most strongly by the vulnerable and standing up for the vulnerable is what our movement is all about,\u201d he says.

Thousands of lives across other US cities would also be saved, right down to San Francisco, where 114 people a year would avoid dying due to the the heat, compared to a 3C world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/heat-deaths-revised-zip/giv-3902k4V08UC089ye/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/heat-deaths-revised-zip/giv-3902k4V08UC089ye/\">map</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cReducing emissions would lead to a smaller increase in heat-related deaths, assuming no additional actions to adapt to higher temperatures,\u201d said Kristie Ebi, a study co-author and public health expert at the University of Washington.</p> <p>\u201cClimate change, driven by greenhouse gas emissions, is affecting our health, our economy and our ecosystems. This study adds to the body of evidence of the harms that could come without rapid and significant reductions in our greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d</p> <p>Overall, New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago and Philadelphia are set to experience the largest number of heat-related deaths, while places such as Boston and San Francisco will suffer lower death tolls. Researchers projected this by looking at previous records on the relationship between high temperatures and mortality.</p> <p>The planet has already warmed by around 1C since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, due to the release of heat-trapping gases from human activity such as power generation, transportation and deforestation. Even if current Paris agreement pledges are met, the world is on course to heat by around 3C.</p> <p>Scientists have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\">warned the world is now dangerously close</a> to breaching the 1.5C limit, which would push societies to a new reality of severe droughts, coastal flooding, wildfires and the loss of key ecosystems such as coral reefs.</p> <p>But even keeping global temperatures at a 2C increase would save lives compared with the warmer alternative according to the new paper, <a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/6/eaau4373\">published in Science Advances</a>. Researchers found that 1,980 New Yorkers would be saved from a heat-related death at a 2C increase compared with 3C heating.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of heat-related deaths in major US cities could be avoided if rising global temperatures are curbed, new research has found. On current global heating trends, thousands of people are set to perish due to the heat in some extreme years across 15 major US cities, in an analysis by a team of British and American researchers. Once the average worldwide temperature rises to 3C (5.4F) above the pre-industrial period nearly 5,800 people are expected to die in New York City during particularly hot years, more than 2,500 are forecast to die in Los Angeles and more than 2,300 lives will be lost in Miami, all during years of extreme heat. These deaths are predicted for any year that was the warmest for 30 years. This dire scenario would probably be avoided if the world was able to keep to its commitments made in the Paris climate agreement, where governments pledged to limit the global temperature rise to 2C, with an aspiration to keep the increase to 1.5C. If global heating was limited to 1.5C, a total of 2,716 lives would be saved each year from heat mortality in New York City, the researchers found. Thousands of lives across other US cities would also be saved, right down to San Francisco, where 114 people a year would avoid dying due to the the heat, compared to a 3C world. \u201cReducing emissions would lead to a smaller increase in heat-related deaths, assuming no additional actions to adapt to higher temperatures,\u201d said Kristie Ebi, a study co-author and public health expert at the University of Washington. \u201cClimate change, driven by greenhouse gas emissions, is affecting our health, our economy and our ecosystems. This study adds to the body of evidence of the harms that could come without rapid and significant reductions in our greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d Overall, New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago and Philadelphia are set to experience the largest number of heat-related deaths, while places such as Boston and San Francisco will suffer lower death tolls. Researchers projected this by looking at previous records on the relationship between high temperatures and mortality. The planet has already warmed by around 1C since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, due to the release of heat-trapping gases from human activity such as power generation, transportation and deforestation. Even if current Paris agreement pledges are met, the world is on course to heat by around 3C. Scientists have warned the world is now dangerously close to breaching the 1.5C limit, which would push societies to a new reality of severe droughts, coastal flooding, wildfires and the loss of key ecosystems such as coral reefs. But even keeping global temperatures at a 2C increase would save lives compared with the warmer alternative according to the new paper, published in Science Advances. Researchers found that 1,980 New Yorkers would be saved from a heat-related death at a 2C increase compared with 3C heating. In Los Angeles, 759 people would avoid this same fate. \u201cWe are no longer counting the impact of climate in change in terms of degrees of global warming, but rather in terms of number of lives lost,\u201d said the report\u2019s co-author Dann Mitchell, from the University of Bristol\u2019s Cabot Institute. Mitchell said the looming deaths mean he would \u201cstrongly encourage\u201d Americans to hold elected leaders to account over the climate crisis. Donald Trump has vowed to remove the US from the Paris agreement, dismantled many of the policies designed to cut greenhouse gases and has opened up vast areas of federal land and waters to oil, gas and coal extraction. Following a period of gradual decline, US greenhouse gas emissions rose last year. This \u201cenergy dominance\u201d agenda is aimed at turning the US into a major exporter of oil and gas, while propping up the fading coal industry. But a series of disastrous hurricanes and wildfires, influenced by the changing climate, along with a slew of stark warnings from scientists, has provoked record levels of concern among Americans over the climate emergency. A major US government climate assessment released last year warned that heat-related health problems, particularly among the sick and elderly, are already a problem in parts of the country. Research released earlier this week highlighted the health challenges posed by climate change, including extreme weather events, the spread of mosquito-borne diseases and air pollution. The World Health Organization has previously stated that tackling the climate crisis would save at least a million lives a year globally, making it a moral imperative to act. \u201cStrengthened climate actions are needed as they would substantially benefit public health in the United States,\u201d said Eunice Lo, from the University of Bristol\u2019s Cabot Institute and lead author of the heat study. This article was amended on 13 June 2019 to clarify that the deaths are what would occur from a one-in-30-year heat wave occurrence, and are not expected to occur every year.",

      "bodyText": "Oakland has become the second city in the US to decriminalize magic mushrooms and other psychedelics, with a policy that activists hope will spark a national legalization movement. The measure, passed on Tuesday night by councilmembers in the progressive northern California city, comes one month after voters in Denver approved a similar ballot initiative to decriminalize psilocybin, which supporters say can help treat depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and other conditions. \u201cThey are naturally occurring and have been used by humans for thousands of years,\u201d said Carlos Plazola, the director of Decriminalize Nature Oakland, the group behind the measure. He told the Guardian he became interested in decriminalization after he had a transformative experience on mushrooms last fall: \u201cThese are not drugs. These are healing plants \u2026 We just think they should never have been made illegal to begin with.\u201d The Oakland measure, which gained unanimous approval, decriminalizes adult use of psychoactive plants and fungi, including mushrooms, cacti, iboga and ayahuasca. Decriminalization means the city is effectively directing law enforcement not to investigate or prosecute people for the use, sale or distribution of these plants and fungi. The resolution cited research linking psychedelics and natural hallucinogens to a range of mental health benefits. \u201cThese are natural plants that can help you with depression, anxiety, alcoholism,\u201d said councilmember Noel Gallo, who sponsored the measure. \u201cIt\u2019s a remedy that has been proven. People already use them. They already have them at home. It\u2019s not a new product.\u201d For years, California and the city of Oakland have led the way on drug law reforms, with the Golden State becoming the first in the nation to approve medical marijuana in 1996. States across the country have since legalized medical and recreational cannabis, and activists hope Oakland\u2019s mushroom measure will also be a catalyst for reforms in the US. \u201cI think it can have a ripple effect throughout the nation,\u201d said Plazola, a 50-year-old who works in real estate. \u201cThe whole process should be a model for other cities.\u201d It is already rare for law enforcement to prioritize arrests and prosecution for mushrooms. Oakland police have documented 19 cases over five years, Plazola said. He said the resolution was aimed at education and expanded access, noting that there were existing underground networks of doctors, therapists, facilitators and others who help people use psychedelics in safe and responsible ways. \u201cThis is getting the word out about the healing power,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people in communities of color and communities of trauma are not getting access.\u201d When Plazola took mushrooms for the first time in October 2018, he said it helped him overcome childhood trauma that he has struggled with for decades: \u201cIt\u2019s a very personal move for me \u2026 It was mind-blowing the level of transformation it allowed.\u201d Councilmember Rebecca Kaplan said the policy was also in line with ongoing criminal justice reforms: \u201cWe need to continue to act to help end mass incarceration and the war on drugs.\u201d Gallo said he didn\u2019t want police wasting any resources on mushrooms: \u201cLet us take care of our health.\u201d The fungi are still outlawed at the state and federal level. Oakland is not the only jurisdiction pursuing this form of decriminalization. Similar efforts are under way in Oregon, Iowa and across California.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green tried to bully his landlords, and it has backfired, says our financial editor Nils Pratley: Without wishing to panic anyone, it would probably be wise to use up any Arcadia gift cards in the next few days. Just in case creditors don\u2019t approve the company\u2019s restructuring next week - in which case such cards might prove useless. My colleague Miles Brignall explains all here: If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our news story on the Arcadia rescue: Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia fashion empire is teetering on the brink of administration after a crucial vote to rescue the business and secure 18,000 jobs was postponed \u2013 when the billionaire appeared to be losing the support of his landlords. Green\u2019s Arcadia business \u2013 which includes Topshop, TopMan, Miss Selfridge, Evans, Wallace and Dorothy Perkins \u2013 said another vote would be held next Wednesday, in a bid to push through proposals for store closures and rent cuts. Arcadia needed 75% support to win approval and stay in business. An attempt to win backing for that plan had to be pulled after a meeting lasting more than five hours, as it became clear that Green was facing defeat \u2013 and likely administration. The company has a pension deficit of up to \u00a3750m, which would have to be supported by the taxpayer if the company collapses. Arcadia said on Wednesday said it needed more time to conduct further dialogue with a few landlords and \u201censure the long term sustainability of the group, its 18,000 employees and its extensive network of loyal suppliers\u201d. In another blow to the UK economy, Ford is planning to close its Bridgend engine plant in Wales. The move would put more than 1,500 jobs at risk, my colleague Jasper Jolly explains: The company is meeting worker representatives at the south Wales plant on Thursday. A source with knowledge of the process said the plant would close. A Ford spokesman said the company was \u201cnot going to comment on speculation\u201d. Ford is only the latest in a string of major international carmakers to seek to drastically reduce its UK operations this year. Honda in February announced it planned to shut its Swindon plant in 2021, while fellow Japanese carmaker Nissan reversed a decision to build its new X-Trail vehicle at its Sunderland plant. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the structure of Arcadia, which is actually owned by Lady Tina Green of Monaco..... Writing in the Independent, Jim Moore says Arcadia has proved an old City rule -- never call a vote you can\u2019t win. He explains that landlords called Sir Philip Green\u2019s bluff - refusing to wave through another insolvency deal to allow a retailer to shed unprofitable stores and cut the rent on others.... Landlords, including big ones, have been getting increasingly fed up of retailers putting the burden of their difficulties on to their shoulders. They also reasoned that if Sir Philip secured the big rental discounts he\u2019s after then other tenants would demand the same, and perhaps threaten to follow him down the CVA route in time. It\u2019s fair to question the role he personally played in all this too, with his aggressive, abrasive style of doing business and the demands he\u2019s made of landlords in the past. This could have contributed to the reluctance of some to give any quarter now he needs their help. You reap what you sow in business. So they called his bluff and what do you know: the struggling empire, which includes Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Burton among others, hasn\u2019t immediately gone into administration as had been threatened. More here: The landlords who voted against Arcadia CVAs today would not have done so lightly, says Stephanie White, real estate expert at legal firm Stevens &amp; Bolton LLP. She points out that they would suffer if Green\u2019s empire collapsed, as Top Shop, Miss Selfridge, Burton and Dorothy Perkins are all familiar sights on the high street. If Arcadia does not survive then some significant brands will disappear from our shopping centres and some landlords could be facing 4 of 5 vacant units in a row. That result would have a serious impact on the value of the landlord\u2019s estate, it would impact on other tenants, and in time it would create a potential business rates liability that the landlord needs to manage. \u201cObviously, landlords would support a rescue plan if they thought it would leave them better off, but the trend for retail CVAs to lean on the landlord in every case is not sustainable. The landlords who voted against the CVA are choosing to send a message that they will not pick up the bill for every failing retailer on the high street whilst the other creditors walk away unscathed.\u201d More reaction to the delay to the vote on Arcadia\u2019s future: Sunday Times City editor Oliver Shah (who wrote the book on Philip Green), says the Arcadia rescue looks to be in trouble: Retail analyst Sofie Willmott says landlords have fought back, rather than roll over and accept rent cuts to bail Green out. Analyst Mark Faithfull suspects landlords will now squeeze Green hard..... Arcadia\u2019s chief executive, Ian Grabiner, has claimed that there is a \u2018reasonable prospect\u2019 that the restructuring will be approved next week. He says: It is in the interests of all stakeholders that we adjourn today\u2019s meetings to continue our discussions with landlords. We believe that with this adjournment, there is a reasonable prospect of reaching an agreement that the majority of landlords will support. But for that to happen, surely Arcadia will have to sweeten its offer to landlords? Green will have to put more money in, or offer than a bigger stake in the restructured Arcadia. Otherwise, administration looms.... Creditors were actually voting on seven different Company Voluntary Arrangement deals to rescue Arcadia today. It appears that some of those CVAs were going to be rejected by creditors-- forcing Philip Green to dramatically pause the voting, to try to persuade landlords such as Intu (who voted against) to change their mind. Analyst Nick Bubb thinks the retailers have called Green\u2019s bluff -- he had claimed that they had to accept rent cuts and store closures today. Clearly not.... This is quite extraordinary. The future of Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail empire, including Top Shop and Miss Selfridge, could hand in the balance for another week. The vote has now been delayed until Wednesday 12th June, meaning we could go through this drama again in a week\u2019s time. The retail magnate is clearly desperate to use the time to persuade landlords that his offer is better than plunging the whole empire into administration. But this is extremely worrying for its workforce. The decision to adjourn today\u2019s crunch meeting is a very strong signal that landlords had not backed Sir Philip Green\u2019s proposal to restructure Arcadia. He needed 75% of creditors to back the plan -- but as we\u2019ve already heard, some were unwilling to accept the proposed rent cuts. NEWSFLASH: The creditors meeting to decide the fate of Arcadia and its 18,000 staff has just been dramatically adjourned. More to follow! Retail analyst Mark Faithfull says landlords face a tough choice -- but surely letting Arcadia collapse would do more damage to their business than agreeing to rent cuts. The BBC\u2019s Simon Jack points out that UK landlords are running out of patience with retailers demanding a rent cut. Previous Company Voluntary Arrangements (CVAs) have been used by retailers to shed underperforming stores, leaving landlords to take the financial hit. As Sir Philip Green is a multi-millionaire with a glamorous lifestyle and a love of luxury yachts, property groups may be unwilling to cut him a break..... Property Week\u2019s David Parsley has heard that Green has been \u201cbegging\u201d landlords to support the rescue deal. The future of 18,000 jobs hangs in the balance, as we await news from the creditors meeting. This is from Ben Martin of The Times: The result of the Arcadia vote seems to have been delayed. Sarah has heard that Philip Green is phoning creditors trying to persuade them to back the proposal - even though the voting actually happened a couple of hours ago.... Arcadia is just the latest in a string of UK retailers to battle for survival. House of Fraser, for example fell into administration last summer - a journey which Debenhams also took two years ago, as the high street crisis deepened. Arcadia\u2019s financial position now looks extremely serious. With debts rising, and sales and profits down, Arcadia says it simply cannot afford its rental bill of \u00a3170m per year. So, it\u2019s asking creditors to agree to some stores shutting, and hefty rent cuts on others. Arcadia has warned that if today\u2019s CVA is rejected, the group is \u201chighly likely, either immediately or after a short time period, to enter into insolvent administration or liquidation\u201d. Such a collapse would put 18,000 jobs at risk. Green has promised landlords a 20% stake in the business and a \u00a340m compensation fund in an effort to secure their backing. He also pledged to make a \u00a350m cash investment in updating stores and online sales infrastructure at Arcadia \u2013 a sum which underpins the group\u2019s \u00a3135m turnaround plan. More here: It\u2019s understood that British Land and Hammerson - two major Arcadia landlords - were planning to vote in favour of the Arcadia structuring. British Land has 24 Arcadia stores, I believe, while Hammerson owns 18 of its shops. But with Intu (35 stores) and Aviva reportedly voting against (and this isn\u2019t confirmed yet), the vote of Land Securities (with 12 stores) could be crucial. Here\u2019s some photos of Arcadia\u2019s chief executive, Ian Grabiner, arriving at County Hall in central London for today\u2019s vote. Grabiner seems to have declined the chance to speak to Sky\u2019s business correspondent Adam Parsons. The Telegraph\u2019s Ashley Armstrong has heard that the mood among Arcadia\u2019s creditors was \u201cfairly fatalistic\u201d, as they voted on whether to accept the restructuring plan. The BBC\u2019s Jamie Robertson says a decision on Arcadia could be imminent.... One of Arcadia\u2019s biggest landlords has decided to oppose the restructuring deal, according to Sky News. It reports that Intu Properties, which owns Manchester\u2019s Trafford Centre and Lakeside in Essex, is to vote against Arcadia\u2019s company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) today. That would be a blow to Green\u2019s chances of getting 75% support from creditors (most of whom are landlords). Sky\u2019s Mark Kleinman wrote: A source close to Arcadia confirmed that Intu - which declined to comment - had informed it of its decision not to support the proposed overhaul of Sir Philip\u2019s company, which would involve steep rent cuts at more than 150 stores, and the closure of about 50 more. Other major landlords, including British Land, are understood to be leaning towards backing the CVA plans, although many will not make their decisions until the meeting in Central London gets under way. There\u2019s also chatter that Aviva Investors could try to block the rescue. Oliver Buhus, operations director of clothing supplier Paragon, is also attending the CVA meeting. He told us that said if Arcadia collapsed it would have \u201csevere implications for the industry as a whole.\u201d For that reason Buhus has backed the CVA as it was the \u201clogical choice\u201d, saying: \u201cI believe in the CVA and the plans for the business as a whole.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a storm that needs to be weathered. The ship needs to be renavigated and hopefully to come out the other side in a better place.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s worrying for everyone in the supply side. It\u2019s catastrophic if an entity like Arcadia is no longer around. They have spearheaded British fashion..... the potential effect on the industry is monumental.\u201d My colleague Sarah Butler is outside today\u2019s crunch meeting on Arcadia\u2019s future. She spoke with Julian Lochrane who attended the meeting to vote on behalf of three landlords. Lochrane told her that they had all backed the restructuring deal as there was \u201cnot much alternative\u201d \u201cThey threatened administration and [if that happened] we don\u2019t get even what they are offering at the moment.\u201d He said landlords were \u201cfeeling pretty bruised\u201d after a string of CVAs by high street retailers and were being singled out as the \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d. The Sunday Times\u2019s Sam Chambers also suspects today\u2019s vote will be very close: Back in London, the future of Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia retail empire is hanging in the balance. Creditors have been locked in meetings for hours, voting on whether to accept or reject a company voluntary arrangement that would restructure Arcadia. If the deal goes through (and it could be close), Green will be able to shut scores of stores and lay off hundreds of staff, with landlords agreeing to cut the rent on other shops. But if the proposals are rejected, then Arcadia will fall into administration. That would put the future of the whole empire, which includes Topshop, Burton and Miss Selfridge, into serious doubt. Green needs 75% of creditors to back the plan. Most of them are landlords, who have to decide whether to accept steep cuts to their rental income. We\u2019re hearing that a result on the CVA could come within the hour.... Yesterday Green agreed to put an extra \u00a325m into Arcadia\u2019s pension fund, to persuade Britain\u2019s pensions regulator to support the restructuring. The International Monetary Fund has weighed in on the US-China trade dispute, warning that it will cost the world economy deeply. In a new blogpost, IMF chief Christine Lagarde warns that more than $450bn will be wiped off global output if Washington and Beijing impose tariffs on all reciprocal trade, as has been threatened. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: The International Monetary Fund has called for a speedy end to the deepening trade war between the United States and China after calculating that the tit-for-tat tariffs will cost $455bn (\u00a3357.5bn) in lost output next year \u2013 more than the size of South Africa\u2019s economy. Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, underlined her organisation\u2019s growing concern at the most serious outbreak of trade tension since the 1930s and said \u201cself-inflicted wounds\u201d had to be avoided. In a paper prepared for the meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors in Japan this weekend, the IMF calculated that the recently announced intensification of protectionism would cut global gross domestic product by 0.3% in 2020. More here: The latest surveys of America\u2019s services sector paint a rather contradictory picture. Data firm Markit has just reported that services growth hit a three-year low last month, with companies reporting a slowdown in new orders and meagre output growth. That pulled Markit\u2019s US services PMI down to a mere 50.9 in May, down from 53.0 in April, the worst since early 2016. That\u2019s shows a sharp deterioration (50 points = stagnation, with anything higher showing growth) So far, so bad. But the Institute for Supply Management has a much more upbeat assessment of the situation. Its rival Services PMI has jumped to 56.9 in May from 55.5 in April (which had been a 20-month low). According to the ISM, service sector activity grew steadily last month, despite other indicators suggesting the US economy. I mentioned in the opening post that investors are treating bad news as good news this week. Poor economic data is being taken as a sign to buy stocks, on the grounds that central bankers will cut interest rates (usually good for asset prices). And this trend is continuing. The US stock market has opened higher, with the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 gaining 0.5% in early trading. Traders are concluding that the slump in US job creation last month makes an early Fed rate cut even more likely. One of the leading players in Italy\u2019s government has hit back at the EU, suggesting that Rome is being treated unfairly. Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the radical Five Star Movement, has posted on Facebook that Italy will talk constructively with Brussels over its budget plans. But Di Maio (with some justification), argues that other countries have run much higher deficits than Italy without being sanctioned. He writes: \u201cWe will go to Europe and sit around a table with responsibility, not to destroy but to construct. \u201cBut it\u2019s very annoying that every day a new way is found to speak badly about Italy and this government.\u201d Significantly, Di Maio also ruled out ditching plans to reverse raising Italy\u2019s pension age to 67 -- despite criticism that it will worsen the country\u2019s financial position. Getting back to Italy.... the EC\u2019s main concern is that its debt is \u2018snowballing\u2019, as its deficit grows and asset sales fail to bridge the gap. Bloomberg explains: \u201cItaly\u2019s public debt remains a major source of vulnerability for the economy,\u201d the commission said in its report. The ratio of the nation\u2019s debt to gross domestic product will \u201crise in both 2019 and 2020, up to over 135%, due to a large debt-increasing \u2018snowball\u2019 effect, a declining primary surplus, and underachieved privatization proceeds,\u201d according to the report. \u201cWhile refinancing risks remain limited in the short term, the high public debt remains a source of vulnerability for Italy\u2019s economy,\u201d the commission added. More here. Newsflash from America: Job creation by US firms fell sharply, and unexpectedly last month. There were just 27,000 new hires by private sector companies in May, according to the closely watched payroll report from ADP. That\u2019s down from 271,000 in April, and is the lowest since 2010 -- when America\u2019s economy was struggling back from the financial crisis. ADP reports that small US businesses cut 52,000 jobs last month, while small firms hired 11,000 people and large company payrolls grew by 68,000. It is further evidence that the US economy has slowed this year, as the trade war with China raises the risks of a recession. It is likely to also fuel predictions that America\u2019s central bank will be forced to cut interest rate soon. Green party MEP Sven Giegold says Germany should also face the wrath of the EU -- for not spending enough! Giegold argues that it\u2019s wrong to penalise a country for running a budget deficit, without penalising those who also run large surpluses (they are, after all, part of the same situation). \u201cThe Commission must end its selective approach to dealing with transgressions in the Eurozone. The excessive current account surplus of Germany is destabilising the Eurozone, just as the excessive budget deficit of Italy does. This Janus-faced approach to dealing with instability in the Eurozone only serves to undermine the long term stability of the whole project.\u201d But.. he also supports the move against Italy: Unfortunately, Italy continues to flaunt the rules of the Stability Pact, so an excessive deficit procedure is logical. A common currency needs common rules, and we will only have stable Eurozone if the rules are adhered to. \u201cHowever, while the Commission is forced to act, it must ensure that the Italian people do not suffer at the will of the market or the whims of their fractious government. Prime Minister Conte\u2019s appeal to revise common budget rules should be listened to carefully, as governments need more scope for spending during crises and incentives for investment as well as binding rules for reserves during the good times.\u201d Markus Ferber, an MEP representing Germany, has welcomed the Commission\u2019s recommendation to plunge Italy into an excessive deficit procedure. Ferber says Italy deserves everything it gets -- and wants France to also face disciplinary action for failing to cuts its borrowing. \u201cItaly deliberately decided to ignore the European fiscal rules and it feels like groundhog day. Unlike before, the European Commission has to be tough this time. The Italian government does not seem to understand any other language after all. Had the European Commission not backed off the last time, the current escalation could have been avoided. It is a mistake only to look at Italy though. The European Commission\u2019s own Spring Economic Forecast predicted that France will also miss the deficit threshold. If the European Commission wants to be a credible defender of the Stability and Growth Pact, it has to treat all offenders equally and that means also launching a procedure against France.\u201d This chart shows how Italy is only at the start of the excessive deficit procedure process (the bottom of the pyramid). Ultimately it could be fined 0.2% of its annual GDP (or around \u20ac3.5bn, according to my rough maths). It\u2019s not clear how taking money off Italy will help it lower its borrowing. Europe\u2019s leaders may also be reluctant to take a step that would worsen relations with Rome, and could also hand populist leaders such as Matteo Salvini another tool for his eurosceptic push. Today\u2019s Commission report on Italy shows that its public debt stood at 132.2% of GDP in 2018, far above the EU\u2019s 60% limit. Many other countries have debt piles over 60% of GDP too, but the EC is unhappy that Italy\u2019s deficit isn\u2019t falling fast enough (in its view). \u201cMoreover, Italy is not projected to comply with the debt reduction benchmark in either 2019 or 2020 based on both the government plans and the commission 2019 spring forecast.\u201d Agnese Ortolani of the Economist Intelligence Unite has tweeted more details: The EC has good news for Madrid -- it recommends that Spain should be removed from its excessive procedure, having brought its deficit into line. Spain was sanctioned back in 2016, and threatened with fines unless it lowered its deficit (leading to tax rises and spending cuts). Italy\u2019s stock market has fallen into the red, as traders digest the EC\u2019s recommendation. The FTSE MIB is now down 163 points, or 0.8%, to 20,065, with banks stocks falling by 1.7%. It\u2019s the only European market showing losses today, with the EU-wide Stoxx 600 up 0.5%. European commissioner Pierre Moscovici is making more conciliatory noises towards Rome - suggesting that sanctions can yet be dodged. Speaking alongside Dombrovskis in Brussels, he says Italy\u2019s government can still avoid being dragged into an excessive deficit procedure: \u201cAs always with all member states, we are ready to look at new data that could change this analysis..... My door is open. Such data would, I suspect, have to show Italy cutting some of its spending and tax-cutting plans. Journalist Dave Keating has also flagged up that Italy hasn\u2019t been hit by disciplinary action yet -- but the process has certainly moved closer. Valdis Dombrovskis, the EC\u2019s vice-president for the euro, is explaining today\u2019s decision - and putting the boot into Italy. He tells reporters that Italy has not complied with Europe\u2019s debt rules. That\u2019s because its deficit is forecast to hit 2.5% of GDP this year, over the target of 2%. Dombrovskis also warns that \u201crecent policy choices\u201d have damaged Italy\u2019s economy, a pop at the (fragile) coalition of right-wing Lega Nord and anti-establishment M5S parties. He points out that Italy\u2019s growth has almost ground to a halt (it only just escaped recession), and that servicing its national debt (over two trillion euros) is taking up a lot of its budget. In theory, an excessive budget deficit procedure could end with Italy being fined by Brussels, and being forced to accept stricter oversight of its tax and spending plans. We\u2019re not there yet, though. The EC says disciplinary action is warranted against Italy, because it has only made limited progress in hitting European budget targets. It also says Italy has backtracked on structural reforms, a criticism of its coalition of right-wing and anti-establishment parties who took power last year. NEWSFLASH: The European Commission has escalated its battle against the Italian government over its debt levels, recommending that disciplinary procedures are launched. The EC has concluded that Rome\u2019s budget is not compliant with EU rules, and that it would be \u201cjustified\u201d in opening disciplinary procedures against Italy\u2019s government. The Commission has NOT opened a \u201cexcessive deficit procedure\u2019 against Italy today, though -- first, European Union states must have their say in two weeks time. But even so, it\u2019s a significant move in the long clash between Brussels and Italy\u2019s coalition government, which has been pushing to raise spending and cut taxes. The ruling comes as part of the Commission\u2019s latest assessment of the eurozone economy, which is being announced now. More to follow.... The drop in UK car sales last month is another sign that the Brexit crisis is acting like an anchor on economic growth. Jonathan Moss, partner and head of transport at law firm DWF says: \u201cNew car registrations figures have again declined 4.6% in part because of the current economic and political ambiguity around the impact of Brexit and uncertainty around the changes in political leadership. He\u2019s also concerned that Britain\u2019s carmakers will suffer: \u201cFrom an industry perspective, the current market also puts a significant strain on manufacturers, who are dealing with increasing pressure on carbon emission standards in the face of significant uncertainty and declining registrations numbers.\u201d Last week we learned that UK car production plunged by 44% in April, as the industry braced for a Brexit that never came. Further uncertainty is clearly unwelcome. Here\u2019s our news story on the weak UK purchasing managers reports. It\u2019s still early (barely 6am in New York), but there are signs that Wall Street will rally again today. The Dow Jones industrial average is up almost 145 points on the futures marker, following Tuesday\u2019s 512-point spike (the second-biggest jump of 2019). Investors continue to cling to hopes that America\u2019s central bank will cut interest rates to cushion the blow from the US-China trade war. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management warns, though, that there\u2019s only so much the Fed can do: US Federal Reserve Chair Powell signalled the Fed could ease policy if the costs of US trade taxes become too high. Trade taxes impose three costs: 1) directly via fiscal tightening and higher prices; 2) indirectly via uncertainty, reducing investment and adding risk; 3) indirectly, as lower investment slows global manufacturing and trade. The Fed can offset direct costs relatively easily. The Fed might be able to offset uncertainty and a risk premium for investing in the US, but that is more difficult. The Fed has less ability to act on the global costs \u2013 that is up to other central banks. Ultimately the Fed can blunt the impact of a slowdown from trade taxes. It probably cannot stop a slowdown from trade taxes. Global growth is likely to be below trend this year (it was likely to be trend, absent trade taxes). However, Fed action would be able to reduce the risk of recession. One of Britain\u2019s largest service sector companies has just announced a sweeping office closure plan, as it tries to cut costs. BT is slashing its UK offices from 300 to just 30, shrinking its property footprint and obviously worrying its staff. My colleague Mark Sweney has the story: The company has announced the first eight locations for its UK workforce, which is being whittled down to about 75,000. London, Manchester, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Belfast, Bristol, Ipswich and Birmingham have been named as \u201ckey locations\u201d for BT maintain a presence. Last May, BT announced plans to cut 13,000 jobs over three years, and move out of its central London headquarters after almost 150 years, to cut \u00a31.5bn in costs after a torrid 18 months. In May, BT\u2019s share price hit its lowest level since 2011. More here: There are bright spots in today\u2019s PMI report, despite the slowdown in growth. For example, business optimism has hit its highest level in eight months. That may suggest companies are less worried about a no-deal Brexit, now that Article 50 has been extended until at least the end of October. Markis adds, though, that political uncertainty is still a problem: There were reports citing cautious optimism about the outlook for customer demand, as well as confidence regarding forthcoming business expansion plans. Some firms also commented on efforts to mitigate rising staff costs through improved productivity. However, survey respondents also noted that domestic political uncertainty remained a key factor holding back their growth expectations for the year ahead. Britain\u2019s economy will only managed \u201cmuted growth\u201d in the current quarter after a \u201cdifficult May\u201d, predicts economist Howard Archer of EY Item Club. Here\u2019s his take on the latest PMI report: We suspect that the economy will struggle to grow any more than 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter following expansion of 0.5% in the first quarter - as it is hampered by some unwinding of the major stockbuilding that occurred in the first quarter amid concerns of a disruptive Brexit occurring at the end of March. Prolonged Brexit uncertainties, a fraught UK political situation and a challenging global economic environment are also weighing on economic activity in the second quarter. There was modest improvement in most areas of the services survey in May but it is still in the slow lane. Overall activity was at a 3-month high, while new business growth rose for the first time this year but only marginally. Jobs growth was at a 6-month high while confidence improved to an 8-month high While some improvement was reported in underlying business conditions, Brexit uncertainties was still said to be holding back client demand. Business and consumer spending was reported subdued. The overall weakness of the May purchasing managers\u2019 surveys reinforces belief that the Bank of England will maintain a cautious \u201cwait and see\u201d approach on interest rates amid heightened economic, political and Brexit uncertainties. We believe the Bank of England is likely to keep interest rates at 0.755 through 2019. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics suggests the PMI surveys are being dragged down by the political uncertainty which has gripped Britain for months (and may not relax its grip for some time). Economists are concerned that Britain\u2019s economy lost momentum in May, even though the services sector grew a little faster. Here\u2019s some snap reaction: Newsflash: Britain\u2019s economy is close to stagnation, despite a pick-up in service sector growth last month. Data firm Markit has just reported that its composite PMI index, which tracks activity across the UK private sector, fell last month to just 50.7, from 50.9. That\u2019s closer to the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction, and one of the weakest readings since 2012. This slump was mainly driven by contractions in UK manufacturing and construction (the figures were released earlier this week). It\u2019s not all gloom - bosses at service sector companies say that new orders have finally picked up, for the first time this year. That pushed the services PMI up to 51 from 50.4 in April -- showing faster, but not exactly fast, growth. The slowdown in the global economy, and the impact of the Brexit crisis, are both to blame. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says: \u201cAlthough service sector business activity gained a little momentum in May, with growth reaching a three-month high, the pace of expansion remained disappointingly muted and failed to offset a marked deterioration in manufacturing performance and a fall in output of the construction industry during the month. As a result, the PMI surveys collectively indicated that the UK economy remained close to stagnation midway through the second quarter as a result, registering one of the weakest performances since 2012. \u201cCompanies reported that activity, order books and hiring were all subdued by a combination of weak demand \u2013 both in domestic and overseas markets \u2013 and Brexit-related uncertainty. \u201cOn a brighter note, optimism about the year ahead picked up to an eight-month high, in part reflecting an easing of near-term concerns due to the extension of the Brexit deadline to 31st October. However, it is clear that many businesses remain cautious in relation to spending and investing in the uncertain political environment, which is exacerbating the impact of a wider global economic slowdown on the UK.\u201d Back in the UK, car registrations have fallen in another sign that economic confidence is weak. Car sales slid by -4.6% in May with 183,724 units registered, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reports. That follows a 4.1% drop in April. The SMMT blames \u201cthe underlying economic and political instability\u201d in the UK (ie Brexit) for hurting consumer and business confidence. The diesel emission scandal is another factor. Demand for diesel-fuelled cars has slumped by 18.3% year-on-year, extending a slump that began more than two years ago. The SMMT says: Modest growth in registrations of petrol (1.0%) and alternatively fuelled vehicles (11.7%) was not enough to offset the significant decline in demand for diesels, which fell for the 26th consecutive month. Ongoing anti-diesel sentiment and the forthcoming introduction of low emission zones continues to affect buyer confidence. Just in: The eurozone economy grew a little faster than expected last month, despite geopolitical worries. Data firm Markit reports that European service sector firms expanded solidly last month. This pushed its eurozone services PMI, which tracks activity, up to 52.9 in May, from April\u2019s 52.8. That\u2019s better than the \u2018flash\u2019 reading two weeks ago, with firms reporting that output and new orders picked up. But business confidence fell last month, to the lowest level since the start of 2019. Optimism is being dented by \u201congoing worries over Brexit, US-China trade and European political instability\u201d, says Markit. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has cut its growth forecast for China, and warned that the trade war with the US is hurting. The Fund now expects China\u2019s economy to grow by 6.2% this year, down from 6.3% previously. That reverses a small upgrade earlier this year. It follows the breakdown in negotiations between Beijing and Washington last month, which led to both sides adding more tariffs on each others goods. Deputy managing director David Lipton warned: \u201cThe near-term outlook remains particularly uncertain given the potential for further escalation of trade tensions.\u201d The Fund also suggested that Beijing may need to stimulate its economy, if the trade war doesn\u2019t ease soon. European stock markets have also risen in early trading. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has gained 30 points to a one-week high of 7,244. Technology, consumer cyclicals and industrial companies are the top sectors -- they\u2019d all benefit if a US interest rate cut from faster economic growth. The French and German markets are also up almost 0.5% -- not as big a jump as on Wall Street last night, but another sign of investors positioning for lower borrowing costs. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Powell gave the markets what they wanted to hear, and the result was a spectacular rally, as traders increased their bets of a rate cut happening before the year end. Jerome Powell\u2019s speech followed similar comments from other Fed officials earlier in the week. This is usually a sign that the Fed wants to prepare investors for a shift in policy. Risk assets lifted as investors responded to the prospect of a lower interest rate environment. An environment which is more favourable to business owing to reduced borrowing costs. The US Federal Reserve\u2019s dual mandate is to keep American inflation steady and unemployment as low as possible. But... it often feels like there\u2019s a third mandate - keep the stock markets up. Back in the 1990s, the idea of the \u201cGreenspan put\u201d was invented - because Fed chair Alan Greenspan could always be relied on to ease policy and boost liquidity if things looked rocky. [A put option gives an investor the chance to sell an asset at a fixed price, so it\u2019s insurance against a market crash]. As CNBC explains, we may be in the era of the Powell put - if the Fed chair is really serious about acting \u201cas appropriate\u201d. \u201cThe market wanted to hear from Powell. When Powell says \u2018we are watching the market\u2019 \u2014 whether it\u2019s right or wrong \u2014 the market starts believing in a Powell put,\u201d said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Private Wealth. He also noted \u201csentiment became extremely negative on a short-term basis.\u201d These comments come amid increasing expectations for a Fed rate cut. The CME FedWatch tool indicated a 90% chance of a September rate cut. Expectations for a second rate cut in December were also above 80%. Government bond prices are also being driven higher, by the prospect of interest rate cuts. This has pushed down the yield (effectively the rate of return) on Japan\u2019s sovereign debt today. Two-year Japanese bonds are now deeper into negative territory, meaning an investors is guaranteed to lose money if they hold them until they mature. Japan\u2019s stock market has matched last night\u2019s Wall Street rally, by jumping by 2% as well. The Topix index gained 30 points to 1,530, amid speculation that the Fed might lower interest rates this year. The Hong Kong and Australian markets also got a lift.... even though Jerome Powell\u2019s comments yesterday were somewhat cryptic. Promising to act \u201cappropriately\u201d isn\u2019t exactly a concrete pledge. As Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank explains, Powell didn\u2019t do anything to dampen rate cut expectations. How much truth there was in the big rally for markets yesterday and how much was dramatised is open for question. Indeed, the last 24 hours has seen a marked change in sentiment and although it\u2019s hard to completely attribute the move to Powell\u2019s comments at the Fed conference yesterday, the fact that the Chair seemingly didn\u2019t push back on very dovish market pricing did at least fill investors with a bit more confidence. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019ve reached the point in the economic cycle where bad news is good news. Wall Street has just posted its best day in five months, as investors bet that an interest rate cut is coming over the horizon. America\u2019s top central banker, Jerome Powell, cheered the rate cut lobby yesterday when he pledged that the Fed would \u201cact as appropriate\u201d to protect the US economy from the disruption caused by trade wars. Powell singled out \u201crecent developments involving trade negotiations\u201d as a key issue on the Fed\u2019s radar, saying: We do not know how or when these issues will be resolved. \u201cWe are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the U.S. economic outlook and, as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion... Read between the lines, and that\u2019s being taken as a hint that the Fed is prepared to cut borrowing costs to ward off a recession. Powell\u2019s comments came a day after America\u2019s factory growth hit a near-decade low, suggesting the world\u2019s largest economy is cooling. The World Bank swiftly followed by slashing its economic forecasts, and predicting the weakest growth for global trade since the 2009 financial crisis. You might expect this torrent of gloom to upset investors. But not yet. Instead, they sniff the prospect of looser monetary policy, and another dollop of the good stuff into the punch bowl. So, shares jumped in New York, sending the Dow Jones industrial average up by 512 points - its second best day of the year. The broader S&amp;P 500 also jumped by over 2%. Asian stock markets have also rallied overnight, as traders pour back into stocks - which look cheaper after May\u2019s losses. Analyst Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management says Jerome Powell has cheered the markets: Equity investors love cheap money, and U.S. stocks posted their best day in five months Tuesday as traders lifted themselves off the mat after Chair Powell suggested a willingness to lower interest rates if the economy slows in response to escalating tariffs. The odds were doubtlessly in favour of rate cuts from the Fed in 2019 but overnight and ahead of the upcoming June FOMC meeting, Chair Powell changed the Fed messaging just enough to avoid signalling a shift from patient to panicked. And while falling well short of confirming the markets overly dovish expectations, it was music to U.S. investors ears who have been starved of positive news of late. Of course, they\u2019ll be singing a different tune if the Fed a) doesn\u2019t cut rate, or b) can\u2019t prevent the US economy sinking into recession. Problems for another day, perhaps. Also coming up today We\u2019ll get another insight into the health of the global economy, when data firm Markit\u2019s latest surveys of purchasing managers at service sector companies are released. The UK services PMI is expected to remain near stagnation, nudging up to 50.6 from 50.5. The eurozone PMI, though, could remain safely in expansion territory (around 52.5). America is expected to lead the way, with a services PMI around 55. It\u2019s a crucial day for retail magnate Sir Philip Green. His Arcadia group could plunge into administration, unless creditors agree a restructuring plan to shut stores and slash rents. Plus, the SMMT will report how many new cars were registered in the UK last month. Car sales fell 4.1% in April, so the industry will be hoping for a bounceback.

But I hear it\u2019s going to work out very well here.\u201d<br><br>Varadkar interjected that Ireland wished to avoid a border or a wall, a keystone of Irish government policy.<br><br>\u201cI think you do, I think you do,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe way it works now is good, you want to try and to keep it that way. I know that\u2019s a big point of contention with respect to Brexit. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to work out very well. I know they\u2019re focused very heavily on it.\u201d</p> \n<p>In London on Tuesday Trump met the Brexiter politicians Nigel Farage, Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson, all of whom have played down the idea that the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland will be a problem after the UK leaves the EU.</p> \n<p>Trump echoed their confidence in Shannon. \u201cThere are a lot of good minds thinking about how to do it and it\u2019s going to be just fine. It ultimately could even be very, very good for Ireland. The border will work out.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Irish government has mounted an intense, three-year diplomatic effort arguing the opposite, that Brexit threatens peace and prosperity on the island of Ireland.</p> \n<p>The US president\u2019s comments were an awkward start to what is expected to be a low-key end to his visit to Europe, with much of his time spent at his golf and hotel resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. From Shannon airport he took a short helicopter ride to his resort on the Atlantic coast.</p> \n<p>Addressing the media after Trump\u2019s departure, Varadkar said he explained the history of the border and the Troubles in their private meeting. \u201cWe talked Brexit. President Trump shares our objective to keep the border open.\u201d He said Trump had not elaborated on why he thought Brexit could benefit Ireland.</p> \n<p>The two leaders also discussed trade, visas and taxes paid by US corporations with operations in Ireland.</p> \n<p>The Irish president, Michael D Higgins, made an unexpected intervention on the eve of the visit by calling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/05/donald-trump-tells-prince-charles-us-is-clean-on-climate-change\">Trump\u2019s policy</a> on the climate emergency \u201cregressive and pernicious\u201d, a critique protesters will echo at rallies in Shannon and Dublin.</p> \n<p>Trump told reporters he was unaware of Higgins\u2019 comments and reiterated that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/05/eight-reasons-why-trumps-clean-climate-claims-fail-to-stack-up\">US had enjoyed cleaner air and water since he became president</a>, a claim he also made in London.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ebdb9af4-c3f3-4930-b197-76b61fd1b60d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLx7nk7FtwA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>After three days of pomp, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/04/d-day-event-must-be-about-veterans-not-donald-trump\">pageantry and politics</a> during his state visit to Britain, Trump and his entourage, which includes his wife, Melania, and his four adult children, will be mostly out of the public gaze in the remote, windswept landscape of Loop Head peninsula.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, Trump will travel to France for D-day commemorations before returning to Doonbeg, where he is due to play a round of golf on Friday before flying home.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/05/britain-d-day-commemoration-trump-brexit-war\">Brexit Britain and Trump\u2019s America are a betrayal of the values D-day was fought for | Martin Kettle</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Irish police deployed 1,500 uniformed officers plus 500 members of specialised units, including divers and armed and air support, to secure Shannon airport and Doonbeg.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s 162-hectare (400 acre) resort was in lockdown and closed to the public. Newly installed surveillance cameras with night-vision capability fed images to a police control room.</p> \n<p>Roads to the adjacent village of Doonbeg remained open. Locals have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/04/doonbeg-why-one-irish-village-wont-join-the-trump-protests\">erected US flags</a> and expressed hope Trump would visit one of their pubs, despite him being teetotal.</p> \n<p>The resort employs more than 300 people during summer and is an economic lifeline for the region. Fr Joe Haugh, the parish priest, said: \u201cThe people are 99.9% behind him.\u201d</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, there were protests by individuals and groups opposed to the US president\u2019s record on the environment and the rights of women, immigrants, ethnic minorities and LGBT people.</p> \n<p>Demonstrators set up a \u201cpeace camp\u201d outside Shannon airport, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jun/05/donald-trump-baby-blimp-review-protest-art\">Trump </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jun/05/donald-trump-baby-blimp-review-protest-art\"> blimp </a>used by protesters in London was due to appear at a rally in Dublin on Thursday.</p> \n<p>The visit has created a political and diplomatic challenge for the Irish government. Trump is not popular in Ireland. Varadkar reportedly asked to have the meeting at Shannon airport, a neutral venue, rather than in Trump\u2019s resort.</p> \n<p>The hosts, however, are keen to lobby the US president over trade, visas for Irish workers and support for the peace process. They also want to explain the potential impact of Brexit on the border and try to placate Trump over Ireland\u2019s low-tax regime and use of Huawei technology in the new 5G network.</p> \n<p>Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, sought a delicate balance when asked about Higgins\u2019 criticism of Trump\u2019s climate policies. The Irish president caught the mood of the Irish people quite well, he told RT\u00c9, but regressive was \u201ca better adjective\u201d than pernicious.</p> \n<p>The hosts will be hoping Trump does not broach a source of personal irritation. Environmental objections have stalled a sea barrier he wishes to build to protect his resort from erosion. The US president has <a href=\"http://www.antaisce.org/articles/trump-and-doonbeg-%E2%80%98environmental-tricks%E2%80%99-and-eu-bureaucracy\">described the battle</a> as an \u201cunpleasant experience\u201d.</p>",

Trump, sitting next to a visibly uncomfortable taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, waded into the Brexit debate minutes after Air Force One touched down at Shannon airport on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cI think it will all work out very well, and also for you with your wall, your border,\u201d he said at a joint press conference. \u201cI mean, we have a border situation in the United States, and you have one over here. But I hear it\u2019s going to work out very well here.\u201d Varadkar interjected that Ireland wished to avoid a border or a wall, a keystone of Irish government policy. \u201cI think you do, I think you do,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe way it works now is good, you want to try and to keep it that way. I know that\u2019s a big point of contention with respect to Brexit. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to work out very well. I know they\u2019re focused very heavily on it.\u201d In London on Tuesday Trump met the Brexiter politicians Nigel Farage, Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson, all of whom have played down the idea that the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland will be a problem after the UK leaves the EU. Trump echoed their confidence in Shannon. \u201cThere are a lot of good minds thinking about how to do it and it\u2019s going to be just fine. It ultimately could even be very, very good for Ireland. The border will work out.\u201d The Irish government has mounted an intense, three-year diplomatic effort arguing the opposite, that Brexit threatens peace and prosperity on the island of Ireland. The US president\u2019s comments were an awkward start to what is expected to be a low-key end to his visit to Europe, with much of his time spent at his golf and hotel resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. From Shannon airport he took a short helicopter ride to his resort on the Atlantic coast. Addressing the media after Trump\u2019s departure, Varadkar said he explained the history of the border and the Troubles in their private meeting. \u201cWe talked Brexit. President Trump shares our objective to keep the border open.\u201d He said Trump had not elaborated on why he thought Brexit could benefit Ireland. The two leaders also discussed trade, visas and taxes paid by US corporations with operations in Ireland. The Irish president, Michael D Higgins, made an unexpected intervention on the eve of the visit by calling Trump\u2019s policy on the climate emergency \u201cregressive and pernicious\u201d, a critique protesters will echo at rallies in Shannon and Dublin. Trump told reporters he was unaware of Higgins\u2019 comments and reiterated that the US had enjoyed cleaner air and water since he became president, a claim he also made in London. After three days of pomp, pageantry and politics during his state visit to Britain, Trump and his entourage, which includes his wife, Melania, and his four adult children, will be mostly out of the public gaze in the remote, windswept landscape of Loop Head peninsula. On Thursday, Trump will travel to France for D-day commemorations before returning to Doonbeg, where he is due to play a round of golf on Friday before flying home. The Irish police deployed 1,500 uniformed officers plus 500 members of specialised units, including divers and armed and air support, to secure Shannon airport and Doonbeg. Trump\u2019s 162-hectare (400 acre) resort was in lockdown and closed to the public. Newly installed surveillance cameras with night-vision capability fed images to a police control room. Roads to the adjacent village of Doonbeg remained open. Locals have erected US flags and expressed hope Trump would visit one of their pubs, despite him being teetotal. The resort employs more than 300 people during summer and is an economic lifeline for the region. Fr Joe Haugh, the parish priest, said: \u201cThe people are 99.9% behind him.\u201d Elsewhere, there were protests by individuals and groups opposed to the US president\u2019s record on the environment and the rights of women, immigrants, ethnic minorities and LGBT people. Demonstrators set up a \u201cpeace camp\u201d outside Shannon airport, and the Trump blimp used by protesters in London was due to appear at a rally in Dublin on Thursday. The visit has created a political and diplomatic challenge for the Irish government. Trump is not popular in Ireland. Varadkar reportedly asked to have the meeting at Shannon airport, a neutral venue, rather than in Trump\u2019s resort. The hosts, however, are keen to lobby the US president over trade, visas for Irish workers and support for the peace process. They also want to explain the potential impact of Brexit on the border and try to placate Trump over Ireland\u2019s low-tax regime and use of Huawei technology in the new 5G network. Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, sought a delicate balance when asked about Higgins\u2019 criticism of Trump\u2019s climate policies. The Irish president caught the mood of the Irish people quite well, he told RT\u00c9, but regressive was \u201ca better adjective\u201d than pernicious. The hosts will be hoping Trump does not broach a source of personal irritation. Environmental objections have stalled a sea barrier he wishes to build to protect his resort from erosion. The US president has described the battle as an \u201cunpleasant experience\u201d.",

Bumrah surgically removed the openers, then Chahal destroyed the middle order. But South Africa\u2019s tail, once so strong, rolled back the years to turn 89-5 into 227 and give them just a glimmer of hope. Half their attack is missing, so it will be the tallest of orders, but it\u2019s not impossible. Their score is 14 more than either side made in the famous tied semi-final of 1999.</p> <p>What do we need to keep the excitement bubbling during the lunch break? Someone at Sky reckons it\u2019s a chance to see that semi-final again, which could be just what Faf du Plessis needs to fire his team up. Our man Abhijato Sensarma reckons it\u2019s another change of structure for the World Cup.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to present my (rather radical) World Cup format:</p> <p>\u201cTop ten teams according to ODI rankings will be divided into two groups of five teams each. Teams ranked 1-5 occupy G1 and teams ranked 5-10 occupy G2. Top five teams from Qualifying Tournament occupy G3.<br>\u201cEach team plays others in its group once. All teams of G1 will qualify for the Knockouts (a reward for overall excellent form over the last four years), top two will qualify from G2, and the group winner from G3.<br>\u201cThe quarter-finals happen after the round-robin. QF1: G1 winner v G3 winner. QF2: G1 first runners-up v G2 first runners-up. QF3: G1 second runners-up v G2 winner. QF4: G1 third runners-up v G2 fourth runners-up. Semis: QF1 winner v QF4 winner, Q2 winner v Q3 winner. Final as per usual.<br>\u201cThis format does what the ODI Championship seeks to do in a more concrete manner - make all matches played in the four-year-cycle relevant. Teams will be motivated to perform since being in G1 gives secure qualification to the Knockouts. 37 matches played overall, with Big Three getting 5 guaranteed matches. Your thoughts?\u201d Ingenious, but complicated. Formats have to be simple, especially in cricket. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cf7c1a38f083bb37cf5c6b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/adam-collins\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-05T13:21:37.065Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Right, that\u2019s enough from me. </strong>Tim de Lisle is here to guide you through the rest of the break and India\u2019s chase of 227-8.

They\u2019ve been doing it since last time out in Oz and have clearly noticed that it, you know, <em>works. </em>Makes them look hellishly strong.\u201d</p> <p>Exactly this. And a lot of it comes back to Kohli\u2019s captaincy. I\u2019m repeating myself a bit here, but the way he uses Jadhav shows what superb touch he has when it comes to his bowling changes. At the peak of his powers in every way.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bbfbb50097c6f473cb5ae4a7bafa01850399c4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bbfbb50097c6f473cb5ae4a7bafa01850399c4b/0_221_4521_2713/1000.jpg\" alt=\"South Africa\u2019s Andile Phehlukwayo thwacks the ball.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South Africa\u2019s Andile Phehlukwayo thwacks the ball.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-05T12:37:45.228Z\">at 1.37pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5cf7b28a8f08066241118c4d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-05T12:19:22.242Z\">1.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>38th over: South Africa 146-6 (Phehlukwayo 26, Morris 5) </strong>Nice shot, Phehlukwayo down the track to the first ball over Chahal\u2019s fresh over, lofting neatly over mid-off for a couple, then adding a single square of the wicket.

Not mathematically, but you know what I mean.<br></p> <p>Did everyone see Kagiso Rabada\u2019s pop at Kohli a couple of days ago, saying that the Indian captain is \u201cimmature\u201d on the field? A touch cheeky given his own form, but I liked it. When asked about it yesterday, the bearded supremo was very happy to leave it through to the \u2018keeper.

It\u2019s like sitting an exam in your favourite subject. But Monday\u2019s thriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/03/england-pakistan-cricket-world-cup-match-report\">between England and Pakistan</a> has stayed with me for a full 36 hours. There\u2019s one question nagging away: how did the world\u2019s greatest chasers, playing at home, on their favourite ground, against a team out of form, manage to lose?</p> <p>As in any good thriller, there are several suspects. </p> <p><strong>1 England\u2019s fielding</strong> Poor old Jason Roy\u2019s drop is threatening to become as famous as Ben Stokes\u2019s catch, but it was costly (Hafeez added another 70 off, from memory, 51 balls). And England\u2019s ground fielding was shoddy. \u201cIt cost us 15 or 20 runs,\u201d said Eoin Morgan, himself one of the offenders. They lost by 14.<br></p> <p><strong>2 Extras</strong> England conceded 20, Pakistan only eight. Bung in a few overthrows and, again, you have the difference between the sides.</p> <p><strong>3 Fast bowlers</strong> England\u2019s were faster, but Pakistan\u2019s were more incisive. Jofra Archer (who actually bowled well) ended up with 0-79, and Chris Woakes only took wickets at the death. The first scalp for an England seamer came in the 33rd over. Mark Wood was excellent (2-53), but Ben Stokes didn\u2019t come to this party (0-43) and Liam Plunkett was badly missed. Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz took five wickets between them, and they struck at vital moments. </p> <p><strong>4 Leg spinners</strong> England\u2019s main wicket-taker in one-day cricket is Adil Rashid, partly because Morgan so obviously trusts him. Not on Monday: Rashid\u2019s first five overs went for 43, and his second five never came. Shadab Khan, by contrast, opened the bowling, removed Jason Roy, and returned to deceive Joe Root with his quicker ball. </p> <p><strong>5 The hundred</strong> When Joe Root reached three figures, he was the first man to do so in this World Cup. But there is such a thing as a match-losing century (just ask Pakistan, who made a few of them in May). Root, superb as he was in many ways, struggled to lift his strike rate above a run a ball, and he ended up with 107 off 104. The overall asking rate was seven an over, so if he went at six, his partners had to go at eight. The great Jos Buttler managed it, with 103 off 76 \u2013 he and Root, house-mates last winter in Sydney, are beautifully matched. Chris Woakes managed it, briefly. But nobody else could do it, and Morgan and Stokes ate up 36 balls between them while making only 22 runs. Compare and contrast with Sarfaraz Ahmed (55 off 44 balls) and Pakistan\u2019s last five batsmen (46 off 30). </p> <p>Conclusion: it\u2019s a funny old game. And a complicated one. Now over to Adam Collins \u2013 see you after lunch.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-05T09:23:42.273Z\">at 10.23am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5cf67a7f8f08d4e6b70dde49\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-04T14:05:57.365Z\">3.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tim de Lisle's preamble: not easy, tigers</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Quiz question. </strong>What does Virat Kohli have in common with the Queen? Answer: probably quite a few things, but the most relevant one is that the Queen arrives at a party last. Today, as South Africa embark on their third match of this World Cup, India play their first. According to sources close to the OBO readership (thank you Abhijato Sensarma), it\u2019s because their board insists on a break after the IPL. And, I might add, because the ICC doesn\u2019t always twig that the point of a governing body is to make sure the rich and powerful are treated the same as everyone else.</p> <p>The ethics may be dubious, the optics off-putting, but the aesthetics could be the better for it. The Indians are walking straight into the middle of a drama. The South Africans are tottering already after losing to England and Bangladesh, both times after winning the toss. To add injury to insult, they have now lost the great Dale Steyn too. They stand second-bottom in the table, fractionally above Afghanistan. They are even behind India, because their net run rate is -1.25 whereas India, being yet to take the field, are on 0. (Of the four subcontinental nations, by the way, Bangladesh are top, being well ahead of Sri Lanka and Pakistan on net run rate. Savour the moment.)</p> <p>So South Africa come to the party as the cornered tigers. That phrase comes from the 1992 World Cup, the only other one to have the same format as 2019 \u2013 all play all, no groups. There were nine teams then and Imran\u2019s tigers got out of their corner with just four wins (and a no-result). Faf du Plessis, as impressive as Imran in his demeanour, reckons that this time it will take six wins out of nine. So, if they lose today, every game becomes a knock-out.</p> <p>For India, things are far more relaxed. They did lose their last three one-day internationals \u2013 all at home, against a resurgent Australia \u2013 but that was before the IPL, so it will feel like years ago. The question for Kohli and co. is whether they can hit the ground running, as West Indies and New Zealand have (both on net run rates above 5, three times as good as anyone else\u2019s). We\u2019re in Southampton, where the pitch is usually very sporting. Play starts at 10.30am BST. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/04/south-africa-bowler-dale-steyn-is-ruled-out-of-cricket-world-cup\">South Africa's woes continue with Dale Steyn ruled out of World Cup</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-05T09:11:37.863Z\">at 10.11am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cHats off to Rohit,\u201d says Kohli, \u201cHis innings was special. Very professional win. With the bat, we had to be careful.\u201d He was going to bowl first anyway, so the toss was immaterial. \u201cBumrah was just brilliant. [After I caught de Kock off him] my hands were buzzing, that\u2019s how quick he\u2019s bowling. And Chahal was outstanding as well.\u201d And that\u2019s it from me. Thanks for your company and your correspondence. Do join Nick Miller for what looks like a tasty contest between Bangladesh and New Zealand. One of them will go top of the table tonight. Don\u2019t you love a World Cup? \u201cIndia were magnificent on a difficult pitch,\u201d says Faf du Plessis, dignified in defeat. \u201cRabada was a champion ... Morris was excellent.\u201d India were clinical this morning \u2013 Bumrah blasting out the openers, Chahal eviscerating the middle order \u2013 and professional this afternoon, with Sharma outstanding and Kohli eclipsed for once. South Africa only turned up with about half a team \u2013 de Kock, who took a wonder catch, and the three seam bowlers, Rabada, Morris and Phehlukwayo. They made most of the runs, then bowled superbly, only to see the Indians escape through a bizarre blend of bad luck, bad fielding and tentative field-setting. So SA have nul points after three games, and have almost gone already, while India become the eighth team on two points. Their net run rate is a modest +0.3, which puts them sixth, between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, just like on the map. \u201cKohli\u2019s at the wheel,\u201d says a flag in the crowd. Hard to see him doing a Solskjaer, but you never know. Another carve from Pandya (15 off seven balls) and that\u2019s it. 47th over: India 223-4 (Sharma 122, Pandya 9) Enter Hardik Pandya, the first Indian who seems to be aware that net run rate might come in handy. He treats Morris with disdain \u2013 a brutally fast-handed cut, followed by a whack through midwicket. \u201cTrying to figure who Dhoni reminds me of with his imperious demeanour,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cExudes a certainty of smiting all before him with minimal effort. Vintage Franz Beckenbauer, perhaps?\u201d Was he a smiter? Another top edge (what is Dhoni up to?) and this time it\u2019s caught as Morris decides the fielders are not to be trusted and grabs it himself, even if it means falling onto the stumps at the non-striker\u2019s end. He\u2019s been immense today, and it\u2019s still not going to be enough. 46th over: India 213-3 (Sharma 121, Dhoni 34) Rabada is still plugging away, when that spill could have reduced him to rubble. He induces a top edge from Dhoni, not once but twice, only for both to fall safely to earth. This is going to be the first time SA have lost three World Cup matches in a row, ever, or at least since 1992, when they entered the fray. 45th over: India 208-3 (Sharma 120, Dhoni 30) Another sweep for four by Sharma, off Tahir. Some kind of DJ is urging the crowd to make some noise, and, this being England, they are politely declining. 44th over: India 198-3 (Sharma 112, Dhoni 28) Sharma parks his disbelief to guide a four over de Kock\u2019s head \u2013 cheeky. The offender at cover seems to have been David Miller. Jason Roy will feel his pain. That is a shocker. Rabada digs one in, Sharma reaches for the sky, and the man at cover lets the dolliest dolly you\u2019ve ever seen pop out of his hands. 43rd over: India 193-3 (Sharma 107, Dhoni 28) Dhoni sees that Shamsi is still on and decides to change gear, cutting for four and slogging for a single, before Sharma sweeps a four and laps, delightfully, for three. Dhoni cuts for two to make 15 off five balls. And the run rate is back to five. That\u2019s magisterial. 42nd over: India 179-3 (Sharma 100, Dhoni 21) That\u2019s another tidy over from Phehlukwayo, and the rate has crept up above a run a ball (49 off 48), which will bother the Indians not a jot. Sharma\u2019s hundred came off 128 balls, the slowest of his ODI career, because of the excellence of Rabada and Morris. Against the spinners, he\u2019s made 57 off 58. 41st over: India 176-3 (Sharma 100, Dhoni 19) Good from Shamsi, but again South Africa\u2019s fielding lets them down. \u201cVery measured response from India,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cIf Kohli were a backgammon man, I suspect the doubling dice would have been played some time ago?\u201d Not being a backgammon man myself, I\u2019ll have to take Brian\u2019s word for it. Dhoni edges Shamsi and Markram, the sub fielder, can\u2019t hold on at slip. That is surely the final nail. Sharma plays a simple push for a single, leaves the nerveless nineties and reaches three figures for the 23rd time in ODIs. Uncertain at first, he has been commanding ever since. 40th over: India 171-3 (Sharma 97, Dhoni 17) Morris keeps Dhoni quiet, but doesn\u2019t bowl quite full enough to beat his back-foot prods. After four dots, Dhoni cuts for two and pulls for one. India need 57 off the last ten, which should be a piece of cake for these two. Here\u2019s Dave Brown. \u201cI can totally understand why a player would choose money over their country of birth,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it is their pretence of loyalty to their new home that gets me. KP having a Three Lions tattoo springs to mind. I\u2019ve got an Eye of Horus tattoo but it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a sodding pharaoh!!\u201d 39th over: India 168-3 (Sharma 97, Dhoni 14) Phehlukwayo concedes four singles. South Africa will insist on being respectable when they need to be explosive. Still, there\u2019s a nice retweet from my colleague Ali Martin here. 38th over: India 164-3 (Sharma 95, Dhoni 12) Now it\u2019s no spin at all as Morris returns. His extra bounce makes Sharma think a bit, and a fuller ball brings an LBW shout against Dhoni, but du Plessis doesn\u2019t review. Dhoni cashes in with a flick-pull for four. 37th over: India 158-3 (Sharma 94, Dhoni 7) The spin-twin phase of the innings comes to an end as Faf brings back Phehlukwayo. Whether or not he bothers the batsmen, he will definitely slow down the OBO. After doing well to string together four dots, he tries a short one and Sharma sees it so early that his pull goes straight back past the bowler. Sharma has shown why he is the second-highest-scoring ODI batsman since the last World Cup, deferring only to Kohli. 36th over: India 154-3 (Sharma 90, Dhoni 7) Shamsi pushes one through and gets it past Dhoni\u2019s attempted cut. \u201cSouth African here,\u201d says Andrew Gladwin. Excellent. \u201cI think the biggest factor in the decline is simply money \u2013 players with a choice (like KP) can make more money playing for England, and other can make more money (with more security) being Kolpak or playing in T20 leagues (AB de Villiers). Quotas have played some role, but possibly more in reinforcing money-based decisions. Poor administration of cricket in SA doesn\u2019t help. \u201cThe fear is that we are going to end up with money driving India, Australia and England to be the only competitive nations, with clear second and third tiers below them. The hope is that this is a World Cup too far for a fading great generation of SA cricketers, as was 2003 \u2013and that the nucleus of the next generation is there for another great SA cricket team \u2013 Markram, de Kock, Ngidi, Rabada.\u201d The OBO at its best. 35th over: India 150-3 (Sharma 88, Dhoni 5) Yet another over from Tahir, who concedes the regulation five. India\u2019s 150 comes up off 207 balls. Slip sliding away. 34th over: India 145-3 (Sharma 86, Dhoni 2) Seeing that his spinners have amassed no wickets in 13 overs betwen them, du Plessis decides to bowl them in tandem. Dhoni sends for his cap, giving us a better view of the flinty look on his face. Shamsi bowls a tidy over, for just two, but tidiness won\u2019t get the tigers out of the corner. And now a word from our fashion editor. \u201cI disagree with OB Jato about the kit,\u201d says Damian Burns. \u201cIn fact all the teams seem to have gone for some kind of vintage throwback style (i.e. England 92 which looks horrible by the way), and they really don\u2019t have the same razzmatazz as some of the usual ODI kits. Definitely wouldn\u2019t spend fifty quid on any of these shirts.\u201d 33nd over: India 143-3 (Sharma 86, Dhoni 1) Tahir continues and I\u2019m just thinking \u201cwell that\u2019s one way to ensure we don\u2019t get another wicket\u201d when Dhoni and Sharma have a misunderstanding about a run. Both of them might have been out, had there not been another fumble in the field. Oh dear. Sharma celebrates with a late cut, so late that he almost pinches the ball out of de Kock\u2019s gloves. India need 85 off 17, so still bang on five. South Africa need two quick wickets \u2013 these two. 32nd over: India 139-3 (Sharma 83, Dhoni 0) A well-deserved wicket for Rabada, who is ready and raring to get at old man Dhoni. Dhoni has other ideas, making a point of fiddling and fidgeting, desperate to be the big guy in the room. He doesn\u2019t need to do that. Playing from the crease, he sees off three balls, so that\u2019s a wicket-maiden. Breakthrough at last! Rabada bowls what seems a fairly standard ball, seam-up, but Rahul gets his timing all wrong and pops a catch to Faf at mid-off. Is there still some life in this? 31st over: India 139-2 (Sharma 83, Rahul 26) Tahir continues \u2013 why, I cannot tell you. Sharma celebrates by square-driving him for four and rubs it in with a couple of twos. Ten off the over. \u201cAt least,\u201d says OB Jato, \u201cthe Proteas\u2019 kit is one of the most beautiful I\u2019ve ever seen. Aesthetic consolation?\u201d 30th over: India 128-2 (Sharma 73, Rahul 25) Now even Rabada is bearing gifts \u2013 a juicy short one, despatched by Sharma with a lordly pull. And here\u2019s Gangesh. \u201cGreat to feast on your memes from England.\u201d Er, thanks. \u201cSA\u2019s displays so far have been dismal. They have done little of note. Saddened, indeed. How is their decline to be explained? The quota system prevalent in sports there, or is it England playing the villain by poaching the cream of their talents? What is your take, gentlemen?\u201d I\u2019m going to throw that out in the hope that someone reading this knows more than me. 29th over: India 123-2 (Sharma 69, Rahul 24) Sure enough, Shamsi comes off, but it\u2019s Tahir who comes on. Maybe Faf thinks he can get wickets here just by keeping the runs down. But the Indians have other ideas: Rahul somehow plays a flick for three from the off bail to fine leg\u2019s right, and Sharma cuts for four. India need 105 more from 21 overs, at the very straightforward rate of five. 28th over: India 115-2 (Sharma 64, Rahul 21) Rabada returns and instantly finds the edge as Rahul brings a crooked bat down from somewhere near his right shoulder. It flies to second slip, where ... there\u2019s only empty space. Next ball, Rabada beats Sharma. He is in danger of putting in one of the great non-winning World Cup performances here. 27th over: India 113-2 (Sharma 63, Rahul 20) Every boundary counts today and now Shamsi hands one to Sharma, who swats a bit of filth off his legs to bring up the fifty partnership \u2013 53 off 65 balls. To twist the knife, Sharma plays a delicate late cut for four more. Eleven off the over, and that\u2019s surely the last we see of poor Shamsi. 26th over: India 102-2 (Sharma 54, Rahul 18) After that daisy-chain of dots, Morris bowls a wide, of all things, as a bouncer goes too high. By the end of the over, Morris is conceding a four, as a paddle-pull from Rahul races through Shamsi\u2019s half-hearted attempt to stop it at long leg. India\u2019s hundred came up off 155 balls, epitomising this episode of period drama. \u201cAfter a pretty disheartening performance in the first innings,\u201d says Richard Mansell, \u201cat least SA are managing to make a decent fist of it now. The game is not yet out of our reach, although we need a wicket or two, and fast.\u201d Spot-on. 25th over: India 95-2 (Sharma 53, Rahul 13) Shamsi continues \u2013 it\u2019s almost as if Faf isn\u2019t reading the OBO. He concedes only three and has a minor moral victory as Sharma charges him, meets the ball on the full and miscues into the deep. 24th over: India 91-2 (Sharma 50, Rahul 13) Morris has been even better in this spell than his first one. After tying down Rahul, he befuddles Sharma: an edge, a fend, another edge \u2013 held at first slip by Amla, but on the half-volley. That\u2019s another maiden and the veteran Morris has the magnificently retro figures of 6-3-10-0. 23rd over: India 91-2 (Sharma 50, Rahul 13) After a run of dots, Sharma gets fed up, dances down the track and lofts Shamsi over long-on for six. He then goes to fifty, off 70 balls, with a more sedate single: aftre a streaky start, he\u2019s played very well. Faf needs to do something: get Shamsi off, bring Rabada back and post five slips, before it\u2019s too late. Does the tiger know when it\u2019s cornered? 22nd over: India 82-2 (Sharma 43, Rahul 11) Phehlukwayo is taken off, after that wobbly fifth over, and Chris Morris returns. First ball back, he beats Rahul with a classic seamer\u2019s delivery, holding its line outside off. And that\u2019s a maiden. \u201cWith reference to Mr Fuller\u2019s point (16th over),\u201d says Gary Naylor, \u201cWhat A Wonderful World... Cup.\u201d Absolutely. 21st over: India 82-2 (Sharma 43, Rahul 11) A few more singles off Shamsi. This partnership is worth 28 already, off 33 balls: purposeful stuff. \u201cAfter watching the opening spells of Bumrah and Rabada,\u201d says Abhu, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any more from old farts who think that fast bowling is dead\u2019.\u201d Fair point \u2013 it\u2019s been a fast bowler\u2019s World Cup so far. 20th over: India 77-2 (Sharma 41, Rahul 9) Rahul sees a mere hint of a half-volley from Phehlukwayo and plays a straight drive for four. That\u2019s the shot of the afternoon. Pulling his length back, Phehlukwayo offers Sharma a long hop. The Indians are beginning to cut loose. 19th over: India 68-2 (Sharma 37, Rahul 4) Tahir does come off, but he gives way to another spinner, the left-arm wristie Tabraiz Shamsi. He makes a solid start. 18th over: India 65-2 (Sharma 35, Rahul 3) Phehlukwayo continues, and again he is comfortably pulled, this time by Sharma for two. But the Indians are having to work for nearly all of their runs. It\u2019s been a fine performance by South Africa\u2019s bowlers, with the ball as well as the bat. 17th over: India 62-2 (Sharma 33, Rahul 2) Sharma grabs the wheel by pulling Tahir for four, first ball of the over, and then there are a few singles. The most interesting thing about Tahir\u2019s spell has been that, at 40, he is older than the umpire \u2013 Michael Gough, who is 39. And that\u2019s drinks, with India on top but not having it all their own way. 16th over: India 54-2 (Sharma 27, Rahul 0) Finally, a four from Kohli. Phehlukwayo drops short and Kohli sees it so early that he can pull on the front foot. That\u2019s almost dismissive \u2013 but it leads to his dismissal, as Phehlukwayo, helped by de Kock, gets the wicket South Africa most wanted. He jumps for joy, as well he may. \u201cWith reference to the great Mr Armstrong,\u201d says John Fuller (13th over), \u201ca quick flurry of wickets and we\u2019re looking at Hello Dhoni!\u201d Let\u2019s hope so. Goddim!! A rising ball outside off, an uncharacteristic waft, a thick edge, and a stunning catch by Quentin de Kock. Put that on the news. 15th over: India 50-1 (Sharma 27, Kohli 14) Tahir continues, and Kohli brings out a hockey shot, whipping a push to mid-on. He\u2019s warming to the task, and Tahir is only keeping it tight, not really threatening. \u201cAfter Afghanistan and Sri Lanka yesterday and now this,\u201d wonders Daniel Howell, \u201cwhat happened to \u2018the modern game favours the batsmen, no total is too high to chase\u2019? Gower, Gooch, Stewart and co. would have been at home with these scores.\u201d Very true. 14th over: India 47-1 (Sharma 26, Kohli 12) Another moral victory for Phehlukwayo, who lures Kohli into a classic edge, only to see it elude the man at gully. Come on Faf, go for broke and give us the full cordon. You know Steve Waugh would. 13th over: India 44-1 (Sharma 25, Kohli 9) Five singles off Tahir. It\u2019s still tense, but the pendulum is moving, like the hand of a clock, towards India. \u201cAll the time in the World Cup,\u201d echoes Andrew Benton (9th over). \u201cThe great Louis Armstrong\u2019s just missing Cup off the end...\u201d 12th over: India 39-1 (Sharma 23, Kohli 7) So, a good start from Phehlukwayo, another bowler who batted well today. But not quite good enough, and both batsmen are finding the singles. It was Phehlukwayo\u2019s second ball, it was angled in, it was hitting the leg bail \u2013 umpire\u2019s call, so Sharma escapes. The game could have done with a wicket there. Against Sharma. Not given, looks a bit high. 11th over: India 34-1 (Sharma 21, Kohli 4) Tahir returns and concedes only two singles. 10th over: India 34-1 (Sharma 21, Kohli 4) Kohli plays a Harrow cut! And nearly edges into leg stump. End of the powerplay, which was riveting. \u201cCricket,\u201d says Andrew Benton firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s a bowler\u2019s game. Protect your wicket and you\u2019re more than halfway there. Slogs for six and blasts for four make for popular telly, but the patience and skill of the bowlers makes the game, any game. And for that, there can surely be no contest.\u201d Discuss! Something else to read here, about the only England team who have a 50-over World Cup win on their CVs. 9th over: India 31-1 (Sharma 19, Kohli 3) Back to Morris v Kohli, to allow everyone to calm down. Five more dots, then a tuck for two in one of the gaps caused by having slips. Kohli knows that India have all the time in the World Cup. Faf knows he has to take early wickets. 8th over: India 29-1 (Sharma 19, Kohli 1) Rabada produces another beauty to beat Sharma, who responds with a nonchalant six, just helping a bouncer on its way. Next ball, a simple forward prod goes for four through the vacant fourth slip. Another bouncer, more wayward, brings a spectacular goalkeeper\u2019s save from de Kock. And then Sharma cuts for four more. Who needs Kohli? 7th over: India 14-1 (Sharma 5, Kohli 1) Facing Morris, Kohli continues his YouTube demonstration of the forward-defensive, mixed in with the odd exaggerated leave. He has only one off ten balls, but he looks so alert, it\u2019s alarming. 6th over: India 14-1 (Sharma 5, Kohli 1) Kohli is greeted by three slips, quite rightly, and a bouncer from Rabada, to follow up his suggestion that Kohli was \u201cimmature\u201d. The great man is standing outside his crease, as he did when he conquered English conditions last summer. He gets well forward and it gets him off the mark as he spots a quick single to mid-off. Rabada, though: he has figures of 3-0-3-1, and they don\u2019t flatter him. Justice is done. Another textbook length ball from Rabada, and Dhawan can only feather it to the keeper. Three more like that and it\u2019s game on. But here comes Kohli... 5th over: India 13-0 (Dhawan 8, Sharma 5) Tidy from Morris. This, kids, is what one-day cricket used to be like. \u201cIf India can get past the new ball against Rabada and co,\u201d says Rohit Singh, \u201cthey will back themselves for a comfortable win.\u201d And his email was sent straight after the first over, before the seamers got going. 4th over: India 11-0 (Dhawan 8, Sharma 3) Rabada is so hungry he\u2019s ready to start the over before the openers have had time to notice that they\u2019re in England, where the ball sometimes moves off the seam. Every ball is testing, mostly line and length but ending with a crisp yorker, which breaks Dhawan\u2019s bat. Another superb over. If all this is too much and you feel like a wander through the pages of history, try this on the day Kapil Dev made 175. 3rd over: India 10-0 (Dhawan 8, Sharma 2) Faf takes Tahir off and turns to Chris Morris, who should be buzzing after top-scoring with 42. He too beats the edge and then finds it, as Sharma pops over gully. India could be four down \u2013 as well as all the edges and misses, there was a run-out chance off the first ball of that over, when Dhawan tipped and ran, rather desperately. He recovers some poise with a whip for the first four of the innings. Breathless stuff. 2nd over: India 4-0 (Dhawan 3, Sharma 1) Kagiso Rabada is up for this. After making a handy 30, he begins by beating Dhawan with a jaffa, then finding an edge off the shoulder that just pops over gully. Faced with the right-handed Sharma, Rabada does it all again in reverse \u2013 a looping edge, agonisingly short of second slip, and a play-and-miss. That may well be the over of the day, and it didn\u2019t yield a wicket. 1st over: India 3-0 (Dhawan 2, Sharma 1) Imran Tahir takes the new ball, as at the very beginning of this World Cup. He starts with a couple of dots, only for a misfield at cover to get the board ticking. And another, off the last ball. If SA are going to be sloppy in the field, they might as well concede now. \u201cProtears,\u201d says a punning email from Sandile Xaso. \u201cI\u2019d like to welcome you by saying it\u2019s been a good day, but for any Proteas fan, it\u2019s been miserable. Our team looks undercooked, with no clear plan. Also seems we don\u2019t have the stomach for the fight! Our batting has failed to fire, looking outmoded and lacking any sort of thrust. Bowling has been wayward and fielding shoddy. Basically, we\u2019re having England\u2019s 2015 campaign.\u201d Not that bad, surely. \u201dI\u2019ve found a good pillow that I\u2019m now going to cry into as Dhawan and Kohli flay our bowling attack.\u201d Time for action. The South Africans are having a huddle, the fans are returning to their seats (looking a bit chilly), and here come Messrs Sharma and Dhawan, perhaps eyeing an early finish. Thanks Adam and afternoon everyone. That was a hell of a performance from India: no rust, no messing, no mercy. Bumrah surgically removed the openers, then Chahal destroyed the middle order. But South Africa\u2019s tail, once so strong, rolled back the years to turn 89-5 into 227 and give them just a glimmer of hope. Half their attack is missing, so it will be the tallest of orders, but it\u2019s not impossible. Their score is 14 more than either side made in the famous tied semi-final of 1999. What do we need to keep the excitement bubbling during the lunch break? Someone at Sky reckons it\u2019s a chance to see that semi-final again, which could be just what Faf du Plessis needs to fire his team up. Our man Abhijato Sensarma reckons it\u2019s another change of structure for the World Cup. \u201cI would like to present my (rather radical) World Cup format: \u201cTop ten teams according to ODI rankings will be divided into two groups of five teams each. Teams ranked 1-5 occupy G1 and teams ranked 5-10 occupy G2. Top five teams from Qualifying Tournament occupy G3. \u201cEach team plays others in its group once. All teams of G1 will qualify for the Knockouts (a reward for overall excellent form over the last four years), top two will qualify from G2, and the group winner from G3. \u201cThe quarter-finals happen after the round-robin. QF1: G1 winner v G3 winner. QF2: G1 first runners-up v G2 first runners-up. QF3: G1 second runners-up v G2 winner. QF4: G1 third runners-up v G2 fourth runners-up. Semis: QF1 winner v QF4 winner, Q2 winner v Q3 winner. Final as per usual. \u201cThis format does what the ODI Championship seeks to do in a more concrete manner - make all matches played in the four-year-cycle relevant. Teams will be motivated to perform since being in G1 gives secure qualification to the Knockouts. 37 matches played overall, with Big Three getting 5 guaranteed matches. Your thoughts?\u201d Ingenious, but complicated. Formats have to be simple, especially in cricket. Right, that\u2019s enough from me. Tim de Lisle is here to guide you through the rest of the break and India\u2019s chase of 227-8. Bumrah and Chahal were the stars of the morning, two fantastic bowlers. Talk to you at Trent Bridge tomorrow. Bye! Speaking of crowds, as soon as I am off the blog I will try and find out why at least a quarter of the seats have nobody in them here today. A bit odd, isn\u2019t it? On a more positive note, I am sure The Oval will be packed with Bangladesh fans, as it was on Sunday. They have picked up eight per cent of all tickets to this tournament, I read on the weekend. Through another project I am working on, looking at the 1999 World Cup two decades later, we spoke to the trailblazing captain of Bangladesh\u2019s first World Cup team, the great Aminul \u201cBulbul\u201d Islam. Great piece from Andy Bull to keep you entertained through the interval. He went for a wander at Trent Bridge the other day and learned a few things about the composition of crowds at this World Cup. A far from ideal final over for the Proteas, only able to take three from it. After losing Morris, Rabada got a couple away to cover but gave the strike to Tahir from the next ball, leaving the tailender two balls to score off. He couldn\u2019t, skying the final delivery of the innings to Jadhav, giving Bhuvi a second late wicket. India\u2019s target is 228. Morris skies the second ball of the final over high in the air towards Kohli at long-off, who does it with ease. The crowd behind him, cameras at the ready, love it. 49th over: South Africa 224-7 (Morris 42, Rabada 28) Dot ball to start from Bumrah, his slower ball so hard to hit when he lands it in the channel at a left-hander. Rabada hacks one from the next, giving the strike to Morris. Can he launch long? Not this time, Bumrah doing the fielding off his own bowling after successfully cramping him up. He tries to go back over his head from the next but doesn\u2019t get much of it at all, the ball coming off the splice and landing just over Bumrah\u2019s head running back with the flight. Rabada now, who plays a lovely drive past mid-off up inside the circle, his second four. Last ball, penultimate over, and he misses the slower ball. Had he made contact, it was going to Portsmouth. Not to be. Fantastic from Bumrah, six taken from the 49th; his final set. The attack-leader will walk off with 2/35 to his name, claiming both openers in his super first spell. 48th over: South Africa 218-7 (Morris 41, Rabada 23) Bhuvi vs Rabada, who whacks a full toss into the gap at mid-off for two to begin, then heaves another to long-on to give Morris his chance. He\u2019s not able to find the rope though, picking out point. Rabada again, and it\u2019s a fat top edge landing safely at fine leg, coming back for two. Morris gets a chance against the final ball. It isn\u2019t timed well but they do race back hard for two. Good batting to grab nine off it without a boundary. 47th over: South Africa 209-7 (Morris 38, Rabada 17) Shot! Morris shuffles outside the leg stump to carve Bumrah through extra cover for four. Rabada, lifting a couple over midwicket, makes it a 50-run partnership for these two in 43 balls, the second stand reaching that mark in this innings. They\u2019ve done well together, especially Morris who has form against Indian bowlers in the IPL. Rabada retains the strike with a slap to point with three overs to come. 225? 235? \u201cLooks like we are back to 2005 all over again. Federer Nadal about to meet at Roland Garros,\u201d suggests Avitaj Mitra. \u201cSouth Africa with a pleasing run rate reminiscent of the early to mid 2000s. An Ashes series to come, which would do well to match the quality of the 2005 edition.\u201d We should be so lucky. 46th over: South Africa 200-7 (Morris 33, Rabada 13) Bhuvi hasn\u2019t picked up a wicket today but he\u2019s been so consistent and the perfect partner for Bumrah. Morris is swinging hard now - nearly caught in the deep at the start of the over and trying to put the Indian quick on the moon at the end - but he does enough in the smaller money between times (helped by a couple of wides outside the off stump) to scrap eight from it, raising the South African 200 in the process. Chris Dent notes that all the wickets are on the ICC website here, which is certainly the case - good point. I was more interested in the twitter videos that Sky post, but this is a good place to catch up if you want to a clinic from Bumrah/ Chahal. \u201cI had some small hope that SA might actually do surprisingly well this tournament,\u201d writes Richard Mansell, \u201cbut the opposite has happened. Rather than being middling they are performing rather badly. It\u2019s pretty depressing, as an SA supporter.\u201d Yes, this must suck. But who knows. They might bowl out India for 100 and it\u2019ll be one of the great comebacks. Stick it out. See what happens. 45th over: South Africa 192-7 (Morris 29, Rabada 12) The perfect man to stunt any semblance of momentum? Jasprit Bumrah. Back for his third spell to close the innings, he\u2019s too good for Rabada at either end of the over, a leg bye and a single to Morris the only runs. He has 2/20 off eight. 44th over: South Africa 190-7 (Morris 28, Rabada 12) Three good overs on the bounce for the Proteas, Morris repeating a shot from the previous time he was up against Chahal, picking out midwicket off the back foot and making no mistake.. SIX RUNS! Chahal\u2019s day ends with 10-0-51-4, the best figures recorded across ten completed overs in World Cup 2019 so far. 43rd over: South Africa 182-7 (Morris 21, Rabada 11) Hardik is back for his sixth, which is essentially the final over of India\u2019s fifth bowler with Jadhav banking four earlier on. He\u2019s ahead in the count, so to speak, until the final ball when Rabada pulls away a ball on leg stump into a gap for four. He\u2019s hanging in there but Morris needs to be the man through to the finish line. Also, I neglected earlier to mention earlier that Tanya Aldred is on the county cricket beat today. Keep her blog open all day in the other browser. 42nd over: South Africa 173-7 (Morris 19, Rabada 4) Morris knows the deal here, making up for lost time in the previous over by launching a rare long-hop into the crowd at midwicket. Three other singles to the sweepers makes it a good one, and importantly, Morris is up the business end for the start of the 43rd as well. Be sure to hop into The Guardian\u2019s World Cup podcast with Emma John and her team of rotating guests. I think I\u2019m joining her in about week four. 41st over: South Africa 164-7 (Morris 11, Rabada 3) Kuldeep\u2019s final over, in at Rabada to begin who takes a couple off the face of his blade down to third man. A genuine edge follows, of the inside variety, just missing his woodwork. Morris, the man who needs the bulk of the strike from here, doesn\u2019t get to face a ball. Kuldeep finishes his day with 10-0-46-1, JP Duminy his earlier scalp. Nicely bowled. 40th over: South Africa 161-7 (Morris 11, Rabada 1) Rabada is off the mark first ball, Morris picking out a gap off his pads for a couple to finish the successful Chahal over. I wish I could share with you the vision of the wickets but, as previously noted, they don\u2019t appear to be going up today. That\u2019s a bit odd. Do digital rights change when India are playing? I wouldn\u2019t doubt it for a single second. \u201cMakes you wonder if there oughtn\u2019t to be an award at the end of the competition for Best Captain?\u201d writes John Starbuck. \u201cIt might not be the one with the champion team.\u201d Yup. It\u2019s why you pick your captain first, and so on. Yuzi has four! After clearing the boundary in the previous over, Phehlukwayo tries to repeat the dose walking down at Chahal but with plenty of spin back at the batsman he is beaten between bat and pad. Dhoni does the rest, much to the joy the crowd. 39th over: South Africa 157-6 (Phehlukwayo 34, Morris 8) WHOA! SIX RUNS! Phehlukwayo over the rope for the first time in the South African innings, leaning back and clobbering Kuldeep from the crease over cow corner, high and handsome into the crowd. Five other singles to the sweepers makes 11 from it, their first double-digit over of the innings as well. \u201cDear Mr Collins (since everyone\u2019s going all Jane Austen).\u201d If it isn\u2019t Robert Wilson in Paris. G\u2019day, Bob. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth noting amidst all the biff and bash and dosh and cash, that this Indian team has become exceptionally squeezy. 30 overs for 120 odd is an OCD-level grip on the game. For all the flair and the funk, there\u2019s something devastatingly humourless about way they strangle all the oppo\u2019s options bit by bit like some tight-fisted cricketing abattoir. They\u2019ve been doing it since last time out in Oz and have clearly noticed that it, you know, works. Makes them look hellishly strong.\u201d Exactly this. And a lot of it comes back to Kohli\u2019s captaincy. I\u2019m repeating myself a bit here, but the way he uses Jadhav shows what superb touch he has when it comes to his bowling changes. At the peak of his powers in every way. 38th over: South Africa 146-6 (Phehlukwayo 26, Morris 5) Nice shot, Phehlukwayo down the track to the first ball over Chahal\u2019s fresh over, lofting neatly over mid-off for a couple, then adding a single square of the wicket. Two wides from Chahal helps make six from it, which will do for now. \u201cThe Saffers are... Saffer-ing?\u201d Oh gosh, OB Jato. No. \u201cI\u2019ll show myself out.\u201d 37th over: South Africa 140-6 (Phehlukwayo 23, Morris 4) Spin twins again, Kuldeep on for a third spell. Morris finds one from the first ball to square leg but Phehlukwayo is stuck at the crease for the rest. He tries to reverse sweep Chahal but doesn\u2019t mix it up in the same way against Kuldeep. He gets one down the ground to finish but with 23 from 52 balls, he has to be at the end now while shifting up several gears in the final ten. Kuldeep has two overs left, Chahal four. 36th over: South Africa 138-6 (Phehlukwayo 22, Morris 3) A false stroke from Morris first up, miscuing a cut shot that deflects off an underedge past Dhoni for three. Gary Naylor just wants South Africa to get close to credibility. Who knows. After losing Miller in that successful Chahanl over, that is quite a lot harder. Miller is done by a bit of extra bounce, returning the most straightforward chance to Chahal in his follow through. What a waste. 35th over: South Africa 134-5 (Miller 31, Phehlukwayo 21) Bhuvi is giving nothing away and Phehlukwayo is reluctant to get jazzy with his footwork. Four dots, two singles. Rinse and repeat. 34th over: South Africa 132-5 (Miller 30, Phehlukwayo 20) I still find it hard to believe that Jadhav gets a trundle on the global stage but this is the genius of Kohli, only wheeling him out when batsmen know they can\u2019t risk getting out to him. He\u2019s even beating the bat now, Miller late on one that turns just enough. Thankfully, Phehlukwayo decides enough is enough and steps out of his ground to create a half-volley that he can slap over cover for four. But after that, he is back in defence for the second half of the set. Five off. Jadhav has 0/16 off four and that\u2019ll probably be his work done with plenty of overs up the sleeve of his colleagues. 33rd over: South Africa 127-5 (Miller 29, Phehlukwayo 16) Bhuvi\u2019s back after that two over burst from Bumrah at the Non-Hotel End. It\u2019s the best I can do; every stand here looks the same. After three singles - Miller down the ground, Phehlukwayo tucking; Miller too - their stand sits at 39 off 60 balls. Nothing about this is easy but they have to find a way to lift the tempo very soon. 32nd over: South Africa 124-5 (Miller 27, Phehlukwayo 15) A maiden from Bumrah followed by Jadhav sneaking through an over giving up only one, a Miller single down the ground. Kohli times his introduction of the sixth bowler so well. Drinks. 31st over: South Africa 123-5 (Miller 26, Phehlukwayo 15) Ha, a maiden in the 31st over of an ODI in 2019. Of course, it is Bumrah who delivers it. To Phehlukwayo, who has to deal with a fierce bumper early on, a yorker in response, and the usual series of balls on a good length moving off the seam. He\u2019s very good at cricket. \u201cBit of a problem here, innit?\u201d begins Peter Salmon. \u201cIf South Africa lose this then they are pretty much out of the tournament in less than a week. Means they then have to stick around for another month, playing six dead matches. Hard to see how they can stay motivated. Pride and all that, but I can see it becoming a factor if a couple more teams are doomed from about halfway.\u201d Yep, the the other side of the coin to the argument that India must play nine matches teams should be given a chance to all play each other in the first stage. They aren\u2019t completely eliminated if losing today - it is possible a side could sneak through with five wins, but, yes, a long month it will almost certainly be. 30th over: South Africa 123-5 (Miller 26, Phehlukwayo 15) Jadhav plods through another belt-and-braces over, five again taken from it. Nothing to see there. 29th over: South Africa 118-5 (Miller 23, Phehlukwayo 13) Bumrah\u2019s back to counterbalance the gentler stuff at Jadhav\u2019s end. And first up, sure enough, he\u2019s finding an edge - Miller\u2019s - but it doesn\u2019t go to hand. Things happen when Bumrah is on, Phehlukwayo taking on Kohli with a quick single evidence of that. He\u2019s very lucky that the Indian skipper was off target. But some relief later in the over, Miller pushing an overpitched ball on leg stump down the ground for his first four. 28th over: South Africa 112-5 (Miller 18, Phehlukwayo 12) Kedar Jadhav\u2019s turn to punch out a couple of overs as the sixth bowler while this pair are happy to pick out sweepers and consolidate. It works, his side-armers taken for five. Kohli won\u2019t mind that at all at this stage of the innings. 27th over: South Africa 107-5 (Miller 16, Phehlukwayo 9) Just two further singles from the Kuldeep over, both square of the wicket. Want some wickets? Here are two of them. For some reason, they aren\u2019t all clipped up today on the Sky feeds as they normally are. But I\u2019ll post what I see. 26th over: South Africa 105-5 (Miller 15, Phehlukwayo 8) Good bowling from Chahal, ripping through an accurate 60-second over to keep the pressure on the new pair. Singles to each down the ground but that\u2019s their lot. \u201cYou\u2019ve only gone and done it again!\u201d note Andy Tyacke of the praise I was giving van der Dussen before he fell one ball later. Sigh. \u201cI suggest that you are a closet Saffer! If you aren\u2019t, please don\u2019t ever praise England and feel free to praise our opponents at every opportunity!!!!!!!!\u201d Not at all South African, but I am on the tools for the second dig of England\u2019s next match against Bangladesh on Saturday, so I will try to keep this in mind! 25th over: South Africa 103-5 (Miller 14, Phehlukwayo 7) Another good over from South Africa courtesy of their two assertive middle order players, stroking Kuldeep around to sweepers positioned both square of the wicket and down the ground. More, please. \u201cMr. Collins.\u201d Nishan Venugopal. Hello to you. \u201cBumrah\u2019ss maiden wickets in each of the formats are as follows Tests : AB de Villiers ODIs : Steve Smith T20s : David Warner If you take major tournaments, it goes on as follows IPL : Virat Kohli Champions Trophy : Chris Morris T20 World Cup: Corey Anderson ODI World Cup : Hashim Amla Can you think about any other bowler with such prolific batsmen as their first scalps?\u201d It\u2019s niche, but I\u2019ll pay it. Nicely assembled. He sure is box office, as they say. 24th over: South Africa 98-5 (Miller 11, Phehlukwayo 5) Miller is productive early in the Chahal over, giving the strike to Phehlukwayo, who reaches a reverse sweep second ball, middling it away to the rope. Gutsy cricket given that shot brought the end of van der Dussen off the leggie to start this collapse, but he\u2019s played it well. \u201cThis is his natural game,\u201d notes Graeme Smith on TMS. Singles for each to end the over, nine off it. South Africa\u2019s best so far today. \u201cSpeaking of finding a telly,\u201d begins Adrian Mack. \u201cAny idea on World Cup viewing figures in the UK? Does seem like a huge missed opportunity to get a new audience for the game judging by the half empty (?) ground and the difficulty of finding anything on free to air. I tried recording Eng v Pak on C4 after midnight and got Gogglebox instead.\u201d It\u2019s probably closer to 80 per cent capaity now, but yes, it is a fraction odd given this is India\u2019s first game and I am sure it was a sell out - on paper at least. As for TV, I don\u2019t have those numbers but I am sure somebody out there does? Oh yes, DRS confirms that is very out. Duminy was caught on the crease, Kuldeep\u2019s straighter delivery as lethal as Chahal\u2019s a few overs ago. \u201cIt must be a dark place in the South African dressing room,\u201d Graeme Smith says on TMS. 23rd over: South Africa 89-5 (Miller 7) IS DUMINY LBW TO KULDEEP? I suspect so. The umpire says so. But he\u2019s going upstairs to check. Stand by. 22nd over: South Africa 88-4 (Miller 6, Duminy 3) Both players are looking to score from the get-go, which is the only logical approach with this game slipping away very quickly from the Proteas. Miller picks out the sweeper at midwicket, Duminy gliding behind point then Miller driving to extra cover. All singles at this stage for this new pair, but good fences make good neighbours. 21st over: South Africa 85-4 (Miller 4, Duminy 2) One, two, three, four, five singles from the Kuldeep over from the new pair, showing them his full repertoire. He is reintroduced at the non-Hotel End to partner Chahal. It\u2019s spin from both ends. Two in an over! Chahal is on fire. His faster, straigher ball has beaten du Plessis all ends up. The captain\u2019s battle is over. Just when South Africa looked to be getting somewhere, they\u2019re very much back to square one. 20th over: South Africa 80-4 (Miller 1) van der Dussen went down low for the reverse sweep from the first ball of Chahal\u2019s new over and he has missed the lot. Pitching comfortably outside leg stump, the right-hander was left reaching to make any contact. He didn\u2019t, losing his middle stump. The replay shows how much drift Chahal had on it too. Excellent bowling. 19th over: South Africa 78-2 (du Plessis 38, van der Dussen 22) Three singles from Hardik\u2019s over, this pair starting to look a little bit steadier at the crease. Oh, actually, I better leave that thought and hit send on this post now for I can see the future. 18th over: South Africa 75-2 (du Plessis 37, van der Dussen 20) The leggie Chahal gets his first go from the Hotel End, replacing Kuldeep following his three overs. He\u2019s too full to begin, which allows Faf to drive risk-free through cover for three. Nice shot. He\u2019s on the mark to van der Dussen first up, though, ripping one past his outside edge. To be able to land one of those second up. Sigh. The South African No4 plays the rest defensively and respectfully. What a golden era for wrist spin this era of ODI cricket has turned into. The aforementioned Indian pair, Rashid Khan and Adil Rashid all at the top of the game. Adam Zampa isn\u2019t far behind them as Australia\u2019s No1. 17th over: South Africa 71-2 (du Plessis 34, van der Dussen 19) Hardik goes short to van der Dussen to start after the drinks break, the right-hander responding cleverly to it by lifting over backward point for a couple. Another single off his pads puts Faf back on strike, who takes the one on offer at point. van der Dussen finishes with a couple into the gap behind square. That\u2019s better. Accumulation. 16th over: South Africa 65-2 (du Plessis 33, van der Dussen 15) Kuldeep gets behind du Plessis\u2019 edge early in the over but the captain - who is really toughing it out here - responds with a full-blooded sweep shot that crashes into the boundary. That\u2019s something for him to enjoy while he takes a drink at the end of the over. \u201cA few months ago, when the lovely wristie was operating at the height of his powers against Australia, I sent in this email to you on an OBO,\u201d emails Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cKuldeep Yadav\u2019s bowling average of 20.84 is frankly as ridiculous as Kohli\u2019s batting average of 59.80. We need to take an unbelieving bow for the young man. It\u2019s been one elongated purple patch for the leggie (which means it has translated into something more indicative of his skills), and I think the degree of his success at this World Cup will decide Kuldeep\u2019s position amidst the all-time ODI greats!\u201d \u201cI was getting carried away, at least too soon. The frankly disastrous IPL season has surely brought down his confidence. But with India needing him to be at his best in this tournament, his BMT needs to come to the fore, and one could almost see this as being his tournament.\u201d No complaints from me. I was behind the mic at Dharamsala during his Test debut a couple of years ago and it was the most joyous first spell. He\u2019s a good\u2019un. 15th over: South Africa 56-2 (du Plessis 26, van der Dussen 13) With eight off it, that\u2019s South Africa\u2019s best over of the morning. Granted, the boundary was again off the edge - Faf\u2019s, when he failed to middle a half-tracker from Hardik - but they all count at this point. In better news, van der Dussen looks to be in decent nick. 14th over: South Africa 48-2 (du Plessis 19, van der Dussen 12) A rare boundary, van der Dussen launching into a half-volley, crunching it through cover. Until that point, Kuldeep was well ahead in the over, nearly sorting out du Plessis with his wrong\u2019un, prompting two ineffective sweeps where contact wasn\u2019t made. 13th over: South Africa 43-2 (du Plessis 18, van der Dussen 8) We have a delay when Hardik hits Faf on the middle finger of his bottom hand with a real snorter. That\u2019s the second ball in two overs taking off like that from the all-rounder. du Plessis has a history of finger injuries, breaking one last year when Australia were in town. Of course, he went on to make a Test century afterwards, reinforcing just how tough he is. After some attention from the medical staff, he continues his innings. Back in his stance, the South African captain wafts at the first ball after the stoppage, missing it by a long way. Regrouping, he\u2019s back over the top of the final offering. He won\u2019t throw it away. 12th over: South Africa 40-2 (du Plessis 15, van der Dussen 8) Bumrah is also replaced at the Hotel End, Kuldeep into the attack. Bouncing in, du Plessis enjoys getting off strike first ball behind square, van der Dussen doing likewise as the left-arm spinner finds his range. He\u2019s in the groove by the end of his first over. With so much variation, he can be a difficult bowler to get on top of once set. 11th over: South Africa 37-2 (du Plessis 13, van der Dussen 7) Hardik Pandya replaces Bhuvi after a five over spell that went for 20 runs all up. The Indian all-rounder loves bowling in England, his five-wicket bag at Trent Bridge last year especially memorable. He is a yard slower but no less effective, conceding just three singles. One of those is off the edge of du Plessis, the outside of his bat getting quite the workout this morning. Watching the replay, that really took off. How can South Africa turn this around? Will they take on the spinners? 10th over: South Africa 34-2 (du Plessis 11, van der Dussen 6) 70 per cent of deliveries in the power play were dot balls, the press box scorer announces at the end of another frugal and biting Bumrah over. It\u2019s van der Dussen under the microscope this time, defending from the crease trying to use the pace of the ball to score behind point but only able to achieve that objective once with a push in that general direction. In response, Bumrah puts his back into one that leaps up and smacks him in the chest. Oooooooh, the Indian fans roar. They are loving this. 9th over: South Africa 32-2 (du Plessis 11, van der Dussen 4) Bhuvi\u2019s turn to drop in an utter unplayable, hitting the seam and beating du Plessis with a ball that flies through at shoulder height from just short of a good length. He wasn\u2019t expected to play today, Shami the more likely partner for Bumrah on paper. But he\u2019s been excellent so far in tandem with the Indian top dog. A second over in a row where van der Dussen gets a single from the first ball before du Plessis absorbs the rest. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with access to the Hampshire Bowl?\u201d asks Andrew Benton. \u201cI\u2019m planning to go to one of the games there later this month. Is there any public transport?\u201d There is a free bus from the station on match days, if I recall correctly. But if you are staying here the night before, it\u2019s not fun. Busses exist but they don\u2019t run that often, operated by two companies with tickets that aren\u2019t compatible. My advice, on that basis, would be to just show up on game day and follow the signs. 8th over: South Africa 31-2 (du Plessis 11, van der Dussen 3) Bumrah again. van der Dussen does the smart thing, getting off strike with a push to single first ball. Back to du Plessis, who draws on all his experience to keep out the rest of the over with a straight bat. With Bumrah bowling this well, and this fast, it is all about survival. 7th over: South Africa 30-2 (du Plessis 11, van der Dussen 2) Bhuvi into his fourth over, doing the job at the other end giving du Plessis nothing to work with. That is until the final ball directed on the pads, which Faf clips away with ease. After a sketchy start, some respite at last for the skipper. 6th over: South Africa 26-2 (du Plessis 7, van der Dussen 2) We are watching a magnificent fast bowler at the peak of his powers. I\u2019ve been lucky to witness Bumrah deliver some ridiculous spells over the last three and a half years since his international debut and this is right up there. Find a telly. Kohli pops in a third slip for Bumrah and it works a treat! Wondrous fast bowling from Bumrah, who tempts de Kock into driving from his crease. In keeping with the theme of the morning so far, the edge was found and this time carried, Kohli doing the rest at the position he had moved himself a few balls earlier. Brilliant. 5th over: South Africa 22-1 (de Kock 9, du Plessis 6) Bhuvi into it first ball of his new over, de Kock misjudging a ball on his pads, a leading edge spitting over the slips and running away for four. A lucky lad. Giving the strike to his captain with a single, du Plessis is also using the skinny part of his blade, an inside edge this time running away behind square, for two. Then an outside edge! Just short of second slip. India are all over them here. 4th over: South Africa 15-1 (de Kock 4, du Plessis 4) Faf nearly bowled first ball! Bumrah goes full to begin at the South African captain, winning an inside edge that is so close to the leg stump. Instead, he opens his account with a four first ball. This is already quite the spell, du Plessis\u2019 outside edge then found later in the over, landing just short of the two waiting slips. What a way for Bumrah to begin his World Cup career. \u201cIndia and the BCCI have threatened to put a dampener on this competition in so many ways (The lack of day/nights, their weekend games opposed to the lack of England\u2019s) \u2013 but it is great they are finally here,\u201d says Neil Harris. \u201cThe World Cup can now come alive, with South Africa turning them over!\u201d Famous last words. Gorgeous! Bumrah, backing up his perfect set to de Kock, gets a delivery to deck away from Amla, collecting the outside edge on the way to second slip with Rohit making no mistake. What a bowler this man is. The best in the business. 3rd over: South Africa 10-0 (Amla 6, de Kock 4) Shot. Amla leans into a square drive first ball of the new Bhuvi over, stroking past point to the rope for the first boundary of the day. The South African openers exchange singles to third man later in the over, Amla then watching the rest pass him by. No issues from this end. 2nd over: South Africa 4-0 (Amla 1, de Kock 3) OOOOHHH!! Run out chance missed by Dhoni from three metres! de Kock raced back for a second run down to fine leg but was struggling, Dhoni collecting the throw and taking a ping but just missing. When these teams played in the Champions Trophy quarter final in 2017, South Africa batted first and suffered three runs out. Chill out, fellas! Meanwhile, Bumrah is bowling absolutely beautifully. His first ball nearly yorks de Kock at pace then later in the set he beats him twice with two absolute beauties. \u201cThe best over of the World Cup,\u201d declares Michael Vaughan on the wireless. Outstanding. Nice piece here on Kapil\u2019s World Cup 175, an innings that truly did change the course of history for the Indian men\u2019s cricket team. 1st over: South Africa 2-0 (Amla 1, de Kock 1) A conservative start, reflecting the fact that Bhuvi is immediately landing them straight into a shoebox just short of a length. Amla deflected a single to third man first up, de Kock pushing a quickish single to mid-off. It\u2019s a public holiday in India today, Prakash Wakankar says on TMS, so the television audience will be gigantic for this game. A brief pause for anthems here at Hampshire Bowl. Which looks... um, half full? That\u2019s not at all what I was expecting. Admittedly, this is a dreadful place to access for spectators. I\u2019ve never quite worked out why administrators are so keen on using it for international cricket. Hopefully, the spare seats for the first ball has nothing to do with ticketing or people waiting in queues outside. THE PLAYERS ARE ON THE FIELD! I know because the Loryn BANGER is playing on the PA. They\u2019ve really nailed it with this World Cup anthem. Amla and de Kock are in the middle, the former taking guard at our Shane Warne Hotel end. Master new baller Bhuvi is opening up from the far end, running towards us. PLAY! \u201cNice to have India join us,\u201d emails Peter Salmon, opening the batting on the email for the day. \u201cI note they are already ahead of South Africa on the table, with a much better net run rate. They must have been tempted to sit this one out and keep their advantage.\u201d There are lot of theories circulating about how India managed to avoid entering the tournament until now. But as Tim noted on his lovely preamble, better late than never. It\u2019s a tasty first outing too, able to just about end South Africa\u2019s campaign in the space of a week. Not mathematically, but you know what I mean. Did everyone see Kagiso Rabada\u2019s pop at Kohli a couple of days ago, saying that the Indian captain is \u201cimmature\u201d on the field? A touch cheeky given his own form, but I liked it. When asked about it yesterday, the bearded supremo was very happy to leave it through to the \u2018keeper. As the great Harsha Bhogle noted, this is nothing he hasn\u2019t heard before. Still, it will be a contest to look out for later today. Right, those teams. South Africa lost Ngidi through injury; Shamsi is in for him - makes sense. Markram, though, who played at Hampshire and made a stack of runs, has lost his spot to Amla, who is back after copping a ball to the head via Jofra. Both played in that tournament opener. It will mean that Faf stays at three. For India, Shami is the unlucky man with the number two seed taking Bhuvi and Bumrah as their two specialist quicks, Hardik the seaming all-rounder also there. Wrist spinners Chahal and Kuldeep edge out Jadeja as the frontline slow bowlers, Jadhav in there too for a few of his sidearm specials. They\u2019re such a strong team. South Africa: Quinton de Kock (+), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis (c), Rassie van der Dussen, David Miller, Jean-Paul Duminy, Andile Phehlukwayo, Chris Morris, Kagiso Rabada, Imran Tahir, Tabraiz Shamsi India: Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli (c), Lokesh Rahul, MS Dhoni (+), Kedar Jadhav, Hardik Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Jasprit Bumrah A bit to take out of these, I\u2019ll gather my thoughts. Thanks to Tim de Lisle for the build up, by the way. You\u2019ll hear from him again during the second innings. Teams shortly. PS - Hello! When you write an OBO, you often forget the game straight away \u2013 it\u2019s an intense process, you\u2019re in the moment for three and a half hours, and then the moment has passed. It\u2019s like sitting an exam in your favourite subject. But Monday\u2019s thriller between England and Pakistan has stayed with me for a full 36 hours. There\u2019s one question nagging away: how did the world\u2019s greatest chasers, playing at home, on their favourite ground, against a team out of form, manage to lose? As in any good thriller, there are several suspects. 1 England\u2019s fielding Poor old Jason Roy\u2019s drop is threatening to become as famous as Ben Stokes\u2019s catch, but it was costly (Hafeez added another 70 off, from memory, 51 balls). And England\u2019s ground fielding was shoddy. \u201cIt cost us 15 or 20 runs,\u201d said Eoin Morgan, himself one of the offenders. They lost by 14. 2 Extras England conceded 20, Pakistan only eight. Bung in a few overthrows and, again, you have the difference between the sides. 3 Fast bowlers England\u2019s were faster, but Pakistan\u2019s were more incisive. Jofra Archer (who actually bowled well) ended up with 0-79, and Chris Woakes only took wickets at the death. The first scalp for an England seamer came in the 33rd over. Mark Wood was excellent (2-53), but Ben Stokes didn\u2019t come to this party (0-43) and Liam Plunkett was badly missed. Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz took five wickets between them, and they struck at vital moments. 4 Leg spinners England\u2019s main wicket-taker in one-day cricket is Adil Rashid, partly because Morgan so obviously trusts him. Not on Monday: Rashid\u2019s first five overs went for 43, and his second five never came. Shadab Khan, by contrast, opened the bowling, removed Jason Roy, and returned to deceive Joe Root with his quicker ball. 5 The hundred When Joe Root reached three figures, he was the first man to do so in this World Cup. But there is such a thing as a match-losing century (just ask Pakistan, who made a few of them in May). Root, superb as he was in many ways, struggled to lift his strike rate above a run a ball, and he ended up with 107 off 104. The overall asking rate was seven an over, so if he went at six, his partners had to go at eight. The great Jos Buttler managed it, with 103 off 76 \u2013 he and Root, house-mates last winter in Sydney, are beautifully matched. Chris Woakes managed it, briefly. But nobody else could do it, and Morgan and Stokes ate up 36 balls between them while making only 22 runs. Compare and contrast with Sarfaraz Ahmed (55 off 44 balls) and Pakistan\u2019s last five batsmen (46 off 30). Conclusion: it\u2019s a funny old game. And a complicated one. Now over to Adam Collins \u2013 see you after lunch. Quiz question. What does Virat Kohli have in common with the Queen? Answer: probably quite a few things, but the most relevant one is that the Queen arrives at a party last. Today, as South Africa embark on their third match of this World Cup, India play their first. According to sources close to the OBO readership (thank you Abhijato Sensarma), it\u2019s because their board insists on a break after the IPL. And, I might add, because the ICC doesn\u2019t always twig that the point of a governing body is to make sure the rich and powerful are treated the same as everyone else. The ethics may be dubious, the optics off-putting, but the aesthetics could be the better for it. The Indians are walking straight into the middle of a drama. The South Africans are tottering already after losing to England and Bangladesh, both times after winning the toss. To add injury to insult, they have now lost the great Dale Steyn too. They stand second-bottom in the table, fractionally above Afghanistan. They are even behind India, because their net run rate is -1.25 whereas India, being yet to take the field, are on 0. (Of the four subcontinental nations, by the way, Bangladesh are top, being well ahead of Sri Lanka and Pakistan on net run rate. Savour the moment.) So South Africa come to the party as the cornered tigers. That phrase comes from the 1992 World Cup, the only other one to have the same format as 2019 \u2013 all play all, no groups. There were nine teams then and Imran\u2019s tigers got out of their corner with just four wins (and a no-result). Faf du Plessis, as impressive as Imran in his demeanour, reckons that this time it will take six wins out of nine. So, if they lose today, every game becomes a knock-out. For India, things are far more relaxed. They did lose their last three one-day internationals \u2013 all at home, against a resurgent Australia \u2013 but that was before the IPL, so it will feel like years ago. The question for Kohli and co. is whether they can hit the ground running, as West Indies and New Zealand have (both on net run rates above 5, three times as good as anyone else\u2019s). We\u2019re in Southampton, where the pitch is usually very sporting. Play starts at 10.30am BST.",

      "body": "<p>In 2019, if women want to earn big bucks, fashion and beauty is the way to do it. Forbes has released its fifth annual list of the US\u2019s richest <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/self-made-women\" title=\"\">so-called \u201c</a><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/self-made-women\" title=\"\">self-</a><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/self-made-women\" title=\"\">made </a><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/self-made-women\" title=\"\">women\u201d</a>. Of the 80 women on it, 10 are from the makeup and skincare industries. Those who have reached millionaire and billionaire status through their own beauty brands and fashion lines include Kylie Jenner, Anastasia Soare of Anastasia Beverly Hills, the Gap co-founder Doris Fisher, Forever 21\u2019s Jin Sook Chang and the creator of Spanx, Sara Blakely.</p> <p>Rihanna, bolstered by her Fenty Beauty brand, has become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/05/rihanna-named-worlds-richest-female-musician\" title=\"\">the world\u2019s richest musician</a> \u2013 despite not having released any music since 2016. Fenty Beauty, which she launched in 2017 with the luxury goods group LVMH, generated an estimated $570 million in revenue last year.</p> <p>I am conflicted about the list. I literally yelped with excitement at the announcement that Fenty would be stocked in Boots. But I also believe that a society that focuses on women\u2019s appearance is inherently sexist. I don\u2019t believe that more millionaires existing in the world is something to celebrate \u2013 but I would be lying if I said I am not pleased that the Forbes list has expanded to 80 women, a third more than a year ago.</p> <p>There is also some relief in knowing that women are beginning to dominate the beauty and fashion industries \u2013 two behemoths that have created and capitalised on women\u2019s insecurities for years. The positive changes introduced by Fenty in terms of addressing the cosmetics industry\u2019s lack of diversity \u2013 40 shades of foundation that cover the full spectrum of women\u2019s skintones, for example \u2013 was informed by Rihanna\u2019s identity as a black woman.</p> <p>There is something to be said about women making money from industries that have sold ideals to them, like the humble Avon lady. I\u2019d certainly stop short of describing it as \u201ctaking back control\u201d, but the venom aimed at Instagram influencers is partly down to the fact that so many women have been able to monetise an ideal of the lives they are supposed to have.</p> <p>Influencers are one of the few industries with a <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/worklife/careers/a9603348/social-media-women-earn-more-than-men/\" title=\"\">reverse pay</a><a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/worklife/careers/a9603348/social-media-women-earn-more-than-men/\" title=\"\"> gap</a> \u2013 a woman with 100,000 followers can reportedly make nearly \u00a310,000 more than a man from two sponsored posts. By capitalising on this, women such as Huda Kattan, Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian have all been able to find success within the beauty industry. </p> <p>It is perhaps also of note that many of the 80 women included in this year\u2019s list started their companies with their husbands, but the majority of makeup moguls have been able to go it alone. In an ideal world, it would not necessarily be deemed a positive to be motivated by money, but in this one, money still equals power.</p>",

Forbes has released its fifth annual list of the US\u2019s richest so-called \u201cself-made women\u201d. Of the 80 women on it, 10 are from the makeup and skincare industries. Those who have reached millionaire and billionaire status through their own beauty brands and fashion lines include Kylie Jenner, Anastasia Soare of Anastasia Beverly Hills, the Gap co-founder Doris Fisher, Forever 21\u2019s Jin Sook Chang and the creator of Spanx, Sara Blakely. Rihanna, bolstered by her Fenty Beauty brand, has become the world\u2019s richest musician \u2013 despite not having released any music since 2016. Fenty Beauty, which she launched in 2017 with the luxury goods group LVMH, generated an estimated $570 million in revenue last year. I am conflicted about the list. I literally yelped with excitement at the announcement that Fenty would be stocked in Boots. But I also believe that a society that focuses on women\u2019s appearance is inherently sexist. I don\u2019t believe that more millionaires existing in the world is something to celebrate \u2013 but I would be lying if I said I am not pleased that the Forbes list has expanded to 80 women, a third more than a year ago. There is also some relief in knowing that women are beginning to dominate the beauty and fashion industries \u2013 two behemoths that have created and capitalised on women\u2019s insecurities for years. The positive changes introduced by Fenty in terms of addressing the cosmetics industry\u2019s lack of diversity \u2013 40 shades of foundation that cover the full spectrum of women\u2019s skintones, for example \u2013 was informed by Rihanna\u2019s identity as a black woman. There is something to be said about women making money from industries that have sold ideals to them, like the humble Avon lady. I\u2019d certainly stop short of describing it as \u201ctaking back control\u201d, but the venom aimed at Instagram influencers is partly down to the fact that so many women have been able to monetise an ideal of the lives they are supposed to have. Influencers are one of the few industries with a reverse pay gap \u2013 a woman with 100,000 followers can reportedly make nearly \u00a310,000 more than a man from two sponsored posts. By capitalising on this, women such as Huda Kattan, Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian have all been able to find success within the beauty industry. It is perhaps also of note that many of the 80 women included in this year\u2019s list started their companies with their husbands, but the majority of makeup moguls have been able to go it alone. In an ideal world, it would not necessarily be deemed a positive to be motivated by money, but in this one, money still equals power.",

It is true that his books comprised oral testimonies of soldiers who served in 20th-century conflicts, from the world wars to the Spanish civil war, the Falklands and Northern Ireland. But as Max often pointed out, there were no commanders or generals in them, and nothing of military strategy or tactics.</p> <p>His fascination was with how ordinary people behave under extreme stress: how they overcome the most horrible conditions, fear and injury, and risk their lives for their brothers-in-arms. His books \u2013 of which the best known are Forgotten Voices of the Great War (2002) and Forgotten Voices of the Second World War (2004) \u2013 are about \u201cthe inside of men and the springs of their courage\u201d, as one observer, The Rev David Cooper, padre to 2 Para during the Falklands, put it. That is what gave them their universal appeal.</p> <p>Max, who has died aged 80, did not have a background in academia \u2013 something more traditional historians often disparaged.

This pilot recognises the scale of the problem and strives to address it head on.\u201d Sally Brooks, the headteacher at Fulham college boys\u2019 school, which is involved in the pilot, said its impact on students would be immeasurable. \u201cProviding the boys with a nutritious meal will not only allow them to compete in an academic environment, but will also give them the nutrition needed to go above and beyond what is required of them at school and actively participate in extra-curricular activities.\u201d The council\u2019s leader, Steve Cowan, said food poverty was a national crisis,. \u201cThis initiative is a step forward in the fight to end this blight on our children and their future wellbeing.\u201d Cowan said he hoped other councils would follow suit. The Department for Education has announced that about 50,000 disadvantaged children in England will be offered free meals and activities over the summer holidays at a cost of \u00a39.1m. The scheme follows a \u00a32m programme last year that reached 18,000 children.",

A source with knowledge of the process said the plant would shut down.</p> <p>The British car industry is facing a series of difficulties including a steep <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/04/sales-new-cars-fall-uk-consumers-continue-shun-diesel-brexit\">fall in demand for diesel vehicles</a> and falling sales in China, previously a key growth market. At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/30/uk-car-production-plunges-amid-untold-damage-of-brexit-chaos\">Brexit uncertainty</a> has cast a pall over the industry, with the threat of tariffs on cars and parts travelling to and from the UK.</p> <p>Ford is the latest in a string of international carmakers to seek to drastically reduce its UK operations this year. In February, Honda announced it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/18/workers-blame-brexit-for-demise-of-hondas-swindon-plant\">planned to shut its Swindon plant</a> in 2021 with the loss of 3,500 jobs, while fellow Japanese carmaker Nissan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/03/nissan-confirms-new-x-trail-will-not-be-built-in-sunderland\">reversed a decision to build its new X-Trail vehicle</a> at its Sunderland plant.</p> <p>Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India\u2019s Tata Motors, is also cutting thousands of jobs. JLR, which runs the largest British carmaking operation, has come under pressure from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/20/jaguar-land-rover-record-loss-chinese-market-diesel-sales\">slump in sales in China</a>.</p> <p>Ford\u2019s planned closure of Bridgend, which was first reported by ITV News, comes amid steep cost-cutting at the US carmaker. In January, Ford announced widespread job losses across its European operations, saying it would consider closing plants. Last month, it announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/20/ford-motor-company-cut-7000-jobs-500-uk\">plans to cut about 7,000 jobs worldwide</a>, or 10% of its global salaried workforce, including about 550 in the UK.</p> <p>The overhaul across Europe, which included shutting down loss-making vehicle lines, has already resulted in the combination of the headquarters of Ford UK and Ford Credit to a site in Dunton, Essex, in an attempt to cut costs.</p> <p>Ford runs three factories in the UK, including a diesel engine plant in Dagenham, east London, and a plant making transmissions in Halewood, on the outskirts of Liverpool.</p> <p>A Ford spokesman refused to comment on the closure plan, saying it was \u201cspeculation\u201d.</p> <p>The Bridgend plant has manufactured engines since 1980.

      "bodyText": "Ford is planning to close its Bridgend engine plant, with the likely loss of about 1,700 jobs, in the latest blow to the embattled British car industry. The company is meeting workers\u2019 representatives at the south Wales plant on Thursday. A source with knowledge of the process said the plant would shut down. The British car industry is facing a series of difficulties including a steep fall in demand for diesel vehicles and falling sales in China, previously a key growth market. At the same time, Brexit uncertainty has cast a pall over the industry, with the threat of tariffs on cars and parts travelling to and from the UK. Ford is the latest in a string of international carmakers to seek to drastically reduce its UK operations this year. In February, Honda announced it planned to shut its Swindon plant in 2021 with the loss of 3,500 jobs, while fellow Japanese carmaker Nissan reversed a decision to build its new X-Trail vehicle at its Sunderland plant. Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India\u2019s Tata Motors, is also cutting thousands of jobs. JLR, which runs the largest British carmaking operation, has come under pressure from a slump in sales in China. Ford\u2019s planned closure of Bridgend, which was first reported by ITV News, comes amid steep cost-cutting at the US carmaker. In January, Ford announced widespread job losses across its European operations, saying it would consider closing plants. Last month, it announced plans to cut about 7,000 jobs worldwide, or 10% of its global salaried workforce, including about 550 in the UK. The overhaul across Europe, which included shutting down loss-making vehicle lines, has already resulted in the combination of the headquarters of Ford UK and Ford Credit to a site in Dunton, Essex, in an attempt to cut costs. Ford runs three factories in the UK, including a diesel engine plant in Dagenham, east London, and a plant making transmissions in Halewood, on the outskirts of Liverpool. A Ford spokesman refused to comment on the closure plan, saying it was \u201cspeculation\u201d. The Bridgend plant has manufactured engines since 1980. However, the plant, which sends petrol engines to Ford factories across Europe, was thought to be particularly at risk because a contract to manufacture engines for JLR will end this year. The company has also been outspoken about the risks to the sector posed by Brexit. Ford\u2019s European president, Steven Armstrong, warned that \u201cnothing would be off the table\u201d if the UK left the EU without a trade deal. Union representatives were told earlier this year that the company planned to cut 1,000 jobs in the UK over two years, including more than half the workforce in Bridgend. A spokesman for Unite, which represents many of the workers in Bridgend, said: \u201cUnite will be meeting Ford first thing tomorrow morning and will comment further once the details of any announcement are known. Our priority is our members\u2019 jobs, the communities and livelihoods in the supply chain that Ford Bridgend supports.\u201d Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said the government must meet Ford urgently to secure the plant\u2019s future. \u201cThis is worrying news, first and foremost for Ford employees and their families who are left unsure as to their futures, but also for the jobs across the supply chain and the impact on the local economy in Bridgend,\u201d she said. \u201cHot on the heels of Honda this would be another devastating blow to our car industry and to the UK\u2019s wider manufacturing base.\u201d Bethan Sayed, a Plaid Cymru member of the Welsh assembly, said there was \u201cno disguising or minimising the damage a closure will do\u201d. She said: \u201cThe Bridgend plant is a hallmark of the Welsh industrial landscape and a flagship anchor company with a highly skilled and specialised workforce.\u201d A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the government would not comment on speculation.",

      "bodyText": "It was cold, remote and involved picking fights with woolly mammoths \u2013 but it seems ancient Siberia 30,000 years ago was home to a hardy and previously unknown group of humans. Scientists say the discovery could help solve longstanding mysteries about the ancestors of native North Americans. While it is commonly believed the ancestors of native North Americans arrived from Eurasia via a now submerged land bridge called Beringia, exactly which groups crossed and gave rise to native North American populations has been difficult to unpick. Now scientists say they might have found some answers to the conundrums. Writing in the journal Nature, Eske Willerslev and colleagues reveal how they drew on existing data from modern populations as well as analysing ancient DNA from the remains of 34 individuals obtained from sites around north-eastern Siberia, dating from more than 31,000 years ago up to 600 years ago. The key remains were fragments of two tiny human milk teeth, shed by males, found at a place in Russia called Yana Rhinoceros Horn Site. First excavated in 2001, the site offers the earliest direct evidence of humans in north-eastern Siberia, with finds also including bone items and stone tools. Indirect evidence of human populations in north-eastern Siberia goes back to more than 40,000 years ago. While it had previously been thought that these remains might be from the ancestors of native North Americans, the DNA data suggests otherwise. \u201cWhat we see here is a much more complex story than what we believed was the case,\u201d said Willerslev, director of the Lundbeck Foundation Centre for Geogenetics at the University of Copenhagen. The results reveal these individuals were part of a previously unknown yet widespread group, dubbed the Ancient North Siberians by the team, who were genetically distinct from both Western Eurasians and East Asians. The researchers say they split off from the former 38,000 years ago \u2013 in other words, very shortly after Western Eurasians and East Asians themselves became genetically distinct. \u201cThey were living as big game hunters of woolly mammoth and woolly rhinoceros,\u201d said Willerslev. But, crucially, this population does not appear to be the direct ancestor of Native Americans. Instead, analysis of the collection of genomes suggests the population that became the ancestors of native North Americans was the result of liaisons about 20,000 years ago between East Asians, who travelled north, and a group distantly related to the Ancient Northern Siberians. The East Asians also mixed with other descendants of Ancient Northern Siberians to give rise to another group, who the team dub the Ancient Paleo Siberians, who went on to supplant the existing group. \u201c[Ancestors of] Native Americans are not the first people in north-eastern Siberia as most people, if not everybody thought,\u201d said Willerslev, adding that DNA recovered in north-eastern Siberia from what is believed to be an Ancient Paleo Siberian was crucial to the work. \u201cThis is the first evidence we have, real evidence, of something very close genetically to Native Americans,\u201d he said. The team add that one possibility is that the mixing involving the East Asians occurred in southern Beringia \u2013 one of the areas that could have offered respite from harshening conditions at the time. They Ancient Paleo Siberians were themselves supplanted by another band of East Asians heading north about 10,000 years ago that gave rise to a group dubbed the \u201cNeo-Siberians\u201d. \u201cThe vast majority of the genetic makeup of present day Siberians comes from this last push,\u201d said Willerslev. \u201cThis is also the reason you don\u2019t have any very close connection between contemporary Siberians and Native Americans.\u201d John Hoffecker from the University of Colorado Boulder, who was not involved in the study, welcomed the research, saying a striking feature of the study is that humans were faring well in north-eastern Siberia, even in very difficult conditions, 30,000 years ago \u2013 with the genetic data from the teeth suggesting the males belonged to a population of about 500 people. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty healthy population,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had no idea 30 years ago that we had this robust healthy hunter-gatherer population thriving up in the high Arctic 30,000 years ago \u2013 it is amazing.\u201d Hoffecker added the presence of the group suggests it was the ice sheets in North America, not hostile conditions in Beringia, that kept people from reaching the Americas sooner.",

At the contested post-Blatter 2016 election, Infantino famously swung the room when he told the countries: \u201cThe money of Fifa is your money.\u201d He ran that line again here. \u201cFifa\u2019s money is your money,\u201d he said. \u201cYour money, for the development of football.\u201d Several times they were told how much they have had under the \u201cForward\u201d development programme and how much more they can look forward to: $1.079bn since its launch in 2016, a further \u00a31.7bn to 2022. Taking his turn with the same figures, Fifa\u2019s finance committee chairman, Alejandro Dom\u00ednguez, told the hall: \u201cI dare say we should have a round of applause here for the president.\u201d Which they duly had. Fifa is adamant this mega-money, $6m to each association over four years, is building targeted, concrete football projects, many in poorer countries, and is not pork-barrel politics for local officials who could pocket it. Fifa\u2019s administrators say they have robust checks, release money only according to specified \u201cmilestones\u201d on projects, and conduct central audits. They point to the six-year, six-month ban handed down by Fifa\u2019s ethics committee in March to former Oceania president David Chung for \u201coffering and accepting gifts\u201d and the eight-year ban of the same confederation\u2019s former general secretary Tai Nicholas for misappropriating funds in relation to a Forward-funded HQ programme, the Home of Football in New Zealand. \u201cWe\u2019re not spending it on dodgy deals,\u201d Infantino said, \u201cwe\u2019re investing it with you and checking [the projects are] done.\u201d Infantino has pounded on unscathed from his administration\u2019s removal in 2017 of the ethics committee chairmen who had mounted preliminary investigations into him and the ousting of the governance committee chairman Miguel Maduro, who maintains pained concerns about Fifa\u2019s workings. Over days of Fifa business in Paris there was not a whisper about that landmark early brutality and delegates were invited to approve Infantino for another term by \u201cacclamation\u201d rather than through the farce of a one-man actual election which the football world lampooned in 2011. This meant, it was explained, that Infantino would be duly elected for the job, which had a $2.5m salary package last year, by a round of applause. Thumping home the scale of Infantino\u2019s ascendancy the vice-president with the job of explaining that was Sheikh Salman, his beaten rival of 2016. The applause came as a ripple rather than a wave and Infantino returned for a victory speech. He said he was humbled, then repeated many of his achievements, including the $2.75bn Fifa has in its reserves. The congress, overall, was notably calm, compliant and pleased with itself, a testament above all to football\u2019s phenomenal power and currency in an uncertain and volatile world.",

The doctors\u2019 committee is the medical arm of the Sudanese Professionals Association, which has been leading the opposition to military rule. There have been repeated reports from witnesses and activists that dead and injured protesters were thrown into the river after Monday\u2019s attack on the camp, which has been the focus of pro-democracy demonstrations for months.Few details, however, have emerged. A doctor at a hospital in Khartoum who had been providing medical care at a makeshift camp clinic told the Guardian he saw the RSF throwing 10 bodies off the Blue Nile bridge at about 4am during the attack. Residents and acitivists retrieved nine bodies from the Nile on Wednesday. Images passed to the Guardian by opposition organisations showed several corpses with concrete blocks tied to their feet. The RSF is largely made up of militia accused of systematic human rights abuses during the war in Darfur. The force is led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, who also serves as the deputy head of the Transitional Military Council (TMC), which has been in power since Bashir was ousted.

However, he insisted it was in their best interests.</p> \n<p>In a video filmed in his offices in Oxford and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-jlRsbbF0k&amp;feature=youtu.be\">posted on YouTube</a>, Woodford said: \u201cAs difficult a decision as this is, and clearly frustrating for you, our investors, we felt this was necessary to protect your interests.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a34ab7fd-7b6c-4631-aeaf-bc0eebcb4675\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/neil-woodford\">Neil Woodford</a>&nbsp;was once the UK\u2019s biggest star fund manager, personally managing a \u00a325bn mountain of money on behalf of pension funds and other investors at Invesco Perpetual. When he decided to quit Invesco and go it alone in 2013 it was a huge shock for the fund management industry. Invesco shares slumped by 7% on the day he announced his departure.</p>\n    <p>At Invesco Woodford held control of huge stakes in some of the UK\u2019s biggest firms, and his opinions mattered. His criticism of AstraZeneca chief executive David Brennan in the 2012 shareholder spring was widely regarded to have cost him his job, and his critique of BAE\u2019s attempted \u00a328bn merger with Airbus is acknowledged as one of the reasons the deal collapsed.</p>\n    <p>Woodford, who was widely referred to in the media as an investment \u201chero\u201d and fund management \u201cstar\u201d, had done exceedingly well over his quarter century there. A \u00a31,000 investment placed when he started at the firm in 1988 would have risen to \u00a323,000 by the time he left.</p>\n    <p>Woodford accidentally fell into fund management and hadn\u2019t heard of the term until he rocked up in the City in the 1980s sleeping on his brother\u2019s floor while looking for a job. He got his first break in insurance, before drifting into fund management. He had left school wanting to fly fighter jets but couldn\u2019t pass the RAF\u2019s aptitude test, and instead read economics and agricultural economics at the University of Exeter.</p>\n    <p>Feeling he had outgrown Invesco Perpetual, he set up his own firm Woodford Investment Management in 2014, on an industrial estate near Oxford. Within two weeks of launching, he had raised \u00a31.6bn, a UK record, and it quickly grew to \u00a316bn. In its first full year his flagship fund returned 16% and Woodford, a devotee of veteran US investor Warren Buffett, was dubbed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-27/oracle-of-oxford-sees-red-as-stock-picking-powers-misfire\">\u201cOracle of Oxford\u201d</a>.</p>\n    <p>Asked if he ever doubted his judgment, Woodford once said: \u201cDaily. You must never, as a fund manager, stick your head in the sand saying \u2018everybody go away, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right\u2019. You\u2019ve always got to expose yourself to criticism and the analysis that you may be wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p>Woodford went on to say that the secret of successful fund management was a balance of arrogance and humility. \u201cYou have to have a sufficiently strong arrogant gene to back your judgment, back your conviction. If you didn\u2019t, you would end up with a portfolio that looks very much like the index. But, equally, you must have the humility to accept that you will get things wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rupertneate\"><b>Rupert Neate</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m extremely sorry that we\u2019ve had to take this decision.

The decision to freeze the fund was taken after a rush of customer withdrawals following a series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/04/neil-woodfords-most-disastrous-stock-choices-a-roundup\">bad market bets</a>.</p> \n<p>Investment group Hargreaves Lansdown, whose clients last year accounted for more than 30% of Woodford\u2019s now blocked fund, said on Wednesday it would waive its fee for affected clients as long as the fund was suspended.</p> \n<p>Emma Wall, head of investment analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cWe have been in communication with Woodford Investment Management to explain why we think this is the right thing to do and have put pressure on them to do the same.\u201d</p> \n<p>Woodford investors are believed to be still liable for fees of up to 1.7% despite the suspension.</p> \n<p>Andrew Bailey, chief executive of City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority, defended Woodford\u2019s decision to suspend the fund.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe alternative would have been much more disorderly,\u201d Bailey told Bloomberg TV in his first comments since the gates were closed on investors on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>He assured the FCA would be watching Woodford closely as he starts to sell-off his stakes in privately held companies, which are more difficult to turn into cash.

      "bodyText": "One of Neil Woodford\u2019s biggest City backers dropped the fund manager on Wednesday, hours after he apologised to investors on YouTube for suspending trading in his largest fund. Wealth manager St James\u2019s Place, announced it had terminated the stock picker\u2019s contract to manage three of its funds \u2013 worth a total of \u00a33.5bn. That mandate, which Woodford has held since launching his own firm five years ago, has now been handed to rivals Columbia Threadneedle Asset Management and RWC Partners. It is the latest blow for the UK\u2019s most renowned fund manager, who said on Wednesday morning he was \u201cextremely sorry\u201d for taking the decision to block investors from pulling cash from his flagship \u00a33.7bn Equity Income Fund. However, he insisted it was in their best interests. In a video filmed in his offices in Oxford and posted on YouTube, Woodford said: \u201cAs difficult a decision as this is, and clearly frustrating for you, our investors, we felt this was necessary to protect your interests. \u201cI\u2019m extremely sorry that we\u2019ve had to take this decision. We understand our investors\u2019 frustration. All I can say in response to that is that this decision was motivated by your interests.\u201d Woodford said he would keep investors informed and the fund would be reopened when \u201cappropriate\u201d, but did not comment on when that might be. The fund will be suspended for at least four weeks, during which time investors cannot pull money out or put money in. The decision to freeze the fund was taken after a rush of customer withdrawals following a series of bad market bets. Investment group Hargreaves Lansdown, whose clients last year accounted for more than 30% of Woodford\u2019s now blocked fund, said on Wednesday it would waive its fee for affected clients as long as the fund was suspended. Emma Wall, head of investment analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cWe have been in communication with Woodford Investment Management to explain why we think this is the right thing to do and have put pressure on them to do the same.\u201d Woodford investors are believed to be still liable for fees of up to 1.7% despite the suspension. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority, defended Woodford\u2019s decision to suspend the fund. \u201cThe alternative would have been much more disorderly,\u201d Bailey told Bloomberg TV in his first comments since the gates were closed on investors on Wednesday. He assured the FCA would be watching Woodford closely as he starts to sell-off his stakes in privately held companies, which are more difficult to turn into cash. Bailey said it was important for funds like Woodford\u2019s to invest in unlisted firms. \u201cThere is always a balance here, we have to have an economy in which there\u2019s investment in illiquid assets. And then it\u2019s a question of how we do it to preserve the integrity of markets.\u201d Bailey cautioned that large funds need to be monitored. \u201cTen years ago we were dealing with the problem of banks that were too big to fail, of course we don\u2019t want funds that are too big to fail.\u201d However the FCA said it was weighing a potential investigation into Woodford, linked to the listing of some of the fund\u2019s private company investments in Guernsey. It was meant to help get around rules that limit the proportion of unlisted investments at 10%, while the total size of his flagship fund continued to shrink. \u201cWhere the FCA believes there are circumstances suggesting serious misconduct or non-compliance with the rules it may open an investigation.\u201d A request by Kent county council\u2019s pension fund to withdraw its \u00a3263m investment is thought to have prompted Woodford to take the decision to suspend the fund. Addressing investors, Woodford said in the video that putting a temporary halt to withdrawals would afford the fund the \u201ctime and space\u201d needed to reduce exposure to illiquid stocks and private companies. He said the capital would be redeployed into \u201cmore liquid stocks in the FTSE 350 but primarily in the FTSE 100 that fit in with my core strategy, but which are more liquid and more conventional, if you like\u201d. Comments posted underneath the video were mixed. Ian Jenkins wrote: \u201cCaught out by his own hubris. Overreached himself.\u201d Meanwhile, Philip Fox wrote: \u201cYou tried to instigate a terrible takeover of Provident Financial. Of which I own shares to the benefit of you and a few others.

Not bad, cheers Neil,\u201d wrote one supporter under the handle \u201cHam head\u201d. Keith Marsh wrote: \u201cIf anyone can turn this around, it is that man. Investors, relax and let him do what he does and has consistently done best.\u201d Assets in the Woodford Equity Income Fund fell by \u00a3560m in May to \u00a33.7bn, according to data compiled by Morningstar, a financial research company. Woodford built his reputation over 26 years at Invesco Perpetual, where he personally managed \u00a325bn on behalf of pension funds and other investors. He left Invesco in 2013 to set up on his own. Woodford paid himself and his business partner, Craig Newman, nearly \u00a337m in the 2017-18 financial year.

Prayuth Chan-ocha, who has been PM for the past five years after a military coup in 2014, will lead a coalition government. He was voted back in on Wednesday by the newly formed democratic parliament. Prayuth\u2019s confirmation as prime minister came after more than 12 hours of deliberations by MPs. He was not present for the debate or the late-night vote. Phalang Pracharat, the political party that operates as a proxy for the military, had earlier cobbled together a ruling coalition that has a slim parliamentary majority, with 254 seats in the 500-seat lower house. Wednesday\u2019s developments confirmed what many had feared, that an election supposed to signal Thailand\u2019s return to democracy would lead to a continuation of military rule. Prayuth\u2019 previous term was defined by the jailing of critics, a ban on protests and political activity and the suppression of free speech and free media. Most had expected the military coalition deal, in which the medium-sized Democrat and Bhumjaithai parties and 16 small entities agreed to unite with Phalang Pracharat, but it has taken weeks of backroom negotiations to secure, suggesting an uneasy and unwieldy alliance. The Democrat party, Thailand\u2019s oldest and most traditional party, had been particularly resistant to joining the coalition, because senior party figures feared the long-term consequences of aligning themselves with the military. Running against Prayuth for prime minister was Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, the head of the progressive Future Forward party. He was put forward by the Democratic Front alliance of seven parties, including Future Forward and the pro-democracy party Pheu Thai. The alliance will form a united opposition.

      "body": "<p>Emily Thornberry had committed the cardinal sin. It had been bad enough that she had completely outshone her leader every time she had deputised for him at prime minister\u2019s questions. But then she had compounded her crime by going freelance after the EU elections and rewriting Labour\u2019s policy on a second referendum.</p> <p>So exile it was. Not that the shadow foreign secretary was going to take being airbrushed out of history lightly. On Tuesday night, the Labour leader\u2019s office had insisted her axing from PMQs was due to her attending the D-day commemorations, but Thornberry was quick out of the blocks to point out she was not invited to Portsmouth and would be going to the ones in Normandy the day after instead.</p> <p>To underline the point, she took her seat halfway down the opposition frontbench for Wednesday\u2019s PMQs, her face and body language the model of disloyal loyalty. Or loyal disloyalty. Take your pick. A combination that Thornberry has managed to perfect over years of training. And one that will have done her leadership ambitions no harm at all among many Labour MPs and members.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/05/trump-visit-d-day-tory-leadership-pmqs-claims-london-crowds-were-supporting-him-ahead-of-d-day-commemoration-live-news\">Trump compares Brexit hard border fears to Mexico wall plan as he arrives in Ireland - live news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In her place was the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, a woman not noted for being that quick on her feet. Or off them, for that matter. OK, she would definitely be better than Jeremy Corbyn because you\u2019d need to be technically brain-dead not to be. But not that much better. A safe pair of hands. Someone who could be relied on to put in a solid, if uninspired performance and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 to stay on message. To stick to any script. However bad.</p> <p>Long-Bailey warmed up with an easy swipe at Theresa May\u2019s failure to contradict Donald Trump\u2019s assertion that the NHS would be up for grabs in any future trade deal between the US and the UK. Over the past two years, it has often felt that PMQs has been an exercise in pointlessness, with one party leader who doesn\u2019t know how to ask the right questions and another who can\u2019t answer them. But now we have hit peak futility. A flat-lining, absentee prime minister and a government whose only commitment is to do nothing until after the Tory leadership election is over. And after, if possible.</p> <p>All of which suited David Lidington, May\u2019s de facto deputy, just fine. Now he didn\u2019t even have to worry about getting things wrong, as there were no policies he could possibly contradict. He could literally make it up as he went along. For a brief moment, he knew what it meant to be inside Trump\u2019s mind. If Trump and mind weren\u2019t some kind of oxymoron.</p> <p>Lidington began by making fun of Thornberry\u2019s relegation. She affected to be outraged, but couldn\u2019t totally disguise her pleasure. If there\u2019s one thing worse than being talked about, it\u2019s not being talked about and at least her absence had been noted. And anything to embarrass Corbyn. It\u2019s not just May\u2019s job that is under threat.</p> <p>That done, Lidington started to play Just a Minute, where he could say any old bollocks provided there was no deviation, hesitation or repetition. People had badly misjudged Trump. The president had been totally preoccupied by D for Donald day and hadn\u2019t really understood that the National Health Service had anything to do with health. So when he said he wanted the NHS to be on the table for any future trade deals what he meant was the precise opposite. And in any case, even if the NHS was on the table, any future Tory leader would take it back off unless they chose to leave it on.</p> <p>Long-Bailey appeared doubtful but let it go and moved on to climate change. How could the Tories claim to be taking the emergency seriously when several of the leadership contenders had expressed doubts about the science and the government had lied about meeting its own targets? Lidington was outraged. What was this obsession with the truth? Surely Long-Bailey hadn\u2019t come in to politics expecting honesty? And in any case Labour were planning to reopen the coal mines.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not Labour policy to reopen coal mines,\u201d Long-Bailey declared firmly. Dennis Skinner and several other Labour MPs looked horrified. As did several old hands on the opposition frontbench. Hadn\u2019t she understood that the whole point of Corbyn\u2019s \u201chonest and straightforward\u201d politics was that it should be neither honest nor straightforward. The idea was to be as ambiguous as possible. The shadow business secretary had committed the same schoolgirl error as Thornberry and would now join her in the gulags.</p> <p>Angela Rayner\u2019s eyes lit up. Her time would come. And much sooner than she had imagined.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Emily Thornberry had committed the cardinal sin. It had been bad enough that she had completely outshone her leader every time she had deputised for him at prime minister\u2019s questions. But then she had compounded her crime by going freelance after the EU elections and rewriting Labour\u2019s policy on a second referendum. So exile it was. Not that the shadow foreign secretary was going to take being airbrushed out of history lightly. On Tuesday night, the Labour leader\u2019s office had insisted her axing from PMQs was due to her attending the D-day commemorations, but Thornberry was quick out of the blocks to point out she was not invited to Portsmouth and would be going to the ones in Normandy the day after instead. To underline the point, she took her seat halfway down the opposition frontbench for Wednesday\u2019s PMQs, her face and body language the model of disloyal loyalty. Or loyal disloyalty. Take your pick. A combination that Thornberry has managed to perfect over years of training. And one that will have done her leadership ambitions no harm at all among many Labour MPs and members. In her place was the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, a woman not noted for being that quick on her feet. Or off them, for that matter. OK, she would definitely be better than Jeremy Corbyn because you\u2019d need to be technically brain-dead not to be. But not that much better. A safe pair of hands. Someone who could be relied on to put in a solid, if uninspired performance and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 to stay on message. To stick to any script. However bad. Long-Bailey warmed up with an easy swipe at Theresa May\u2019s failure to contradict Donald Trump\u2019s assertion that the NHS would be up for grabs in any future trade deal between the US and the UK. Over the past two years, it has often felt that PMQs has been an exercise in pointlessness, with one party leader who doesn\u2019t know how to ask the right questions and another who can\u2019t answer them. But now we have hit peak futility. A flat-lining, absentee prime minister and a government whose only commitment is to do nothing until after the Tory leadership election is over. And after, if possible. All of which suited David Lidington, May\u2019s de facto deputy, just fine. Now he didn\u2019t even have to worry about getting things wrong, as there were no policies he could possibly contradict. He could literally make it up as he went along. For a brief moment, he knew what it meant to be inside Trump\u2019s mind. If Trump and mind weren\u2019t some kind of oxymoron. Lidington began by making fun of Thornberry\u2019s relegation. She affected to be outraged, but couldn\u2019t totally disguise her pleasure. If there\u2019s one thing worse than being talked about, it\u2019s not being talked about and at least her absence had been noted. And anything to embarrass Corbyn. It\u2019s not just May\u2019s job that is under threat. That done, Lidington started to play Just a Minute, where he could say any old bollocks provided there was no deviation, hesitation or repetition. People had badly misjudged Trump. The president had been totally preoccupied by D for Donald day and hadn\u2019t really understood that the National Health Service had anything to do with health. So when he said he wanted the NHS to be on the table for any future trade deals what he meant was the precise opposite. And in any case, even if the NHS was on the table, any future Tory leader would take it back off unless they chose to leave it on. Long-Bailey appeared doubtful but let it go and moved on to climate change. How could the Tories claim to be taking the emergency seriously when several of the leadership contenders had expressed doubts about the science and the government had lied about meeting its own targets? Lidington was outraged. What was this obsession with the truth? Surely Long-Bailey hadn\u2019t come in to politics expecting honesty? And in any case Labour were planning to reopen the coal mines. \u201cIt is not Labour policy to reopen coal mines,\u201d Long-Bailey declared firmly. Dennis Skinner and several other Labour MPs looked horrified. As did several old hands on the opposition frontbench. Hadn\u2019t she understood that the whole point of Corbyn\u2019s \u201chonest and straightforward\u201d politics was that it should be neither honest nor straightforward. The idea was to be as ambiguous as possible. The shadow business secretary had committed the same schoolgirl error as Thornberry and would now join her in the gulags. Angela Rayner\u2019s eyes lit up. Her time would come. And much sooner than she had imagined.",

The court heard on Wednesday that Hussain will not appear in court to defend himself in the London trial. The case, one of the biggest fraud trials in British history, has shone a spotlight on the increasingly troubled relationship between Lynch and Whitman, one of the most prominent American businesswomen. The influential former eBay chief executive previously ran as the Republican candidate for governor in California, and has a net worth of $3.7bn, according to Forbes.

The company specialised in using complex pattern recognition techniques to help organisations search and sort through unstructured information such as emails and phone records. It became a darling of the British tech scene, and Lynch was made a government science advisor and awarded an OBE. However, in a witness statement entered in court on Wednesday, Whitman described Lynch as unsuitable for an executive role in a large company.

Despite nobody involved, least of all its host \u2013 erstwhile Football Weekly stand-in Rob Curling \u2013 appearing to have any idea what on earth was going on in its Sphere, Palindrome, Star or About Turn games, the show ran for 239 episodes across eight series and all involved seemed to have a very nice time. More recently, in their own attempt to put an end to the kind of meaningless friendlies that have long been the scourge of international football, Uefa introduced its own similarly complicated competition and called it the Nations League. Since its inception last year, England have played four games and advanced to this week\u2019s finals and now stand on the brink of winning their first trophy since 1966 without, one suspects, many of their fans and possibly even players having even the foggiest idea why or how.</p> <p>Not that any of that matters as we approach the business end of the competition, as things couldn\u2019t really be simpler. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2019/jun/05/nations-league-players-watch-england-portugal-switzerland-netherlands\">It\u2019s semi-final time</a> with Switzerland taking on Portugal in Porto on Wednesday, before England face the Netherlands in Guimaraes on Thursday, before Sunday\u2019s final and third-place play-off. Flying off to Portugal, having welcomed the England internationals who contested last weekend\u2019s Big Cup final back into the group, Gareth Southgate will address the press there later on, which means that by the time people read this he\u2019ll have already answered questions such as \u201cAny knocks?\u201d, \u201cWill Harry Kane start?\u201d and \u201cWere he, Dele and Eric upset when Jordan, Trent and Joe wore their winner\u2019s medals down to breakfast?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2019/jun/05/nations-league-players-watch-england-portugal-switzerland-netherlands\">Nations League: four exciting young players to watch in Portugal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Worryingly, in their absence, Marcus Rashford has been holding the fort and said there is unlikely to be any sour grapes between the two sets of players. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you play for Tottenham or Liverpool or whoever,\u201d said the striker who clearly wasn\u2019t involved in Madrid. \u201cWhile we\u2019re here that doesn\u2019t matter at all. We\u2019ll battle for each other. That\u2019s what\u2019s special about this group, because that transition to international football seems to be very smooth. [Gareth Southgate] always says to us: \u2018When you\u2019re in camp we want you to enjoy yourself.\u2019 He wants it as close as it can be to how it is at a club.\u201d Unless that club happens to be the one Rashford plays for, one hopes, where at least half the first-team squad are surplus to requirements. \u201cBasically it\u2019s like your club, where you\u2019d fight for the person next to you,\u201d Rashford added, without laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s the exact same thing here.\u201d With that in mind, England fans are advised that Sunday\u2019s third-place play-off kicks off in Guimaraes at 2pm BST.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Barry Glendenning from 7.45pm BST for hot MBM coverage of Portugal 2-1 Switzerland</a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201c[He] was our biggest international football leader of all time, no Swede has had a similar influence on football in the world.

      "bodyText": "THAT\u2019S NATIONSWANG! Fiver readers of a certain age and nationality will remember Turnabout, a daytime BBC TV quiz show that was as ludicrously complicated as it was utterly compelling. Despite nobody involved, least of all its host \u2013 erstwhile Football Weekly stand-in Rob Curling \u2013 appearing to have any idea what on earth was going on in its Sphere, Palindrome, Star or About Turn games, the show ran for 239 episodes across eight series and all involved seemed to have a very nice time. More recently, in their own attempt to put an end to the kind of meaningless friendlies that have long been the scourge of international football, Uefa introduced its own similarly complicated competition and called it the Nations League. Since its inception last year, England have played four games and advanced to this week\u2019s finals and now stand on the brink of winning their first trophy since 1966 without, one suspects, many of their fans and possibly even players having even the foggiest idea why or how. Not that any of that matters as we approach the business end of the competition, as things couldn\u2019t really be simpler. It\u2019s semi-final time with Switzerland taking on Portugal in Porto on Wednesday, before England face the Netherlands in Guimaraes on Thursday, before Sunday\u2019s final and third-place play-off. Flying off to Portugal, having welcomed the England internationals who contested last weekend\u2019s Big Cup final back into the group, Gareth Southgate will address the press there later on, which means that by the time people read this he\u2019ll have already answered questions such as \u201cAny knocks?\u201d, \u201cWill Harry Kane start?\u201d and \u201cWere he, Dele and Eric upset when Jordan, Trent and Joe wore their winner\u2019s medals down to breakfast?\u201d Worryingly, in their absence, Marcus Rashford has been holding the fort and said there is unlikely to be any sour grapes between the two sets of players. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you play for Tottenham or Liverpool or whoever,\u201d said the striker who clearly wasn\u2019t involved in Madrid. \u201cWhile we\u2019re here that doesn\u2019t matter at all. We\u2019ll battle for each other. That\u2019s what\u2019s special about this group, because that transition to international football seems to be very smooth. [Gareth Southgate] always says to us: \u2018When you\u2019re in camp we want you to enjoy yourself.\u2019 He wants it as close as it can be to how it is at a club.\u201d Unless that club happens to be the one Rashford plays for, one hopes, where at least half the first-team squad are surplus to requirements. \u201cBasically it\u2019s like your club, where you\u2019d fight for the person next to you,\u201d Rashford added, without laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s the exact same thing here.\u201d With that in mind, England fans are advised that Sunday\u2019s third-place play-off kicks off in Guimaraes at 2pm BST. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Barry Glendenning from 7.45pm BST for hot MBM coverage of Portugal 2-1 Switzerland. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201c[He] was our biggest international football leader of all time, no Swede has had a similar influence on football in the world. He was deeply respected as Uefa president and vice-president of Fifa, his leadership has aroused admiration worldwide\u201d \u2013 the Swedish FA\u2019s Karl-Erik Nilsson pays tribute to Lennart Johansson, who has died aged 89. FIVER LETTERS \u201cNot to worry. USA! USA!! USA!!! reader Chris Fuller\u2019s \u2018argument\u2019 regarding your perceived tea-timely politic bias (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) lost all credibility before he\u2019d even started. Anyone who opens by describing The Fiver as \u2018often humorous\u2019 is clearly talking nonsense\u201d \u2013 Steve Bennett (and 1,056 others). \u201cAs a California-born, USA! USA!! USA!!! citizen who has long been a fan of The Fiver and its typically clever letter writers, I have to express scorn and take umbrage at Chris\u2019s clumsy and buffoonish attempt to defend his vote for our disgrace of a president. Yes Chris, it\u2019s your right to vote. It\u2019s also your obligation to take criticism for enabling a corrupt and predatory charlatan to ascend to the most powerful position in the world. And frankly, Fiver, I\u2019d respectfully request you not publish idiotic letters from my compatriots. I read The Fiver for a daily dose of the beautiful game and the culture of its supporters across the pond. I get enough of dumb Americans every day\u201d \u2013 Todd Condor (and others). \u201cThanks to Chris for providing a rare bit of humour in The Fiver\u201d \u2013 Kim Lightbody.

Merseyside-based dance duo Daniel Sturridge and Alberto Moreno are yours to hire for free after being released by Liverpool. Raheem Sterling is set to captain England against the Netherlands. Juventus have asked Manchester United if they would rather have loads more cash for the Glazers to take out of the club instead of Paul Pogba in their midfield.

Surrey had lost the remainder of their first-innings wickets cheaply in the morning, the Overton twins finishing with eight between them. <strong>Somerset</strong> then subsided to 153 all out with only 64 from James Hildreth sparing their blushes. Matt Dunn pocketed five for 43.</p> <p><strong>Nottinghamshire</strong> suffered a batting apocalypse at Edgbaston in the Division One wooden spoon game. After <strong>Warwickshire</strong> had eventually declared on 391 for nine with a century for Adam Hose, Notts were ravaged by Jeetan Patel\u2019s six for 16 and were all out for 97. They fared better following on, closing on 116 for one.</p> <p><strong>Essex</strong> avoided the follow-on at Headingley thanks to some blistering boundaries from Peter Siddle in his 39 not out under glowering skies. They had been cruising mid-afternoon against <strong>Yorkshire</strong> after 77 from Tom Westley and smart runs by Ravi Bopara but lost three for one before tea.</p> <p>Nerves were jangling around Lord\u2019s as <strong>Middlesex</strong> came within an hour of saving the game.<strong> Sussex</strong> started the day needing six wickets but met unexpected resistance. Nick Gubbins fell in the morning session but James Harris (80) and John Simpson (76) batted through until tea, gritty runs in the face of Ollie Robinson with a bracelet of slips. But Sussex were not to be denied and with their coach, Jason Gillespie, on the field as substitute fielder, they took the last wicket with 12.4 overs to spare. Robinson finished with seven for 98.</p> <p><strong>Glamorgan</strong> soared to the top of Division Two thanks to outstanding bowling from Michael Hogan and Marchant de Lange, beating <strong>Northamptonshire</strong> by an innings and 143 runs. It was their second win of the season and their first win by an innings since 2014.</p> <p>At Aigburth the chill wind did not detract from an intriguing day when<strong> Lancashire</strong> ascendancy switched to <strong>Leicestershire</strong> obstinacy and back again. Leicestershire were in deep trouble at 82 for five at lunch, but Mark Cosgrove and the debutant Harry Swindells inched them forward in a partnership of 50. Dieter Klein and Callum Parkinson were in touching distance of avoiding the follow-on when Richard Gleeson had one of his inspired spells, removing Klein 13 short of what would have been a debut first-class century and Leicester 12 short of the target. Leicestershire had to survive four overs of their second innings from Graham Onions and Gleeson but nightwatchman-opener Chris Wright confidently left a ball from Onions and was bowled for a duck.</p> <p>At Chester-le-Street, <strong>Derbyshire</strong> got to within shirt-tugging distance of <strong>Durha</strong>m thanks to 79 not out from Matt Critchley. Ravi Rampaul then tore through Durham\u2019s batting with three for 39. Alex Lee flew the flag with 63 not out.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-05T23:16:12.901Z\">at 12.16am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5cf7e9be8f0897a4e19f93fa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-05T16:14:49.267Z\">5.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Where's your killer instinct Sussex?

      "bodyText": "Was Peter Diddlebury making a point? Let's see when he gets the ball. Eventually out for 60, Essex 81 behind on first-innings, a fine fightback. Finbar Anslow who you might remember wrote in with the lyrics to his song Taunton Town, has sent the YouTube Link. Somerset fans, I think you\u2019ll rather like it. https://youtu.be/QFpDVcBYzq8 I\u2019m at Aigburth, where the sun is out and the players are pottering onto the pitch. Two quick question apropos of nothing : 1 why are balloons banned at Liverpool Lime St? 2 Has any transport minister ever spent a few hours at Manchester Victoria ? The smell of diesel trains is eye -wateringly unpleasant. A fluctuating day at Guildford ended with Surrey on 99 for two, needing another 168 to beat Somerset. Surrey had lost the remainder of their first-innings wickets cheaply in the morning, the Overton twins finishing with eight between them. Somerset then subsided to 153 all out with only 64 from James Hildreth sparing their blushes. Matt Dunn pocketed five for 43. Nottinghamshire suffered a batting apocalypse at Edgbaston in the Division One wooden spoon game. After Warwickshire had eventually declared on 391 for nine with a century for Adam Hose, Notts were ravaged by Jeetan Patel\u2019s six for 16 and were all out for 97. They fared better following on, closing on 116 for one. Essex avoided the follow-on at Headingley thanks to some blistering boundaries from Peter Siddle in his 39 not out under glowering skies. They had been cruising mid-afternoon against Yorkshire after 77 from Tom Westley and smart runs by Ravi Bopara but lost three for one before tea. Nerves were jangling around Lord\u2019s as Middlesex came within an hour of saving the game. Sussex started the day needing six wickets but met unexpected resistance. Nick Gubbins fell in the morning session but James Harris (80) and John Simpson (76) batted through until tea, gritty runs in the face of Ollie Robinson with a bracelet of slips. But Sussex were not to be denied and with their coach, Jason Gillespie, on the field as substitute fielder, they took the last wicket with 12.4 overs to spare. Robinson finished with seven for 98. Glamorgan soared to the top of Division Two thanks to outstanding bowling from Michael Hogan and Marchant de Lange, beating Northamptonshire by an innings and 143 runs. It was their second win of the season and their first win by an innings since 2014. At Aigburth the chill wind did not detract from an intriguing day when Lancashire ascendancy switched to Leicestershire obstinacy and back again. Leicestershire were in deep trouble at 82 for five at lunch, but Mark Cosgrove and the debutant Harry Swindells inched them forward in a partnership of 50. Dieter Klein and Callum Parkinson were in touching distance of avoiding the follow-on when Richard Gleeson had one of his inspired spells, removing Klein 13 short of what would have been a debut first-class century and Leicester 12 short of the target. Leicestershire had to survive four overs of their second innings from Graham Onions and Gleeson but nightwatchman-opener Chris Wright confidently left a ball from Onions and was bowled for a duck. At Chester-le-Street, Derbyshire got to within shirt-tugging distance of Durham thanks to 79 not out from Matt Critchley. Ravi Rampaul then tore through Durham\u2019s batting with three for 39. Alex Lee flew the flag with 63 not out. Where's your killer instinct Sussex? See Glamorgan and weep. I better write up though this is going to be the most exciting session of all. Ps Notts still haven't lost a wicket. Well, well, Stoneman bowled Brooks for 12. Surrey need 259 to win at Guildford. If you're in the area, pop by, should be a cracker. What an innings this is by James Harris at Lord\u2019s_65 not out. And BTW Roland_Jones was Robinson s fifth wicket., It\u2019s all getting a bit twitchy all round. SEVEN Down at Lord\u2019s. Leicester defences starting to grate on Lanes fielders. Still, new ball soon. NOTTS ALL OUT 97. They didn\u2019t look this bad at Trent Bridge in April. They\u2019re not this bad. Also apologies if punctuation haywire, I've had to resort to emergency tablet. Notts creep, gasping, towards three figures. And a wicket at Lord's! Harris for 80. Somerset_when I wasn\u2019t looking have thrown their dice in the air and come up with 153 for nine. You\u2019re supposed to be winning the Championship, you can t do this. You probably know this, but Kohli is out. INDIA 94 for two off 22. Apologies technical problems have got in the way of these scores_but Notts are in trouble and Middlesex seem safe. At tea Middlesex are holding on. Remarkable. Partnership of 103 between James Harris and John Simpson. Can Sussex find five wickets amongst the jam tarts? Can Notts be out in a session and a sneeze? 87 for EIGHT It\u2019s all happening at Guildford and Edgbaston. A third for Morkel and Somerset are down to their tail - 119 for six. Notts 79 for seven, Moores goes cheaply again. After last year\u2019s run-glut, things have grown a little parched. Keaton Jennings, Mr Neat and Tidy, cajoles his body into a swallow dive to catch Swindells at short leg off Liam Livingstone. Leicestershire 150 for seven at just over the half-way point in the day. Michael Hogan 4-32 but, Billy Root - this one\u2019s for you. That Notts-up? It\u2019s on. 75-6 on the slowest, most benign pitch of the round. Patel 2-1, Norwell 2-6. Glamorgan can taste the sweet tang of victory, just one wickets needed now as Marnus Labuschagne gets in on the act. Rob Jones removes his trousers as the fielders all swap places. Harry Swindells, on debut, looking slimly unperturbed, 26 not out. Leicester 132-5. Make that 132-6, Cosgrove out for 70, which is Leicestershire\u2019s joint highest first-class score this season, Onions bringing the ball back into him. The umpire waited, five, six, seven seconds before sending him on his way. Against all predictions, James Harris and John Simpson look as if they could hang on at Lord\u2019s. Michael Jones has gone early in Durham\u2019s second innings - Ravi Rampaul of course. 20-1. Notts and Essex lose a post-prandial third - Nash for 25 and the aforementioned Westley for 77. While Northants are on the brink - 180-7, still 158 behind - Hogan and de Lange the incisors. Hildreth 33 not out at Guildford, as Somerset recover. Nash and Clark rebuild at Edgbaston after the wicket of Ben Duckett - 65 for two. Tom Westley 77 not out at Headingley - could he be the first player to reach three figures in this match? Balls flying about in a state of uncontrolled undress here at Aigburth. Gleeson causing trouble from the River End. India have been set 228 to win by South Africa. Trickier than it looked at one stage, but should be a breeze. Maybe there is time for a podcast in your life? Maybe it is this one? Hosted by Emma John, who has a fab new book out on Bluegrass music, it takes a merry look at the World Cup and all things cricket. It turns out that if you lie down flat on the grass at the Mersey end and tuck your socks into your trousers whilst using a natural windbreak of fallen chairs, the sun warms your legs. Don\u2019t mention this to anyone in real life. Meanwhile Cosgrove thunders through to his fifty and Bavuma falls at The County Ground. Six more Glamorgan, six more. Division One Somerset 344 and 50-3 (Morkel 2-12) v Surrey 231 (Patel 63; Coverton 5-38, Joverton 3-46) Somerset lead by 163 Warwickshire 391-9dec (Hose 111) v Nottinghamshire 18-1. Notts trail by 373 with 9 wickets standing Yorkshire 390 v Essex 115-2 (Westley 68 not out) Essex trail by 275 with 9 wickets standing Division Two Durham 293 v Derbyshire 268 (Critchley 79 not out) Lancashire 449 v Leicestershire 82-5 Day four: Middlesex 138 &amp; 135-5 (Robinson 4-47) v Sussex 481-9 dec(after day three) Middlesex need another 209 to avoid innings defeat Day four: Northamptonshire 209 &amp; 142-3 v Glamorgan 547 Northants need another 197 to avoid innings defeat And at the unwrapping of lunch, Harry Dearden edges to Jennings at first slip. Leicestershire lose their fifth wicket for 86 and the groundsmen invade the pitch with wheelbarrow and rake. Lunchtime scores to follow. Well batted Northants and Middlesex - losing just three and one wickets in the morning session. If they keep going at that rate, they\u2019ll be safe - just... I wonder, is that the faint whiff of the start of a Notts-up blowing up the west coast? Another wicket at Guildford. South Africa are doing a Warwickshire - 123 for five off 30. The matches are coming thick and fast now - follow the dynamic double act of Nick Miller and Simon Burnton for Bangladesh v New Zealand here: A wicket at Guildford.... but it is Abell, Morkelled for 9. Somerset 21/1. David Wiese spoils the scorecard but breaks the impasse, Middlesex lose a fifth - Gubbins lbw for 33. 122 for five and still 200 behind, though they have now avoided falling to their worst defeat since the second world war. Essex quietly plugging away at Headingley - Fifty for Tom Westley and 34 for Nick Browne - 91 for one. Today\u2019s the day. At last. Warwickshire have put everyone out of their misery and declared - 391 for 9, Adam Hose a hidden century. Not even Notts version 2019 can be out twice in less than two days on this pitch. No they can\u2019t. Watching Mark Cosgrove bat, the years roll away and Greg Ritchie appears on the horizon with his gleaming white teeth. Short of leg, jolly of stomach, Cosgrove holds the bat as if it was a toy and is remarkably keen on getting down on one knee for an industrial unit. Oh, and as always, when I was looking the other way, Ackermann goes for the drive and is caught. He is reluctant to leave, but has little choice, he\u2019s been sent on his way. He\u2019d already had a life after being dropped by Liam Livingstone at slip. Leics 61 for four. Surreyt 231 all out. COverton 5-38, Joverton 3-46, a deficit of 113. It\u2019s suddenly easier to bat at Lord\u2019s - Nick Gubbins and James Harris in a partnership of fifty. Remember today is the last day of this match and Glamorgan v Northants. Loving the train in the background here. I think, adjusts anorak, it\u2019s the Guilford via Cobham line. Matthew Critchley leading Derby towards Durham\u2019s hinterland. 59 not out, 225 for 7, they trail by 68. A third catch for Tom Cullen at the County Ground, Northants 93/3 -245 behind. I\u2019ve just eaten my fourth Danish pasty in three days. In my defence it is freezing even in a mother-in-law knit, woolly hat and manager\u2019s coat. Oh no! Ben Curran felled - at least he made fifty, Northants 89 for two, 249 behind Glamorgan. Surrey collapsing! Joverton 5-38, Surrey 223-9, though Patel still there on 55. I hope no-one took annual leave for the snooze-fest at Edgbaston. It\u2019s the morning of day 3 and Warwicks are still batting....350 for 8. Oh my, Leicestershire. Paul Horton caught and bowled by a ridiculously athletic Bailey . Leicestershire 17 for three and this could be over today. A straight-forward catch to Keaton Jennings at first slip, after Neil Dexter pushes forward slightly overbalanced to another fine ball from Tom Bailey. Leicester 16 for 2. Also, a little mention for Ratcliffe CC. A few years ago I went along for a piece on West Indians in the Lancashire league. Off I trotted, bringing the kids as it was the holidays. Some lovely folk in the bar showed me around, sold us some cheap squash and then played with the kids on the pitch. It was a faded glory, targeted by vandals, but you could sense its once-majesty in the photos on the wall and the crumbling stands. It used to be standing room only for cup games. They deserve a new mower. And a third for Craig Overton at Guildford as Surrey\u2019s impenetrable skin wears fingernail thin. Jacks caught by old slow hands at slip for 13. Surrey 201 for six. A huge appeal by Lancashire against Paul Horton! Ten seconds worth of tongue-warbling. Nowt says the ump - Bailey walks back to his mark. A wicket! Onions through the gloom gets Azad onto the back foot. No stroke and that my son is out I\u2019m afraid. Leicestershire 13 for one. Graham Onions, green soles on his shoes, chugging in from the Pavilion End, a short one, which flies past the outside edge of Horton\u2019s bat. The next one is fiercer, passing the outside edge. I don\u2019t fancy Leicester\u2019s chances here. I see South Africa are having a shocker, 26 for two from six overs with Bumrah inspired. Division One Somerset 344 v Surrey 188-5 Surrey trail by 156 with 5 wickets remaining Warwickshire 311-7 v Nottinghamshire Yorkshire 390 v Essex 18-1 Essex trail by 372 with 9 wickets standing Division Two Durham 293 v Derbyshire 181-6 Lancashire 449 v Leicestershire Middlesex 138 &amp; 61-4 v Sussex 481-9 dec (after day three) Middlesex need another 282 to avoid innings defeat Northamptonshire 209 &amp; 68-0 v Glamorgan 547 (after day three) Northants need another 270 to avoid innings defeat There\u2019s something very heartwarming about following a trail of old boys with anoraks and thermal picnic bags from Aigburth station and watching them embrace their buddies outside the cricket ground. What news will they tell? Good morning from a remarkably dry Aigburth. In front of me the Leicestershire players are doing \u2018pogos\u2019 at the request of their physio, while Glenn Chapple throws slip catches. Hats are firmly on. There will be 104 overs today to try and catch up. Looking round the grounds, it\u2019s woolly weather this morning but the forecast is better than yesterday. Lord\u2019s and Guildford look particularly intriguing. In other news, huge congratulations to Stephen Fay and David Kynaston who have won the Telegraph Sports Book of the year with Arlott, Swanton and the Soul of English Cricket, after being pipped to the post by Geoff Lemon in the Wisden and MCC Awards. It\u2019s a lovely read, I recommend it. And of course, India\u2019s World Cup gets under way today, at Hampshire against wobbly South Africa. South Africa really must win it to have a chance of a semi-final spot - an unenviable position. Adam Collins and Tim de Lisle will be your fabulous guides here:",

For obvious reasons that may well be so. The surviving soldiers who fought their way up the beaches of Normandy are in their 90s now, so it seems poignantly unlikely that more than a handful will return in 2024.</p> <p>But there is a more political reason why this week could be the start of a less unified approach to marking the liberation of Europe at the end of the war against Hitler\u2019s Germany. The reason is that Donald Trump\u2019s US and Brexit Britain, though both still immeasurably and justifiably proud of the roles their predecessors played in this epic climax of the war in the west, are each in their own way turning their backs upon the European order that the invasion of 6 June 1944 made possible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/03/d-day-75th-anniversary-interviews\">'I count myself lucky': D-day remembered on the 75th anniversary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The uneasy relationship between Wednesday\u2019s major <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/05/d-day-veterans-and-world-leaders-arrive-in-portsmouth-to-vast-security\" title=\"\">commemorations at Portsmouth</a> and those that will take place on Thursday in France illustrates Britain\u2019s change of stance. In recent decades, Normandy has overwhelmingly been the main place to commemorate D-day. But now here is Britain mounting a large parallel event. Fair enough, in one sense. Britain was the base from which the war in the west was won. It is easier for the 90-year-olds to get to Portsmouth than France. But it is also as though Britain is choosing to reassert a closed-off version of its own national wartime myth alongside \u2013 and even in opposition to \u2013 the previously more established international one.</p> <p>This marks another stage in both the systemic impact of Brexit and, at the same time, the older, slow decline in the potency of Britain\u2019s own postwar myths \u2013 a process that itself had much to do with the Brexit vote. Postwar British politics was rooted in two competing but also mutually dependent myths that arose directly out of events like D-day. One was a Conservative version of Britishness, which celebrated indomitable exceptionalism, military prowess and long-enduring \u2013 especially English \u2013 traditions of governance and culture. The other was a Labour version, centred on national unity, shared sacrifice and reward, and an exceptionalism that is more British than English. These traditions overlapped at times. Both included a strong sense of British uniqueness, and each has spent much of the past 75 years seeking ways to recreate their respective idealisations of this imagined past.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ee92f93babd3827dae1f844006baa0a8bbad4c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ee92f93babd3827dae1f844006baa0a8bbad4c2/0_298_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Britain is choosing to reassert a closed-off version of its own national wartime myth.\u2019 Macron, May, Prince Charles, the Queen and the Trumps watch a flyover during D-day commemorations.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Britain is choosing to reassert a closed-off version of its own national wartime myth.\u2019 Macron, May, Prince Charles, the Queen and the Trumps watch a flyover during D-day commemorations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They remain powerful visions: today, Brexit and Corbynism are respective reflections of their enduring allure to many. But, as time has passed, the claim to national greatness has become more remote from the interconnections of the modern world and from people\u2019s life experiences. Politically, both myths have been challenged by internal \u201cmodernising\u201d movements. But they have also been challenged by movements and parties that speak to different post-Churchill and post-Attlee visions of Britain \u2013 among them pro-Europeans, environmentalists and an array of identitarians.</p> <p>These evolving fractures ensure that the solemn events this week cannot just be commemorative business as usual. Instead they mark a change. They embody the chronic uncertainty of the times. They cast an unavoidably unforgiving light on the way that the electorates of both the US and Britain have each taken deeply disruptive decisions that threaten the international order of which their governments still imagine themselves to be mainstays.</p> <p>In one sense this is merely another phase in on ongoing process. As the decades have passed, the weight which these wartime anniversaries have been called upon to bear has always evolved. In the early postwar period, the D-day commemorations in Normandy served a predominantly Gallic narrative as postwar France sought a way to rebuild. By 1964, when <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/eisenhower-recalls-sacrifices-of-d-day-20-years-later/\" title=\"\">Dwight Eisenhower returned to Normandy</a> for the first time since he had commanded the invasion of France to speak movingly about D-day and world peace, a more cold war and US-led narrative predominated. In 1994, in the first post-cold war commemoration, Bill Clinton launched a heroic new myth about the global benevolence of US power, which George W Bush (in spite of Iraq) and <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/06/06/remarks-president-obama-70th-anniversary-d-day-omaha-beach-normandy\" title=\"\">Barack Obama echoed in 2004 and 2014</a>.</p> <p>Now, though, we have reached a sharp turn in the narrative.

      "bodyText": "They are saying that Thursday \u2013 the 75th anniversary \u2013 will be the last of the international D-day commemorations in which the veterans of 1944 participate. For obvious reasons that may well be so. The surviving soldiers who fought their way up the beaches of Normandy are in their 90s now, so it seems poignantly unlikely that more than a handful will return in 2024. But there is a more political reason why this week could be the start of a less unified approach to marking the liberation of Europe at the end of the war against Hitler\u2019s Germany. The reason is that Donald Trump\u2019s US and Brexit Britain, though both still immeasurably and justifiably proud of the roles their predecessors played in this epic climax of the war in the west, are each in their own way turning their backs upon the European order that the invasion of 6 June 1944 made possible. The uneasy relationship between Wednesday\u2019s major commemorations at Portsmouth and those that will take place on Thursday in France illustrates Britain\u2019s change of stance. In recent decades, Normandy has overwhelmingly been the main place to commemorate D-day. But now here is Britain mounting a large parallel event. Fair enough, in one sense. Britain was the base from which the war in the west was won. It is easier for the 90-year-olds to get to Portsmouth than France. But it is also as though Britain is choosing to reassert a closed-off version of its own national wartime myth alongside \u2013 and even in opposition to \u2013 the previously more established international one. This marks another stage in both the systemic impact of Brexit and, at the same time, the older, slow decline in the potency of Britain\u2019s own postwar myths \u2013 a process that itself had much to do with the Brexit vote. Postwar British politics was rooted in two competing but also mutually dependent myths that arose directly out of events like D-day. One was a Conservative version of Britishness, which celebrated indomitable exceptionalism, military prowess and long-enduring \u2013 especially English \u2013 traditions of governance and culture. The other was a Labour version, centred on national unity, shared sacrifice and reward, and an exceptionalism that is more British than English. These traditions overlapped at times. Both included a strong sense of British uniqueness, and each has spent much of the past 75 years seeking ways to recreate their respective idealisations of this imagined past. They remain powerful visions: today, Brexit and Corbynism are respective reflections of their enduring allure to many. But, as time has passed, the claim to national greatness has become more remote from the interconnections of the modern world and from people\u2019s life experiences. Politically, both myths have been challenged by internal \u201cmodernising\u201d movements. But they have also been challenged by movements and parties that speak to different post-Churchill and post-Attlee visions of Britain \u2013 among them pro-Europeans, environmentalists and an array of identitarians. These evolving fractures ensure that the solemn events this week cannot just be commemorative business as usual. Instead they mark a change. They embody the chronic uncertainty of the times. They cast an unavoidably unforgiving light on the way that the electorates of both the US and Britain have each taken deeply disruptive decisions that threaten the international order of which their governments still imagine themselves to be mainstays. In one sense this is merely another phase in on ongoing process. As the decades have passed, the weight which these wartime anniversaries have been called upon to bear has always evolved. In the early postwar period, the D-day commemorations in Normandy served a predominantly Gallic narrative as postwar France sought a way to rebuild. By 1964, when Dwight Eisenhower returned to Normandy for the first time since he had commanded the invasion of France to speak movingly about D-day and world peace, a more cold war and US-led narrative predominated. In 1994, in the first post-cold war commemoration, Bill Clinton launched a heroic new myth about the global benevolence of US power, which George W Bush (in spite of Iraq) and Barack Obama echoed in 2004 and 2014. Now, though, we have reached a sharp turn in the narrative. Donald Trump\u2019s isolationism and indifference to international institutions such as the EU and Nato mean these will be the most uneasy D-day commemorations for years. And so they ought to be. For Trump represents a defiance of the internationalism and shared interests that marked D-day itself, as well as most of the commemorations over the years. Faced with a president who doesn\u2019t care whether he offends others, it is hard for the collective D-day song to remain the same. But the Britain that Theresa May will represent in Normandy on her departure from office is a destabiliser of the postwar order too. Under May, Britain has protested against its commitment to Europe while readying to break the relationship unilaterally. It has talked the language of rules-based governance while spurning the obligations of rule enforcement. And it has talked about the primacy of trade while flirting this week with a US president who may allow US firms to gouge the NHS and blitz environmental and food standards. It would be idle to pretend that this is not a splintering moment in the way Europe sees its 20th century past. But these fractures can be healed. These retreats can be reversed. To see how this can happen, consider instead the approach of two people from different ends of the 75-year spectrum being marked this week. One is someone whom, in so many other ways, May might have resembled in other political circumstances. The other is a leader who in every way was the antithesis and moral reprimand to everything embodied by Trump. Last week, Angela Merkel went to Harvard to deliver the end of academic year commencement address to the university\u2019s graduating students. She did not mention Trump by name but, in her remarkable speech, told the students not to act on impulses but always to pause and think, to always ask themselves whether courses of action were right rather than easy, and to resist the temptation to \u201cdescribe lies as truth, and truth as lies\u201d.

It\u2019s a scary business meeting royals. I\u2019m nobody\u2019s idea of a royalist, but even my legs went a bit wibbly-wobbly when I met Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.</p> <p>It was in the garden at Clarence House where Christine Bleakley and I were interviewing them about said garden when we presented Daybreak. On being introduced to them, Christine conjured up a curtsey from somewhere. Panicked, I went into a bow but, having never bowed to anyone before, I realised I didn\u2019t know how it was done. You wouldn\u2019t have thought there\u2019s a lot to it, but there is one key decision you have to make: how far down to bow. Once I was on my way down, I didn\u2019t know when to stop. Before I knew it, my torso was at right angles to my legs. I was stuck there for what seemed an awfully long time. With a little gasp and a hand from Christine I just about managed to arise.</p> <p>At the end of the interview, as a little joke, I told HRH that time was getting on and I had nothing at home for my tea. Perhaps, I suggested, I could take some vegetables from his organic garden. He laughed uncertainly.</p> <p>As the crew were packing up, he sidled up to me and quietly said, out of the corner of his mouth: \u201cReally, if you do need something, then please go ahead and help yourself.\u201d He nodded towards the royal vegetable patch. I\u2019m afraid that this simple act of kindness rendered me quite speechless. I stammered something unintelligible and waved the offer away with pathetic gratitude. He looked benignly at me, as if I were mad.</p> <p>I have always regretted not striding off and manfully uprooting a couple of right royal carrots. Another time, perhaps.</p> <h2>Will old blokes ever learn to put on a condom?</h2> <p>I see more over-65s are picking up gonorrhoea, which is encouraging and discouraging news. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that those of us galloping through middle age might still be sexually active throughout our seventh decade; it\u2019s discouraging that the entirely common-sense precaution of popping on a condom seems beyond the ken of young and old blokes alike. Also, it would help if these afflictions were easier to spell. I once texted somebody about chlamydia without noticing it had been autocorrected to clammy diva. </p>",

On being introduced to them, Christine conjured up a curtsey from somewhere. Panicked, I went into a bow but, having never bowed to anyone before, I realised I didn\u2019t know how it was done. You wouldn\u2019t have thought there\u2019s a lot to it, but there is one key decision you have to make: how far down to bow. Once I was on my way down, I didn\u2019t know when to stop. Before I knew it, my torso was at right angles to my legs. I was stuck there for what seemed an awfully long time. With a little gasp and a hand from Christine I just about managed to arise. At the end of the interview, as a little joke, I told HRH that time was getting on and I had nothing at home for my tea. Perhaps, I suggested, I could take some vegetables from his organic garden. He laughed uncertainly. As the crew were packing up, he sidled up to me and quietly said, out of the corner of his mouth: \u201cReally, if you do need something, then please go ahead and help yourself.\u201d He nodded towards the royal vegetable patch. I\u2019m afraid that this simple act of kindness rendered me quite speechless. I stammered something unintelligible and waved the offer away with pathetic gratitude. He looked benignly at me, as if I were mad. I have always regretted not striding off and manfully uprooting a couple of right royal carrots. Another time, perhaps. Will old blokes ever learn to put on a condom? I see more over-65s are picking up gonorrhoea, which is encouraging and discouraging news. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that those of us galloping through middle age might still be sexually active throughout our seventh decade; it\u2019s discouraging that the entirely common-sense precaution of popping on a condom seems beyond the ken of young and old blokes alike. Also, it would help if these afflictions were easier to spell. I once texted somebody about chlamydia without noticing it had been autocorrected to clammy diva.",

Do we really think that Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift will simply down tools when they reach 45 and take up knitting? The fact she is still annoying people by doing the job she has been doing for 35 years would suggest she\u2019s a long way from being irrelevant. In the minds of her most vicious detractors \u2013 the ones that jeered with hilarity as \u201cgrandma\u201d fell off the stage at the 2015 Brits \u2013 she would be better off binning the fishnets, putting on a nice cardie and waiting for death. Even the more moderate language used in relation to her is revealing. \u201cDignity\u201d crops up a lot, as does \u201cappropriate\u201d and \u201cgrowing old gracefully\u201d. When men talk about women ageing gracefully, they are not acting out of concern. They\u2019re telling them to know their station, to sit down and shut up. \u201cPeople have always been trying to silence me for one reason or another, whether it\u2019s that I\u2019m not pretty enough, I don\u2019t sing well enough, I\u2019m not talented enough, I\u2019m not married enough \u2013 and now it\u2019s that I\u2019m not young enough,\u201d Madonna told Vogue recently. \u201cNow I\u2019m being punished for turning 60.\u201d Tracey Thorn, the Everything but the Girl singer-turned-solo artist and author, last year shared her objections to being described as \u201ca 55-year-old wife and mother\u201d in a review by the American music writer Robert Christgau. \u201cThe more I think about it the crosser I\u2019m getting,\u201d she said on Twitter. \u201c\u201855-year-old husband and father.\u2019 I\u2019m trying to imagine it as a description in an album review. Nope. Can\u2019t do it.\u201d I have no right to throw stones here. In 2003 I interviewed Siouxsie Sioux, an artist I\u2019d admired for as long as I could remember. Near the end of our chat I asked blithely if musical retirement was on the cards. She was 45. She gave me a proper bollocking, and pointed out \u2013 rightly \u2013 that I would never have asked a man that question. Ultimately it all boils down to what society deems alluring and acceptable. Older men, with their silver hair and laughter lines, are seen as stately and wise. Women of the same age are past it and embarrassing. Today, Iggy Pop (72) gets to run around shirtless during live performances. Nick Cave (61) dyes his hair and wears his shirts slashed to the waist; Elton John (72), who this year spoils us with a film, a memoir and a farewell tour, gads about in shades and diamante-encrusted suits. What links them, beyond their occupation, is that they get to decide how they conduct themselves and, crucially, when they stop working. And they get to do this without fear of criticism or vitriol. It\u2019s high time female artists enjoyed the same privilege. \u2022 Fiona Sturges is an arts writer specialising in books, music, podcasting and TV",

The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has said it will no longer restrict the size of salmon farms as long as they meet tougher standards limiting chemical, faecal and organic waste pollution in surrounding seas. Scottish ministers have also unveiled much stricter legal limits on the level of sea lice allowed on farmed fish, amid mounting anger about plagues of sea lice, a parasite that eats fish alive, killing wild Atlantic salmon. The new measures are expected to see much larger farms placed in deeper water further off the Scottish coast, in part to replace smaller inshore fish farms that may be forced to move because of the tougher pollution tests.

Conservationists and anglers say fish farms act as factories for sea lice, which in turn feed on wild Atlantic salmon swimming past, with many calling for a ban on new farms. The number of wild salmon caught by Scottish anglers last year plunged to the lowest in 70 years. The Scottish salmon farming industry, which is largely owned by Norwegian multi-national companies who are under investigation by the European commission for alleged price fixing, want to double production by 2030, by up to 400,000 tonnes. Holyrood\u2019s environment committee warned last year that goal would be \u201cunsustainable and may cause irrecoverable damage to the environment\u201d unless pollution and parasite controls significantly improved.

A commemorative stamp bears a grid of 100 faces cropped down to the eyes and nose. Ten black faces are arranged in a diagonal, bisected by the letters \u201cBLACK POWER\u201d crossing in the opposite direction. Less visible, but effectively dominating the canvas, is the phrase \u201cWHITE POWER\u201d: a pervasive underlying structure that refuses to announce itself.</p> <p>Ringgold\u2019s mother was a fashion designer, working as Madame Posey, and had learned to quilt from her grandmother and great grandmother, both former slaves. Ringgold came to quilting from a different route, after seeing Tibetan and Nepalese tankas \u2013 portable cloth scroll paintings \u2013 at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. In the tankas at the Serpentine, Ringgold experiments with radically different combinations of image and border, among them paintings carrying historic texts, and patterns simultaneously referencing central African Kuba textiles and modish geometric abstraction. In the Slave Rape (1972) portraits, naked women modelled on Ringgold and her daughters flee through stylised undergrowth. The quilted borders locate these stories as part of a female tradition, the reinsertion of now-invisible histories of women fleeing slavers on the African continent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"990d1bb493af0914ca89a1b9300fe191a37a7370\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/990d1bb493af0914ca89a1b9300fe191a37a7370/0_212_3770_2262/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Slave Rape #1: Fear Will Make You Weak; and Slave Rape #2: Run You Might Get Away, both 1972, by Faith Ringgold.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Slave Rape #1: Fear Will Make You Weak; and Slave Rape #2: Run You Might Get Away, both 1972.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the early 1980s, following the death of her mother, Ringgold started exploring quilts as a narrative format, drawing on devotional folk paintings \u2013 such as Mexican retablos \u2013 cartoon books and other pictorial storytelling traditions. The star turn is the magnificent Who\u2019s Afraid of Aunt Jemima? (1983). Ringgold reimagines <a href=\"http://www.auntjemima.com/products/pancake_waffle_mixes/original_pancakes\">Aunt Jemima</a> \u2013 a fiction created as the face of a pancake brand, based on a racist archetype from 19th-century minstrel shows \u2013 as a stylish entrepreneur, telling her story through four generations. It\u2019s a gorgeous and intricate object, its cast of characters embroidered with real bead necklaces and sparkling sequin eyes.</p> <p>While Ringgold returned to something closer to a tanka format for subsequent works, her 80s quilts are intense, complex and exciting: information is everywhere, including the scraps of fabric forming the borders. Subway Graffiti #2 of 3 (1987) crams friends and neighbours together on a subway platform in a visual homage to New York graffiti artists of the era: their names and tags chase around the surrounding panels. Woman on a Bridge #1 of 5: Tar Beach (1988) is inspired by hot summer nights as a child, lying on a Harlem rooftop, and became the basis for Ringgold\u2019s first children\u2019s book.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27431de37aac56bb17bb6b4be1b6a67f011021cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27431de37aac56bb17bb6b4be1b6a67f011021cf/14_19_2333_2225/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Flag is Bleeding #2 (American Collection #6), 1997, by Faith Ringgold.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"954\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Flag is Bleeding #2 (American Collection #6), 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Faith Ringold/ARS, courtesy Pippy Houldsworth Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The show closes with two quilts from the American Collection (1997). In the first, a mother, weeping blood, stands clasping her naked children before an oozing American flag. In the second, Black Liberty, her torch extinguished, turns her back on a sea filled with drowning black bodies, stretching to the horizon. Both recall the violence on which the US was constructed, and with which a dominant power structure is maintained. It feels grotesque that it has become so commonplace in reviews to note that works created in response to racist and misogynist systems of the last century should still feel so relevant, but alas they do.</p> <ul> <li><p>At <a href=\"https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/faith-ringgold\">Serpentine Galleries, London</a>, 6 June to 8 September.</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",

For #19: US Postage Stamp Commemorating the Advent of Black Power (1967), Ringgold exploits graphic techniques associated with pop art. A commemorative stamp bears a grid of 100 faces cropped down to the eyes and nose. Ten black faces are arranged in a diagonal, bisected by the letters \u201cBLACK POWER\u201d crossing in the opposite direction. Less visible, but effectively dominating the canvas, is the phrase \u201cWHITE POWER\u201d: a pervasive underlying structure that refuses to announce itself. Ringgold\u2019s mother was a fashion designer, working as Madame Posey, and had learned to quilt from her grandmother and great grandmother, both former slaves. Ringgold came to quilting from a different route, after seeing Tibetan and Nepalese tankas \u2013 portable cloth scroll paintings \u2013 at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. In the tankas at the Serpentine, Ringgold experiments with radically different combinations of image and border, among them paintings carrying historic texts, and patterns simultaneously referencing central African Kuba textiles and modish geometric abstraction. In the Slave Rape (1972) portraits, naked women modelled on Ringgold and her daughters flee through stylised undergrowth. The quilted borders locate these stories as part of a female tradition, the reinsertion of now-invisible histories of women fleeing slavers on the African continent. In the early 1980s, following the death of her mother, Ringgold started exploring quilts as a narrative format, drawing on devotional folk paintings \u2013 such as Mexican retablos \u2013 cartoon books and other pictorial storytelling traditions. The star turn is the magnificent Who\u2019s Afraid of Aunt Jemima? (1983). Ringgold reimagines Aunt Jemima \u2013 a fiction created as the face of a pancake brand, based on a racist archetype from 19th-century minstrel shows \u2013 as a stylish entrepreneur, telling her story through four generations. It\u2019s a gorgeous and intricate object, its cast of characters embroidered with real bead necklaces and sparkling sequin eyes. While Ringgold returned to something closer to a tanka format for subsequent works, her 80s quilts are intense, complex and exciting: information is everywhere, including the scraps of fabric forming the borders. Subway Graffiti #2 of 3 (1987) crams friends and neighbours together on a subway platform in a visual homage to New York graffiti artists of the era: their names and tags chase around the surrounding panels. Woman on a Bridge #1 of 5: Tar Beach (1988) is inspired by hot summer nights as a child, lying on a Harlem rooftop, and became the basis for Ringgold\u2019s first children\u2019s book. The show closes with two quilts from the American Collection (1997). In the first, a mother, weeping blood, stands clasping her naked children before an oozing American flag. In the second, Black Liberty, her torch extinguished, turns her back on a sea filled with drowning black bodies, stretching to the horizon. Both recall the violence on which the US was constructed, and with which a dominant power structure is maintained. It feels grotesque that it has become so commonplace in reviews to note that works created in response to racist and misogynist systems of the last century should still feel so relevant, but alas they do. At Serpentine Galleries, London, 6 June to 8 September.",

Restrictions on funding also include limiting access to funds for sex education, and shifting funds to anti-LGBTQ and pro-abstinence groups such as Focus on the Family, researchers say. The \u201cCrisis in Care\u201d report from the International Women\u2019s Health Coalition outlines the two-year impact of the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cglobal gag rule\u201d which prohibits funding to international NGOs that do not sign a pledge saying they will not provide or promote abortions as a method of family planning. The rule applies to an organization\u2019s non-US funded activities too, regardless of the local laws regarding abortion. \u201cI think the most impactful and glaring thing is that people are dying as a result of the policy,\u201d said Vanessa Rios, pointing to a case in Kenya in which two women died from unsafe abortions \u2013 one used knitting needles \u2013 after a sex-worker organization stopped providing abortion information or referrals. The new report, built on 118 interviews with community health organizations in Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa and Nepal, portrays an international health community grappling with confusion over the gag rule\u2019s implementation, increased stigmatization of reproductive health services, and a ripple effect that is closing or fragmenting critical health services. It also illustrates the international implications of intensifying efforts in the US, primarily in Republican-dominated state legislatures, to roll back abortion access. Though every Republican president since Ronald Reagan has implemented the gag rule, which is imposed by a presidential memo, the Trump iteration expands the amount of money susceptible to the order, and has implications for funds for a wide array of global health concerns such as malaria, HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and nutrition. According to the new report, adherence to the gag rule now applies to $9bn in US foreign aid and extends to many organizations that previously did not have to comply with the policy. The escalation of the gag rule, the report says, has led to confusion among international providers as to what services and advice they can offer, and increased fear that a wrong step will jeopardize vital funds. Interviewees who received US funding from all four countries said they believed the gag rule allowed \u201cabsolutely no opportunity\u201d for providing any information, service or referral relating to abortion, according to the report. \u201cEven when prompted, many organizations did not or could not explain that the policy does not apply to abortion in cases of rape, incest, and when the woman\u2019s life is in danger, and that it allows for post-abortion care.\u201d The report also warned that the US\u2019s aggressive stance against abortion counseling and services was emboldening \u201cregressive actors\u201d \u2013 rightwing or anti-reproductive health groups \u2013 in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa. \u201cThe amount of money from the US to other countries isn\u2019t decreasing, it\u2019s just going more and more to regressive groups,\u201d said Jedidah Maina, executive director, in Kenya, of Trust for Indigenous Culture and Health, at a panel previewing the report. These groups include the anti-LGBTQ Christian group Focus on the Family, which now receives US funding to fight HIV/Aids in South Africa through a \u201cpurity pledge\u201d program, which promotes sexual abstinence among young people. Focus on the Family is one prominent example of how, two years into the more stringent gag rule, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing the real shift: if organizations are declining to sign this policy, then where is that funding going? We\u2019re seeing newer relationships with these [rightwing] groups,\u201d said Rios.

Sports Direct, which also owns the House of Fraser chain, immediately announced a review of Game\u2019s 540 stores, <a href=\"https://www.investegate.co.uk/game-digital-plc/rns/game-digital-plc-interim-results/201903210700085122T/\">which are located in the UK and Spain</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe review will focus on whether the existing Game sites should be consolidated with others in the Sports Direct Group [including House of Fraser], repurposed or closed,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe review could result in consolidation or closure of Game sites and a consequent reduction or relocation in the employment of Game\u2019s employees and management.\u201d</p> <p>Sports Direct, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/13/sports-direct-game-digital-mike-ashley-nintendo-switch\">first took a stake in Game in 2017</a>, increased its 29.9% shareholding to 38.49% triggering its bid for full control.</p> <p>Sports Direct\u2019s 30p per share offer for Game represents a 27% premium to the company\u2019s closing share price on Tuesday, the last day of trading before the bid.

      "bodyText": "The founder of Sports Direct, Mike Ashley, has launched a \u00a352m bid for video games retailer Game Digital. Ashley made the move after announcing that his stake in the business had risen to more than 38%, above the threshold requiring the tycoon to make a takeover bid for the entire business. Sports Direct, which also owns the House of Fraser chain, immediately announced a review of Game\u2019s 540 stores, which are located in the UK and Spain. \u201cThe review will focus on whether the existing Game sites should be consolidated with others in the Sports Direct Group [including House of Fraser], repurposed or closed,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe review could result in consolidation or closure of Game sites and a consequent reduction or relocation in the employment of Game\u2019s employees and management.\u201d Sports Direct, which first took a stake in Game in 2017, increased its 29.9% shareholding to 38.49% triggering its bid for full control. Sports Direct\u2019s 30p per share offer for Game represents a 27% premium to the company\u2019s closing share price on Tuesday, the last day of trading before the bid. Game\u2019s shares rose 23% on the news to 29p. The company said it intends to work with Game\u2019s management team to \u201cdevelop and review the existing strategic programme of repositioning and right sizing Game\u2019s retail business\u201d. Sports Direct also intends to further invest in, and expand, Game\u2019s eSports operation, Belong. \u201cThe retail and gaming sectors are fast moving and currently subject to challenging conditions,\u201d the company said. \u201cSports Direct does not believe that, as a standalone business, Game is able to weather the pressures that it is facing. Sports Direct\u2019s aim is to ensure Game\u2019s long-term sustainability and to escalate the evolution of the Belong business to accelerate the next stage of Game\u2019s development.\u201d Last year, Ashley increased his grip on Game striking a deal to rollout Belong in pay-to-play concessions in Sports Direct stores across the country. Sports Direct paid \u00a33.2m for 50% of the intellectual property owned by Belong including taking half the operation\u2019s profits. The deal also included Sports Direct providing a \u00a355m loan to Game\u2019s Spanish division to help fund development of more eSports venues in the country. Game Digital launched Belong in 2016 as part of a plan to move away from traditional retail sales, opening 19 venues. Ashley took a 25.75% stake in Game Digital in 2017 a month after the retailer issued a profit warning due to a supply shortage of Nintendo\u2019s hugely popular Switch console and a weaker lineup of new games.",

In an unusual public statement the US state department revealed that its undersecretary for political affairs, the diplomat David Hale, had phoned the Saudi deputy defence minister, Khaled bin Salman, to ask him to use the country\u2019s influence to end the brutal repression against peaceful protesters by the Sudanese Transitional Military Council (TMC) in Sudan. It has hardly been a secret that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have gained influence in Sudan following the overthrow of the dictator Omar al-Bashir in April. Critics of Saudi Arabia will see a pattern of behaviour, evident in Libya and Yemen, in which Saudi Arabia moves to marginalise rivals Iran and Qatar, as well as to install autocratic regimes built on repression. But it is rare for the Americans, normally so close to Saudi Arabia on regional issues, to make so public their representations to Riyadh on the need for civilian rule and for democracy to run its course. Saudi Arabia may claim the Sudanese crackdown was an independent judgment by the interim leader, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, but the army general has in recent weeks paid visits to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt. More importantly the deputy president of the council, Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia leader known as Hemedti, met the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, in Jeddah on 24 May, and pledged to stand with the kingdom against all threats, including Iran. He vowed Sudanese troops would continue fighting alongside Saudi Arabia against the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Dagolo is widely seen as the true decision-maker in Khartoum, and the figure behind moves to stall negotiations about the transition to democracy and resist protesters\u2019 demands that they be included in the transitional body. That Dagolo chose Riyadh for his first overseas trip since the fall of Bashir was hardly surprising. In April Saudi Arabia pledged to provide $3bn in funds to Khartoum, a move designed to stabilise the exchange rate and strengthen the military. Until recently there was no sign that the US disapproved of its great ally gaining influence in Sudan.

Between 2000 and 2017, Gulf states invested $13bn in the region, mainly in Sudan and Ethiopia, according to a study by the Clingendael Institute, a thinktank in the Netherlands.

Hadi spends most of his time in Riyadh and is no poster boy for democracy but Saudi will not abandon the war, regardless of the casualties, because it regards Iranian-backed Houthis as a permanent security threat. Equally in Libya, where a bloody military stalemate persists in Tripoli, Marshall Khalifa Haftar by most accounts would not have tried to seize the capital in defiance of a UN peace plan without UAE military hardware, and Saudi political backing. The question now is whether in Sudan, unlike Libya and Yemen, the US government is prepared to do more than simply dial Riyadh once.",

Noa Pothoven, 17, who for several years had been treated in multiple institutions for severe depression and anorexia, and had made previous attempts to kill herself, died at her parents\u2019 home in Arnhem on 2 June, local media reported. Media organisations from Australia to Britain and the US to India reported it as a case of \u201clegal euthanasia\u201d performed by a Dutch \u201cend-of-life clinic\u201d, and Noa\u2019s name was trending on social media on Wednesday in countries including Italy, where the story was front-page news.

She said she expected to die within 10 days. Euthanasia, in which a person\u2019s life is ended by doctors, and assisted suicide, where patients are given the means to end their own life, have been legal in the Netherlands since 2002. The law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide requires the patient\u2019s suffering to be unbearable, with no prospect of improvement, and their request must be made voluntarily, not under the influence of others. The patient must also have been fully informed of their condition, prospects and choices, another independent doctor must agree with the request, and a doctor must be present when the procedure is performed, either by the doctor or the patient. For children aged between 12 and 16, the parents\u2019 consent is required.

She described her subsequent mental illness, telling de Gelderlander in her interview that she hoped her book might prove useful for other young people facing similar problems, since there were no specialised Dutch institutions for teenagers needing psychiatric help. Noa had written graphically in her autobiography of her horror at the involuntary hospital admissions and treatments she had previously undergone, saying she \u201calmost felt like a criminal, even though I hadn\u2019t so much as stolen a piece of candy in my life\u201d. De Gelderlander said she had spent her final days saying goodbye to her close family. A spokeswoman for the Dutch MP Lisa Westerveld, who has campaigned for improved youth psychiatric care and visited Noa shortly before her death, told DutchNews that as far as was known, Noa had died \u201cbecause she didn\u2019t eat any more\u201d.

They simply continue trampling over the grass, or let their dogs bound over it. \u201cI\u2019m used to all kinds of hazards to my work,\u201d shrugs the artist <a href=\"https://www.saype-artiste.com/?lang=en\">Saype</a>. \u201cIf it\u2019s not the weather, it\u2019s cows walking over it, or moles popping up, and here it\u2019s dogs. I take it as a lesson in humility.\u201d</p> <p>Saype \u2014 real-name Guillaume Legros \u2014 is one of France\u2019s newest street art sensations, a rural graffiti artist who, instead of working in urban settings, creates his own brand of land art: massive biodegradable paintings on enormous stretches of grass on mountainsides.</p> <p>Where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/11/deserts-and-dynamite-my-journey-to-the-cosmic-heart-of-land-art\">land art</a> was traditionally about building epic works from rocks and natural materials on the ground or mowing and carving shapes into the landscape, Saype instead spray-paints ultra-realist, street-art images of local people on to the grass itself. His scale is gigantic \u2013 covering huge swathes of fields and mountains using his own recipe of homemade biodegradable paint. From a woman\u2019s face on fields in the French Alps to a giant grandad in braces on a Swiss mountainside or a child in a Russian clearing, his works are visible from the air \u2014 a new artform for the era of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/drones-non-military\">drones</a> \u2014 and don\u2019t last long, soon disappearing again into the landscape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c26f21e1b28661fa712d2cf6996fd11a7625880f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c26f21e1b28661fa712d2cf6996fd11a7625880f/0_0_4898_3265/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Story of the Future, land art by Saype on a hill above Montreux, Switzerland, in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Story of the Future, land art by Saype on a hill above Montreux, Switzerland, in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valentin Flauraud/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But now Saype is returning to cities, transforming parks into huge portraits visible from the sky that comment on the climate emergency or the refugee crisis.</p> <p>The 30-year-old is the first artist ever allowed to take over the hallowed Champs de Mars lawns under the Eiffel Tower. His vast new project, <a href=\"https://www.saype-artiste.com/beyond-walls?lang=en\">Beyond Walls</a>, will see him spray-paint a series of interlocked hands across the lawns here this month, stretching over hundreds of square metres. They will make little sense close up on the ground, but will be visible from the top of the tower.</p> <p>To him, it\u2019s a \u201chuman chain\u201d and \u201ca symbol of togetherness at a time when people are more and more turning in on themselves\u201d.

The hands gripping each other could be an act of rescue, survival or friendship. The work comes from photographs he has taken, but exactly whose hands are pictured we will never know. Saype deliberately chose not to know himself. His inspiration was the humanitarian group, <a href=\"http://www.sosmediterranee.fr/\">SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e</a>, and their rescue work pulling people in distress from the Mediterranean, the world\u2019s most deadly migration route.</p> <p>Last year, in central Geneva Saype created a <a href=\"https://sosmediterranee.ch/event/une-fresque-gigantesque-rend-hommage-a-sos-mediterranee-a-geneve/\">vast grass fresco</a> of a girl with her hand outstretched towards a paper boat on the lake in support of their rescue work.

His mother operated x-ray equipment at a hospital, his father worked in IT. \u201cI never went to a museum or a single exhibition as a child,\u201d he says.

That word, Saype, became his <em>nom de guerre</em>.</p> <p>Soon he progressed to ultra-realist portraits, travelling to Paris to photograph people on the M\u00e9tro and then painting them in black and white. For years he combined street art with full-time work as a nurse. He says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nursing\">a nurse\u2019s \u201cdaily confrontation with human suffering</a>, ageing and illness\u201d pushed him to keep painting people.

      "bodyText": "On a vast stretch of lawn beneath the Eiffel tower, a paint-splattered figure in a baseball cap is kneeling down, carefully planting small wooden stakes into the grass, checking each is aligned with a tape-measure. It\u2019s an odd sight in the park beneath Paris\u2019s main tourist attraction, but in the morning rush, few people pause to wonder what he is doing. They simply continue trampling over the grass, or let their dogs bound over it. \u201cI\u2019m used to all kinds of hazards to my work,\u201d shrugs the artist Saype. \u201cIf it\u2019s not the weather, it\u2019s cows walking over it, or moles popping up, and here it\u2019s dogs. I take it as a lesson in humility.\u201d Saype \u2014 real-name Guillaume Legros \u2014 is one of France\u2019s newest street art sensations, a rural graffiti artist who, instead of working in urban settings, creates his own brand of land art: massive biodegradable paintings on enormous stretches of grass on mountainsides. Where land art was traditionally about building epic works from rocks and natural materials on the ground or mowing and carving shapes into the landscape, Saype instead spray-paints ultra-realist, street-art images of local people on to the grass itself. His scale is gigantic \u2013 covering huge swathes of fields and mountains using his own recipe of homemade biodegradable paint. From a woman\u2019s face on fields in the French Alps to a giant grandad in braces on a Swiss mountainside or a child in a Russian clearing, his works are visible from the air \u2014 a new artform for the era of drones \u2014 and don\u2019t last long, soon disappearing again into the landscape. But now Saype is returning to cities, transforming parks into huge portraits visible from the sky that comment on the climate emergency or the refugee crisis. The 30-year-old is the first artist ever allowed to take over the hallowed Champs de Mars lawns under the Eiffel Tower. His vast new project, Beyond Walls, will see him spray-paint a series of interlocked hands across the lawns here this month, stretching over hundreds of square metres. They will make little sense close up on the ground, but will be visible from the top of the tower. To him, it\u2019s a \u201chuman chain\u201d and \u201ca symbol of togetherness at a time when people are more and more turning in on themselves\u201d. He will paint similar images of hands and arms clinging to each other in cities across the world over the next three years, aiming for locations from Nairobi to Belfast. For him it\u2019s about \u201cliving together\u201d, moving beyond borders and remembering history. His great-grandparents, French Resistance fighters in rural eastern France during the second world war, died after they were deported. \u201cRight now, it seems like we\u2019ve all got short memories, that we\u2019re living in a kind of negative, prewar atmosphere with economic crisis and people putting up barriers,\u201d he says. Beyond Walls is also the first time he has ever worked on a project with a newspaper. He has produced three images of interlaced hands which will be printed from this Saturday on the Guardian\u2019s new biodegradable, potato starch wraps that package the weekend print supplements. Saype sees the groundbreaking eco-friendly packaging as a way to bring his images \u201cfrom the mountainside into people\u2019s homes\u201d. If his transitory art on grass is destined ultimately to fade away, he liked the notion of making art that would be composted into oblivion in Guardian readers\u2019 bins. \u201cI love the idea that nothing is left of it,\u201d he smiles. \u201cAnd what really interests me is how people will interact with it \u2013 how will they rip open this bag? I find that act really symbolically interesting. The art will be on the compost heap, but the image will stay in the mind.\u201d The images themselves carry their own mystery. The hands gripping each other could be an act of rescue, survival or friendship. The work comes from photographs he has taken, but exactly whose hands are pictured we will never know. Saype deliberately chose not to know himself. His inspiration was the humanitarian group, SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, and their rescue work pulling people in distress from the Mediterranean, the world\u2019s most deadly migration route. Last year, in central Geneva Saype created a vast grass fresco of a girl with her hand outstretched towards a paper boat on the lake in support of their rescue work. For Beyond Walls, he set up a camera at an SOS M\u00e9diterann\u00e9e gala night and took pictures of anyone who would have their arms and hands photographed. Among them were rescue workers, sailors, refugees themselves \u2013 many who had survived the crossing from Libya \u2013 but also politicians and footballers as well as the fashion designer Agn\u00e8s B.

      "body": "<p>Churches should offer their green spaces as gardening projects for people with mental health problems, a senior Church of England bishop has said.</p> <p>Studies had established the therapeutic benefits of gardening, said James Newcome, the bishop of Carlisle and the C of E\u2019s lead bishop on health issues.</p> <p>He said: \u201cChurches should look at the land they have around their buildings to see if there\u2019s any possibility of people who are homeless or have mental health difficulties or who are lonely [getting] involved in hands-on gardening.</p> <p>\u201cIn urban areas there is a real shortage of green space, and churches often have the only green space in a neighbourhood. In rural areas there are real problems of isolation and loneliness. There are all sorts of benefits \u2013 therapeutic, meeting up with others, finding a sense of belonging and purpose. [This idea] is not complicated but it can make a huge difference.\u201d</p> <p>Newcome was speaking on Wednesday at a conference at Lambeth Palace, the London headquarters of the archbishop of Canterbury, to promote gardening and mental health. The garden at Lambeth Palace, stretching over 10 acres, is one of the oldest in England.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.churchofengland.org/more/media-centre/news/mental-health-english-communities-leading-concern-clergy-survey-finds-0\">survey of clergy</a> last year showed that mental health issues were one of the main problems they encountered in their parishes, along with loneliness and homelessness.</p> <p>David Shreeve, who advises the church on environmental issues, said: \u201cThere are 16,400 C of E churches, many with unused spaces around them, and often in difficult urban areas with homes without gardens and few parks. There are people who have never done any gardening before but when they plant a seed or bulb, nurture it, see it sprout and grow, it has an enormously positive effect.\u201d</p> <p>Among the speakers at the conference was Jonathan Aitken, the former Conservative cabinet minister who went to prison for perjury. He was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/29/jonathan-aitken-back-at-the-old-bailey-this-time-as-a-jail-chaplain\">ordained as an Anglican deacon last year</a> and is now training to be a prison chaplain.</p> <p>\u201cThere are astonishing mental health problems in our prisons, including self-harming and suicides. Could gardening make a difference? I think it might,\u201d said Aitken, who said he worked in the gardens of HMP Standford Hill during his prison term.</p> <p>Aitken said he was involved in discussions about a possible gardening projectinvolving the Young Offender Institution Feltham and a nearby church with a \u201cbig wilderness of a garden\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cGardening slows you down and calms you down. You have all these troubled, testosterone-fuelled, aggressive young men. It might help to get them out of the concrete spaces of prison into the fresh air,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Rachel Kelly, a mental health campaigner and author, said people with depression found it hard to cope with big demands but gardening was \u201cvery scaleable\u201d. She added: \u201cEven on a really bad day you might be able to snip a rose or sweep a path, and that gives you a sense of achievement.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Churches should offer their green spaces as gardening projects for people with mental health problems, a senior Church of England bishop has said. Studies had established the therapeutic benefits of gardening, said James Newcome, the bishop of Carlisle and the C of E\u2019s lead bishop on health issues. He said: \u201cChurches should look at the land they have around their buildings to see if there\u2019s any possibility of people who are homeless or have mental health difficulties or who are lonely [getting] involved in hands-on gardening. \u201cIn urban areas there is a real shortage of green space, and churches often have the only green space in a neighbourhood. In rural areas there are real problems of isolation and loneliness. There are all sorts of benefits \u2013 therapeutic, meeting up with others, finding a sense of belonging and purpose. [This idea] is not complicated but it can make a huge difference.\u201d Newcome was speaking on Wednesday at a conference at Lambeth Palace, the London headquarters of the archbishop of Canterbury, to promote gardening and mental health. The garden at Lambeth Palace, stretching over 10 acres, is one of the oldest in England. A survey of clergy last year showed that mental health issues were one of the main problems they encountered in their parishes, along with loneliness and homelessness. David Shreeve, who advises the church on environmental issues, said: \u201cThere are 16,400 C of E churches, many with unused spaces around them, and often in difficult urban areas with homes without gardens and few parks. There are people who have never done any gardening before but when they plant a seed or bulb, nurture it, see it sprout and grow, it has an enormously positive effect.\u201d Among the speakers at the conference was Jonathan Aitken, the former Conservative cabinet minister who went to prison for perjury. He was ordained as an Anglican deacon last year and is now training to be a prison chaplain. \u201cThere are astonishing mental health problems in our prisons, including self-harming and suicides. Could gardening make a difference? I think it might,\u201d said Aitken, who said he worked in the gardens of HMP Standford Hill during his prison term. Aitken said he was involved in discussions about a possible gardening projectinvolving the Young Offender Institution Feltham and a nearby church with a \u201cbig wilderness of a garden\u201d. \u201cGardening slows you down and calms you down. You have all these troubled, testosterone-fuelled, aggressive young men. It might help to get them out of the concrete spaces of prison into the fresh air,\u201d he said. Rachel Kelly, a mental health campaigner and author, said people with depression found it hard to cope with big demands but gardening was \u201cvery scaleable\u201d. She added: \u201cEven on a really bad day you might be able to snip a rose or sweep a path, and that gives you a sense of achievement.\u201d",

It\u2019s like having to go to the dentist or get your eyes tested.\u201d</p> <p>The reason Khan hates bikini shopping is because she is a size 10-12, with a 32FF bust, and few retailers design swimwear for women with relatively narrow backs and larger cup sizes. Khan isn\u2019t alone. \u201cI heard at least two or three other people in the changing rooms today saying: \u2018Oh God, I can never find anything.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It will be a familiar grievance to many women as holiday season approaches \u2013 frowning at their reflections in starkly lit mirrors as they attempt to wriggle and contort themselves into high-street swimming costumes that seem to be made with no consideration of women\u2019s bodies. \u201cIt\u2019s such an emotional drain,\u201d Khan says. \u201cEven if you\u2019ve bought something, you always leave feeling deflated afterwards.\u201d</p> <p>Canvassing women about their experiences of buying swimwear on the high street, the feedback was astonishingly negative: tales of bikini bottoms so tiny that most of your rear end is on show, or cut too tight on the thigh so that you can barely get a leg inside them. Taller women find swimsuits are never long enough, so they get a perpetual wedgie. For women who don\u2019t fit into the 6-16 range offered by most high-street shops, the choice is limited to matronly control-wear and billowing kaftans \u2013 the assumption being that plus-sized women are ashamed of their bodies and want to disappear. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7629ff9ce502ab4ec5621adc55d7fd5f96a60f59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7629ff9ce502ab4ec5621adc55d7fd5f96a60f59/0_0_2432_3636/669.jpg\" alt=\"Youswim costumes are made from stretchy fabric that accommodates a range of sizes\" width=\"669\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Youswim costumes are made from stretchy fabric that accommodates a range of sizes</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt fits into the narrative, which I think a lot of us have internalised, that your body is wrong for the clothes, rather than the clothes being wrong for your body,\u201d says Stephanie Boland, 28, from London, who is a bra size 28FF. \u201cIt\u2019s depressing to buy things that are supposedly in your size and find they don\u2019t fit at all.\u201d</p> <p>Often women end up with the thing that is the closest to fitting. <a href=\"https://prettybigbutterflies.com/\" title=\"\">Plus-size blogger </a><a href=\"https://prettybigbutterflies.com/\" title=\"\">Hollie Burgess</a>, 33, from Nottingham, remembers her first holiday abroad, aged 18. All she could find in her size was a brown tankini, which she hated. \u201cMy size just wasn\u2019t there in shops,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember thinking: everyone else can wear what they want and I\u2019m wearing this.\u201d</p> <p>Things are looking up, however, and it\u2019s all thanks to the internet. \u201cIf we think about online providers, in effect they have endless aisles, which means that they can store unlimited inventory,\u201d explains Jonathan Reynolds, a retail expert at the University of Oxford. High-street shops tend not to stock what is known as the \u201c\u2018long tail\u2019, stuff that might broaden your range, but doesn\u2019t sell frequently enough to justify its space on the shelf\u201d. </p> <p>This may not be a sensible commercial decision for long. According to market researchers Mintel, 18% of women buy plus-size clothing, defined as a size 18 or above. Online-only retailers such as Asos, Missguided and Boohoo have proved particularly adept in targeting these consumers. And, even for women who are not plus-sized, online shopping takes the sting out of swimwear purchasing. \u201cNo longer are people going in, picking up a swimsuit from a rack, going to a changing room, trying it on, looking at it in the mirror with harsh lighting and feeling bad about their bodies,\u201d says Steven Wright, a senior lecturer in fashion design at the University of South Wales. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is people purchasing multiple swimsuits online, trying them on in their own home and sending the remainder back.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"921e2836dda401c98825f3c1adbe2a0fe784fbbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/921e2836dda401c98825f3c1adbe2a0fe784fbbc/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bravissimo specialises in swimwear for women with larger busts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bravissimo specialises in swimwear for women with larger busts</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bravissimo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brands catering to women shut out of the British high street have experienced remarkable growth. Bravissimo, which specialises in swimwear for women with larger busts, saw its sales increase by 3.4% to \u00a351.9m in 2017. Lyra Swim \u2013 a modest swimwear brand founded in 2017 by Ikram Zein, who was tired of never being able to find swimwear that felt acceptable for her Islamic faith \u2013 has grown 300% year-on-year. \u201cI\u2019m surprised by how quickly we\u2019ve grown,\u201d she says. This is particularly because not all of her customers are Muslim \u2013 some want to cover up because they want sun protection or feel body-conscious. (Nigella Lawson was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/23/nigella-lawson-burkini-bikini-swimming\" title=\"\">spotted wearing a burkini on Bondi beach</a> in 2011; she didn\u2019t want to get a tan.)</p> <p>New players are entering the market. Elise Wallbank launched Youswim in June 2018, after discovering a stretchable nylon fabric that could be made into an outfit that would accommodate a range of sizes. The brand\u2019s swimwear fits size 6 to 14, but Wallbank acknowledges there is \u201cwork to do in terms of being more inclusive\u201d for bigger women. Browsing <a href=\"https://www.youswim.com/\" title=\"\">Youswim\u2019s website</a>, women of different sizes beam back at you. They have pot bellies, wide hips and thighs that jiggle. They look wonderful. \u201cFrom the outset, I never wanted the swimwear to be displayed on your typical size 8, blond model on a beach ... because it works on such a diverse range of sizes, it seems counter-intuitive to not represent that market in the way that you advertise your product.\u201d</p> <p>Brands like Youswim have a simple aesthetic \u2013 minimal one-pieces and bikinis, without adornments, underwiring or padding, in a stretchable, one-size-fits-all \u201ccrinkle\u201d fabric \u2013 that is indebted to luxury swimwear brand Hunza G. Even if you have never heard of Hunza G, you have almost certainly seen a knock-off by now. There are no dangling bits of string or complicated halter-tops to tie. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to design something that felt really complicated that you couldn\u2019t swim in,\u201d explains the brand\u2019s creative director, Georgiana Huddart. \u201cYears ago, all the brands that were really successful had cutouts, diamante bits, little metal things hanging off them. It was unusual to find something quite sporty and simple, but fashionable.\u201d</p> <p>Hunza G costumes and those like them are popular because the material moulds itself to your body, meaning it fits women who are different sizes on top and bottom. As the material is thick, you feel contained \u2013 your bits aren\u2019t going to lurch anywhere. \u201cFashion has taken a turn for the functional over the last few years,\u201d explains Wright. \u201cWhat we saw 10 years ago was effectively several triangles of Lycra worn on the body. Now we\u2019re seeing moulded, tech-fabric-driven garments that provide the body with a bit more of an equipment base.\u201d But with designs starting at \u00a3130, Hunza G is expensive, and it is not currently suitable for plus-size women, only fitting up to a size 14. (Huddart plans to introduce a version to fit up to a size 20 next year.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"103e1b259c014eed85b5d1ed8676788020c5ce96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/103e1b259c014eed85b5d1ed8676788020c5ce96/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lyra Swim\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lyra Swim is a modest beachwear brand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WWAGS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One retailer cornering this market is Wolf &amp; Whistle. With sizing from 32B and 42F, and a dress size 26, it offers trends-driven swimwear that caters for plus-size and big-breasted women. \u201cOften when people do plus-size or fuller-bust swimwear, they make it dowdy,\u201d explains the co-founder Emma Parker. She wanted to make swimwear that was as \u201csexy and fashionable and revealing and brightly coloured\u201d as anything on the high street. The bigger range of sizes does add to the brand\u2019s production expenses, but Parker thinks it is worth it to cater to women of all sizes. \u201cIt normalises bodies, having them all in there together.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually, Khan bought a yellow bikini from Bravissimo, a specialist store for women with larger breasts. It fit perfectly, but, at \u00a360, was more expensive than she was hoping for. \u201cThe garments cost more to produce,\u201d explains Clare Turner, a senior supply and merchandising manager at Bravissimo, \u201c[because] if you\u2019ve got a swimsuit on the high street that\u2019s just a pull-on swimsuit, it could just use one fabric, or maybe a very thin liner. Whereas a cup size and wired swimsuit might have the outer fabric, the liner in the body, and then it\u2019s essentially got a full bra inside ... it\u2019s two products in one.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s still a way to go, particularly when it comes to sustainability. Wolf &amp; Whistle\u2019s recycled swimwear collection isn\u2019t available in plus-size. Although Youswim\u2019s garments are ethically manufactured in the UK, and Lyra Swim uses a Turkish factory that is audited by the <a href=\"https://www.fairwear.org/about/\" title=\"\">Fair Wear Foundation</a>, it is still the case that many consumers favour fast-fashion brands. Although they may have affordable and size-inclusive ranges, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/nov/27/mps-criticise-high-street-fashion-throwaway-culture\" title=\"\">some such brands have poor records</a> when it comes to worker rights and are some of the biggest contributors to the estimated \u00a3140m of clothing sent to landfill every year.</p> <p>Gripes aside, there is no doubt things are improving. \u201cYou have a choice now, whereas you never used to,\u201d says Burgess. \u201cDifferent shapes, different cuts, different colours. The brands are slowly doing better.\u201d She tells me about her favourite yellow swimsuit. It is from Forever 21, and has a cutout detail and bow at the front. \u201cIt\u2019s miles away from the tankini I bought when I was 18!\u201d The first time Burgess wore it, on holiday with her fiance in Magaluf in 2014, it was game-changing. \u201cI felt comfortable in what I was wearing, and I felt good.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 June 2019 to clarify that Lyra Swim uses a factory that is audited by, rather than part of, the Fair Wear Foundation.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The increasing ambition of home-cooking \u2013 with technical complexity, obscure ingredients and long-term projects now part of the lexicon \u2013 has thrown up the question of whether there is any point in going to restaurants. Where once an overcooked salmon steak was a disappointment, it is now an active insult. So, is there a better reason to eat out than the fact that there will be other people there?</p> <p>Well, yes. You are going for atmosphere \u2013 noise, soft furnishings, cool people, couples who look as if they are not as well suited as you are. But as far as the food is concerned, you are going for talent \u2013 imagination, embedded knowledge and dexterity \u2013 and the kitchen\u2019s accrued resources. Some recipes will require a brown veal stock as a bare minimum, and there is nothing to stop you doing that yourself, except the bit where you have to start two days before, engaging in a bit of banter with a butcher before he will even look out the back to see if he has any veal bones.</p> <p>Every time you go to a restaurant and wonder why the food tastes so much better than anything you have ever made at home, that is 75% down to its sauce. I once did a cooking course at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/sep/15/le-manoir-aux-quat-saisons-restaurant-review\" title=\"\">Le Manoir aux Quat\u2019Saisons</a>, and roughly a third of the eye-poppingly expensive day was spent teaching us how to make light and dark chicken stock. The kitchenerati of the Cotswolds were incensed, because it seemed so basic, so low-skill, so non-interventionist. They kept poking it and stirring it as it was simmering. In the end, the chef put a pan of boiling water next to it on the stove and said: \u201cIf you absolutely can\u2019t see a pan without wanting to stir it, stir that one.\u201d It is patient, slow, unengaging work, making a perfect stock, done best by a person who is doing 17 other things at the same time. Its transformation into something more profound involves yet more time, as well as \u2013 generally \u2013 more butter and salt than the domestic cook would ever countenance.

      "bodyText": "The increasing ambition of home-cooking \u2013 with technical complexity, obscure ingredients and long-term projects now part of the lexicon \u2013 has thrown up the question of whether there is any point in going to restaurants. Where once an overcooked salmon steak was a disappointment, it is now an active insult. So, is there a better reason to eat out than the fact that there will be other people there? Well, yes. You are going for atmosphere \u2013 noise, soft furnishings, cool people, couples who look as if they are not as well suited as you are. But as far as the food is concerned, you are going for talent \u2013 imagination, embedded knowledge and dexterity \u2013 and the kitchen\u2019s accrued resources. Some recipes will require a brown veal stock as a bare minimum, and there is nothing to stop you doing that yourself, except the bit where you have to start two days before, engaging in a bit of banter with a butcher before he will even look out the back to see if he has any veal bones. Every time you go to a restaurant and wonder why the food tastes so much better than anything you have ever made at home, that is 75% down to its sauce. I once did a cooking course at Le Manoir aux Quat\u2019Saisons, and roughly a third of the eye-poppingly expensive day was spent teaching us how to make light and dark chicken stock. The kitchenerati of the Cotswolds were incensed, because it seemed so basic, so low-skill, so non-interventionist. They kept poking it and stirring it as it was simmering. In the end, the chef put a pan of boiling water next to it on the stove and said: \u201cIf you absolutely can\u2019t see a pan without wanting to stir it, stir that one.\u201d It is patient, slow, unengaging work, making a perfect stock, done best by a person who is doing 17 other things at the same time. Its transformation into something more profound involves yet more time, as well as \u2013 generally \u2013 more butter and salt than the domestic cook would ever countenance. This is the point of going out. As for imagination, I reviewed restaurants for a decade and thought I had tasted every combination, ancient and modern, until I tried a pop-up in a shipping container (Smoke &amp; Salt, in south Lonon). Combinations you would never have thought of \u2013 new potatoes with gorgonzola and beef heart \u2013 were awesome in the execution.

      "bodyText": "After just three months, the party that was supposed to be Britain\u2019s answer to Emmanuel Macron\u2019s Renaissance (formerly known as En Marche!) has split after taking just 3.4% of the vote in the EU elections. Six of Change UK\u2019s MPs, including the interim leader Heidi Allen and spokesperson Chuka Umunna, have left the party to sit as independents, with (highly plausible) rumours that they will go on to join the Lib Dems. It would be tempting to point out how this is a bit like Brian McFadden splitting from his own solo career after leaving Westlife. Or take cheap shots about how they\u2019re so crap that they\u2019ve rehabilitated the Lib Dems, like a political version of a frat-boy wingman deliberately making themselves look rubbish in order to let Vince Cable look \u201cbang-worthy\u201d. Or mock the fact that the new party is now called \u2013 and I\u2019m not even remotely kidding, Continuity Change UK \u2013 like a kids\u2019 rock band thinking it\u2019s cool to name themselves Hot Ice. But this split isn\u2019t anything to be happy or smug about. It\u2019s especially not a time for gloating from other parties. Laughing at Change UK from a position of being affiliated with another party at the moment is like a trouserless clown laughing at a second clown because their trousers fell down. Nobody is coming out of this looking dignified. Mocking a party that\u2019s already a fragment for fragmenting again isn\u2019t going to unfuck the dire political situation we\u2019re in. And the party that had more names than it did months, funny though that objectively is, did start from a position of principle. Whether you agree with it or not, their decision to leave both parties was a bold move, and you have to respect them at least a tiny bit for that. But it did sort of go downhill from there.

More importantly, there are crucial ICC Women\u2019s Championship points at stake: England need two more wins to achieve their goal of automatic qualification for the 2021 World Cup, while a clean sweep would mean they overtake the leaders, Australia. However West Indies \u2013 currently placed seventh in the Championship \u2013 will be keen to steal some points for themselves. The visitors are fresh from whitewashing Ireland 3-0 in a T20 series, with the opener, Hayley Matthews, in fine form, having hit an unbeaten century in the most recent of those encounters. \u201cThey\u2019re a team we know very well,\u201d Knight said. \u201cI\u2019ve played with Hayley at the Hobart Hurricanes and I\u2019ve also played with [the captain] Stafanie Taylor at Western Storm. I\u2019ve got to know how they work, identified potential weaknesses, but I guess the same works for those two in terms of my game. \u201c West Indies will be a big test so we\u2019ll need to be at our best, but we\u2019re confident about what we can bring to the table.\u201d",

They also claimed the US policy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/22/us-troop-increase-pentagon-middle-east-iran\">sending extra troops and an aircraft carrier</a> to the region had acted as a deterrent.</p> <p>Britain, at odds with Washington over how to handle Iran, acknowledges the US policy of applying maximum economic pressure is taking a huge toll on Iran and has pushed the country close to insolvency. Officials also said Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, had a mandate to determine whether the conditions for talks could be reached.</p> <p>But with Iran set to take further steps within a month to break out of the deal \u2013 known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/08/iran-nuclear-deal-what-is-it-why-does-trump-want-to-scrap-it\">Joint Comprehensive Plan for Action</a> - the UK remains nervous the two sides do not have long to reach an agreement on the terms for talks.

The stakes are now lethally high | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Iran is hoping that a two-day visit to Tehran next week by the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, will be the moment when messages from the US are delivered, setting out the terms for talks.</p> <p>The Iranian deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, this week welcomed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/27/donald-trump-welcomes-japans-offer-of-mediation-with-iran\">Japanese mediation</a>. \u201cUnfortunately tension is increasing and we hope that [the Japanese] prime minister\u2019s visit to Tehran would help to ease tensions in the region,\u201d he said. He added that, as a ally of Washington, Japan will probably be able to make the US understand the situation.</p> <p>Abe is scheduled to meet Iranian leaders, including the leader of the Islamic revolution, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2016/jan/15/legacy-iran-supreme-leader-ayatollah-khamanei\">Ayatollah</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2016/jan/15/legacy-iran-supreme-leader-ayatollah-khamanei\"> Ali Khamenei</a>, during his visit starting next Wednesday. Abe has met the president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, six times since he was appointed prime minister, and Japan, an energy importer, has not endorsed Trump\u2019s contentious move to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/06/donald-trump-us-jerusalem-israel-capital\">recognise </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/06/donald-trump-us-jerusalem-israel-capital\">Jerusalem as the capital of Israel</a>. Japan, however, has no history of mediation in the Middle East.</p> <p>Tehran will insist some US sanctions are lifted as a precondition for talks, and is willing to offer the release of a number of US political prisoners as a sign of goodwill. It is not clear if the terms would be enough for Trump to agree to hold talks. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said this week Washington <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/02/mike-pompeo-iran-nuclear-program-talks-no-pre-conditions\">was willing to talk without preconditions</a>. Within Iran, the issue of whether to seek talks or simply hold out until Trump is defeated in the presidential elections is a matter for open political debate.</p> <p>Trump himself has said on his trip that he is prepared to talk to Rouhani, but added \u201cthere\u2019s always a chance\u201d that the US would need to take military action. \u201cI\u2019d much rather talk,\u201d said Trump, in an interview with Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain, carried out on Tuesday evening. </p> <p>Plans for the US to put evidence to the UN security council setting out direct Iranian involvement in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/12/uae-four-merchant-ships-reported-sabotaged\">attack on four empty oil tankers</a> off the coast of the United Arab Emirates may be put on hold in a sign that the US is willing to lower the temperature and see if the offer of talks can be reciprocated.</p> <p>The national security adviser, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/17/john-bolton-iran-north-korea-venezuela-trump\">John Bolton</a>, this week raised the prospect of US officials putting the largely Mossad-sourced evidence of Iranian involvement in the tanker attacks to the security council. Bolton said the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps was \u201calmost certainly\u201d behind the attack on the shipping in Fujairah, and that he saw it as a warning shot for what the Iranians might do in extremis to damage oil shipping through the Straits of Hormuz. Iran denied any involvement in the attack.</p> <p>Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal a year ago, imposed sweeping sanctions on Iran, and since November has tried to impose a ban on all Iranian oil exports \u2013 the lifeblood of the country\u2019s economy, which normally exports 2.5m barrels a day, but is now down to 400,000. These export levels could bring the Iranian government close to insolvency. </p> <p>Europe, to Iran\u2019s fury, has proved incapable of protecting trade with Tehran in the face of the threat of US sanctions.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has told British officials he is not seeking a military confrontation with Iran and is instead aiming for direct talks with Tehran over his plan to negotiate and broaden the country\u2019s nuclear deal. Despite the assurances, British officials remain nervous the US president may have only 30 days before Iran takes irreversible steps to forgo the agreement. The assurance that Trump is not seeking war with Iran was made by US officials to British counterparts in talks surrounding the president\u2019s three-day state visit to the UK. They also claimed the US policy of sending extra troops and an aircraft carrier to the region had acted as a deterrent. Britain, at odds with Washington over how to handle Iran, acknowledges the US policy of applying maximum economic pressure is taking a huge toll on Iran and has pushed the country close to insolvency. Officials also said Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, had a mandate to determine whether the conditions for talks could be reached. But with Iran set to take further steps within a month to break out of the deal \u2013 known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan for Action - the UK remains nervous the two sides do not have long to reach an agreement on the terms for talks. Further actions by Tehran are likely to lead to a declaration by the International Atomic Energy Authority that Iran is not in compliance with the deal, ratcheting up tensions. Iran is hoping that a two-day visit to Tehran next week by the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, will be the moment when messages from the US are delivered, setting out the terms for talks. The Iranian deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, this week welcomed Japanese mediation. \u201cUnfortunately tension is increasing and we hope that [the Japanese] prime minister\u2019s visit to Tehran would help to ease tensions in the region,\u201d he said. He added that, as a ally of Washington, Japan will probably be able to make the US understand the situation. Abe is scheduled to meet Iranian leaders, including the leader of the Islamic revolution, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, during his visit starting next Wednesday. Abe has met the president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, six times since he was appointed prime minister, and Japan, an energy importer, has not endorsed Trump\u2019s contentious move to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Japan, however, has no history of mediation in the Middle East. Tehran will insist some US sanctions are lifted as a precondition for talks, and is willing to offer the release of a number of US political prisoners as a sign of goodwill. It is not clear if the terms would be enough for Trump to agree to hold talks. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said this week Washington was willing to talk without preconditions. Within Iran, the issue of whether to seek talks or simply hold out until Trump is defeated in the presidential elections is a matter for open political debate. Trump himself has said on his trip that he is prepared to talk to Rouhani, but added \u201cthere\u2019s always a chance\u201d that the US would need to take military action. \u201cI\u2019d much rather talk,\u201d said Trump, in an interview with Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain, carried out on Tuesday evening. Plans for the US to put evidence to the UN security council setting out direct Iranian involvement in an attack on four empty oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates may be put on hold in a sign that the US is willing to lower the temperature and see if the offer of talks can be reciprocated. The national security adviser, John Bolton, this week raised the prospect of US officials putting the largely Mossad-sourced evidence of Iranian involvement in the tanker attacks to the security council. Bolton said the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps was \u201calmost certainly\u201d behind the attack on the shipping in Fujairah, and that he saw it as a warning shot for what the Iranians might do in extremis to damage oil shipping through the Straits of Hormuz. Iran denied any involvement in the attack. Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal a year ago, imposed sweeping sanctions on Iran, and since November has tried to impose a ban on all Iranian oil exports \u2013 the lifeblood of the country\u2019s economy, which normally exports 2.5m barrels a day, but is now down to 400,000. These export levels could bring the Iranian government close to insolvency. Europe, to Iran\u2019s fury, has proved incapable of protecting trade with Tehran in the face of the threat of US sanctions. EU firms, especially those that trade in American dollars, have not been willing to risk US sanctions. China, India and Pakistan have not resumed oil imports, but the EU is taking the bulk of the diplomatic flak in Tehran for failing to stand up to the US. Iranians\u2019 hopes of waiting for the Democrats to be in charge are looking increasingly unviable. In turn, Washington may not want to try to jump-start talks in 2021 with a freshly elected Iranian hardliner. Meanwhile, British officials fear that if talks do not start soon, the threat of an Iranian-US conflict developing by accident could come from Yemen. Iran is increasingly backing Houthi rebels with sophisticated drones capable of attacking Saudi cities, shipping and territory. The Houthis are at war with Saudi Arabia over the kingdom\u2019s support for President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, a leader that the Houthis deem as a puppet of Riyadh. Britain has been privately urging the Saudis to reach a settlement in Yemen, fearing the rebels, increasingly dependent on Iran, will launch an attack on Saudi cities that could lead to a regional conflagration.",

A tremendous game of rugby league, as fast-paced, skilful and brutal as expected. Let\u2019s hope for more of the same when the circus rolls onto Perth for Game 2 on Sunday 23 June.

Game 1 of the 2019 Origin series, a game like no other. Early ascendency, territorial superiority and bragging rights are all up for grabs at Suncorp tonight as the Blues begin their quest to retain the shield for the first time since 2005.

Last year\u2019s series win by the Blues, coupled with the staggered loss of Queensland\u2019s experienced spine \u2013 Greg Inglis, Billy Slater, Cameron Smith, Johnathan Thurston or Cooper Cronk \u2013 has New South Wales awash with hope. </p> <p>Of course, hope is the source of all disappointment. Never mind, there\u2019s as much in evidence north of the border as there is to the south, given the exciting young things that will pull on a Maroons shirt tonight. </p> <p>It all makes for a tantalising prospect. Two young sides packed with fresh, pacy talent, who will go at each other from the off. On paper, it\u2019s too tight to call and it may well come down to which individuals deals with the occasion the better. </p> <p>Kick off is slated for 8:10pm AEST. So an actual start time of 8:22pm is my guess. Do stick around for that \u2013 plenty of talking points to address in the buildup too.

      "bodyText": "So, a big step towards reclaiming the Origin shield has been taken by Queensland tonight. And what a way to do it. They headed into the sheds at the break 8-0 down (even though they could easily have had three tries of their own), but a remarkable second-half recovery, led by the irrepressible tryscorer Dane Gagai, ensured Daly Cherry-Evans\u2019 debut as skipper ended in victory. A tremendous game of rugby league, as fast-paced, skilful and brutal as expected. Let\u2019s hope for more of the same when the circus rolls onto Perth for Game 2 on Sunday 23 June.

Half the job.\u201d Josh McGuire praises the officiating tonight. \u201cReferees put the whistle away I thought was good. I thought the referees let us test each ow other out. After that 20 minute mark I thought both teams slowed down. Few opportunities starting to arise for both teams.Come in at half-time not too much possession and missed opportunities. We are confident we score points. No better feeling than winning at home than in front of fans.\u201d Kalyn Ponga is speaking on Channel Nine: \u201cIt was an awesome game. First half was probably definitely the hardest footy I played. Then our boys in the second half were outstanding.We got the win. We were still positive [at half-time]. Created three opportunities to score. Couple of disallowed tries. We knew we were in the game. We weren\u2019t behind or anything at all. We weren\u2019t in front. We came out in the second half and gave it to them.\u201d Phew. Hectic stuff towards the end there. I\u2019ll catch my breath and some final thoughts to follow shortly. And two-try Maroon hero Dane Gagai: \u201cLike I always say it\u2019s off the back of hard work and effort from the boys. There was a set there where it was going back and forward. We managed to lock them in. The boys was a massive set and they ended up kicking out of 20 or 30. It makes my job easier when I\u2019m catching around 40 and 50.\u201d Gracious words from Damian Cook: \u201cIt\u2019s always special up here. As a new South Welshman you love coming up here. They make it extra hard. Great turn out. State of Origin is the best game. Great turn out and great footy. Would have been nice to get the win.\u201d What a game! Something of an instant classic. Here\u2019s Cameron Munster: \u201cKnew it was going to be hard physical game. We knew we had to grind the 08 minutes there and keep the ball in play. Play to the game plan. Did that in the second half. It was frustrating at times. I knew I was. Remained a couple of line breaks there. Didn\u2019t do the icing on the cake. We knew if we kept to gameplan in the second half we scored points we showed that tonight.\u201d 80 min: Last play for the Blues, but Cotric can\u2019t get on the end of the kick and the ball runs out of play! All over and the Maroons draw first blood! 78 min: It opens up for Mitchell and he bullocks his way towards the line as Ponga bounces off him, but hasn\u2019t quite got the momentum to get past the remaining Maroons defenders! This is going right down to the wire. 77 min: Gagai earns his crust (if he hadn\u2019t already) by taking a high, swirling bomb in his own half, under pressure from a posse of blue shirts. Excellent, and important, catch. 76 min: The conversion is taken quickly by Cleary and it\u2019s good. Surely not.... 75 min: Hang on! Trbojevic scores for the Blues as barges over from close range! And the game is back on! 74 min: It\u2019s going to have to be a comeback for the ages now for NSW. Frizell barrels his way to within a metre or so from the Maroons line, but they\u2019ve got him wrapped up. 72 min: Ponga gets it this time and the hosts have opened up a 10-point lead with less than 10 minutes remaining. 71 min: Gagai! He squeezes in at the corner and there\u2019s nothing Mitchell can do to stop it. It\u2019s given the green light and you\u2019d think the Maroons are home and dry now. It stemmed from a brilliant pass by Ponga, but there was still a lot to do by Gagai. That\u2019s his 11th in 11 Origin games. Incredible. 70 min: Oh dear it\u2019s all going wrong for NSW now. Tedesco loses the ball and the Maroons pick it up less than 10m out. 68 min: Ponga\u2019s off target with the conversion and the lead is just four points. But the momentum is very much with the Maroons. 67 min: Intercepted by Gagai, right on his own try line! He sprints all the way to the other end of the pitch and gleefully touches down! He just telegraphed that one from Jack Wighton! Nothing less than the Maroons deserve to be honest. 64 min: The Maroons look in control of the game now. They get another set of six, 20m out, but the Blues get a lucky deflection and the ball lands neatly in Addo-Carr\u2019s grateful arms. The pressure valve is turned slightly. 62 min: Queensland charge forward and twice keep the move going with passes from first Ponga and then DCE when they were in the clutches of opponents. Hunt ends up with the ball but he can\u2019t weave any magic this time. 61 min: Cotric has hit the turf and seems to be in some pain. It\u2019s his knee that\u2019s bothering him. At least everyone gets a chance to take a breath as he\u2019s seen to by the medics. 60 min: An hour gone, and it\u2019s Queensland who are in the ascendency now. They\u2019ve just evened the ledger and are a man up for the next 10 minutes. NSW are under the pump. 59 min: Ponga opts to take the penalty goal. He nails it and we\u2019re all square in Brisbane. 58 min: No penalty try is the call, much to the disappointment of the massed ranks of Queenslanders in the stands. The ref\u2019s call was that he couldn\u2019t be sure Gillett would have scored a try. The locals\u2019 mood is improved moments later though as Mitchell is dispatched to the sin bin for 10 minutes, for a professional foul. 58 min: Massive chance for the Maroons as Gillett is impeded by Tedesco and Mitchell as he tries to run onto a kick into the Blues\u2019 in-goal. And there may be a penalty try though for interference on Gillett. 58 min: The crowd appear to be going nuts and the Maroons will look to ride that wave of fervour now. 57 min: Confirmed, no try. More impressive, last-ditch defending by the Blues. But they\u2019re under the cosh here. 56 min: Queensland look dangerous at the moment. Morgan surges over the line but it looks like the Blues have managed to keep him on his back, turtle-like, and hold the ball up. Still, they\u2019ll have a look at it. 55 min: A silly penalty to give away by Payne Haas here. Absolutely no need for him to shove the Maroons player to the ground as he\u2019s trying to play the ball. 52,191 is the crowd here tonight, by the way. 54 min: Ponga takes his head gear off, as is his way, before setting himself for the kick. It\u2019s tight, but the ball comes back just enough, before scraping the post and going through! 53 min: Oates does score this time! It\u2019s a carbon copy try of the disallowed effort in the first half \u2013 a huge Superman-like leap in the corner, and this time the foot he boosts off remains in play before he touches down. Spectacular stuff from Oates and the locals like that one! 51 min: \u201cI feel good,\u201d says coach Fittler. \u201cDefence first 10 minutes looked solid. We haven\u2019t stopped playing. Be good if we got in better position come out of trouble. We had that good ball down the other end and one several coming off our own line. That\u2019s disappointing.\u201d 49 min: Young Fifita is on, and here he is making some key tackles close to the NSW goal line. That\u2019ll give him some confidence. 47 min: Ponga sweeps up in his own in-goal, dancing out of trouble before he\u2019s grounded by a posse of hungry Blues. 46 min: Quick word on the forgotten aspect of Origin \u2013 the biffo. In short, there\u2019s been absolutely none. Plenty of big hits and hard tackling, but no aggro at all. 44 min: Here\u2019s a bit more on the anthem boycott from earlier. 43 min: Ponga makes a hash of a high ball \u2013 he falls over and spills the ball. Not an auspicious start to the second period for the youngster. 42 min: On the way out of the sheds, Queensland coach Kevin Walters said his side need to tighten up their defence. \u201cMissed about 26 tackles. That\u2019s not where we needed to be. But we\u2019re creating good opportunities with our attack. That\u2019s moving nicely. Got to fix up tighten up our defence a bit. Get that right in the second half. It will create opportunities with our attack. We have to keep believing. Great test in the second half. I 100% believe we\u2019ll get the job done.\u201d 41 min: Mitchell, who was probably the most underwhelming player during that electric first half, gets us back underway for the second half. Ponga tries to catch his breath and talk at the same time on his way off the field. He\u2019s struggling to do both, to be honest. \u201cWe created opportunities,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to execute them. We\u2019re creative. We should execute them.\u201d Tedesco: \u201cJust around the ruck our forwards getting tired. Working around that middle. Create some havoc.\u201d 40 min: And that will be that for the half. What a breathless half of Origin football. Plenty to enjoy there. And the Blues head in with an all-important lead. 39 min: Munster makes some metres with a jinking run and the pressure on the NSW defence increases. But they do enough to hold out and the Maroons run out of tackles. 38 min: Two minutes left in the half and that could prove to be a costly penalty by Mitchell. Queensland will look to finally get on the scoreboard in the dying moments of this half. They\u2019re 5m out from the try line... 37 min: Addo-Carr leaps into the night sky and makes a crucial interception. Any misjudgement there and Ponga\u2019s pass would have surely resulted in a try for Queensland. 35 min: This is set up very nicely now. The home side, spurred on by a partisan crowd, chasing the game a bit. 33 min: There might have been a time, in the not-so-distant past when NSW would be three tries down here. But their last-ditch defending is much improved - it\u2019s almost like they believe in themselves in the cauldron of Suncorp. 31 min: Another chance goes begging for the Maroons, after some brilliant work by Munster. He offloads to Chambers who is closed down by Tedesco and when he tries to flick the ball back to somebody, anybody, there\u2019s no Maroons teammates there to help out. 30 min: That\u2019s a let-off for the Blues, and you wonder how the Maroons will respond to that disappointment \u2013 their players were convinced they\u2019d scored and were all back on the halfway line when the verdict was delivered. 29 min: The Maroons get on the scoreboard as they take full advantage of a kick that strikes the post and bounces back! No Blues player can get on it and amid the confusion, Napa gets there to touch down with his forearms! But wait. They\u2019re having a very good look at it. NO TRY! He didn\u2019t have control of the ball! Big call to make. But probably the right one, after much video scrutiny. 29 min: Ponga\u2019s ability to change direction in a heartbeat is truly incredible. Mitchell doesn\u2019t fall for it this time though and he makes a key tackle. 28 min: Hunt opts against the kick at goal, and plays the ball. Another penalty to the Maroons follows as Walker is pulled up for a second pop at Oates. Still they opt against the kick. 27 min: But here go Queensland. End to end stuff at Suncorp. Ponga high-steps as he looks to find a way through. And we\u2019re all given some respite as the Maroons win a penalty. Phew. 26 min: Oh, brilliant stuff from Cook, who breaks clear before passing out of the back of his hand! Kafusi makes a try-saving tackle! 23 min: The pace has been relentless this half. Even more so than usual in an Origin game? It seems that way. NSW are on top here, no doubt. Here goes Tedesco again, who opts not to pass out wide; he runs into traffic inside instead. 21 min: Cleary, from a wide angle, bends it through the posts! Cracking kick from the youngster! NSW have an eight-point lead in Brisbane. 20 min: Morris barges over the line for the first try of the game, but it\u2019s all about Tedesco again, who shimmies his way through the challenge of Munster before offloading to Morris, who just has to use his momentum to get over! 19 min: Munster grounds the ball in Queensland\u2019s in-goal under pressure from Tedesco who races onto Cook\u2019s grubber through. They\u2019re having a second look at this as there is doubt whether Munster does indeed get his hand to the ball. Replays show he does - eventually. That was a close one, but the Maroons got away with it. 18 min: So, the good news is that there was no doubt about that try being ruled out. Oates\u2019 boot was clearly out of play. The bad news for Maroons fans is that NSW are on the attack again. 17 min: Decibel levels spike as Oates takes to the air and touches down in the corner, following a thrilling attacking move, which saw the ball cross the entire width of the field. The crowd love it \u2013 but not for long, as it\u2019s ruled out. Oates\u2019 foot went out of play! 15 min: Addo-Carr hoons off on another return, stretching those lengthy legs of his. Moments later Cook makes a break through the first line of Maroon defence. This is frenetic stuff. 13 min: Points on the board! Queensland give away a penalty and Cleary takes the chance to have a kick at goal. He nails it and the Blues have an early lead. 12 min: NSW are 20m out. Klemmer barges forward and the visitors are now less than 10 from the Maroons\u2019 tryline. 11 min: Queensland are pulled back after Gagai gets a hand to a Mitchell flicked pass. He races after the ball but it\u2019s a knock-on. 10 min: A quarter of the way through the first half, and Tedesco does what he does best \u2013 jinking inside and out, swivelling those hips as he gets away from a Maroon challenge. 9 min: As expected, this is being played at a rip-roaring pace. Plenty to enjoy so far. Here goes Cotric, with a powerful run for the Blues. 7 min: Nice play from Tedesco, who offloads to Morris. NSW are looking good here. Cleary now dinks the ball through hoping Tedesco can sprint onto it, but it bounces out of play just before the Roosters star can reach it. Blues danger abounds. 6 min: Ponga picks up a grubber played through towards the try line and is immediately hit high. He rides it though and is up on his feet before too long. 4 min: Oof. Ponga gets hit hard and then Frizell delivers a late shot. NSW win the ball back and now they finally get over halfway. Klemmer shows all his size and strength to carry the ball further upfield. 3 min: Cordner gets hit after playing the ball, but he\u2019s up and running again soon enough. Papalii has a run before Gillett does likewise. Tedesco takes a high ball soon after and the Blues will try to get out of their own half once again \u2013 something they haven\u2019t managed so far. 2 min: \u201cQueenslander, Queenslander\u201d is the roar from the crowd as they take the ball for the first time. Munster boots high and deep at the end of the set and NSW will come again. 1 min: And we\u2019re off! Queensland get the game underway, and Klemmer has his first battering ram-like run of the night. An acknowledgement of country from JT precedes the anthem sung by Lucy Maunder. More than a few players joining Walker et al in not singing it. Cheers from the crowd follow the completion of it. And we\u2019re nearly ready to get going. Here come the players. Out come the Blues, to a predictable reception from the hospitable Queenslanders. Impossible to imagine what they\u2019re feeling at this point. And here come the Maroons, led by DCE as the Blues line up and link arms. Anthem to come. And here\u2019s Kevin Walters, Fittler\u2019s counterpart, who\u2019s being drowned out a bit by his players running through a few drills in the background. \u201cOpening 10 minutes, certainly [is the most important thing for Queensland tonight]. Just to get out of the blocks really nicely. How we want to play. That is being nice and aggressive with our defence and completing our sets. Getting through our sets. Defensively we have got to be really strong tonight and that is a big part of it as well. I\u2019ve said it all week, I\u2019m really excited about these 17 Queensland players. As a group, they\u2019ve worked together beautifully and tonight, we get a chance to see all of their work that they have done throughout the week.\u201d Here\u2019s NSW coach Brad Fittler, speaking on Channel Nine: \u201cI definitely feel alive at the moment. It is great watching the boys warming up. Sitting amongst the coaches. The heart is racing. I wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere else. I think what we did last year gives us a lot of confidence. Watching them how they handled training. It feels like we are better than we were last year.I can\u2019t see us not doing a good job. If we were to get beat, Queensland will have to do a hell of a job. I think we have got to be aggressors early. We spoke about that. So they are very important that. So they are very important that we get off to a good start.\u201d Twenty minutes to go. A final chance to have a read of Larissa O\u2019Connor\u2019s match preview. To think that only 34 points separate the two teams over 37 Origin series shows just how close this contest has been over time and gives reason to why this epic state battle eclipses any national representative match in popularity and number of TV eyeballs. The stage is set at Suncorp Stadium, league\u2019s most intimidating and stirring amphitheatre, and it may be that the location might just prove the difference. Some music. And it\u2019s Briggs! Decent showing from the hiphop star. Meanwhile, stats: AFP raids on the ABC. Is nothing sacred anymore? There are fears tonight\u2019s game will be missed by ABC staff stuck in a room looking at computer files with the feds. Disturbing on many levels. Cody Walker is one of those making his Origin debut tonight, although his story is perhaps more inspirational than most. Asked why he didn\u2019t make his NRL debut until the ripe old age of 26, he says: \u201cI didn\u2019t have everything it takes to be an NRL footballer. Didn\u2019t like to turn up to training. Didn\u2019t like diet. I didn\u2019t want to be a footballer away from footy. It wasn\u2019t until my missus got pregnant, it just sort of clicked mind into gear that I really needed to do something. I sort of grew up in that split-second and I had to. I had no other choice. I had to build my reputation up to be, you know, a good trainer. One that had a good work ethic, one that made changes within his diet. All of those sort of things. It took me a little while to get there. But I didn\u2019t want to give up so early because if I\u2019m teaching my kids to chase their dream, how can I tell them to chase their dream if I didn\u2019t do everything possible to chase mine.\u201d The national anthem. It\u2019s been one of the biggest talking points since last week\u2019s announcement by Cody Walker that he will remain silent during tonight\u2019s pre-match rendition of Advance Australia Fair. Walker will be joined by Josh Addo-Carr, Latrell Mitchell and Will Chambers in their boycott and while the issue has split the rugby league community (judging by social media reaction over the past week), there\u2019s has been nothing but support from within the respective Origin camps. \u201cRespect\u201d has been the buzz word from players and coaches alike; we\u2019ll soon find out if that respect has filtered through to the Suncorp crowd. Here\u2019s Jack Latimore if anyone still needs things explaining: One of the players who\u2019s getting Maroon juices flowing is Kalyn Ponga, who starts for Queensland \u2013 and fills Billy Slater\u2019s shoes, not that he wants to do that. \u201cI want to make my own, that is how I\u2019m going to go about it. I\u2019m excited to see and feel just how enormous that crowd is going to be. I played last year and it was obviously a bit more blue jerseys, but hopefully we will have more Maroons this year. I don\u2019t want to let anyone down. The boys are out there, the family, coaches, just anyone that\u2019s had any bit of me being here, I want to do them proud and give it my all.\u201d Earlier, the young Queenslanders won the Under-18s game. A good omen? Evans above. Apologies for that, but Daly Cherry-Evans\u2019 ascension to the captaincy of Queensland has been nothing short of miraculous. Here is the man who will lead out the Maroons tonight: \u201cIt\u2019s a special occasion for me and the family, so I\u2019m looking forward to it. I daresay they\u2019d be pretty proud.\u201d When asked about what\u2019s important tonight, he says: \u201cNot necessarily the captaincy, it\u2019s the number on my back, No 7. That direction from me is going to be important for the side tonight. Everyone\u2019s going to get a little bit nervous at some stage but when we\u2019re out there, we have got to trust that we\u2019ve prepared well and this is what we\u2019re here for. We\u2019re here to put on a performance and we have trained really well an put ourselves in a position to do that.\u201d And here\u2019s Larissa O\u2019Connor on DCE: Sex, lies and video. It\u2019s been a rather strange buildup to tonight\u2019s opener. Indeed, a buildup \u201clike no other\u201d, the TV has just said. I\u2019ve got to be careful what I say here, but one of the more bizarre moments (in a pretty competitive field) came with the leaked sex tape allegedly featuring a NSW player, who wasn\u2019t the player at all. The mind boggles how NSW officials came to the conclusion it wasn\u2019t, given the alleged star of the video reportedly didn\u2019t show his face. Anyway, it certainly did come at a curious time. Very odd. And we haven\u2019t even started about the motivational gurus. The teams. A reminder that Queensland have named three debutants, NSW five. Queensland: Kalyn Ponga, Corey Oates, Will Chambers, Michael Morgan, Dane Gagai, Cameron Munster, Daly Cherry-Evans, Jai Arrow, Ben Hunt, Josh Papalii, Felise Kaufusi, Matt Gillett, Josh McGuire. Interchange: Moses Mbye, Dylan Napa, Joe Ofahengaue, David Fifita. NSW: James Tedesco, Nick Cotric, Latrell Mitchell, Josh Morris, Josh Addo-Carr, Cody Walker, Nathan Cleary, David Klemmer, Damien Cook, Paul Vaughan, Boyd Cordner, Tyson Frizell, Jake Trbojevic. Interchange: Jack Wighton, Payne Haas, Cameron Murray, Angus Crichton. Here we go then. Game 1 of the 2019 Origin series, a game like no other. Early ascendency, territorial superiority and bragging rights are all up for grabs at Suncorp tonight as the Blues begin their quest to retain the shield for the first time since 2005. In that time, the Maroons have managed to defend their crown nine times, a stat that highlights a seriously maroon-tinged dominance over recent history. But is that all changing? Last year\u2019s series win by the Blues, coupled with the staggered loss of Queensland\u2019s experienced spine \u2013 Greg Inglis, Billy Slater, Cameron Smith, Johnathan Thurston or Cooper Cronk \u2013 has New South Wales awash with hope. Of course, hope is the source of all disappointment. Never mind, there\u2019s as much in evidence north of the border as there is to the south, given the exciting young things that will pull on a Maroons shirt tonight. It all makes for a tantalising prospect. Two young sides packed with fresh, pacy talent, who will go at each other from the off. On paper, it\u2019s too tight to call and it may well come down to which individuals deals with the occasion the better. Kick off is slated for 8:10pm AEST. So an actual start time of 8:22pm is my guess. Do stick around for that \u2013 plenty of talking points to address in the buildup too. And feel free to get in touch on email (mike.hytner@theguardian.com) or on Twitter (@mike_hytner) in the meantime.",

      "body": "<p>When a small boy dashed into the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester shouting \u201cDad, Dad, they\u2019ve got a Man City plane!\u201d, he summed up the gift Richard Hills, who has died aged 82, bequeathed to the city.</p> <p>The 1920s Avro Avian, painted by chance in the same pale blue as the football team\u2019s strip, is one of a hoard of mechanical marvels that the museum\u2019s first curator amassed with unflagging skill and enthusiasm. \u201cIf we can\u2019t sell it, give it to Dr Hills,\u201d became a standard line for modernising businesses \u2013 including this newspaper \u2013 faced with the question of what to do with redundant machinery. Although primarily an academic and teacher, Hills \u2013 as founding director of the museum from 1968 \u2013 became Britain\u2019s expert on where to find space for historically vital but temporarily unloved leviathans, gifting Manchester knowledge mixed with fun.</p> <p>Patient and meticulous, he also tracked down archives telling the story of the world\u2019s first industrial city and found display room for humble components, pins or spanners, that had played their part.</p> <p>But his heart was in exhibits that actually worked, engines puffing, looms weaving. An infectious networker, he brought home a Manchester-built locomotive from the Isle of Man in 1975 with the help of a cousin who was a member of the House of Keys; he later flew to South Africa to secure a 120-ton Beyer-Garratt locomotive, dating from 1929, one of the 1,116 built in Gorton, the industrial quarter of Manchester. He arranged the engine\u2019s passage just in time on a boat that had been due to carry oranges.</p> <p>Hills was born in Lewisham, south-east London, where his father, Leslie, was an Anglican vicar, but spent his childhood in the care of an aunt in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, after his mother, Peggy, died of cancer when he was two.

      "bodyText": "When a small boy dashed into the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester shouting \u201cDad, Dad, they\u2019ve got a Man City plane!\u201d, he summed up the gift Richard Hills, who has died aged 82, bequeathed to the city. The 1920s Avro Avian, painted by chance in the same pale blue as the football team\u2019s strip, is one of a hoard of mechanical marvels that the museum\u2019s first curator amassed with unflagging skill and enthusiasm. \u201cIf we can\u2019t sell it, give it to Dr Hills,\u201d became a standard line for modernising businesses \u2013 including this newspaper \u2013 faced with the question of what to do with redundant machinery. Although primarily an academic and teacher, Hills \u2013 as founding director of the museum from 1968 \u2013 became Britain\u2019s expert on where to find space for historically vital but temporarily unloved leviathans, gifting Manchester knowledge mixed with fun. Patient and meticulous, he also tracked down archives telling the story of the world\u2019s first industrial city and found display room for humble components, pins or spanners, that had played their part. But his heart was in exhibits that actually worked, engines puffing, looms weaving. An infectious networker, he brought home a Manchester-built locomotive from the Isle of Man in 1975 with the help of a cousin who was a member of the House of Keys; he later flew to South Africa to secure a 120-ton Beyer-Garratt locomotive, dating from 1929, one of the 1,116 built in Gorton, the industrial quarter of Manchester. He arranged the engine\u2019s passage just in time on a boat that had been due to carry oranges. Hills was born in Lewisham, south-east London, where his father, Leslie, was an Anglican vicar, but spent his childhood in the care of an aunt in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, after his mother, Peggy, died of cancer when he was two. His maternal grandfather, Sir John Ontario Miller, had been orphaned at the age of six but rose to high office in Indian civil service. Hills, whose father was posted as a military chaplain throughout the second world war, showed similar resolution. He boarded at Charterhouse school, in Surrey, read history at Queens\u2019 College, Cambridge and served as a lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on national service from 1955 until 1957. He started training as a teacher at Cambridge but nearly lost a leg in a rock fall while leading an Outward Bound party on Great Gable, in the Lake District. He returned to teaching after bone and skin grafts and a year\u2019s convalescence. After stints at schools including Worcester College for the Blind (now New College Worcester), he took a diploma in the history of science and technology at Imperial College, London, which led to the first of his 15 books, Machines, Mills and Uncountable Costly Necessities (1967), a history of the drainage of the Fens. In the meanwhile, he developed a passion for rebuilding ancient machinery, which had started at school with work on a steam model of Robert Stephenson\u2019s locomotive Invicta. Hills\u2019 personal transport followed a similar course: he graduated from a vintage motorbike through various old Alvis cars to a 1924 Lancia Lambda which he repaired, maintained and ran for 52 years. His talents were spotted in 1965 by Prof Donald Cardwell, head of the history of science department at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist), who was keen to realise the dream of a grand industrial museum, an idea first proposed in Manchester in 1834. Hills was given a research post in the department and tasked with helping set up what was originally called the North Western Museum of Science and Industry. Over the next 20 years, Cardwell, Hills and the museum\u2019s dauntless chief technician, Frank Wightman, made this happen beyond anyone\u2019s most optimistic hopes.

When the museum\u2019s cat had to be removed from a mural at Oddfellows Hall because its presence was thought frivolous, it was only lightly painted over and became known as the \u201cghost cat\u201d. Hills\u2019 unflagging work, documented in his history of the museum in the digital collection at Chetham\u2019s library, eventually took its toll, and in 1983, with the move to Liverpool Road secured, he retired as director.

Trump replied: \u201cYou could handle it no question.\u201d</p> \n<p>Former Royal Marine Jack Smith, 94, a landing craft coxswain who was part of the first wave during D-day, enjoyed a chat with the Queen. \u201cIt means an awful lot to be here, the day respects everybody who took part in D-day,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people did a lot of good work that day, it respects their memory and the lads that didn\u2019t come back.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8066597bacf65cbc95759cf18233ba5f411e662e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8066597bacf65cbc95759cf18233ba5f411e662e/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People wave union flags on Southsea Common in Portsmouth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wave union flags on Southsea Common.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump wished happy birthday to Joan \u201cJonni\u201d Berfield, a Wren who worked as a coder and will be celebrating her 95th birthday on 7 June.

The Ministry of Defence said more than 4,000 personnel were involved in the commemorations, one of the biggest mobilisations of the UK\u2019s armed forces in recent years.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9604ad5d-dd6d-48e3-9c58-d20deebbcb08\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What was D-day?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>D-day was an invasion of France by allied forces. It was codenamed Operation Neptune, and it aimed to push Nazi Germany out of occupied France. Five beaches in Normandy, codenamed Omaha, Utah, Juno, Sword and Gold, were the main targets for landing a large number of troops by sea.</p>\n    <p>At 10pm on 5 June 1944, troops began departing from British shores to head across the Channel. Five assault groups set sail under darkness in an armada of about 7,000 vessels. Just after midnight on 6 June, aerial bombardment of enemy positions on the Normandy coast began. Special operations troops were also parachuted into France.</p>\n    <p>US troops landed on Omaha and Utah beaches at about 6:30am. About an hour later Canadian forces landed at Juno, and British troops landed at Gold and Sword. Soldiers had to get off their boats, wade through the water, and seize control of the beach, all the while under heavy and sustained fire from German defensive positions.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How was the plan kept secret?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Despite involving a large number of troops, keeping D-day secret was vital to the success of the operation. A disinformation campaign had led the Germans to believe that Operation Fortitude was the main plan for the allies to invade the continent, via a two-pronged attack involving Norway and Calais. Even once the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/d-day\">D-day</a>&nbsp;landings had begun, German commanders were convinced they were just a diversionary tactic before the real invasion.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is it called D-day?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The D in D-day actually has no particular significance to Operation Neptune. It was common practice in the military to make plans that used the term, where the D stands for the day when operations commenced. Military planners also set H-hour, the time at which a plan was to begin.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What happened next?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>By the end of the day, the allies had disembarked more than 135,000 men and 10,000 vehicles on to the beaches, and established bridgeheads of varying depths along the Normandy coastline. This came at the cost of 4,400 allied troops being killed, with thousands more injured or missing. There were also heavy casualties among German troops and French civilians.</p>\n    <p>By 19 August, the allied forces had pushed down far enough to begin the battle to liberate Paris. German troops surrendered the French capital on 25 August 1944, two and a half months after D-day.</p>\n    <p><b>Martin Belam</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Miles of fencing, roadblocks and checkpoints were in place in Portsmouth, one of the major embarkation points on D-day, and residents of nearby flats were told not to aim long-lens cameras at Southsea Common or fly drones over the site. The day was alive with the clatter of helicopters and the roar of police outriders bringing dignitaries in and out.</p> \n<p>At the commemoration event on the common, the Queen said the fate of the world had depended on the success of the operation. \u201cThe heroism, courage and sacrifice of those who lost their lives will never be forgotten,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is with humility and pleasure on behalf of the entire country, indeed the whole free world, that I say to you all \u2013 thank you.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47b289bd414e18f336338e5ff081942263939fe3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47b289bd414e18f336338e5ff081942263939fe3/0_51_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump with a member of the armed forces at D-day commemorations\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump and the leaders of 15 other countries signed a proclamation to mark the anniversary.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One of the most emotional moments came when Theresa May read a letter from Capt Norman Skinner of the Royal Army Service Corps, written to his wife, Gladys, on 3 June 1944. The letter was still in his pocket when he landed on Sword Beach on 6 June. Skinner was killed the day after, leaving his wife and two young daughters.</p> \n<p>The letter read: \u201cAlthough I would give anything to be back with you, I have not yet had any wish at all to back down from the job we have to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, thanked the veterans on behalf of his nation before reading another final letter, that of Henri Fertet, a resistance fighter executed aged 16. \u201cThe soldiers are coming to get me. I must hurry. My handwriting may look wobbly, but it is just because I am using a small pencil. I am not afraid of death, my conscience is completely clear \u2026 A thousand kisses. Long live France,\u201d he wrote.</p> \n<p>There had been grumbles from some locals who felt excluded because of the huge security operation, but there was a festival atmosphere in the public viewing area where visitors watched the ceremony on giant screens.</p> \n<p>People brought deckchairs and picnics, and there were burger stands, beer tents and stalls selling everything from souvenir mugs to fridge magnets and tea towels.</p> \n<p>Sally Pattenden, 42, from Southsea, said the day made her proud to be British and that she didn\u2019t mind the minor inconveniences caused by the security operation.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have had lots of warnings. We couldn\u2019t park anywhere for a while, but I think you get into the spirit of it. It is about the veterans. If you can\u2019t give up your parking space for someone who gave their life, what can you do?\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2eb2f310ce261dfc794fc996aefe5ed513435df7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eb2f310ce261dfc794fc996aefe5ed513435df7/141_102_3389_2034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The MV Boudicca with D-day veterans onboard arrives in Poole, Dorset\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The MV Boudicca with D-day veterans onboard arrives in Poole, Dorset.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Politics occasionally reared its head. Sandra Tonge, who was with her husband Anthony, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a cliche but we really all could be speaking German now for all we know if it wasn\u2019t for the men we were remembering today.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou come away from something like this with a different feeling. I felt that a bit more enthusiastic about Brexit for example.\u201d</p> \n<p>Before the Southsea Common event, the 16 nations involved in the commemorations agreed a proclamation to mark the anniversary.

      "bodyText": "There were concerns ahead of the UK\u2019s official D-day commemoration that the presence of Donald Trump and the circus that surrounds him would overshadow the most important people \u2013 the veterans and their families. The worries were unfounded. At every point of a very long and emotional day the amazing stories and spirit of the 300 or so ageing veterans at the event in Portsmouth \u2013 and memories of those who did not make it back 75 years ago \u2013 took centre stage. Men such as John Jenkins, 99, from Portsmouth, a platoon sergeant with the Royal Pioneer Corps on D-day, stole the show. Like many of his comrades, he said his lasting memories were of fear. \u201cI was terrified, I think everyone was,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t show it, but it was there.\u201d He also said what happened was a big part of the man he became. \u201cI look back on it as a big part of my life. It changed me in a way. I was a small part in a big machine. You never forget your comrades, because we were all in it together. We must never forget.\u201d Video recordings were played during the official commemoration event on Southsea Common of other men who were at D-day. Bob Roberts, a Canadian veteran, recalled the moment he and his colleagues were told they were about to be given live ammunition. \u201cThat was the first we knew we were in action. I thought \u2018My God, I was never brought up to be killing people\u2019. There were so many cases where I could have lost my life. I don\u2019t know how I survived.\u201d After the commemorations on the common, the Queen, Trump and his wife, Melania, met veterans at a reception. Thomas Cuthbert, a 93-year-old, who was in a landing barge oiler anchored off Utah and Omaha beaches, jokingly told the US president: \u201cIf only I was 20 years younger\u201d while pointing at the First Lady. Trump replied: \u201cYou could handle it no question.\u201d Former Royal Marine Jack Smith, 94, a landing craft coxswain who was part of the first wave during D-day, enjoyed a chat with the Queen. \u201cIt means an awful lot to be here, the day respects everybody who took part in D-day,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people did a lot of good work that day, it respects their memory and the lads that didn\u2019t come back.\u201d Trump wished happy birthday to Joan \u201cJonni\u201d Berfield, a Wren who worked as a coder and will be celebrating her 95th birthday on 7 June. She said: \u201cI think I will wake up and find it\u2019s all a dream. It\u2019s been a fantastic day, I\u2019m just overwhelmed by everything.\u201d The event was vast. The Ministry of Defence said more than 4,000 personnel were involved in the commemorations, one of the biggest mobilisations of the UK\u2019s armed forces in recent years. Miles of fencing, roadblocks and checkpoints were in place in Portsmouth, one of the major embarkation points on D-day, and residents of nearby flats were told not to aim long-lens cameras at Southsea Common or fly drones over the site. The day was alive with the clatter of helicopters and the roar of police outriders bringing dignitaries in and out. At the commemoration event on the common, the Queen said the fate of the world had depended on the success of the operation. \u201cThe heroism, courage and sacrifice of those who lost their lives will never be forgotten,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is with humility and pleasure on behalf of the entire country, indeed the whole free world, that I say to you all \u2013 thank you.\u201d One of the most emotional moments came when Theresa May read a letter from Capt Norman Skinner of the Royal Army Service Corps, written to his wife, Gladys, on 3 June 1944. The letter was still in his pocket when he landed on Sword Beach on 6 June. Skinner was killed the day after, leaving his wife and two young daughters. The letter read: \u201cAlthough I would give anything to be back with you, I have not yet had any wish at all to back down from the job we have to do.\u201d The French president, Emmanuel Macron, thanked the veterans on behalf of his nation before reading another final letter, that of Henri Fertet, a resistance fighter executed aged 16. \u201cThe soldiers are coming to get me. I must hurry. My handwriting may look wobbly, but it is just because I am using a small pencil. I am not afraid of death, my conscience is completely clear \u2026 A thousand kisses. Long live France,\u201d he wrote. There had been grumbles from some locals who felt excluded because of the huge security operation, but there was a festival atmosphere in the public viewing area where visitors watched the ceremony on giant screens. People brought deckchairs and picnics, and there were burger stands, beer tents and stalls selling everything from souvenir mugs to fridge magnets and tea towels. Sally Pattenden, 42, from Southsea, said the day made her proud to be British and that she didn\u2019t mind the minor inconveniences caused by the security operation. \u201cWe have had lots of warnings. We couldn\u2019t park anywhere for a while, but I think you get into the spirit of it. It is about the veterans. If you can\u2019t give up your parking space for someone who gave their life, what can you do?\u201d Politics occasionally reared its head. Sandra Tonge, who was with her husband Anthony, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a cliche but we really all could be speaking German now for all we know if it wasn\u2019t for the men we were remembering today. \u201cYou come away from something like this with a different feeling. I felt that a bit more enthusiastic about Brexit for example.\u201d Before the Southsea Common event, the 16 nations involved in the commemorations agreed a proclamation to mark the anniversary. The statement recognises the sacrifice of those who took part in the second world war and salutes the surviving D-day veterans. The 16 countries undertake to work together to find common ground and recommit to the shared values of democracy, tolerance and the rule of law. After the reception with veterans, the world leaders present met to discuss Nato and security. They were then whisked away by helicopter and motor cavalcade while many of the veterans took to the water on board a cruise ship to be ferried across to France accompanied by a flotilla of naval vessels. For them, the D-day commemorations will continue in Normandy on Thursday.",

      "bodyText": "Women born in the 1950s whose retirement age was increased from 60 to 65 have gone to court seeking a judicial review of how the government raised the retirement age and to try to force the government to repay their lost pensions. Nearly 4 million women have been forced to wait up to an extra six years to get their pensions after changes to bring women\u2019s retirement age into line with men\u2019s. Two claimants have now taken the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to court, arguing that raising their pension age \u201cunlawfully discriminated against them on the grounds of age, sex, and age and sex combined\u201d. On the first day of the landmark legal case on Wednesday, Michael Mansfield QC said: \u201cAlthough the object of the exercise was intended to be equalisation of treatment, in fact what has happened is the reverse.\u201d Addressing a court packed with supporters from the campaign group BackTo60, Mansfield said that \u201croughly 3.8 million\u201d women had been affected by the changes. The barrister said raising the state pension age discriminated against women born after 1950 on the grounds of their age, and also put women \u201cat a particular disadvantage to men\u201d. He submitted that \u201cthe claimants and many other women born in the 1950s\u201d were not told about the changes \u201cuntil shortly before their expected state pension age at 60\u201d, which caused \u201csignificant detriments\u201d to many of them. Mansfield said many of the women expected to reach state pension age at 60 because that was \u201cthe practice and legislation in place for most of their working lives\u201d. He added that women born in the 1950s had already suffered \u201cconsiderable inequalities in the workplace\u201d, which he said were the result of \u201chistorical factors and social expectations\u201d. Sir James Eadie QC, representing the DWP, argued that the changes were intended \u201cto equalise the state pension age between the sexes\u201d and \u201cto ensure intergenerational fairness as between those in receipt of state pensions and the younger taxpayers funding them\u201d. He added that the aim of raising the pension age to 66 was also to \u201cmake pensions affordable ... and to control government expenditure at a time of great pressure on public finances\u201d. Sir James submitted that the government took \u201cextensive\u201d steps to notify women of the change to their state pension age, and added that \u201cpersonal notification would have been very difficult if not impossible prior to 2003\u201d. He concluded that the changes \u201cpursue obviously legitimate aims\u201d, and that they \u201cstrike a balance between the public interest and the claimants\u2019 interests\u201d. Before the hearing BackTo60 said that many of the women did not find out about the changes until they went to get their pension or were finally sent an official letter 16 years after the changes were made, leaving them with no time to make alternative financial arrangements. \u201cWe\u2019re in an exquisite position today,\u201d said Joanne Welch from BackTo60, which is seeking repayments of all the pensions that people born in the 1950s would have received if they had been able to retire earlier. \u201cWe have done everything we could possibly have done to place ourselves in a powerful legal position. \u201cWe have so much to say and we expect our claim to be granted.

BackTo60 argues that women were not given time to adjust to the new retirement age and also that the changes in 2011 and 1995 had not been clearly communicated.",

He was under active investigation when he staged the attack on London Bridge, and the victim\u2019s families believe opportunities were missed to realise the scale of the danger he posed.</p> <p>A senior Metropolitan police counter-terrorism detective, known only as witness M, insisted police had not come across any material showing Butt was planning an attack.</p> <p>Gareth Patterson QC, for the victim\u2019s families, questioned the senior detective about a raid on Butt\u2019s home in which his phone and laptop were examined by police.</p> <p>The raid, over a fraud allegation, took place in October 2016 and resulted in no criminal charges after it was referred to the Crown Prosecution Service.</p> <p>The inquest heard the material recovered from Butt\u2019s phone and laptop included Isis propaganda about martyrdom and suicide missions, which Patterson said showed \u201can obsession with Islamic State\u201d.</p> <p>Butt had a YouTube subscription to an extremist preacher, material from other propagandists linked to inspiring and praising al-Qaida and Isis attacks, a voice message from one extremist saying he was looking forward to meeting Butt in paradise, and one in reply from Butt mentioning \u201clike-minded brothers\u201d in London who offered their support.</p> <p>Patterson said: \u201cButt is speaking about death in the context of an obsession with martyrdom and suicide attacks.\u201d</p> <p>On Butt\u2019s laptop, there was video of him clutching a knife and slitting the throat of a cow. There was also material about terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels and a photo of Butt\u2019s son with a toy gun.</p> <p>Witness M said: \u201cYes, it is concerning \u2026 None of this material shows he was planning an attack or that an offence had been committed.

Both phones were registered in their own names and thus their identities were discoverable.</p></li> <li><p>Did not know that almost every day Butt was teaching children at an Islamic school in east London that has now closed.</p></li> </ul> <p>Witness M said: \u201cI have never worked on a perfect operation.

The inquest into the June 2017 attacks was told about a series of alleged missed opportunities by counter-terrorism investigators in the months before eight people were killed. Butt was the ringleader and had been under investigation by police and MI5 since 2015 over fears he was planning an attack in the UK. He was under active investigation when he staged the attack on London Bridge, and the victim\u2019s families believe opportunities were missed to realise the scale of the danger he posed. A senior Metropolitan police counter-terrorism detective, known only as witness M, insisted police had not come across any material showing Butt was planning an attack. Gareth Patterson QC, for the victim\u2019s families, questioned the senior detective about a raid on Butt\u2019s home in which his phone and laptop were examined by police. The raid, over a fraud allegation, took place in October 2016 and resulted in no criminal charges after it was referred to the Crown Prosecution Service. The inquest heard the material recovered from Butt\u2019s phone and laptop included Isis propaganda about martyrdom and suicide missions, which Patterson said showed \u201can obsession with Islamic State\u201d. Butt had a YouTube subscription to an extremist preacher, material from other propagandists linked to inspiring and praising al-Qaida and Isis attacks, a voice message from one extremist saying he was looking forward to meeting Butt in paradise, and one in reply from Butt mentioning \u201clike-minded brothers\u201d in London who offered their support. Patterson said: \u201cButt is speaking about death in the context of an obsession with martyrdom and suicide attacks.\u201d On Butt\u2019s laptop, there was video of him clutching a knife and slitting the throat of a cow. There was also material about terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels and a photo of Butt\u2019s son with a toy gun. Witness M said: \u201cYes, it is concerning \u2026 None of this material shows he was planning an attack or that an offence had been committed. I can only go where the legislation permits.\u201d Under sustained questioning from Patterson, Witness M said that before the attack, police: Had not investigated a gym Butt visited regularly. Were unaware it was linked to a man accused of setting up a training camp in Pakistan used to prepare for the 7 July 2005 attacks in London. Did not know Butt was associating, at the gym and elsewhere, with the two other men who carried out the London Bridge attack. Never investigated Butt\u2019s phone to see who he was in regular contact with. Missed the fact Butt was regularly in contact via his phone with his fellow attackers, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba. Both phones were registered in their own names and thus their identities were discoverable. Did not know that almost every day Butt was teaching children at an Islamic school in east London that has now closed. Witness M said: \u201cI have never worked on a perfect operation. There are always lessons to be learned.\u201d He said that with hindsight, things would have been done differently, but did not specify what. He said there had been no \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d to stop the attack and resources had been stretched. Butt and the two other terrorists were shot dead by police 10 minutes after starting their attack. The inquest continues into the deaths of two people run over by a van and six people stabbed to death.",

The Maroons had four opportunities \u2013 rightly \u2013 denied by The Bunker and blew a number of other chances before overcoming an 8-0 deficit to win 18-14. The final score did not reflect Queensland\u2019s dominance with the Maroons owning both the ball and field position over the final 55 minutes. It was a testament to Queensland\u2019s composure and self-belief that they were able to absorb the Blues\u2019 big swings early before punching out a famous win late. New South Wales opened the scoring with a 12th minute penalty goal slotted by Nathan Cleary but it was a missed opportunity just minutes earlier that left the Blues faithful aghast when the No 7 put too much power on a grubber that bounded dead with only star custodian James Tedesco in pursuit. The Maroons missed a chance not long after when Dane Gagai was tackled just short following a Will Chambers break. The Maroon used the entire width of the field with Corey Oates spectacularly diving over on the opposite side only to be denied when he put a foot into touch. A barrage of pressure on the Queensland goalline though saw the Maroons finally crack when Tedesco \u2013 who was simply brilliant in the opening 20 minutes \u2013 shimmied past Cameron Munster to create an extra man down the right to send recalled centre Josh Morris crashing over. The Maroons appeared to hit back in the 28th minute when a Ben Hunt grubber bounced off the upright with Dylan Napa the unlikely man to fall on the ball.

      "body": "<p>At home in California, <a href=\"http://www.joannastingray.com/\">Joanna Stingray</a> is an estate agent with two additional jobs. But in Russia, the 58-year-old American is a near-legend, feted by rock fans and musicians for her fearless championing of Soviet underground music during the cold war. \u201cYou are the mother of Russian rock!\u201d a fan shouted as Stingray promoted her new autobiography at a Moscow bookstore.</p> <p>\u201cI always loved that I was famous in Russia and then I could go home and no one would recognise me,\u201d Stingray says, when we meet near Red Square. (Stingray in Wonderland has, so far, been published only in Russian.) It\u2019s only her second visit to Russia since she left her adopted home to return to the US in 1996, but the years haven\u2019t dulled her enthusiasm for her time at the heart of the underground rock scene in Leningrad (now St Petersburg). \u201cIn America, we had the 1960s. In Russia, we had that time in Leningrad.\u201d</p> <p>Stingray\u2019s passion for Soviet rock \u2013 which led to her being questioned by the KGB <em>and</em> the FBI \u2013 inspired her to smuggle recordings out of the country for a landmark compilation album featuring four Russian groups. <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/Various-Red-Wave-4-Underground-Bands-From-The-USSR/release/7488688\">The Red Wave LP</a>, released in America in 1986, introduced western audiences to Russian rock and helped end the Kremlin\u2019s censorship of homegrown groups \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.rbth.com/literature/2013/07/27/red_wave_how_soviet_rock_made_it_to_the_us_28349.html\">Mikhail Gorbachev reportedly asked</a>: \u201cWhy is it that such albums come out in America, but not here?\u201d</p> <p>Stingray\u2019s first visit to the Soviet Union, in March 1984, came after her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rew4SUMtKw\">nascent rock career</a> hit a hitch. She had released a single, Beverly Hills Brat, and performed at Studio 54, before a dispute with her manager scuttled further plans. Heading to Russia was an act of youthful rebellion: in 1962 <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1c_PsUR1wvA?t=5\">her father had produced an anti-Soviet documentary</a>, narrated by Ronald Reagan, and he would frequently warn her never to step foot in the communist state. \u201cWhen your parents tell you not to do something, you want to do it even more,\u201d says Stingray.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5be3823ae0d69934f278f9f21a7b99aae87e35a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5be3823ae0d69934f278f9f21a7b99aae87e35a3/0_0_2048_1572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Akvarium frontman Boris Grebenshchikov.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"768\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The Soviet Bob Dylan\u2019 \u2026 Boris Grebenshchikov.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tass/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On her arrival in Leningrad, Stingray and her younger sister ditched their state-employed tour guides to meet a rock musician whose telephone number they got from a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9. Boris Grebenshchikov fronted Akvarium, regarded at the time as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BhcNYYJrhY\">the Soviet Union\u2019s leading underground rock group</a>. Like other bands that refused to submit their lyrics to government censors, Akvarium were barred from state-run studios and the stage, as well as from releasing music officially. Instead, they distributed their albums on illicit cassettes and played acoustic gigs in communal apartments. The exception was Leningrad\u2019s Rock Club, where non-state-approved groups were permitted to perform, albeit under the watchful eye of undercover KGB agents. Foreigners were barred.</p> <p>Back then, Stingray knew nothing of this. At Grebenshchikov\u2019s cramped flat, she says, \u201cI pulled out my record covers and my promos and I thought, he must think I\u2019m so cool, an American rocker.\u201d Then she got her first taste of Akvarium\u2019s music, a blend of Russian and western influences with poetic lyrics that would later see Grebenshchikov <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/2015/06/26/meet-boris-grebenshchikov-soviet-bob-dylan-335200.html\">dubbed \u201cthe Soviet Bob Dylan\u201d</a>. \u201cI realised I\u2019m not an artist; I\u2019m a silly American trying to be a rocker,\u201d she says. \u201cThis guy is the artist, and he\u2019s magic.\u201d The next night, Grebenshchikov took her to an illegal experimental gig. \u201cIt was one of the best nights of my life. It was the moment I realised I was witnessing something extremely special and surreal.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bfc95bc6276948b352ef1093aeb94cd1c5165f24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfc95bc6276948b352ef1093aeb94cd1c5165f24/0_0_2970_4200/707.jpg\" alt=\"Peace initiative \u2026 Kino vocalist Viktor Tsoi.\" width=\"707\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peace initiative \u2026 Kino vocalist Viktor Tsoi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tass/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Inspired, Stingray vowed to return to Leningrad as soon as possible. Before she left, Grebenshchikov gave her the number of an American banker with links to David Bowie\u2019s management. The banker had met Grebenshchikov during a trip to Leningrad and passed on recordings of Akvarium\u2019s music to Bowie, who promised to buy him some instruments. Grebenshchikov asked for a red Fender Stratocaster. Back in the US, Stingray called the number, and Bowie, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140320174125/http:/themoscownews.com/arts/20130820/191866656/Space-Odyssey-on-the-Trans-Siberian-Bowie-in-the-USSR.html\">who had travelled to the Soviet Union in the 70s</a>, duly kept his promise. Stingray delivered the guitar when she returned to Leningrad that year. There was one hitch: custom officials insisted that any musical equipment brought in had to be taken back out. So Grebenshchikov\u2019s friends created a mock-up, right down to the serial number. It worked.</p> <p>Stingray\u2019s second visit to the Soviet Union attracted the attention of the KGB.

      "bodyText": "At home in California, Joanna Stingray is an estate agent with two additional jobs. But in Russia, the 58-year-old American is a near-legend, feted by rock fans and musicians for her fearless championing of Soviet underground music during the cold war. \u201cYou are the mother of Russian rock!\u201d a fan shouted as Stingray promoted her new autobiography at a Moscow bookstore. \u201cI always loved that I was famous in Russia and then I could go home and no one would recognise me,\u201d Stingray says, when we meet near Red Square. (Stingray in Wonderland has, so far, been published only in Russian.) It\u2019s only her second visit to Russia since she left her adopted home to return to the US in 1996, but the years haven\u2019t dulled her enthusiasm for her time at the heart of the underground rock scene in Leningrad (now St Petersburg). \u201cIn America, we had the 1960s. In Russia, we had that time in Leningrad.\u201d Stingray\u2019s passion for Soviet rock \u2013 which led to her being questioned by the KGB and the FBI \u2013 inspired her to smuggle recordings out of the country for a landmark compilation album featuring four Russian groups. The Red Wave LP, released in America in 1986, introduced western audiences to Russian rock and helped end the Kremlin\u2019s censorship of homegrown groups \u2013 Mikhail Gorbachev reportedly asked: \u201cWhy is it that such albums come out in America, but not here?\u201d Stingray\u2019s first visit to the Soviet Union, in March 1984, came after her nascent rock career hit a hitch. She had released a single, Beverly Hills Brat, and performed at Studio 54, before a dispute with her manager scuttled further plans. Heading to Russia was an act of youthful rebellion: in 1962 her father had produced an anti-Soviet documentary, narrated by Ronald Reagan, and he would frequently warn her never to step foot in the communist state. \u201cWhen your parents tell you not to do something, you want to do it even more,\u201d says Stingray. On her arrival in Leningrad, Stingray and her younger sister ditched their state-employed tour guides to meet a rock musician whose telephone number they got from a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9. Boris Grebenshchikov fronted Akvarium, regarded at the time as the Soviet Union\u2019s leading underground rock group. Like other bands that refused to submit their lyrics to government censors, Akvarium were barred from state-run studios and the stage, as well as from releasing music officially. Instead, they distributed their albums on illicit cassettes and played acoustic gigs in communal apartments. The exception was Leningrad\u2019s Rock Club, where non-state-approved groups were permitted to perform, albeit under the watchful eye of undercover KGB agents. Foreigners were barred. Back then, Stingray knew nothing of this. At Grebenshchikov\u2019s cramped flat, she says, \u201cI pulled out my record covers and my promos and I thought, he must think I\u2019m so cool, an American rocker.\u201d Then she got her first taste of Akvarium\u2019s music, a blend of Russian and western influences with poetic lyrics that would later see Grebenshchikov dubbed \u201cthe Soviet Bob Dylan\u201d. \u201cI realised I\u2019m not an artist; I\u2019m a silly American trying to be a rocker,\u201d she says. \u201cThis guy is the artist, and he\u2019s magic.\u201d The next night, Grebenshchikov took her to an illegal experimental gig. \u201cIt was one of the best nights of my life. It was the moment I realised I was witnessing something extremely special and surreal.\u201d Inspired, Stingray vowed to return to Leningrad as soon as possible. Before she left, Grebenshchikov gave her the number of an American banker with links to David Bowie\u2019s management. The banker had met Grebenshchikov during a trip to Leningrad and passed on recordings of Akvarium\u2019s music to Bowie, who promised to buy him some instruments. Grebenshchikov asked for a red Fender Stratocaster. Back in the US, Stingray called the number, and Bowie, who had travelled to the Soviet Union in the 70s, duly kept his promise. Stingray delivered the guitar when she returned to Leningrad that year. There was one hitch: custom officials insisted that any musical equipment brought in had to be taken back out. So Grebenshchikov\u2019s friends created a mock-up, right down to the serial number. It worked. Stingray\u2019s second visit to the Soviet Union attracted the attention of the KGB. As she was leaving an Akvarium gig at the Rock Club, she was pulled aside and questioned by two agents. \u201cThey dragged me downstairs,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was so afraid. I knew if I gave them my name, there was a good chance I\u2019d never be allowed back.\u201d She eventually admitted she was American. They let her go.

Plastic is seen as a versatile, indispensable product, but the environmental impact is becoming more stark. Plastic is now so pervasive that recycling systems cannot keep up and the leakage into the environment is such that by 2050 plastic in the ocean will outweigh fish. In 2017 scientists found plastic fibres in tap water, and plastic has been found in the stomachs of sea creatures in the deepest part of the ocean. Most plastic waste ends up in landfill sites or leaks into the natural environment, where it is causing huge damage to eco-systems on land and sea, creating near permanent contamination. According to academics in the United States, by 2015, of all the plastic waste generated since the 1950s, only 9% has been recycled, with 12% incinerated and 79% accumulated in landfill sites or the environment.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why are the supermarkets under fire?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Producers of plastic include retailers, drinks companies and supermarkets. Supermarkets create more than half of the plastic waste in the household stream in the UK. But they refuse to reveal how much they put on to the streets and how much they pay towards recycling it. Supermarkets are under pressure to reduce their plastic packaging and campaigners argue they have the power to turn off the tap. Much of the packaging they sell to consumers is not recyclable: plastic film, black plastic trays, sleeves on drinks bottles and some coloured plastic. The Recycling Association and other experts believe supermarkets could do much more to make packaging 100% recyclable and reduce the use of plastic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who pays to clean up the waste?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The taxpayer, overwhelmingly. UK producers and retailers pay among the lowest towards recycling and dealing with their waste in Europe. In other countries, the \u201cpolluter\u201d is forced to pay much more. In France, a sliding system of charges means those who put more non- recyclable material on the market pay more.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What can shoppers do to help?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Supermarkets are under pressure, not least from the prime minister, to create plastic-free aisles. A growing number of zero-waste shops are springing up and consumers are being encouraged to ask for products to be sold without plastic.</p>\n    <p><b>Sandra Laville</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Most food and drink types have not been tested, however, meaning the study only assessed 15% of calorie intake. \u201cWe don\u2019t know a huge amount.

      "body": "<p>I remember clearly the first time I self-harmed. I was an awkward 13-year-old girl, beset by problems with my body image. I had a budding eating disorder and was bullied mercilessly by my peers for being bisexual. The sensation of crushing hopelessness and self-hatred threatened to overwhelm me, so I addressed the pain in a way I believed wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone else but myself. I turned all the tumult and sadness inwards, and the relief, although short-lived, was immediate.</p> <p>This began a pattern that would last well into my adult life. Trauma, in the form of losing jobs, sexual assault and family breakdown, prompted more self-harm episodes, resulting in countless stitches and permanent scarring.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/04/one-in-five-young-women-have-self-harmed-study-reveals\">One in five young women have self-harmed, study reveals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The news that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/04/one-in-five-young-women-have-self-harmed-study-reveals\" title=\"\">one in five girls and young women</a> in England aged 16 to 24 have self-harmed brings this largely hidden problem to light. The study, published by the Lancet Psychiatry journal, shows that the number of young people engaging in cutting, burning and self-poisoning has risen across all sexes and age groups since 2000. We should be alarmed, but we should not be surprised.</p> <p>In Britain, the government\u2019s ideological austerity agenda has contributed to plunging <a href=\"http://www.cpag.org.uk/content/child-poverty-facts-and-figures\" title=\"\">4.1 million children into poverty</a>. This means insecure accommodation, cold homes and not enough to eat \u2013 and young people absorb all of this stress. The anxiety of living like this should not be underestimated as a factor in the rise of self-harm behaviours. Worries about exams, university applications and job prospects all loom large too, particularly in a world where employment options are too often limited and precarious.</p> <p>In the age of the influencer and Instagram, appearance and body image concerns are perhaps stronger than ever, with the YMCA finding that <a href=\"https://www.ymca.org.uk/latest-news/ymcas-be-real-campaign-finds-that-almost-two-thirds-of-young-people-feel-pressure-to-look-their-best-online\" title=\"\">67% of young people regularly worry about their appearance</a> and two-thirds feeling pressure to look their best online. Reality TV shows like the recently returned Love Island are also instrumental. Far from being trivial, worries about body image can be devastating, particularly at a young age, and they have a lasting effect on self-esteem and self-efficacy.</p> <p>All of this and more \u2013 bullying, fears about climate change, sexual harassment and assault \u2013 contribute to an environment where young people feel so helpless and alone that self-harm feels like the only way that they can get a handle on a world that seems to be out of control. A lack of NHS mental health services and the stigma that is still attached to self-harm means that many don\u2019t seek help, and more than half of those who self-harm don\u2019t receive any care or intervention at all. As Emma Thomas, chief executive of the mental health charity Young Minds, told the Guardian: \u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s far too difficult for children and young people to get mental health support before they reach crisis point.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The appeal of self-harm can be enduring. It can become a person\u2019s go-to coping strategy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s still a lack of appropriate training for GPs, who may not have the skills to handle the situation appropriately.

      "bodyText": "I remember clearly the first time I self-harmed. I was an awkward 13-year-old girl, beset by problems with my body image. I had a budding eating disorder and was bullied mercilessly by my peers for being bisexual. The sensation of crushing hopelessness and self-hatred threatened to overwhelm me, so I addressed the pain in a way I believed wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone else but myself. I turned all the tumult and sadness inwards, and the relief, although short-lived, was immediate. This began a pattern that would last well into my adult life. Trauma, in the form of losing jobs, sexual assault and family breakdown, prompted more self-harm episodes, resulting in countless stitches and permanent scarring. The news that one in five girls and young women in England aged 16 to 24 have self-harmed brings this largely hidden problem to light. The study, published by the Lancet Psychiatry journal, shows that the number of young people engaging in cutting, burning and self-poisoning has risen across all sexes and age groups since 2000. We should be alarmed, but we should not be surprised. In Britain, the government\u2019s ideological austerity agenda has contributed to plunging 4.1 million children into poverty. This means insecure accommodation, cold homes and not enough to eat \u2013 and young people absorb all of this stress. The anxiety of living like this should not be underestimated as a factor in the rise of self-harm behaviours. Worries about exams, university applications and job prospects all loom large too, particularly in a world where employment options are too often limited and precarious. In the age of the influencer and Instagram, appearance and body image concerns are perhaps stronger than ever, with the YMCA finding that 67% of young people regularly worry about their appearance and two-thirds feeling pressure to look their best online. Reality TV shows like the recently returned Love Island are also instrumental. Far from being trivial, worries about body image can be devastating, particularly at a young age, and they have a lasting effect on self-esteem and self-efficacy. All of this and more \u2013 bullying, fears about climate change, sexual harassment and assault \u2013 contribute to an environment where young people feel so helpless and alone that self-harm feels like the only way that they can get a handle on a world that seems to be out of control. A lack of NHS mental health services and the stigma that is still attached to self-harm means that many don\u2019t seek help, and more than half of those who self-harm don\u2019t receive any care or intervention at all. As Emma Thomas, chief executive of the mental health charity Young Minds, told the Guardian: \u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s far too difficult for children and young people to get mental health support before they reach crisis point.\u201d There\u2019s still a lack of appropriate training for GPs, who may not have the skills to handle the situation appropriately. The first time I was taken to the GP for self-harming at 16, the doctor took one look at me and pronounced my wounds \u201csuperficial\u201d. I vowed to make the future incisions as deep as possible, in order to be taken seriously. And this is not necessarily a phase that a young person will grow out of. The appeal of self-harm can be enduring. It can become a person\u2019s go-to coping strategy; the thing they turn to in times of hardship and uncertainty. For some, self-harm becomes an addictive behaviour. In order to tackle this crisis, the government must address the lack of services available for young people struggling with their mental health. If appropriate treatment options are available from the outset, people might never resort to self-harm, and, even if they do, it need not become a lifelong habit. The damaging Tory austerity agenda must end, with measures taken to lift children out of poverty, and the school system\u2019s over-emphasis on exam success should come under further scrutiny. Self-harm is what we revert to when depression and anxiety overwhelm us. We need to give young people hope and support as a matter of urgency. \u2022 Harriet Williamson is a journalist, mental health activist and artist who tweets @harriepw \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Sure, Cyrus was responsible for freeing the Jewish population from captivity in Babylon, but I think I missed the bit of the Bible where God\u2019s people campaigned to be subject to his rule in the first place. It all sounds like an excuse for people desperate to justify voting for someone who Christians should be rebuking, not supporting.</p> <p>The Bible is clear that we don\u2019t know the mind of God \u2013 that is beyond us; second-guessing him is not something we are encouraged to do. Only he has the big picture. But one thing I know for sure is that we are instructed to love God and to love our neighbour \u2013 and that means that someone who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/12/trump-el-paso-family-separations-migrants-immigration\" title=\"\">separates children from their mothers</a>, bans Muslims from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/01/trump-travel-ban-visa-waiver-muslim\" title=\"\">entering his country</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/26/donald-trump-torture-absolutely-works-says-us-president-in-first-television-interview\" title=\"\">countenances torture</a>, is worthy of rebuke.</p> <p>So not only is it wrong to support Trump on this basis, it is also dangerous. Dangerous because it contributes to the tribal politicisation of evangelical Christians.</p> <p>The right is often found decrying identity politics, but is it possible that they are as guilty of it as anyone else? In 2000 and 2004, the evangelical Christian movement in the US allowed itself to become politicised as never before, as it lined up behind George W Bush. Though Christians\u2019 association with Bush was counterproductive, it was, however, understandable. He was a professing evangelical Christian who sought to live in accordance with the Bible\u2019s teaching.</p> <p>But evangelical Christians\u2019 political marriage to Trump is much harder to fathom. In his private life the president has demonstrated a flagrant disregard for the dignity of others, an utter contempt for equality, and far more concern for his own rights and reputation than the wellbeing and care of others. His attitude to refugees and migrants demonstrates a lack of compassion and understanding for the vulnerable that at times beggars belief.</p> <p>The politicisation and tribalism of Christianity is dangerous and, in the case of Trump, stands in direct opposition to the values of the saviour who Christians seek to follow. One who gave up his rights to save others rather than trampling on the rights of others to promote himself. Some Christians may believe they are bringing about God\u2019s purposes, but in reality they are causing his name to be associated with the very things he stands against.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/oct/31/trump-democrats-evangelicals-pro-jesus-republicans\">'I\u2019m not anti-Trump, I\u2019m just pro-Jesus': the evangelicals stumping for the Democrats</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Indeed, it is possible that this association with Trump\u2019s loveless, graceless amoralism could write Christianity out of the public square even faster than the dominance of secularism might on this side of the Atlantic. Where a Christian worldview is dismissed and derided in the UK, association with Trump means many may actively reject it in the US. In fact, the impact of the politicisation of evangelical Christians is not just damaging to Christianity in the US. Churches in Britain have been taking the word \u201cevangelical\u201d out of their name for fear of the association.</p> <p>The choice of American Christians to publicly back Trump now, and George W Bush before him, has been a dangerous move in a culture war that now means that half of the US has its fingers in its ears when it comes to the gospel. My challenge to Christians in the US is this: what matters more to you, the identity of the person in the White House or the promotion of the good news about Jesus Christ? If it is the latter \u2013 and it surely must be \u2013 then you need to seriously reconsider your support of the former. The politicisation of US Christianity has undermined the witness of evangelicals everywhere.</p> <p>\u2022 Tim Farron is MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale and former leader of the Liberal Democrats</p>",

But one thing I know for sure is that we are instructed to love God and to love our neighbour \u2013 and that means that someone who separates children from their mothers, bans Muslims from entering his country, and countenances torture, is worthy of rebuke. So not only is it wrong to support Trump on this basis, it is also dangerous. Dangerous because it contributes to the tribal politicisation of evangelical Christians. The right is often found decrying identity politics, but is it possible that they are as guilty of it as anyone else? In 2000 and 2004, the evangelical Christian movement in the US allowed itself to become politicised as never before, as it lined up behind George W Bush. Though Christians\u2019 association with Bush was counterproductive, it was, however, understandable. He was a professing evangelical Christian who sought to live in accordance with the Bible\u2019s teaching. But evangelical Christians\u2019 political marriage to Trump is much harder to fathom. In his private life the president has demonstrated a flagrant disregard for the dignity of others, an utter contempt for equality, and far more concern for his own rights and reputation than the wellbeing and care of others. His attitude to refugees and migrants demonstrates a lack of compassion and understanding for the vulnerable that at times beggars belief. The politicisation and tribalism of Christianity is dangerous and, in the case of Trump, stands in direct opposition to the values of the saviour who Christians seek to follow. One who gave up his rights to save others rather than trampling on the rights of others to promote himself. Some Christians may believe they are bringing about God\u2019s purposes, but in reality they are causing his name to be associated with the very things he stands against. Indeed, it is possible that this association with Trump\u2019s loveless, graceless amoralism could write Christianity out of the public square even faster than the dominance of secularism might on this side of the Atlantic. Where a Christian worldview is dismissed and derided in the UK, association with Trump means many may actively reject it in the US. In fact, the impact of the politicisation of evangelical Christians is not just damaging to Christianity in the US. Churches in Britain have been taking the word \u201cevangelical\u201d out of their name for fear of the association. The choice of American Christians to publicly back Trump now, and George W Bush before him, has been a dangerous move in a culture war that now means that half of the US has its fingers in its ears when it comes to the gospel. My challenge to Christians in the US is this: what matters more to you, the identity of the person in the White House or the promotion of the good news about Jesus Christ? If it is the latter \u2013 and it surely must be \u2013 then you need to seriously reconsider your support of the former. The politicisation of US Christianity has undermined the witness of evangelicals everywhere. \u2022 Tim Farron is MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale and former leader of the Liberal Democrats",

While carbon emissions have been falling, in part because of the switch from coal to gas, <a href=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/usa/\">Climate Tracker estimates</a> that the US will fail to meet its carbon reduction targets set by Barack Obama, to cut emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025.</p> <h2>2) Fracking</h2> <p>The US is now one of the world\u2019s biggest gas producers, thanks to fracking, and about half of its oil now comes from the production method, which requires the blasting of dense shale rock with water, sand and chemicals to release the tiny bubbles of fossil fuel trapped inside. This boom has come at a cost, as the vast water requirements are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/05/fracking-water-america-drought-oil-gas\">draining some areas dry</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/25/pollutants-from-fracking-could-pose-health-risk-to-children-warn-researchers\">pollutants found near fracking sites</a> include heavy metals, chemicals that disrupt hormones, and particulates. The effects range from memory, learning and IQ deficits to behavioural problems. Leaks of \u201cfugitive\u201d methane are an additional contributor to climate change.</p> <h2>3) Fossil fuel exploration</h2> <p>Not content with the US\u2019s existing conventional oil reserves, and the expansion of the oil and gas industries through fracking, the US fossil fuel industry is seeking new grounds for exploration \u2013 among them, the pristine Alaskan wilderness. Drilling in the Alaskan wildlife reserve is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/24/alaska-national-wildlife-refuge-seismic-testing-trump-plan\">key Trump policy</a>.</p> <h2>4) Fuel efficiency standards</h2> <p>The Trump administration has moved to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/02/epa-trump-vehicle-emissions-clean-car-rules\">loosen regulations on fuel efficiency for cars and vans</a>, which were already less stringent than in many other countries. Opponents fear this will increase greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.</p> <h2>5) International cooperation</h2> <p>Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement of 2015 cannot legally take effect until after the next presidential election, in an irony of timing. However, the effect can already be seen, in the emboldening of other nations considering a withdrawal, such as Brazil, formerly a strong proponent of action at the UN talks, and the increasing<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/11/australia-only-nation-to-join-us-at-pro-coal-event-at-cop24-climate-talks\"> influence of fossil fuel lobbyists</a>.</p> <h2>6) Climate denial</h2> <p>With the president claiming climate change to be a \u201cChinese hoax\u201d, it is perhaps not surprising that the US has some of the highest rates of climate denial in the world, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/07/us-hotbed-climate-change-denial-international-poll\">polling by YouGov in collaboration with the Guardian</a>. Despite this, a sizeable majority of the US public \u2013 nearly six in 10 people \u2013 still agree with the science on climate change, and support action to stave off the worst consequences.</p> <h2>7) Water</h2> <p>Despite Trump\u2019s claim to Morgan that \u201cwe want the best water, the cleanest water \u2013 it\u2019s crystal clean, has to be crystal clean clear\u201d, his <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/12/11/675477583/trump-epa-proposes-big-changes-to-federal-water-protections\">recent actions on water</a> have been an attempt to roll back decades of progress on cleaning up the US water supply. Last December, he announced plans to undo or weaken federal rules that protect millions of acres of wetlands and thousands of miles of streams from pesticide run-off and other pollutants.</p> <h2>8) Air</h2> <p>By rolling back Obama-era measures intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, the Trump administration is also threatening to increase air pollution, as coal-fired power stations will be able to spew out toxins once more, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/31/epa-trump-pollution-clean-power-plan-states\">14 states who last year opposed the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s plans</a>. This is in contrast with China and India, cited by Trump \u2013 along with Russia \u2013 as having polluted air. Those nations are trying to clean up their pollution with stricter limits on what power plants and other industries can produce.</p>",

The Portuguese forward was supposed to carry Juventus to European glory. Instead, they won an eighth consecutive Serie A title, and nothing more.</p> <p>Ronaldo, for the most part, delivered. He did not hit those otherworldly heights of his best years in Madrid, but 28 goals and 10 assists are hardly a pittance. His hat-trick bailed the <em>Bianconeri</em> out after a catastrophic first leg against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the Champions League last-16, and he struck in both legs of the quarter-final defeat by Ajax.</p> <p>Still, few predicted at the outset that he would finish behind Fabio Quagliarella and Duv\u00e1n Zapata in the scoring charts. The former turned 36 in January. The latter had never gone beyond 11 goals in his previous five seasons in Italy.</p> <p>Look beyond Juventus\u2019s dominance, and this was a season packed with unexpected twists.

OK, perhaps that bit was less surprising, but the path the <em>Nerazzurri</em> took was something else.</p> <p>Eight points clear of fifth at the start of 2019, Inter had won the derby, beaten Lazio 3-0 in Rome and earned results at home to Barcelona and Tottenham, too. Then they started the year poorly and alienated their only reliable goalscorer by stripping him of the captaincy.</p> <p>Perhaps that was even the right thing to do. Certainly, it was not ideal for Mauro Icardi\u2019s wife and agent, Wanda, to be taking digs at teammates on TV chat shows. Then again, it was not exactly desirable for him to write an autobiography three years ago in which he triumphantly recalled threatening to bring criminals over from Argentina to murder fans who criticised him, either, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/17/mauro-icardi-v-inters-ultras-an-unhappy-chapter-in-his-ongoing-san-siro-saga\">he did not lose the armband </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/17/mauro-icardi-v-inters-ultras-an-unhappy-chapter-in-his-ongoing-san-siro-saga\">then</a>.</p> <p>Icardi is expected to leave, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/31/antonio-conte-appointed-inter-milan-head-coach\">Antonio Conte builds a team</a> in his image. Milan already offloaded their own ill-fitting Argentinian striker in January. Gonzalo Higua\u00edn was supposed to fire the <em>Rossoneri</em> into the Champions League. Instead his brief loan stay will be remembered for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/12/gonzalo-higuain-milan-juventus-red-card-serie-a-football\"> a penalty miss, red card and meltdown</a> against parent club Juventus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/28/gennaro-gattuso-leaves-milan-head-coach\">Gennaro Gattuso leaves Milan but tells club not to pay him for rest of contract</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Krzysztof Pi\u0105tek fared better, though his goals dried up, too, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/sep/27/krzysztof-piateks-glorious-run-goes-on-as-genoa-swat-aside-chievo\">after an astonishing start </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/sep/27/krzysztof-piateks-glorious-run-goes-on-as-genoa-swat-aside-chievo\">in Serie A</a>. He joined Genoa from CS Cracovia for \u20ac4.5m last June, and was sold to Milan for almost eight times that sum half a year later. An astonishing piece of business, and also one that very nearly backfired, as the <em>Rossoblu</em> slid to 17th without him. They avoided relegation only thanks to a head-to-head tie-breaker over Empoli.</p> <p>It was sad to see the Tuscans go: a team that always sought to attack under Aurelio Andreazzoli. Perhaps, if he had not been briefly replaced by Beppe Iachini in the middle of the season, Empoli might have survived, even with the smallest wage bill in the division.</p> <p>Many wealthier clubs delivered less bang for their buck. Fiorentina finished just three points above the relegation zone after an extraordinary collapse. Roma, too, were a disappointment, if not quite on the same scale. Monchi and Eusebio Di Francesco were gone by the middle of March. Now Daniele De Rossi\u2019s journey with his boyhood club has come to an end as well.</p> <p>There were more positive seasons for Lazio, Coppa Italia winners, and Torino, who challenged strongly for a European place, as well as Spal and Sassuolo. Bologna had some of the best results in the league after hiring Sinisa Mihajlovic as manager in January. Parma followed up three consecutive promotions by consolidating their top-flight place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"824bb9425941bd929bc066d59aa4d569317d40ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/824bb9425941bd929bc066d59aa4d569317d40ed/0_290_5528_3318/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lazio celebrate after winning the Coppa Italia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lazio celebrate after winning the Coppa Italia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincenzo Pinto/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Napoli cruised to second almost as comfortably as Juventus took first. Carlo Ancelotti deserves credit for evolving the team left by Maurizio Sarri, and making better use of his squad\u2019s depth, without slipping down the table \u2013 even if the points tally was diminished.</p> <p>This will be another Serie A season, however, remembered for ugly events off the pitch as well. Kalidou Koulibaly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/26/carlo-ancelotti-slams-racist-chanting-napoli-kalidou-koulibaly\">was racially abused</a> during Napoli\u2019s defeat at Inter. Moise Kean, a joyful late-season revelation for Juventus, was likewise targeted during a match at Cagliari.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/14/cagliari-escape-punishment-over-racist-abuse-directed-at-moise-kean\">The limp reaction of the authorities</a> \u2013 who took no action against the Sardinian club \u2013 was dispiriting. But the response of Kean\u2019s own team-mate Leonardo Bonucci, who suggested that blame \u201cshould be split 50-50\u201d between the teenager and his abusers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/apr/03/since-when-does-a-celebration-justify-racist-abuse\">was arguably</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/apr/03/since-when-does-a-celebration-justify-racist-abuse\"> worse</a>.</p> <p>Ronaldo found himself at the centre of a grim story in October, when Las Vegas police confirmed that they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/10/cristiano-ronaldo-rape-allegation-dna-warrant\">were re-opening investigations into a rape accusation</a> made against him in 2009. The player denied the charge and there are conflicting reports about whether the case has been dropped. But Juventus\u2019s response, issuing a pair of tweets that highlighted his professionalism together with the length of time since the alleged incident, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/oct/08/cristiano-ronaldo-scoring-for-juventus-is-just-a-goal-nothing-else\">was nevertheless horribly misjudged</a>.</p> <p>These stories cannot be swept aside, yet it is right to celebrate the highs of the season as well. So without further ado, here are your 2019 awards \u2026</p> <h2><strong>Goal of the season</strong></h2> <p>6) Between injuries, car trouble and a habit for showing up late to training, Radja Nainggolan\u2019s first year at Inter <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jHBHkHjjWU\">was mostly a disappointment</a>.

Gasperini was in charge of Genoa back then, but would go on to have his own disastrous stint in charge of the <em>Nerazzurri</em>: fired after just five games in 2011.</p> <p>It took time to bounce back. But what is so impressive about Gasperini is that he continues to evolve, even at 61. For most of his career, his schemes were premised on the idea that a team should keep one defender free to mop up. At Atalanta, there is no such safety net. He has dared his players to engage in one-on-one battles, and reaped incredible rewards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0324b3e4f3ed68a1464310493ec68f5b9ce82b6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0324b3e4f3ed68a1464310493ec68f5b9ce82b6d/0_109_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Atalanta head coach Gian Piero Gasperini.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Atalanta head coach Gian Piero Gasperini.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paolo Magni/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gasperini has also drawn the best out of individuals by observing qualities that others had missed. Zapata\u2019s muscular frame led many to presume that he was best suited to acting as a target-man who could hold the ball up and bring others into play. This season, he was encouraged to play facing the goal more. He scored 23 times.</p> <h2><strong>Definitely not </strong><strong>manager of the season</strong></h2> <p>Giampiero Ventura, out of work since failing to qualify Italy to the 2018 World Cup, returned to management with Chievo in October. He presided over three defeats and a draw before handing in his resignation. He was, as the journalist Giovanni Capuano observed, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/capuanogio/status/1061659075694510080\">\u201conly 363 days late\u201d</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Player of the season</strong></h2> <p>Ronaldo was supposed to be the signing that allowed Juventus to win the Champions League. Instead, they crashed out against Ajax. The football was often drab, and Massimiliano Allegri lost his job.</p> <p>Still, Ronaldo was the best individual performer in a team that won Serie A at a stroll. If Juventus were able to take 24 wins and three draws from their first 27 league games, it was in part because they had a player who could resolve everything on his own even when they were playing badly. More was hoped for. But only because the bar was set high to begin with.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4d31d33f245a7df9e5de632f7ea97fc598f5901e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d31d33f245a7df9e5de632f7ea97fc598f5901e/0_0_3945_2626/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cristiano Ronaldo of Juventus celebrates after scoring against Sampdoria in December.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cristiano Ronaldo of Juventus celebrates after scoring against Sampdoria in December.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicol\u00f2 Campo/LightRocket via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Quickest redemption story</strong></h2> <p>Zapata misses penalty to equalise from 3-0 down against Roma.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jan/28/serie-as-weekend-of-thrills-topped-by-great-entertainers-atalanta-again\"> Scores 45 seconds later anyway</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Most self-aware</strong></h2> <p>After scoring the only goal in a win over Fiorentina, Frosinone\u2019s Daniel Ciofani lamented leaving himself out of his fantasy team.

A magnificent midfielder in his prime, he was always more than the hard-tackling caricature implied by the tattoo <a href=\"https://images2.gazzettaobjects.it/methode_image/2016/02/04/Calcio/Foto%20Calcio%20-%20Trattate/tattoo%20de%20rossi-U202260272483HhC-U1405487230847lC-620x349@Gazzetta-Web_articolo.jpg?v=201602051052\">on his right calf</a>.</p> <p>He will not retire a one-club man like Francesco Totti. Nor did he get the chance to raise a Scudetto for Roma, as his former team-mate did. But De Rossi did get to live that glory in a different way: as fan, as a member of the academy and as a ball-boy. This was always his team, long before he ever got the chance to play in it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30192032d115667916bfc944ee6a54f3d568b156\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30192032d115667916bfc944ee6a54f3d568b156/0_0_3072_2044/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roma supporters pay tribute to Daniele De Rossi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roma supporters pay tribute to Daniele De Rossi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Riccardo Antimiani/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It will remain so, when he returns, as promised, to watch games with a sandwich and a beer.

He spent 11-and-a-half years at Napoli, the last five of those as captain \u2013 surpassing Diego Maradona as the club\u2019s all-time leading scorer. His move to China in February marked the end of an era as well; not all heroes need to be homegrown.</p> <p><em>Grazie di tutto, ragazzi</em>.

      "bodyText": "Not even an alien invasion could change the narrative for Italian football. Cristiano Ronaldo was hailed as an extra-terrestrial when he touched down in Turin, a five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner arriving in a country where no player had got close to the award since Kak\u00e1 claimed it in 2007. The Portuguese forward was supposed to carry Juventus to European glory. Instead, they won an eighth consecutive Serie A title, and nothing more. Ronaldo, for the most part, delivered. He did not hit those otherworldly heights of his best years in Madrid, but 28 goals and 10 assists are hardly a pittance. His hat-trick bailed the Bianconeri out after a catastrophic first leg against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the Champions League last-16, and he struck in both legs of the quarter-final defeat by Ajax. Still, few predicted at the outset that he would finish behind Fabio Quagliarella and Duv\u00e1n Zapata in the scoring charts. The former turned 36 in January. The latter had never gone beyond 11 goals in his previous five seasons in Italy. Look beyond Juventus\u2019s dominance, and this was a season packed with unexpected twists. Atalanta, playing vibrant and ambitious football, finished third \u2013 higher than ever before in their 112-year history. They outscored everyone, including Juventus, and ended the Bianconeri\u2019s bid for a fifth-consecutive domestic double with a 3-0 Coppa Italia rout. Inter, tipped as title challengers after adding Radja Nainggolan, Stefan De Vrij and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, instead produced a re-enactment of their previous campaign \u2013 finishing with the same points and again scraping into fourth with a nerve-shredding final-day win. OK, perhaps that bit was less surprising, but the path the Nerazzurri took was something else. Eight points clear of fifth at the start of 2019, Inter had won the derby, beaten Lazio 3-0 in Rome and earned results at home to Barcelona and Tottenham, too. Then they started the year poorly and alienated their only reliable goalscorer by stripping him of the captaincy. Perhaps that was even the right thing to do. Certainly, it was not ideal for Mauro Icardi\u2019s wife and agent, Wanda, to be taking digs at teammates on TV chat shows. Then again, it was not exactly desirable for him to write an autobiography three years ago in which he triumphantly recalled threatening to bring criminals over from Argentina to murder fans who criticised him, either, and he did not lose the armband then. Icardi is expected to leave, as Antonio Conte builds a team in his image. Milan already offloaded their own ill-fitting Argentinian striker in January. Gonzalo Higua\u00edn was supposed to fire the Rossoneri into the Champions League. Instead his brief loan stay will be remembered for a penalty miss, red card and meltdown against parent club Juventus. Krzysztof Pi\u0105tek fared better, though his goals dried up, too, after an astonishing start in Serie A. He joined Genoa from CS Cracovia for \u20ac4.5m last June, and was sold to Milan for almost eight times that sum half a year later. An astonishing piece of business, and also one that very nearly backfired, as the Rossoblu slid to 17th without him. They avoided relegation only thanks to a head-to-head tie-breaker over Empoli. It was sad to see the Tuscans go: a team that always sought to attack under Aurelio Andreazzoli. Perhaps, if he had not been briefly replaced by Beppe Iachini in the middle of the season, Empoli might have survived, even with the smallest wage bill in the division. Many wealthier clubs delivered less bang for their buck. Fiorentina finished just three points above the relegation zone after an extraordinary collapse. Roma, too, were a disappointment, if not quite on the same scale. Monchi and Eusebio Di Francesco were gone by the middle of March. Now Daniele De Rossi\u2019s journey with his boyhood club has come to an end as well. There were more positive seasons for Lazio, Coppa Italia winners, and Torino, who challenged strongly for a European place, as well as Spal and Sassuolo. Bologna had some of the best results in the league after hiring Sinisa Mihajlovic as manager in January. Parma followed up three consecutive promotions by consolidating their top-flight place. Napoli cruised to second almost as comfortably as Juventus took first. Carlo Ancelotti deserves credit for evolving the team left by Maurizio Sarri, and making better use of his squad\u2019s depth, without slipping down the table \u2013 even if the points tally was diminished. This will be another Serie A season, however, remembered for ugly events off the pitch as well. Kalidou Koulibaly was racially abused during Napoli\u2019s defeat at Inter. Moise Kean, a joyful late-season revelation for Juventus, was likewise targeted during a match at Cagliari. The limp reaction of the authorities \u2013 who took no action against the Sardinian club \u2013 was dispiriting. But the response of Kean\u2019s own team-mate Leonardo Bonucci, who suggested that blame \u201cshould be split 50-50\u201d between the teenager and his abusers, was arguably worse. Ronaldo found himself at the centre of a grim story in October, when Las Vegas police confirmed that they were re-opening investigations into a rape accusation made against him in 2009. The player denied the charge and there are conflicting reports about whether the case has been dropped. But Juventus\u2019s response, issuing a pair of tweets that highlighted his professionalism together with the length of time since the alleged incident, was nevertheless horribly misjudged. These stories cannot be swept aside, yet it is right to celebrate the highs of the season as well. So without further ado, here are your 2019 awards \u2026 Goal of the season 6) Between injuries, car trouble and a habit for showing up late to training, Radja Nainggolan\u2019s first year at Inter was mostly a disappointment. But he did still score one absolute gem against Juventus. 5) Piatek did not need to look at the goal to know where it was as he ran on to Ricardo Rodriguez\u2019s cross against Atalanta. 4) Who needs Ronaldo, when you have Rolando (Mandragora)? 3) Luis Muriel shades it over Gervinho in the coast-to-coast section. 2) Andrea Belotti had a brilliant overhead kick saved by Andrea Consigli when Torino took on Sassuolo this May. But if at first you don\u2019t succeed \u2026 1) Quagliarella\u2019s backheel volley against Chievo was pretty good. But the one he scored against Napoli was even better. Best first goal Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo made sure that everyone sat down to watch as he opened his Serie A account against Sassuolo. Team of the season (4-2-3-1) Samir Handanovic; Joao Cancelo, Armando Izzo, Kalidou Koulibaly, Domenico Criscito; Rodrigo, Remo Freuler; Josip Ilicic, Papu Gomez, Cristiano Ronaldo; Fabio Quagliarella Subs: Salvatore Sirigu, Alessio Cragno, Francesco Acerbi, Fabian Ruiz, Joaquin Correa, Rade Krunic, Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo, Suso, Stephan El Shaarawy, Dries Mertens, Duv\u00e1n Zapata, Krzysztof Pi\u0105tek Manager of the season Back when Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was in charge of Inter, he hailed Gian Piero Gasperini as one of the toughest managers he had coached against. Gasperini was in charge of Genoa back then, but would go on to have his own disastrous stint in charge of the Nerazzurri: fired after just five games in 2011. It took time to bounce back. But what is so impressive about Gasperini is that he continues to evolve, even at 61. For most of his career, his schemes were premised on the idea that a team should keep one defender free to mop up. At Atalanta, there is no such safety net. He has dared his players to engage in one-on-one battles, and reaped incredible rewards. Gasperini has also drawn the best out of individuals by observing qualities that others had missed. Zapata\u2019s muscular frame led many to presume that he was best suited to acting as a target-man who could hold the ball up and bring others into play. This season, he was encouraged to play facing the goal more. He scored 23 times. Definitely not manager of the season Giampiero Ventura, out of work since failing to qualify Italy to the 2018 World Cup, returned to management with Chievo in October. He presided over three defeats and a draw before handing in his resignation. He was, as the journalist Giovanni Capuano observed, \u201conly 363 days late\u201d. Player of the season Ronaldo was supposed to be the signing that allowed Juventus to win the Champions League. Instead, they crashed out against Ajax. The football was often drab, and Massimiliano Allegri lost his job. Still, Ronaldo was the best individual performer in a team that won Serie A at a stroll. If Juventus were able to take 24 wins and three draws from their first 27 league games, it was in part because they had a player who could resolve everything on his own even when they were playing badly. More was hoped for. But only because the bar was set high to begin with. Quickest redemption story Zapata misses penalty to equalise from 3-0 down against Roma. Scores 45 seconds later anyway. Most self-aware After scoring the only goal in a win over Fiorentina, Frosinone\u2019s Daniel Ciofani lamented leaving himself out of his fantasy team. He was then asked whether his friends had allowed him buy himself cheaply in the preseason auction. \u201cThey let me pay [the minimum price] \u20ac1m,\u201d confirmed Ciofani. \u201cNot to do me a favour, but because I\u2019m the centre-forward for Frosinone.\u201d Honourable mention: Kevin-Prince Boateng, asked on the eve of the season if he could be Sassuolo\u2019s Ronaldo. \u201cMaybe, yes. But I\u2019m short by 500 goals.\u201d Best choreography (by a mile \u2026) Spal\u2019s supporters went all-out to remind Mattia Destro of the open goal he had missed against them a season before. Best custom design The Inter fan who turned his back on Mauro Icardi in favour of a true club legend. Greatest reason to hang around \u201cI hope I stay here for a long time so I can complete a tour of all the different pizza places. Once you eat pizza in Naples, you don\u2019t eat it anywhere else any more. The same goes for the mozzarella\u201d \u2013 Carlo Ancelotti tells Radio Kiss Kiss why he won\u2019t be leaving Napoli any time soon. (The feeling between him and the city\u2019s pizza-makers is mutual.) Lifetime achievement awards There are not enough words left to me here to do justice to De Rossi. A magnificent midfielder in his prime, he was always more than the hard-tackling caricature implied by the tattoo on his right calf. He will not retire a one-club man like Francesco Totti. Nor did he get the chance to raise a Scudetto for Roma, as his former team-mate did. But De Rossi did get to live that glory in a different way: as fan, as a member of the academy and as a ball-boy. This was always his team, long before he ever got the chance to play in it. It will remain so, when he returns, as promised, to watch games with a sandwich and a beer. His journey as a professional footballer is not finished quite yet, though. Perhaps the 2006 World Cup winner will find there are further trophies to be claimed away from Rome. Before we finish, though, I want to give a mention for Marek Hamsik as well. He spent 11-and-a-half years at Napoli, the last five of those as captain \u2013 surpassing Diego Maradona as the club\u2019s all-time leading scorer. His move to China in February marked the end of an era as well; not all heroes need to be homegrown. Grazie di tutto, ragazzi. Here\u2019s hoping the next chapter is every bit as rewarding.",

      "bodyText": "Players from both teams have taken part in a much-discussed boycott of Australia\u2019s national anthem before Wednesday\u2019s State of Origin opener. Indigenous players Cody Walker, Josh Addo-Carr and Will Chambers had all spoken in the build-up to the match at Suncorp Stadium that they would not be singing Advance Australia Fair. Of the 34 players to take the field for Queensland and NSW, 11 players appeared not to sing during the pre-match ceremony. The players linked arms with teammates on the pitch but remained tight-lipped as Advance Australia Fair was sung by the majority of players and fans massed in the stands. The rendition of the anthem immediately followed a welcome to country delivered by Johnathan Thurston, the retired Queensland great. The issue has prompted a national debate over the singing of the anthem and how Indigenous people feel about the song, particularly the lyrics declaring Australians are \u201cyoung and free\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Is the typical genius still regarded as fundamentally male, or have we now dispensed with that particular variety of dullness? The Swedish author Lina Wolff is pretty certain that we have not: she is prone, therefore, to outbreaks of satire.</p> <p>In her latest novel she creates a great male genius and pisses all over his magnum opus. This is not a metaphor. Furthermore, it is not even the worst that befalls the magnum opus; it is burned as well. In her first novel, 2016\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/22/bret-easton-ellis-and-the-other-dogs-lina-wolff-review-novel\" title=\"\">Bret Easton Ellis and the Other Dogs</a></em>, Wolff described a kennel full of dogs named after famous male writers. If readers think these gags are possibly a bit juvenile, fair enough. Wolff is exuberantly tasteless and cynical in both books. In <em>The Polyglot Lovers</em>, the casual destruction of the great genius\u2019s work recalls countless acts of historical sabotage. Some of her characters regard it as a tragedy, others argue that it is not so important because the writer is such a pig (not a dog). This is clearly provocative.</p> <p>The novel opens with online dating, in all its terror. The first of three narrators, Ellinor, comes from Sk\u00e5ne, in southern Sweden, and has discovered through bleak experience that \u201cwhat\u2019s important is not being alone\u201d. She is 36 and has just escaped from a relationship with a sentimental alcoholic. Now she meets a man called Ruben online, and travels to Stockholm to see him. She discovers that Ruben is \u201coverweight, [with] dirty hair \u2026 obviously intoxicated\u201d. Worse, he is also a book reviewer. Despite this, Ellinor goes to his big house by the sea.

      "bodyText": "Is the typical genius still regarded as fundamentally male, or have we now dispensed with that particular variety of dullness? The Swedish author Lina Wolff is pretty certain that we have not: she is prone, therefore, to outbreaks of satire. In her latest novel she creates a great male genius and pisses all over his magnum opus. This is not a metaphor. Furthermore, it is not even the worst that befalls the magnum opus; it is burned as well. In her first novel, 2016\u2019s Bret Easton Ellis and the Other Dogs, Wolff described a kennel full of dogs named after famous male writers. If readers think these gags are possibly a bit juvenile, fair enough. Wolff is exuberantly tasteless and cynical in both books. In The Polyglot Lovers, the casual destruction of the great genius\u2019s work recalls countless acts of historical sabotage. Some of her characters regard it as a tragedy, others argue that it is not so important because the writer is such a pig (not a dog). This is clearly provocative. The novel opens with online dating, in all its terror. The first of three narrators, Ellinor, comes from Sk\u00e5ne, in southern Sweden, and has discovered through bleak experience that \u201cwhat\u2019s important is not being alone\u201d. She is 36 and has just escaped from a relationship with a sentimental alcoholic. Now she meets a man called Ruben online, and travels to Stockholm to see him. She discovers that Ruben is \u201coverweight, [with] dirty hair \u2026 obviously intoxicated\u201d. Worse, he is also a book reviewer. Despite this, Ellinor goes to his big house by the sea. There he tells her that he is currently borrowing the only copy of a new book by Max Lamas, an acknowledged genius of the age. We might wonder how Max can be such a fool that he has only one copy of his manuscript, but Wolff\u2019s novel would collapse without this device, so he must be a genius at writing but absolutely not a genius at photocopying. Ruben and Ellinor get savagely drunk and, after Ruben has talked a lot about Max, they fight and have violent, cataclysmic sex. Afterwards, Ellinor avenges herself on Ruben by feeding Max\u2019s manuscript into the fire. Ruben accepts this destruction of someone else\u2019s book as a fair punishment, and \u2013 oddly \u2013 Ellinor decides to stay. This is all totally improbable, but the impossibility of the story seems quite deliberate. Ruben goes to his office each day, having observed some careful rituals of bathing and shaving. Ellinor approves of his rigorous personal hygiene. While Ruben is at work, she sifts through his possessions, trying to understand him. In this way, Ellinor unearths Ruben\u2019s secret stash of Michel Houellebecq novels. Ruben is obsessed with Houellebecq, and at times prefers him to Max. Later we discover that Max is obsessed with Houellebecq too, and also obsessed with the question of why people at times prefer Houellebecq to him. Ellinor starts reading Houellebecq as well, and becomes obsessed with him in a different way from Max and Ruben.

He warned that the glorification of the murder of police officers even 100 years ago in the first shots of the Irish war of independence helped \u201cradicalise the young people of today\u201d and excused the murder of his officers in the 21st century.

President calls Senate opposition to tariff plan \u2018foolish\u2019 Donald Trump is facing rare opposition from Senate Republicans over his plan to impose tariffs on Mexican imports in an attempt to force Mexico to do more to tackle illegal immigration. Trump said the Senate would be foolish to try to thwart the tariffs, which are due to take effect next week, as the World Bank released a report suggesting global investment has plummeted as a result of the president\u2019s trade wars with Mexico and China. Dream bill. The Democrat-controlled House passed a bill on Tuesday that would give about 2 million immigrants the possibility of acquiring citizenship. The law has close to zero chance of enactment. The Beast. Despite Trump and the Mexican government\u2019s efforts at a crackdown, Central American migrants are still making their way northonboard the freight train, as David Agren reports from southern Mexico. Trump backtracks on NHS remarks on UK visit On the final day of his state visit to Britain, Trump joins several other world leaders in Portsmouth to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the D-day landings. In an interview released on Wednesday morning, he rowed back on his previous remarks that the UK\u2019s National Health Service would be on the table in a post-Brexit trade negotiation. Climate talks. In a meeting with Prince Charles, during which the heir to the throne pressed him on environmental issues, Trump said he blamed other nations for the climate crisis, insisting the US was \u201camong the cleanest climates\u201d. Leadership material. During the visit, Trump has met Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove, two of the Conservative ministers vying to replace Theresa May as prime minister. \u201cYou have a lot of good people running,\u201d he told ITV\u2019s Piers Morgan. Doctors: calling abortion bans \u2018heartbeat bills\u2019 is misleading The biggest professional group in the US for doctors who specialise in women\u2019s health has come out against the term \u201cfetal heartbeat bill\u201d to describe abortion bans, saying it is not medically accurate. Bans on abortions after the sixth week of pregnancy, which were recently passed by several US states, are arbitrary, said Dr Ted Anderson, the president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which represents 58,000 physicians across the country. Clinical understanding. Six-week abortion bans that \u201cuse the term \u2018heartbeat\u2019 to define the gestational development being targeted do not reflect medical accuracy or clinical understanding\u201d, Anderson said. Homeless population of Los Angeles rises dramatically The homeless population of Los Angeles has gone up by 16% in the past year. An annual report released on Tuesday found more than 36,000 homeless people in the city and almost 59,000 across Los Angeles county. The city, which contains some of the wealthiest neighbourhoods in the US, is also home to the Skid Row district, where thousands live in tents, cars and shelters yards from the skyscrapers of Downtown.

Crib sheet Police in the Northern Territory of Australia have announced a review of the state\u2019s parole rules after a man wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet following his recent prison release allegedly killed four people on a shooting rampage in Darwin. Despite economic growth across Africa, almost half of the continent\u2019s child deaths are a result of hunger, and one in three African children are stunted due to malnutrition, an Ethiopian thinktank has said. Cardinal George Pell, the former Vatican treasurer who is the most senior Catholic to have been jailed for child sexual abuse, has begun an appeal against his conviction. A \u201ccontrolled explosion\u201d on the set of the new James Bond movie at Pinewood Studios in London has injured a crew member and damaged the 007 soundstage. Must-reads Seeking respect in \u2018back-row America\u2019 For his new book, Dignity, the photographer Chris Arnade captured life in the poor communities of what he describes as \u201cback-row America\u201d. In many such towns, he found, McDonald\u2019s served as the de facto community centre, a space where people \u201ccould be themselves on their own terms\u201d. Why Eric Garner\u2019s family are still waiting for justice Eric Garner died as a result of an alleged police chokehold in Staten Island in 2014. Five years later, despite nationwide protests, millions of dollars in compensation and a disciplinary hearing, no one has been held accountable. \u201cThere is no justice at all for Eric,\u201d Garner\u2019s mother tells Oliver Laughland. How a dog became mayor of a California town The mayor of Idyllwild, California, took office at just 11 weeks old and conducts his duties in the nude. He is, however, a very good boy. Matthew Cantor talks to Mayor Maximus Mighty-Dog Mueller II, a golden retriever more popular than most human politicians. How to beat the $200bn medicine counterfeiters Thousands of people in Africa dye each year after treating diseases such as malaria and pneumonia with fake and ineffective medicines. Helen Lock reports on how health workers and campaigners are fighting the fakes, including with the use of blockchain technology.

      "body": "<p>Writing about pariahs lets an author explore the lives of individuals persecuted for their beliefs or desires and who are branded dangerous traitors or misfits. In my case, I cherish the chance to write about people whose voices have been systematically silenced \u2013 and who have vanished from official histories.</p> <p>In my four decades of reading about Jesus, I have often been struck by how his Judaism is swept aside or characterised in prejudicial terms. One of the reasons I wrote my novel <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/gospel-according-to-lazarus-9780720620627.html\">The Gospel According to Lazarus</a><em> </em>was to give him back his Judaism \u2013 to permit him to be what he was, a Jewish mystic and healer.</p> <p>In my version of Saint John\u2019s story of resurrection, Lazarus becomes a pariah because local authorities regard his revival as dangerous proof of Jesus\u2019s astonishing healing powers and spiritual mastery. Forced to flee Jerusalem, he goes into exile on the island of Rhodes. Many years later, he discovers that Jesus\u2019s message has become distorted by his followers. Profoundly disappointed and angry, he decides to risk his life and return home in order to voice his own unique perspective on his old friend\u2019s mission.</p> <p>Here are my 10 favourite novels about pariahs.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://sfbook.com/sirius.htm\">Sirius by Olaf Stapledon</a><br></strong>What if you found yourself the only representative of your species in the world? Such is the cruel destiny of Sirius, a genetically enhanced dog with human-level intelligence. Raised at the Welsh home of the geneticist who creates him, he forms a loving bond with his human sister, Plaxy. Stapledon beautifully explores the ways that Sirius\u2019s supersensitive nose informs his relationships and opinions. Disgusted by the miseries of war created by the planet\u2019s dominant species, he decides to make a solitary life for himself beyond human conventions, incurring the wrath of those who regard him as a genetically engineered freak.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/26/how-philip-roth-wrote-america\">I Married a Communist by Philip Roth</a><br></strong>Starting in the 1990s, Philip Roth began to explore the fall from grace of protagonists who run afoul of American mores and politics. In this, his 21st novel<em>,</em> he deftly explores the shattering effect of Senator McCarthy\u2019s anticommunist crusade on the country\u2019s insecure Jewish community. The story focuses on radio icon Ira Ringold. When he is accused of inserting leftist propaganda into his scripts, his vengeful wife threatens to reveal his secret allegiances.

His attraction to down-and-out misfits and sadomasochism seems to rule that out until he falls in love with a married father of six.

There, his rebellious antics, zest for life and sexual allure put him in conflict with the despotic and puritanical head of his ward, Nurse Ratched, who comes to see him as a disruptive misfit and rival. McMurphy soon earns her fury by encouraging his fellow patients to live more adventurously, and though readers know that he is unlikely to win this battle of wills, the length to which Ratched goes to ensure victory still comes as a terrible shock.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n21/mark-greif/black-and-white-life\">Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison</a><br></strong>The unnamed African American narrator of this groundbreaking 1952 novel begins his often grim and violent tale by describing how he has sought refuge in a hidden, underground room in New York City. In flashback, he reveals how racial prejudice and personal betrayals transformed him from an enthusiastic university student into a homeless and hounded outlaw.

Christmas has light skin but his adoptive parents led him to believe that he has African American heritage, and this damning secret has created in him a seething self-loathing. When the home of his reclusive lover is burned down, the sheriff initiates a manhunt for Christmas. Will our protagonist end up spending the rest of his life in prison?

      "bodyText": "Writing about pariahs lets an author explore the lives of individuals persecuted for their beliefs or desires and who are branded dangerous traitors or misfits. In my case, I cherish the chance to write about people whose voices have been systematically silenced \u2013 and who have vanished from official histories. In my four decades of reading about Jesus, I have often been struck by how his Judaism is swept aside or characterised in prejudicial terms. One of the reasons I wrote my novel The Gospel According to Lazarus was to give him back his Judaism \u2013 to permit him to be what he was, a Jewish mystic and healer. In my version of Saint John\u2019s story of resurrection, Lazarus becomes a pariah because local authorities regard his revival as dangerous proof of Jesus\u2019s astonishing healing powers and spiritual mastery. Forced to flee Jerusalem, he goes into exile on the island of Rhodes. Many years later, he discovers that Jesus\u2019s message has become distorted by his followers. Profoundly disappointed and angry, he decides to risk his life and return home in order to voice his own unique perspective on his old friend\u2019s mission. Here are my 10 favourite novels about pariahs. 1. Sirius by Olaf Stapledon What if you found yourself the only representative of your species in the world? Such is the cruel destiny of Sirius, a genetically enhanced dog with human-level intelligence. Raised at the Welsh home of the geneticist who creates him, he forms a loving bond with his human sister, Plaxy. Stapledon beautifully explores the ways that Sirius\u2019s supersensitive nose informs his relationships and opinions. Disgusted by the miseries of war created by the planet\u2019s dominant species, he decides to make a solitary life for himself beyond human conventions, incurring the wrath of those who regard him as a genetically engineered freak. 2. I Married a Communist by Philip Roth Starting in the 1990s, Philip Roth began to explore the fall from grace of protagonists who run afoul of American mores and politics. In this, his 21st novel, he deftly explores the shattering effect of Senator McCarthy\u2019s anticommunist crusade on the country\u2019s insecure Jewish community. The story focuses on radio icon Ira Ringold. When he is accused of inserting leftist propaganda into his scripts, his vengeful wife threatens to reveal his secret allegiances. Roth\u2019s conflicted, many-layered characters give this work memorable force. 3. The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne The Puritans of New England subjected unwed mothers to public humiliations, and in Hawthorne\u2019s 19th-century masterpiece, Hester Prynne is made to wear an embroidered letter \u201cA\u201d (for adulteress) on her dress and live a solitary existence. She refuses to identify the father to authorities, but we soon discover that he is a local minister. What\u2019s so tragic to the contemporary reader is that we know that such a courageous and intelligent woman would flourish in more tolerant times. 4. The Story of Harold by Terry Andrews The narrator of this fictional autobiography is a compassionate, witty and wildly promiscuous children\u2019s book author and resident of pre-Aids Greenwich Village who discovers that he is most drawn to what he cannot have \u2013 a family and kids. His attraction to down-and-out misfits and sadomasochism seems to rule that out until he falls in love with a married father of six. When that relationship comes undone, however, Terry slides into suicidal depression. His narration is charged with magical exuberance, and his black humour bursts the confines of prose and emerges as a sharply ironic kind of poetry. 5. One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest by Ken Kesey While serving a prison term for assault, Randle McMurphy fakes insanity in order to win a transfer to a psychiatric hospital. There, his rebellious antics, zest for life and sexual allure put him in conflict with the despotic and puritanical head of his ward, Nurse Ratched, who comes to see him as a disruptive misfit and rival.

Light in August by William Faulkner Faulkner\u2019s fictional Mississippi always has its share of wretched outcasts, but the one who draws our attention in this complex, tangled narrative is Joe Christmas, a violent bootlegger. Christmas has light skin but his adoptive parents led him to believe that he has African American heritage, and this damning secret has created in him a seething self-loathing. When the home of his reclusive lover is burned down, the sheriff initiates a manhunt for Christmas. Will our protagonist end up spending the rest of his life in prison? Alas, Faulkner has more brutal plans in store for him. 8.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s services sector failed to keep the economy afloat last month, registering a modest increase in activity that was not enough to offset falling output in the manufacturing and construction sectors. The IHS Markit purchasing managers index (PMI) for the services sector, which mainly covers business-to-business activity, increased to a three-month high of 51 in May from 50.4 in April, following a rise in domestic orders. A figure above 50 indicates growth. IHS Markit said a combination of the services, manufacturing and construction sector surveys indicated that the economy was at its weakest since 2012. To emphasise the point, the figures showed that a year-long slump in export orders persisted in May, highlighting the difficulties UK exporters are facing as Brexit uncertainty continues through the summer. The PMI showed that new export business began to shrink last September and has failed to recover since then. In May the index showed that new business exports stood at 48.2. A global slowdown in trade on the back of the tit-for-tat trade war between the US and China is also understood to have played a part in the general slowdown in export activity. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, described the sector as having little momentum, with companies reporting that \u201cactivity, order books and hiring were all subdued by a combination of weak demand \u2013 both in domestic and overseas markets \u2013 and Brexit-related uncertainty\u201d. \u201cAlthough service sector business activity gained a little momentum in May, with growth reaching a three-month high, the pace of expansion remained disappointingly muted and failed to offset a marked deterioration in manufacturing performance and a fall in output of the construction industry during the month,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, the PMI surveys collectively indicated that the UK economy remained close to stagnation midway through the second quarter as a result, registering one of the weakest performances since 2012.\u201d Staffing levels rebounded in May after a drop in employment in April, though the rate of job creation remained modest. The survey indicated that higher job numbers were linked to firms pressing ahead with long-term business expansion plans and efforts to boost operating capacity, the report said. Earlier this week the manufacturing PMI tumbled from from 53.1 points in April to 49.4 in May, while the construction PMI showed the sector contracted in May after a mild recovery earlier in the year.",

      "bodyText": "The ABC has confirmed David Speers will join the public broadcaster to host Insiders \u2013 but not until 2020 as Sky News has insisted he work out the remainder of his contract. Almost two weeks after Guardian Australia revealed the political journalist had accepted an offer to join the ABC to replace Barrie Cassidy, Sky News broke its silence and admitted Speers had resigned. Sky News chief executive officer Paul Whittaker said Speers would continue on-air as political editor and anchor of Speers and Speers on Sunday until the end of his contract early next year. \u201cDavid is an exceptional and highly respected journalist and one of Australia\u2019s most insightful political interviewers,\u201d Whittaker said. \u201cHis highly decorated career has seen him chosen to host leaders\u2019 debates and forums at the last six federal elections, as well as cover the last four US presidential elections.\u201d The ABC welcomed Speers and said its journalists Annabel Crabb and Fran Kelly would fill in for him on Insiders for the remainder of the year. Cassidy\u2019s farewell show is on Sunday 9 June. Speers, who has remained silent on his defection until now, revealed he never missed an episode of Insiders. \u201cInsiders is essential viewing if you\u2019re interested in politics and understanding how Australia is being led,\u201d Speers said. \u201cI never miss it. To be able to take over from a legend, Barrie Cassidy, and present the program is an honour and a terrific opportunity.\u201d Speers, who lives in Canberra, will move to Melbourne where the program is produced and will work with executive producer Sam Clark. ABC news director Gaven Morris said Speers was a worthy successor to Cassidy. \u201cDavid is a terrific journalist and presenter, an astute political observer and a great talent,\u201d Morris said. \u201cHe joins Australia\u2019s best and most trusted political journalism team.\u201d Whittaker said Speers had made an outstanding contribution to Australian journalism and Sky News and wished him well. The 44-year-old, who has won two Walkley Awards, an AACTA Subscription Television Award, a Kennedy Award and ten ASTRA Awards, is taking a pay cut of some $200,000 to join the ABC. He is the highest paid presenter at Rupert Murdoch\u2019s pay TV operation, where sources say he is on $680,000. Widely admired for his razor-sharp interviews with politicians, Speers has managed to keep his reputation as a fair minded journalist despite being the face of the right-wing channel.",

One of the victims, a PhD student and taxi driver Hassan Baydoun, had never met the accused gunman, his cousin says. Baydoun had been driving his taxi but returned home to his studio apartment in McMinn Street on Tuesday evening for a meal break. He was there at the time the gunman was going from room to room inside the building, firing his gun and shouting the name of a man \u2013 Alex \u2013 according to witness Matthew James. Baydoun, 33, moved to Darwin from Lebanon 10 years ago, his cousin and fellow Darwin resident Abdallah Salman said.

The 27-year-old Denmark midfielder, who has been at Spurs since 2013, has one year to run on his current contract and has shown no inclination to renew for another cycle in north London.</p> <p>Spurs cannot afford to allow him to run down his deal and leave as a free agent next summer, given his high value at arguably the peak of his career and the fact they have repayments to make on their new stadium. Consequently, they have let it be known in recent weeks he would be available at a price, albeit an extremely high one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/jun/04/football-transfer-window-2019-every-summer-deal-from-europe-top-five-leagues\">Transfer window 2019 \u2013 every summer deal from Europe's top five leagues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Daniel Levy, the chairman, has quoted \u00a3130m for him, which might seem like wishful thinking but it offers an impression of where he is drawing the lines for negotiations. Eriksen has repeatedly refused to discuss his next move with reporters and last week, in the buildup to Spurs\u2019 Champions League final against Liverpool, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/01/tottenham-liverpool-champions-league-final-match-report\">which they </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/01/tottenham-liverpool-champions-league-final-match-report\">lost 2-0</a>, he turned on his heel and left one interview when asked about his future.</p> <p>\u201cI feel that I am at a stage of my career where I would like to try something new,\u201d Eriksen told the <a href=\"https://ekstrabladet.dk/sport/fodbold/udenlandsk_fodbold/engelsk_fodbold/PremierLeague/nu-taler-eriksen-om-fremtiden-jeg-vil-proeve-noget-nyt/7661012\">Danish newspaper</a><a href=\"https://ekstrabladet.dk/sport/fodbold/udenlandsk_fodbold/engelsk_fodbold/PremierLeague/nu-taler-eriksen-om-fremtiden-jeg-vil-proeve-noget-nyt/7661012\"> Ekstra Bladet</a>. \u201cI have the deepest respect for everything that is happening at Tottenham and it would not be something negative to stay.

      "bodyText": "Christian Eriksen has confirmed the worst kept secret at Tottenham: that he wants to take on a new challenge at another club this summer. The 27-year-old Denmark midfielder, who has been at Spurs since 2013, has one year to run on his current contract and has shown no inclination to renew for another cycle in north London. Spurs cannot afford to allow him to run down his deal and leave as a free agent next summer, given his high value at arguably the peak of his career and the fact they have repayments to make on their new stadium. Consequently, they have let it be known in recent weeks he would be available at a price, albeit an extremely high one. Daniel Levy, the chairman, has quoted \u00a3130m for him, which might seem like wishful thinking but it offers an impression of where he is drawing the lines for negotiations. Eriksen has repeatedly refused to discuss his next move with reporters and last week, in the buildup to Spurs\u2019 Champions League final against Liverpool, which they lost 2-0, he turned on his heel and left one interview when asked about his future. \u201cI feel that I am at a stage of my career where I would like to try something new,\u201d Eriksen told the Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet. \u201cI have the deepest respect for everything that is happening at Tottenham and it would not be something negative to stay. But I have also said that I would like to try something new. \u201cI hope that something will be decided this summer. That is the plan. In football you never know when there could be a decision like that. It could be at any point. The best thing is always for it to happen quickly but in football things take time.\u201d Eriksen has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid, who are looking to add marquee signings this summer for Zinedine Zidane after a desperately disappointing season. \u201cReal Madrid is a step up but then it would take Real Madrid picking up the phone and making contact with Tottenham and say that they want Christian,\u201d Eriksen said. \u201cAnd that they haven\u2019t done as far as I know. \u201cIt all depends on Daniel Levy and there has to be another club too. Or I will sit down myself at the table and negotiate a new contract. You can\u2019t set a date yourself. There aren\u2019t many boxes that Tottenham don\u2019t tick so if I have to move away, it would have to be a step up.\u201d Eriksen was asked whether he would seek to run down his contract. \u201cThat is difficult to say,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt depends on the possibilities.

The AFP said the story published information that was \u201cclassified as an official secret\u201d which had the potential to undermine Australia\u2019s national security.

However, neither app offers an option for safety, or \u201cnight\u201d mode. This may seem like an unfair request, or too demanding of an ask. But CityMapper already offers a \u201crain safe\u201d and \u201cstep-free\u201d mode, even a \u201ccold safe\u201d mode. And when you consider both apps often offer routes to users that direct them down pitch-black paths at night, an option that at least considered street lighting wouldn\u2019t go amiss.</p> <p>A greater focus on safer routes at night has been flagged by concerned users for years. Most recently, a woman tweeted her experience, saying CityMapper\u2019s suggested route left her stranded, after she missed the last train home. Lil Patuck, who works in tech herself, said if CityMapper had told her it was the last train, she\u2018d have taken the bus, and would have avoided walking alone. The app then directed her through deserted roads and \u201cdark, creepy alleyways\u201d late at night.</p> <p>Pauck <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LilPatuck/status/1117755106781429762\">tweeted</a>: \u201cWhoever leads, tech needs sensitive responsible design \u2013 ie rather than telling a user to \u2018go catch this train\u2019, also tell them: \u2018It\u2019s the last one \u2013 are you sure? Here\u2019s a safe alternative.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>While CityMapper and Google Maps haven\u2019t announced plans to introduce any form of \u201csafe\u201d or \u201cnight\u201d mode for users, others in the tech space are trying to answer safety concerns for women.</p> <p>In the US, Lexie Ernst and Jake Wayne founded the app Companion, which lets you enter a destination, and then add friends and family to monitor your journey home. The duo created the app for both men and women in mind, and while it doesn\u2019t provide a safe route option, it does allow users to request help from those nearby, and be able to call 911 with one tap.</p> <p>And last year, Jillian Kowalchuk, 32, launched the app <a href=\"https://www.safeandthecity.com/\">Safe &amp; The City</a>, aimed at women. The app rates routes based on practical elements, such as street safety and lighting, whether nearby businesses are open, and if crimes have been reported to the police in the area.</p> <p>Kowalchuk <a href=\"https://www.inyourarea.co.uk/news/meet-the-female-tech-start-up-founders-making-waves-in-stratford/\">has spoken about</a> the challenges she faced in developing an app concerning women\u2019s safety, and as a founder. \u201cAs a female founder I often find I am one of a few in the tech sector. I have found it a challenge. I was a bit naive about the ecosystem I was coming into \u2013 I had a few situations where I was sexually harassed by investors or developers.\u201d</p> <p>Kowalchuk is hoping to fill a void in the tech space, listening to women and building on their feedback.</p> <p>Still, while some women are addressing gender-specific safety concerns in the tech space, the launch of previous safety apps has shown us there\u2019s still a need for women from different backgrounds and ethnicities to be behind the making of these apps, too.</p> <p>In 2014, the app SketchFactor launched, allowing users to report having seen or experienced something, or seen someone, they deemed to be \u201csketchy\u201d in a particular location, and add their rating, so users can then avoid those areas.</p> <p>The app caused huge controversy in the US, as critics argued the term \u201csketchy\u201d is a dog whistle for \u201cminorities\u201d, and what users interpreted as \u201csketchy\u201d would <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-to-do-when-your-app-is-racist\">encourage racial profiling</a>. The two founders, who are white, denied their app would be used by other white people to avoid black neighbourhoods.</p> <p>Including reported crime incidents is one thing for tech founders to consider in their app. But asking users to rate the \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d of the people around them, or of a neighbourhood \u2013 like the Safe &amp; The City app encourages \u2013 is at risk of facing the same criticism SketchFactor faced.</p> <p>A safety app isn\u2019t a sure-fire way to protect women from a possible attack or assault. And a \u201cnight mode\u201d isn\u2019t going to stop women from being followed or harassed. But to have these tools \u2013 and to have a more diverse pool of women behind the making of them \u2013 would still be useful. So the next time we tell a friend \u201cget home safe\u201d at the end of a night, we can be somewhat less worrisome.</p>",

Lil Patuck, who works in tech herself, said if CityMapper had told her it was the last train, she\u2018d have taken the bus, and would have avoided walking alone. The app then directed her through deserted roads and \u201cdark, creepy alleyways\u201d late at night. Pauck tweeted: \u201cWhoever leads, tech needs sensitive responsible design \u2013 ie rather than telling a user to \u2018go catch this train\u2019, also tell them: \u2018It\u2019s the last one \u2013 are you sure? Here\u2019s a safe alternative.\u2019\u201d While CityMapper and Google Maps haven\u2019t announced plans to introduce any form of \u201csafe\u201d or \u201cnight\u201d mode for users, others in the tech space are trying to answer safety concerns for women. In the US, Lexie Ernst and Jake Wayne founded the app Companion, which lets you enter a destination, and then add friends and family to monitor your journey home. The duo created the app for both men and women in mind, and while it doesn\u2019t provide a safe route option, it does allow users to request help from those nearby, and be able to call 911 with one tap. And last year, Jillian Kowalchuk, 32, launched the app Safe &amp; The City, aimed at women. The app rates routes based on practical elements, such as street safety and lighting, whether nearby businesses are open, and if crimes have been reported to the police in the area. Kowalchuk has spoken about the challenges she faced in developing an app concerning women\u2019s safety, and as a founder. \u201cAs a female founder I often find I am one of a few in the tech sector. I have found it a challenge. I was a bit naive about the ecosystem I was coming into \u2013 I had a few situations where I was sexually harassed by investors or developers.\u201d Kowalchuk is hoping to fill a void in the tech space, listening to women and building on their feedback. Still, while some women are addressing gender-specific safety concerns in the tech space, the launch of previous safety apps has shown us there\u2019s still a need for women from different backgrounds and ethnicities to be behind the making of these apps, too. In 2014, the app SketchFactor launched, allowing users to report having seen or experienced something, or seen someone, they deemed to be \u201csketchy\u201d in a particular location, and add their rating, so users can then avoid those areas. The app caused huge controversy in the US, as critics argued the term \u201csketchy\u201d is a dog whistle for \u201cminorities\u201d, and what users interpreted as \u201csketchy\u201d would encourage racial profiling. The two founders, who are white, denied their app would be used by other white people to avoid black neighbourhoods. Including reported crime incidents is one thing for tech founders to consider in their app. But asking users to rate the \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d of the people around them, or of a neighbourhood \u2013 like the Safe &amp; The City app encourages \u2013 is at risk of facing the same criticism SketchFactor faced. A safety app isn\u2019t a sure-fire way to protect women from a possible attack or assault. And a \u201cnight mode\u201d isn\u2019t going to stop women from being followed or harassed. But to have these tools \u2013 and to have a more diverse pool of women behind the making of them \u2013 would still be useful. So the next time we tell a friend \u201cget home safe\u201d at the end of a night, we can be somewhat less worrisome.",

She writes, she says, \u201cto unlock the code of silence that I kept for so many years \u2026 so that I can, at last, feel present in my own life.\u201d The book opens with a wry, shocking account of finding her alcoholic father \u201cin a small pool of his own shit\u201d in a run-down Greek hospital: \u201cAfter years of teaching Beckett plays, I am finally living in one.\u201d Elsewhere she explores the silences and shame associated with growing up in a female body: lifelong sexism and female conditioning, taboos around menstruation, the \u201chunger regime\u201d of her troubled adolescence, and her \u201cwild child\u201d years identifiable only in retrospect as a time of neglect and sexual exploitation. The medics\u2019 obfuscation around her miscarriage and the oddity of being the child of separated parents in a country without divorce are particularly Irish experiences, but what is most striking about the collection as a whole is its universality. These are not new stories, but they still urgently need to be told. Pine does so with an honesty and vigour that are always uplifting, despite her painful material. \u2022 Notes to Self: Essays is published by Penguin (RRP \u00a39.99) .

It\u2019s been a total joy to look back through piles of old photo albums and scrapbooks and to reflect upon what it meant at the time, and the incredible evolution of the event.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the book, Michael Eavis discusses the festival\u2019s precarious existence and the resulting learning curve, including his various run-ins with the council and the police. Emily, who began assisting her father with the running of the festival after the death of her mother Jean in 1999, discusses among other issues the difficulty of the 2008 festival, when Noel Gallagher questioned Jay-Z\u2019s right to headline the festival as a hip-hop performer and tickets didn\u2019t sell out until after the gates had opened.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc757d66eb3e612e4a6e98a8680445380b7175aa\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc757d66eb3e612e4a6e98a8680445380b7175aa/0_0_2870_3497/821.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of Glastonbury 50.\" width=\"821\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cover of Glastonbury 50.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Trapeze</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Glastonbury 50 begins in September 1970, the day after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jimi-hendrix\">Jimi Hendrix</a>\u2019s death, when Michael Eavis invited 1,000 Somerset revellers to Pilton Pop, Blues &amp; Folk festival on Worthy Farm, charging \u00a31 a ticket for a bill including a headline slot by T Rex, and offering festival-goers free milk from his cows.</p> \n<p>Inspired by the Bath festival of blues and progressive music earlier that year, Eavis told his wife Jean he was going to stage a similar event. \u201cIf I remember rightly, her reply was, \u2018Don\u2019t be silly, you\u2019ve no idea how,\u2019\u201d he recalls in an exclusive extract from the book, available below.</p> \n<p>The festival\u2019s identity soon started taking shape: the first year featured the hippy-oriented Green Fields, which remain a key part of modern Glastonbury. In 1971, the main stage was renamed \u2013 and rebuilt \u2013 as an early incarnation of the Pyramid stage known today. Glastonbury was held sporadically in the 70s before becoming an annual fixture (with occasional fallow years) during the 80s, when its political affiliations with Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and later Oxfam, Greenpeace and WaterAid began.</p> \n<p>The book will feature stories from key figures throughout the festival\u2019s history, including Jay-Z, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/adele\">Adele</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/dolly-parton\">Dolly Parton</a>, Lars Ulrich of Metallica, Chris Martin of Coldplay, Noel Gallagher, Pulp\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jarvis-cocker\">Jarvis Cocker</a>, Billy Bragg, Peter Hook of New Order, John Cooper Clarke and Suzanne Vega.</p> \n<p>The Chemical Brothers \u2013 whose 1994 Glastonbury headline set was one of the festival\u2019s first to be televised nationally and was credited with helping bring rave and dance music into the mainstream \u2013 will also contribute.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e07ef0c6f4f2ee4aa0910d2eb5b61da2706645de\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e07ef0c6f4f2ee4aa0910d2eb5b61da2706645de/0_226_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adele performing at Glastonbury, 25 June 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adele performing at Glastonbury in 2016.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Short/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Artists Banksy, Stanley Donwood (who designed the book\u2019s cover art) and Kurt Jackson also appear in Glastonbury 50, alongside writers including Caitlin Moran and Lauren Laverne.

The festival was held intermittently until 1979, when it became a (largely) annual event, and Eavis now organises it with his daughter Emily through the company Glastonbury Festivals Limited. (From 2002 until 2012, promoter Melvin Benn assisted the Eavises with operations and licensing.) Emily and her husband Nick Dewey book the acts for the main stages and oversee the management of the festival's many areas. Each year, the festival donates around \u00a32 million to Oxfam, Greenpeace and WaterAid.

I discovered Radio Luxembourg when I was at boarding school, and I\u2019d listen to it every Sunday night, when Pete Murray and David Jacobs were on. Bill Haley and Bob Dylan captured my imagination, and although I never really went to concerts, I fell in love with pop music.</p> \n <p>Before I met Jean, I\u2019d rigged up a very primitive sound system to play music to myself and the cows in the parlour. It was a nine-foot-long pipe connected to a speaker and it made a hell of a sound. I used to play Lola by the Kinks a lot \u2013 that was our big milking song. One day in 1970, our baker lady who used to deliver bread to the farm arrived late. She told me it was because she\u2019d been held up in all the traffic going to the Blues festival. I had no idea what she was talking about. She told me it was this big event happening at the Bath &amp; West Showground, a few miles from the farmhouse, and there were millions of people coming for it. \u201cThat sounds amazing!\u201d I said, to which she replied, \u201cNo, it\u2019s horrible!\u201d</p> \n <p>Jean and I agreed that we should go there on the Sunday, after chapel, and it was absolutely incredible. They had Led Zeppelin and Moody Blues and all these west coast American bands. It was the whole flower-power era, and all the girls and blokes looked amazing. It was a very lovey-dovey affair, and emotional, too. I\u2019d never seen anything like it before \u2013 it just hit me for six. We were watching Moody Blues, who were playing Question, which is a belter of a song, and I turned to Jean and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to do one of these on the farm!\u201d If I remember rightly, her reply was, \u201cDon\u2019t be silly, you\u2019ve no idea how.\u201d</p> \n</blockquote> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/29/glastonbury-festival-2019-lineup-stage-times-headliners-stormzy-killers-cure-lewis-capaldi\">Glastonbury festival 2019: full lineup and stage times announced</a> </p> \n</aside>",

      "bodyText": "Glastonbury founder Michael Eavis and co-organiser Emily Eavis will tell the official story of the world-famous music and arts festival in a new book published to mark next year\u2019s 50th edition. Emily Eavis told the Guardian: \u201cWith our 50th anniversary fast approaching, we felt now was the time to put all of our memories and stories together in one place. It\u2019s been a total joy to look back through piles of old photo albums and scrapbooks and to reflect upon what it meant at the time, and the incredible evolution of the event.\u201d In the book, Michael Eavis discusses the festival\u2019s precarious existence and the resulting learning curve, including his various run-ins with the council and the police. Emily, who began assisting her father with the running of the festival after the death of her mother Jean in 1999, discusses among other issues the difficulty of the 2008 festival, when Noel Gallagher questioned Jay-Z\u2019s right to headline the festival as a hip-hop performer and tickets didn\u2019t sell out until after the gates had opened. Glastonbury 50 begins in September 1970, the day after Jimi Hendrix\u2019s death, when Michael Eavis invited 1,000 Somerset revellers to Pilton Pop, Blues &amp; Folk festival on Worthy Farm, charging \u00a31 a ticket for a bill including a headline slot by T Rex, and offering festival-goers free milk from his cows. Inspired by the Bath festival of blues and progressive music earlier that year, Eavis told his wife Jean he was going to stage a similar event. \u201cIf I remember rightly, her reply was, \u2018Don\u2019t be silly, you\u2019ve no idea how,\u2019\u201d he recalls in an exclusive extract from the book, available below. The festival\u2019s identity soon started taking shape: the first year featured the hippy-oriented Green Fields, which remain a key part of modern Glastonbury. In 1971, the main stage was renamed \u2013 and rebuilt \u2013 as an early incarnation of the Pyramid stage known today. Glastonbury was held sporadically in the 70s before becoming an annual fixture (with occasional fallow years) during the 80s, when its political affiliations with Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and later Oxfam, Greenpeace and WaterAid began. The book will feature stories from key figures throughout the festival\u2019s history, including Jay-Z, Adele, Dolly Parton, Lars Ulrich of Metallica, Chris Martin of Coldplay, Noel Gallagher, Pulp\u2019s Jarvis Cocker, Billy Bragg, Peter Hook of New Order, John Cooper Clarke and Suzanne Vega. The Chemical Brothers \u2013 whose 1994 Glastonbury headline set was one of the festival\u2019s first to be televised nationally and was credited with helping bring rave and dance music into the mainstream \u2013 will also contribute. Artists Banksy, Stanley Donwood (who designed the book\u2019s cover art) and Kurt Jackson also appear in Glastonbury 50, alongside writers including Caitlin Moran and Lauren Laverne. The book features photography from the likes of Jill Furmanovsky, Brian Walker and Greg Williams. Glastonbury 50 is published on 31 October, four months after the 2019 edition of the festival, which will feature headline sets by Stormzy, the Killers and the Cure. Ticket prices have increased somewhat since the festival\u2019s first incarnation: tickets for this year cost \u00a3248. The festival\u2019s population has also grown, from 1,500 people in 1970 to almost 250,000 \u2013 still a slender proportion of the more than 3 million people who register to attend in the annual bunfight for tickets. This year\u2019s Glastonbury is the first to see organisers ban the sale of single-use plastic water bottles in an attempt to limit the spread of plastics in the oceans and the climate emergency. In 2017, festival-goers got through more than 1.3m plastic bottles. \u201cWhen you see images of the arena completely covered in old plastic bottles it\u2019s quite haunting,\u201d Emily Eavis told the Guardian in February. Organisers spent the 2018 fallow year planning the logistics of the ban, which covers suppliers, market managers, area organisers and the backstage area. Water will be available in recyclable cans. Attendees may bring single-use bottles on site, but are encouraged to bring reusable bottles, which will also be on sale at the festival. The move follows bans on plastic cutlery, plates, straws and cups initiated in previous years, along with sauces in single-serving sachets. Glastonbury caused controversy this week by rescinding an invitation to British punk band Killdren to perform at the festival after the Sunday Times drew attention to their song Kill Tory Scum (Before They Kill You), which includes the lyric: \u201cTory genocide is the perfect outcome.\u201d The duo defended the song as a \u201ccrude\u201d satire, and said it \u201cwould not exist at all if the destructive and violent policies of the Tory party hadn\u2019t taken such a long and devastating toll on the UK. The band does not condone the killing of Tories or children, or anyone for that matter \u2013 regardless of political beliefs.\u201d The organisers of the Shangri-La stage, which was due to host Killdren, said they \u201cin no way condone violence and will not allow this matter to overshadow the incredibly inclusive spirit of Glastonbury\u201d. Read an exclusive extract from Glastonbury 50, by Michael Eavis Music had always been a big part of my life. I discovered Radio Luxembourg when I was at boarding school, and I\u2019d listen to it every Sunday night, when Pete Murray and David Jacobs were on. Bill Haley and Bob Dylan captured my imagination, and although I never really went to concerts, I fell in love with pop music. Before I met Jean, I\u2019d rigged up a very primitive sound system to play music to myself and the cows in the parlour. It was a nine-foot-long pipe connected to a speaker and it made a hell of a sound. I used to play Lola by the Kinks a lot \u2013 that was our big milking song. One day in 1970, our baker lady who used to deliver bread to the farm arrived late. She told me it was because she\u2019d been held up in all the traffic going to the Blues festival. I had no idea what she was talking about. She told me it was this big event happening at the Bath &amp; West Showground, a few miles from the farmhouse, and there were millions of people coming for it. \u201cThat sounds amazing!\u201d I said, to which she replied, \u201cNo, it\u2019s horrible!\u201d Jean and I agreed that we should go there on the Sunday, after chapel, and it was absolutely incredible. They had Led Zeppelin and Moody Blues and all these west coast American bands. It was the whole flower-power era, and all the girls and blokes looked amazing. It was a very lovey-dovey affair, and emotional, too. I\u2019d never seen anything like it before \u2013 it just hit me for six. We were watching Moody Blues, who were playing Question, which is a belter of a song, and I turned to Jean and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to do one of these on the farm!\u201d If I remember rightly, her reply was, \u201cDon\u2019t be silly, you\u2019ve no idea how.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>NBA commissioner Adam Silver wants more female referees in the NBA. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how it was that it remained so male-dominated for so long,\u201d said Silver last month. And <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/article/2019/05/09/nba-adam-silver-female-referees-coaches\">Silver doesn\u2019t want to stop with referees</a>. \u201cThe goal going forward is that it should be roughly 50-50 of new officials entering in the league,\u201d he said. \u201cSame for coaches, by the way. We have a program, too. There\u2019s no reason why women shouldn\u2019t be coaching men\u2019s basketball.\u201d</p> <p>One would think the NBA can find plenty of qualified candidates among current and retired WNBA players. Of the six women with coaching experience in the NBA, all have ties to the WNBA. However, economic and cultural barriers remain that could limit the success of a WNBA to NBA coaching pathway.</p> <p>In collaboration with the National Basketball Coaches Association (NBCA), the NBA developed a plan to diversify the coaching pool. \u201cThis all starts with developing good talent and creating opportunities for people to become qualified. Quota systems don\u2019t work. They\u2019re ineffective, and we\u2019re not interested in that. We\u2019re interested in a level playing field with regard to development,\u201d the NBCA president and Dallas Mavericks head coach, Rick Carlisle, told the Guardian.</p> <p>Instead, the plan will include a declaration of equality, ongoing coaching development and the creation of a coaching database. \u201cOur goal with this is to \u2026 have detailed information on all the careers of all of our assistant coaches that will be valuable for teams formulating ideas on who they would want to hire, both as head coaches and assistant coaches,\u201d said Carlisle. He also hopes the database can incorporate interviews where each coach talks about their basketball journey.</p> <p>While these plans are admirable, there are problems. A two-day coaches\u2019 summit will be held at the start of July. It will be a valuable opportunity for coaches to network and talk to teams. The only problem: it conflicts with the WNBA season. That means the vast majority of WNBA coaches interested in moving to the NBA won\u2019t be able to participate.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the fact that getting a start as an female coach can be tough in the first place. Jenny Boucek is now an assistant coach with the NBA\u2019s Dallas Mavericks, but building up coaching experience in the WNBA after her playing career ended was not easy. \u201cWhen I started coaching in the WNBA, I got paid zero dollars. I knew I needed to learn and so my first job, I volunteered. When you get into pro sports, a lot of coaches have to start at the very bottom as video coordinator, or intern, or whatnot,\u201d she told the Guardian in a phone interview.</p> <p>While Boucek believes players need to be willing to make sacrifices, she also believes the WNBA and NBA can and should create more pathways to coaching for former players. WNBA teams carry two assistant coaching slots. With the Mavericks, Boucek is one of six assistants.</p> <p>WNBA coaches like Boucek and <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/women-coaching-men-why-not-a-successful-minnesota-coach/480273253/\">current Minnesota Lynx head coach Cheryl Reeve</a> have long advocated for the WNBA to create an additional coaching position for former players. \u201cThat was always tricky, because when I was a head coach, I had a huge passion to help develop former players as coaches. But it was a little bit of a dilemma because I only had two coaching spots,\u201d said Boucek of her four seasons as a WNBA head coach.</p> <p>If paid spots are limited in the WNBA, why don\u2019t more women go the route of Kristi Toliver? The 32-year-old combines a playing career with the Washington Mystics with an assistant coaching role at the Washington Wizards. Again, part of the answer is economic. WNBA teams have a budget of $50,000 to keep active WNBA players in-market, as opposed to having them play overseas where they can make upwards of five times their WNBA salaries. In Toliver\u2019s case, since the Mystics and Wizards share the same owner, she would have to be paid from that $50,000.</p> <p>Unfortunately, by the time the Wizards offered Toliver the role, only $10,000 from the budget was left. According to the New York Times, even at $50,000, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/sports/kristi-toliver-wizards-salary.html\">Toliver would have been paid 50% less</a> than the lowest-paid NBA assistant. Toliver accepted the role at $10,000, a tiny amount when some NBA assistant coaches make $1m a year.</p> <p>Despite scheduling conflicts and lower pay, there are six women, including Toliver and Boucek, with WNBA ties that have made their way to NBA sidelines. Lindsey Harding (Philadelphia 76ers), Nancy Lieberman (Sacramento Kings), and Becky Hammon (San Antonio Spurs) all played in the WNBA. Karen Stack Umlauf (Chicago Bulls) played in the Women\u2019s American Basketball Association, as well as abroad, before working as a WNBA analyst for the Chicago Sky.</p> <p>None of these women got their job through a database or coaching summit. In most cases, they were somehow on the radar of a NBA coach. There too lies an opportunity to help increase the amount of women coaching NBA teams. \u201cWhat I have learned in the short term is that [the NBA] is a relationships business. And you can really only have relationships with people that you\u2019re willing to go out and seek,\u201d ESPN analyst and former WNBA player Kara Lawson told the Guardian.</p> <p>But Lawson knows more than anyone that those relationships require work. During her playing career, she also worked as a studio analyst for Sacramento Kings\u2019 broadcasts. She wanted to sit in on team practices to get a better idea of how the players prepared for game but the Kings would not let her. Eventually, they let her sit behind a one-way mirror. The reason? \u201c[I would] distract the players, if I was sitting [on court],\u201d <a href=\"https://highposthoops.com/2017/04/04/kara-lawson-sacramento-kings-wnba/\">she told The Summit in 2017</a>.</p> <p>Today, she sees immense value in what Carlisle and the NBCA have committed to, but hopes the database in particular, will not just be another one-way mirror. \u201cI hope NBA teams will immerse themselves in the women\u2019s game more, so that they don\u2019t need a database to look at.

After all, the wedding is as fake as the flowers that frame the arch above us, and our marriage is for just one day.</p> <p>I\u2019m trying out Marry an Amsterdammer for the day, one of several activities suggested in the <a href=\"https://www.untouristguide.com/\" title=\"\">Untourist Guide to Amsterdam</a>, a book and website launched this week, in collaboration with the city marketing organisation <a href=\"https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/our-network/amsterdam-and-partners\">amsterdam&amp;partners</a>, and local businesses. It\u2019s packed with ideas for bringing tourists and locals together, and encouraging visitors to explore less-known parts of the city, as an antidote to the problems of overtourism. Other activities include a boat tour of the city guided by refugees, and fishing for plastic in the canal.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea is that tourists not only feed from the city, but can also build a connection with people who live here,\u201d says Jona Rens, founder of Wed and Walk, the shop-cum-chapel in Amsterdam\u2019s De Pijp district where Julian and I make pledges to the city as well as to each other, and where Jona has been conducting kitsch mock weddings since 2015.</p> <p>Last year, about 21 million people visited Amsterdam. Attempts to handle such numbers has have resulted in campaigns like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/may/29/amsterdam-gets-tough-on-antisocial-behaviour-from-british-tourists-stag-parties\" title=\"\">Enjoy and Respect</a>, launched in June 2018, dishing out steep fines for nuisances such as littering and urinating in public.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27f68cec3870f8a641434d635d42955f56caa570\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27f68cec3870f8a641434d635d42955f56caa570/0_0_3189_1914/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The idea of fake marriages came from Wed and Walk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The idea of fake marriages came from Wed and Walk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sofie Kramer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Untourist Guide takes a refreshingly positive approach. Social innovator Elena Simons, one of the authors of the book, describes this influx of people from all over the world as \u201ca really exciting opportunity\u201d. She says: \u201cLet\u2019s do something with all that energy, all that diversity \u2013 something good for mankind and enjoyable at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday (5 June), a mass wedding between tourists and Amsterdammers will take place at <a href=\"https://uniquevenuesofamsterdam.com/posthoornkerk/\" title=\"\">Posthoorn church</a> (close to Central Station) and, from June to January, visitors can bid, starting at \u20ac100, for a different listed bride or groom each month, who will introduce them to a new aspect of Amsterdam life during their one-day honeymoon. Shamiro, the city\u2019s current <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/21/night-mayor-amsterdam-holland-mirik-milan-night-time-commission\" title=\"\">night </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/21/night-mayor-amsterdam-holland-mirik-milan-night-time-commission\" title=\"\">mayor</a>, will take visitors to off-beat late-night spots, for example, while Natascha, an urban farmer, will introduce you to her favourite green spaces around town. Friends and family can come too, as long as the amount of money bid covers the activities and there\u2019s something left for the chosen charity of your bride or groom.</p> <p>My marrying Julian for the day probably isn\u2019t going to make Amsterdam a better place but, symbolically, this union between a resident and a tourist does have a strange poignancy. The red aisle that I walk down, the music, and the exchanging of thrift-store rings creates a powerful mood \u2013 although it\u2019s a hug, not a kiss, that seals the ceremony.</p> <p>As we sign the register, the sun appears, and we take our first steps outside as a \u201cmarried\u201d couple. Drivers honk us, a French tourist stops to take photographs, and Julian, who is charming and relaxed throughout, gets his guitar out and serenades me with Ed Sheeran\u2019s Thinking Out Loud.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a858a564e89e55959a2a215a2d33c534d6f35dbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a858a564e89e55959a2a215a2d33c534d6f35dbb/0_263_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julian serenaded his new bride after the wedding.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julian serenades his bride after the wedding.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sofie Kramer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since I am a writer and he is a musician, he proposes a collaboration: we will write a love song to the city. We jump on bikes (goodbye loaned dress, hello jeans) and head off to his home turf in Amsterdam East (Oost), over the Amstel river and out of traditional tourist territory.</p> <p>The Oosterpark, with its lake and shady terraces, is the perfect place to pause and make music and it\u2019s much quieter than the better-known Vondelpark. \u201cMoving people to less obvious places is a positive by-product,\u201d says Elena, who sees the wedding\u2019s primary aim as improving relations between tourists and locals, as well as taking them to less popular areas. \u201cIt\u2019s such a pity we live in separate worlds,\u201d she says. \u201cWe use the same city centre, but we hardly ever really connect.\u201d</p> <p>When the limits of my songwriting skills become obvious, Julian throws his guitar on to his back and we explore a little further. \u201cYou think you know the city quite well,\u201d he tells me, \u201cbut every day you discover a new part.\u201d The stalls are packing up at the multicultural <a href=\"https://www.amsterdam.info/markets/dappermarkt/\" title=\"\">Dappermarkt</a>, where Julian buys his fruit and vegetables, but <a href=\"https://www.brouwerijhetij.nl/?lang=en\" title=\"\">Brouwerij \u2018t IJ</a>, a brewery with a large terrace beneath Amsterdam\u2019s oldest windmill, is buzzing, and we order beers for around \u20ac3 and toast our wedding day.</p> <p>\u201cTourism can be so much more than grabbing a selfie at the canals,\u201d says Nico Mulder of amsterdam&amp;partners. \u201cI\u2019m not saying nobody will go to the Van Gogh Museum or Anne Frank House any more, but it\u2019s really positive to see tourists and Amsterdam citizens more as one, instead of opponents of each other.\u201d<br><em>\u2022 Bidding for the mock weddings starts at \u20ac100. </em><em>More information about the Untourist movement</em><em> at <a href=\"https://www.untouristguide.com/\" title=\"\">untouristguide.com</a></em></p>",

I\u2019m trying out Marry an Amsterdammer for the day, one of several activities suggested in the Untourist Guide to Amsterdam, a book and website launched this week, in collaboration with the city marketing organisation amsterdam&amp;partners, and local businesses. It\u2019s packed with ideas for bringing tourists and locals together, and encouraging visitors to explore less-known parts of the city, as an antidote to the problems of overtourism. Other activities include a boat tour of the city guided by refugees, and fishing for plastic in the canal. \u201cThe idea is that tourists not only feed from the city, but can also build a connection with people who live here,\u201d says Jona Rens, founder of Wed and Walk, the shop-cum-chapel in Amsterdam\u2019s De Pijp district where Julian and I make pledges to the city as well as to each other, and where Jona has been conducting kitsch mock weddings since 2015. Last year, about 21 million people visited Amsterdam. Attempts to handle such numbers has have resulted in campaigns like Enjoy and Respect, launched in June 2018, dishing out steep fines for nuisances such as littering and urinating in public. The Untourist Guide takes a refreshingly positive approach. Social innovator Elena Simons, one of the authors of the book, describes this influx of people from all over the world as \u201ca really exciting opportunity\u201d. She says: \u201cLet\u2019s do something with all that energy, all that diversity \u2013 something good for mankind and enjoyable at the same time.\u201d On Wednesday (5 June), a mass wedding between tourists and Amsterdammers will take place at Posthoorn church (close to Central Station) and, from June to January, visitors can bid, starting at \u20ac100, for a different listed bride or groom each month, who will introduce them to a new aspect of Amsterdam life during their one-day honeymoon. Shamiro, the city\u2019s current night mayor, will take visitors to off-beat late-night spots, for example, while Natascha, an urban farmer, will introduce you to her favourite green spaces around town. Friends and family can come too, as long as the amount of money bid covers the activities and there\u2019s something left for the chosen charity of your bride or groom. My marrying Julian for the day probably isn\u2019t going to make Amsterdam a better place but, symbolically, this union between a resident and a tourist does have a strange poignancy. The red aisle that I walk down, the music, and the exchanging of thrift-store rings creates a powerful mood \u2013 although it\u2019s a hug, not a kiss, that seals the ceremony. As we sign the register, the sun appears, and we take our first steps outside as a \u201cmarried\u201d couple. Drivers honk us, a French tourist stops to take photographs, and Julian, who is charming and relaxed throughout, gets his guitar out and serenades me with Ed Sheeran\u2019s Thinking Out Loud. Since I am a writer and he is a musician, he proposes a collaboration: we will write a love song to the city. We jump on bikes (goodbye loaned dress, hello jeans) and head off to his home turf in Amsterdam East (Oost), over the Amstel river and out of traditional tourist territory. The Oosterpark, with its lake and shady terraces, is the perfect place to pause and make music and it\u2019s much quieter than the better-known Vondelpark. \u201cMoving people to less obvious places is a positive by-product,\u201d says Elena, who sees the wedding\u2019s primary aim as improving relations between tourists and locals, as well as taking them to less popular areas. \u201cIt\u2019s such a pity we live in separate worlds,\u201d she says. \u201cWe use the same city centre, but we hardly ever really connect.\u201d When the limits of my songwriting skills become obvious, Julian throws his guitar on to his back and we explore a little further. \u201cYou think you know the city quite well,\u201d he tells me, \u201cbut every day you discover a new part.\u201d The stalls are packing up at the multicultural Dappermarkt, where Julian buys his fruit and vegetables, but Brouwerij \u2018t IJ, a brewery with a large terrace beneath Amsterdam\u2019s oldest windmill, is buzzing, and we order beers for around \u20ac3 and toast our wedding day. \u201cTourism can be so much more than grabbing a selfie at the canals,\u201d says Nico Mulder of amsterdam&amp;partners. \u201cI\u2019m not saying nobody will go to the Van Gogh Museum or Anne Frank House any more, but it\u2019s really positive to see tourists and Amsterdam citizens more as one, instead of opponents of each other.\u201d \u2022 Bidding for the mock weddings starts at \u20ac100.

      "bodyText": "Miley Cyrus has spoken out after a man grabbed and kissed her following a festival performance in Barcelona last weekend. She posted footage of the incident to her Instagram and Twitter feeds, which shows the man grabbing at her hair, then pulling her towards him by wrapping his arm around her neck, and kissing her head. Clearly rattled, she breaks free and moves quickly away. Captioning the footage, Cyrus wrote: \u201cShe can be wearing what she wants. She can be a virgin. She can be sleeping with 5 different people. She can be with her husband. She can be with her girlfriend. She can be naked. She CAN\u2019T be grabbed without her consent. #DontFuckWithMyFreedom.\u201d She reposted critical comments made to her on social media following the incident, including \u201cYou wanted to be \u2018sexy\u2019, what do you expect?\u201d, along with the hashtag #stillnotaskingforit. Cyrus has also thrown her support behind abortion rights, announcing a charity fashion project involving her, designer Marc Jacobs, LGBT and homelessness charity Happy Hippie foundation, and US sexual healthcare organisation Planned Parenthood. The singer launched the initiative by posting an image of herself eating a cake featuring the words \u201cAbortion is healthcare\u201d, though was accused of plagiarism by Becca Rea-Holloway, AKA The Sweet Feminist, who had created an identical cake in May 2018. Rea-Holloway described it as \u201cdirect theft of my own original art\u201d. Cyrus apologised, saying: \u201cWe saw the image online and didn\u2019t realise it was yours. We will absolutely tag you for your work.\u201d Cyrus released her new EP, She Is Coming, last week, and stars in the latest episode of the Netflix series Black Mirror, which launches today.",

      "bodyText": "Honduran security forces with teargas and live bullets have been deployed to quell a wave of nationwide protests led by doctors and teachers demanding the resignation of the country\u2019s president. Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, the US government\u2019s top ally in Central America, is under increasing pressure amid public anger over crumbling public services, dismal approval ratings \u2013 and explosive revelations that he was the subject of a US Drug Enforcement Administration trafficking investigation during his first term in office. The US supported his re-election in 2017, since when the number of migrants and asylum seekers fleeing Honduras has soared. The current wave of social unrest was triggered by privatization reforms that critics warned would kill off public education and health services. This week, Hern\u00e1ndez withdrew the proposed legislation, but more strikes and protests are planned for the coming days despite the militarized crackdown. \u201cThe people are on the streets because the crisis is extreme, and they have been betrayed too many times by this government, which is no longer recognized as credible or legitimate,\u201d said Dr Suyapa Figueroa, president of the Honduras Medical College and leader of the fledgling Platform for the Defense of Education and Health. \u201cWe are willing to dialogue but only with representatives who are honest, knowledgable, and have no conflicts of interest, not those chosen by this illegal government,\u201d Figueroa added. Teachers and doctors first went on strike in April after the government approved legislative decrees granting special powers to ministers to impose major reforms to the health and education systems. But the roots of the unrest go much deeper. Education and healthcare have suffered severe cuts and multiple corruption scandals under the National party, which has ruled Honduras since a military-backed coup deposed the elected president, Manual Zelaya, in 2009. Spending on education and culture has dropped from 32.9% of the central government budget to 19.9% over the past decade, with a de facto freeze on wages and infrastructure spending. Marco Calder\u00f3n, 28, a primary school teacher in the country\u2019s industrial hub, San Pedro Sula, was among hundreds manning a roadblock this week. \u201cThe constitution establishes the right to free education, but we depend more on parents than we do on the state,\u201d he said.

The public health service is also close to collapse, with widespread shortages of medicines, staff, beds, cribs and equipment. About 40% of emergency rooms have inadequate medical cover, according to the National Commission for Human Rights. Less than 10% of this year\u2019s central government budget is allocated to health, compared with 14.3% in 2010. A previous wave of protests erupted in 2015 when it was revealed that at least $350m was stolen from the state run health insurance system, (IHSS) \u2013 some of which ended up in Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s 2013 election campaign coffers. San Pedro Sula\u2019s public maternity clinic has cancelled regular appointments due to staff shortages, offering only emergency services. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough bandages, gauze, supplements or doctors,\u201d said Sam Lu\u00eds, a fifth-year medical student. \u201cFor too long, the focus has been on security, when it should be health and education.\u201d Honduras\u2019s security and defence budget increased from 12.5% to 14.5% in the past decade, but Honduras remains one of the most dangerous countries in the world outside an official war zone, with 31 massacres (three or more murders) registered in the first five months of 2019 \u2013 compared to 39 in all of 2018. \u201cThe IMF and World Bank demand efficiencies in the public sector, but, an illegitimate government linked with corruption and drug trafficking cannot transform the health and education sectors by force,\u201d said economist Hugo No\u00e9 Pino, a former economic minster and ex-governor of the Central Bank. Last week US prosecutors unsealed court documents from 2015 which name Hern\u00e1ndez as a target of a major investigation into \u201clarge-scale drug-trafficking and money laundering activities\u201d. The court filings also named several close confidants, including his deceased sister, Hilda Hern\u00e1ndez, a former National party president linked to an IHSS fraud, and the security minister, Gen Juli\u00e1n Pacheco. The president\u2019s younger brother and former congressman, Tony Hern\u00e1ndez, was arrested in the US last November and charged with conspiring to traffic tons of cocaine stamped with his initials into the US between 2004 and 2016. President Hern\u00e1ndez released a statement denying any wrongdoing and said he enjoyed a good relationship with the DEA. There is no indication that charges were brought, nor that the investigation remains open. But the revelations fuelled further anger on the streets, which was met with state force condemned as excessive by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights\u2019 office and Amnesty International.

      "bodyText": "Prince Charles spent 75 minutes longer than scheduled trying to convince Donald Trump of the dangers of global heating, but the president still insisted the US was \u201cclean\u201d and blamed other nations for the crisis. Trump told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain on Wednesday he had been due to meet the Prince of Wales for 15 minutes during his state visit, but the discussion went on for 90 minutes \u2013 during which the prince did \u201cmost of the talking\u201d. Trump said: \u201cHe is really into climate change and I think that\u2019s great. What he really wants and what he really feels warmly about is the future. He wants to make sure future generations have climate that is good climate, as opposed to a disaster, and I agree.\u201d But Trump said he pushed back at the suggestion the US should do more. He said: \u201cI did say, \u2018Well, the United States right now has among the cleanest climates there are based on all statistics.\u2019 And it\u2019s even getting better because I agree with that we want the best water, the cleanest water. It\u2019s crystal clean, has to be crystal clean clear.\u201d Trump added: \u201cChina, India, Russia, many other nations, they have not very good air, not very good water, and the sense of pollution. If you go to certain cities \u2026 you can\u2019t even breathe, and now that air is going up \u2026 They don\u2019t do the responsibility.\u201d Asked by Piers Morgan if he accepted the science on climate change, Trump said: \u201cI believe there\u2019s a change in weather, and I think it changes both ways.

      "body": "<p>When it came to power in 1997, Labour picked up and ran with the Tories\u2019 individualistic reforms to the school system. Along with school choice, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/school-tables\">league tables</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/academies\">academies</a>, in came parental responsibility for absences. So I was disappointed, but not surprised, to be given a fixed penalty notice of \u00a360 per parent as a result of taking our six-year-old out of school for two weeks during term time to visit Jamaica.</p> <p>The fact that my son will have the chance to engage with world renowned scholars during that time (as I\u2019m going for work on a writing retreat) meant nothing to the local authority. It is deemed less valuable than sitting in his classroom, thinking about next year\u2019s Sats. This is a reminder that we have replaced education with schooling, putting a premium on the state-mandated curriculum rather than the much wider world of learning. But as annoying as it is to be penalised for taking my child out of school, it\u2019s not really parents like me who are the targets of the non-attendance punishment industry.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/56/contents\">1996 Education Act</a> criminalised non-attendance, and Labour\u2019s introduction of <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/38/part/3/crossheading/parenting-orders-under-the-1998-act\">Parenting Orders in 1998</a> made parents liable for their children\u2019s offences. By making non-attendance a safeguarding issue that all schools had to account for, Labour unleashed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/feb/12/truancy-parents-jail\">the weight of the law on to parents</a>. It is estimated that in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-43254495\">2016-17 more than \u00a324m</a> was paid in fines by parents in England and Wales whose children did not attend or were taken out of school in term time, and that in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/mar/21/parents-fined-term-time-holidays-children-missing-school-record-level\">2017-18 </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/mar/21/parents-fined-term-time-holidays-children-missing-school-record-level\">local authorities issued 223,000 penalty notices</a> for unauthorised holidays. The logic and impact of this approach is to punish the disadvantaged children it is meant to protect.</p> <p>To understand the motivation behind this look no further than David Cameron. His government believed it had identified the 120,000 so called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/15/david-cameron-broken-britain-policing\">\u201ctroubled families\u201d</a> who caused the majority of social problems in the country.

      "bodyText": "When it came to power in 1997, Labour picked up and ran with the Tories\u2019 individualistic reforms to the school system. Along with school choice, league tables and academies, in came parental responsibility for absences. So I was disappointed, but not surprised, to be given a fixed penalty notice of \u00a360 per parent as a result of taking our six-year-old out of school for two weeks during term time to visit Jamaica. The fact that my son will have the chance to engage with world renowned scholars during that time (as I\u2019m going for work on a writing retreat) meant nothing to the local authority. It is deemed less valuable than sitting in his classroom, thinking about next year\u2019s Sats. This is a reminder that we have replaced education with schooling, putting a premium on the state-mandated curriculum rather than the much wider world of learning. But as annoying as it is to be penalised for taking my child out of school, it\u2019s not really parents like me who are the targets of the non-attendance punishment industry. The 1996 Education Act criminalised non-attendance, and Labour\u2019s introduction of Parenting Orders in 1998 made parents liable for their children\u2019s offences. By making non-attendance a safeguarding issue that all schools had to account for, Labour unleashed the weight of the law on to parents. It is estimated that in 2016-17 more than \u00a324m was paid in fines by parents in England and Wales whose children did not attend or were taken out of school in term time, and that in 2017-18 local authorities issued 223,000 penalty notices for unauthorised holidays. The logic and impact of this approach is to punish the disadvantaged children it is meant to protect. To understand the motivation behind this look no further than David Cameron. His government believed it had identified the 120,000 so called \u201ctroubled families\u201d who caused the majority of social problems in the country. He accused them of \u201ca culture of disruption and irresponsibility\u201d that had \u201ccascaded through [the] generations\u201d. This is the classic \u201ccycle of deprivation\u201d logic, which argues behavioural change can snap people of their poverty. One of the performance indicators Cameron\u2019s government set for local authorities was whether children were attending school. It\u2019s a pretty simple formula: get the feckless parents to ensure their feral kids get educated so they can have the skills needed for the modern economy drilled into them, get a job and stop sponging off the state. So local authorities installed a rigid no-unauthorised-leave policy. Fining parents has the added bonus of raising much-needed revenue for the depleted school system. The reality is that children are disadvantaged not only because of their parents\u2019 life choices but also by the system itself. Class and racial inequalities are far older than universal schooling. As a parent of four black children I have no faith in schools to educate them. As much as there are great teachers, the school system is something we work with our children to navigate and survive. When schools levy fines for non-attendance it is pretty obvious who this will impact. Those 120,000 families whose children are more likely to truant are some of the poorest in the country.

      "body": "<p>On the afternoon of 13 March 1940 a gunman entered a public meeting at Caxton Hall, Westminster, and assassinated Sir Michael O\u2019Dwyer, a former lieutenant governor of Punjab. That primary job done, he took aim at other members of the platform party and wounded Lord Zetland, the secretary of state for India, Sir Louis Dane, who had been O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s predecessor, and Lord Lamington, a former governor of Bombay.</p> <p>This grand assembly of old India hands had just finished their discussion of Afghanistan and the threat posed to it by Germany\u2019s then ally, the Soviet Union. They were relaxed and unaware of any danger; a better-equipped assassin would have made a clean sweep of all four. But the gunman, Udham Singh, had somehow managed to acquire the wrong calibre bullets for his Smith &amp; Wesson; O\u2019Dwyer alone died because he was shot in the back at point blank range and, as the first target, he had no time to defend himself. But O\u2019Dwyer was the only victim Singh cared about \u2013 the rest were a bonus in a long-delayed act of revenge that had its origins more than 20 years before, when on 13 April 1919 troops led by General Reginald Dyer fired into a crowd of unarmed civilians in the city of Amritsar, killing either 379 (the official figure) or more than 1,000 of them (the unofficial estimate of the Indian National Congress). Indian fury at the slaughter extended well beyond the nascent independence movement, and the relationship between the rulers and ruled lurched into what became an unstoppable decline.</p> <p>The broadcaster Anita Anand had a grandfather who could recall scenes from that terrifying day a century ago, but her book\u2019s preoccupation is the aftermath: how a low-born Sikh murdered a country-born Irishman in the august surroundings of imperial London. In this story, very little is predictable. O\u2019Dwyer, one of 14 siblings born to a Catholic farmer in County Tipperary, is hardly the conventional idea of a senior Raj administrator. Singh, flamboyant enough to find work as an extra in Alexander Korda\u2019s <em>Elephant Boy</em> (where he appears in a corner of the Indian jungle created by the Denham Studios in 1936), refuses to conform to typical characterisations of the lone assassin. In Anand\u2019s narrative, the courses of two lives separated by a gulf in race, class and geography narrow slowly until they meet each other, momentarily and theatrically, on stage in front of a London audience.

O\u2019Dwyer was 30 miles away in Lahore, the provincial capital, when General Dyer ordered his troops to fire, and nothing suggests that Singh was a witness to the slaughter. O\u2019Dwyer, however, got up to some bloody mischief of his own the next day when he ordered RAF planes to bomb and machine-gun what he wrongly identified as a rebellious mob in another district of Punjab, while a telegram to Dyer left no doubt that the lieutenant governor approved of the general\u2019s action in Amritsar.</p> <p>The Indian members of the official inquiry into the whole tragic debacle issued a minority report that castigated O\u2019Dwyer for his assumption that Punjab was on the brink of revolt, arguing that the massacre had been precipitated by his overreaction. That didn\u2019t moderate O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s views in any way. He continued to support Dyer long after the general resigned and never stopped publicising his belief that the massacre had prevented widespread rebellion. He was a die-hard. He believed that Indian nationalism should never be appeased and that threats to the status quo needed to be punished severely. When Dyer, for long a sick man, died in his West Country cottage in 1927, O\u2019Dwyer was left as the massacre\u2019s most prominent apologist and a good replacement as its chief culprit.</p> <p>What isn\u2019t at all clear is when Singh resolved to kill him. Anand gives the impression that he swore vengeance on the day of the massacre itself or soon after. She has a puzzling passage in italics, no other author credited, which reads like a historical romance: Singh \u201c<em>took a handful of blood-soaked earth in his hand \u2026 and he swore a terrible vow \u2026 No matter how long it took, no matter how far it took him \u2026 he would track down the dogs who did this to his people and kill them.</em>\u201d In fact, no firm evidence places him at the scene of the killings or anywhere else in Amritsar in April 1919. Perhaps Anand intends only to show how popular Indian history would like to see Singh, or how Singh would have liked to see himself. Certainly the earlier that Singh\u2019s resolve can be shown to take hold, the more the book\u2019s title can be justified, though given the shortage of information about his intentions for most of the period 1919 to 1940, a more accurate title might have been \u201cThe Wandering Assassin\u201d. What Anand provides about his state of mind is reasonable biographical speculation; all we know for certain is that he moved about the world like an adventurer.</p> <p>Born the son of railway crossing-keeper in rural Punjab and raised in an orphanage, Singh left India for the first time during the first world war, when he joined the Indian army\u2019s expeditionary force to Mesopotamia as a carpenter. Lowly jobs in India followed, and then he went off again to work as a labourer on the Uganda Railway in East Africa. He travelled to England via France and eventually to Mexico, where he settled in El Paso for a time until in 1924 he was smuggled across the US border and into California. It was here, under the tutelage and occasional subsidy of the revolutionary Ghadar movement, that Singh seems to have discovered his vocation as an anti-Raj propagandist.</p> <p>According to Anand, the Ghadars sent him on tours to continental Europe and the Soviet Union, and eventually to the UK, where his multiple aliases and addresses and his trip to Russia soon made him of interest to the authorities. In 1936, a Scotland Yard memo noted that he was believed to be \u201cco-habiting with a white woman somewhere in the West End of London and working at intervals on \u2018crowd scenes\u2019 at film studios\u201d.

Worried about its effect on Indian and foreign opinion, the British government determined that it should attract as little publicity as possible.

In the event, it was Reuters who supplied most of the copy from the trial, and Reuters had agreed to omit anything that could be described as incendiary in the political sense, and to make no connection between the massacre of 1919 and O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s assassination. Helpfully to the government\u2019s purpose, Nehru and Gandhi and other Congress leaders found the murder inconvenient to the policy of peaceful cooperation they were then trying to pursue. Gandhi declared it \u201can act of insanity\u201d. Singh sank below the waves of wartime news as a solitary killer unconnected to history, perhaps a little mad.</p> <p>He was hanged at Pentonville prison \u2013 a shamefully bungled execution by a nervous hangman, so Anand has discovered from documents released under the Freedom of Information Act. Her book isn\u2019t perfect. There are some jarring Americanisms \u2013 \u201cgrunt\u201d for army private, for example \u2013 and in terms of technique an inclination to go beyond the cautiously speculative (\u201cThere is no reason to believe that he would not have helped spread the word \u2026\u201d) into the assertively fictional (\u201cHe took the gun from his overcoat to check it one last time\u201d).

Helpfully to the government\u2019s purpose, Nehru and Gandhi and other Congress leaders found the murder inconvenient to the policy of peaceful cooperation they were then trying to pursue. Gandhi declared it \u201can act of insanity\u201d. Singh sank below the waves of wartime news as a solitary killer unconnected to history, perhaps a little mad. He was hanged at Pentonville prison \u2013 a shamefully bungled execution by a nervous hangman, so Anand has discovered from documents released under the Freedom of Information Act. Her book isn\u2019t perfect. There are some jarring Americanisms \u2013 \u201cgrunt\u201d for army private, for example \u2013 and in terms of technique an inclination to go beyond the cautiously speculative (\u201cThere is no reason to believe that he would not have helped spread the word \u2026\u201d) into the assertively fictional (\u201cHe took the gun from his overcoat to check it one last time\u201d). But all the same it is an involving account of a strange and obsessive life. \u2022 The Patient Assassin is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (\u00a320).

      "bodyText": "In the wind-swept wilds of southern Mexico, a Beast is stirring. Migrants heading north are once again taking their chances on the freight train known as La Bestia \u2013 so named for the way it maims unlucky riders who fall beneath its wheels as it grinds across the isthmus of Tehuantepec. Not so long ago, migrants were increasingly seeking safety in numbers, joining mass caravans to travel through Mexico. For a while they encountered an unusually warm welcome, but in recent weeks, the reception has cooled dramatically: police roadblocks have sprung up across the south of the country, and immigration officials have raided migrant camps and broken up caravans. Evelio Isidro, 23, left Honduras on foot to escape extortionists, and originally planned to walk the length of Mexico after hearing that the government was offering transit visas for Central Americans. But when the group he was travelling with was targeted by immigration officials \u2013 forcing him to run through the hills to escape arrest \u2013 he opted instead for the risky train journey. \u201cPresident [Andr\u00e9s] Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said they weren\u2019t going to detain any migrants so I decided to come,\u201d Isidro said. \u201cBut police and immigration officials are detaining and deporting us.\u201d When he took power in January, L\u00f3pez Obrador promised to overhaul immigration policy in Mexico \u2013 long feared by Central American migrants as a danger zone of extortion, kidnap and sexual assaults. The president, known as Amlo, said that Mexico would no longer do America\u2019s \u201cdirty work\u201d, instead offering humanitarian visas allowing migrants to spend one year in the country. But Donald Trump has derailed those aspirations. The US president has repeatedly accused Mexico of failing to stop migrants and illegal drugs from reaching the US, and is now threatening to slap tariffs on Mexican exports until the issue is resolved. During his visit to London on Tuesday, Trump reprised the theme, claiming that \u201cmillions of people\u201d were being allowed to pass through Mexico, and warning that tariffs could be imposed as soon as next week. Mexico\u2019s foreign ministry retorted by boasting robust detention and deportation figures: 80,537 people have been repatriated, mostly to Central America, since Amlo took office. L\u00f3pez Obrador also wrote to Trump, reminding his US counterpart, \u201cThe Statue of Liberty is not an empty symbol.\u201d But Amlo has acceded to Trump\u2019s \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d policy, forcing nearly 9,000 asylum seekers to stay in Mexico as their cases are heard in US courts. Meanwhile, Mexican immigration officials are taking longer to issue travel documents and caravans are quickly corralled. \u201cThe government is reacting in an extremely hostile way and with [migration] policies which are far from its rhetoric,\u201d said Salva Lacruz, coordinator with the Fray Mat\u00edas de C\u00f3rdova Human Rights Centre in Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala. Mexico has started issuing \u201cregional visas\u201d which allow migrants to freely visit several southern states \u2013 far from the US border. But migrants have shown little interest in the poverty-ridden region where wages are little higher than in Central America. \u201cIt\u2019s a tactic to contain Trump\u2019s anger,\u201d Lacruz said of the regional visas. \u201cThe Mexican government is under enormous pressure from the United States.\u201d Even amid the crackdown, migrants keep coming: on Tuesday about 400 people crossed the Suchiate River from Guatemala. Tensions have boiled over in the nearby city of Tapachula, where migrants have staged mass outbreaks from the XXI Century detention centre. Tuesday\u2019s group was mostly composed of Hondurans, but others passing through the city hail from Cuba, Haiti and African countries. Many camp out in Tapachula as they wait, living in cockroach-infested flop hotels or sleeping on sheets of cardboard along roadsides. \u201cMy kids have a cold and a cough,\u201d said Kesner Bazin, a Haitian migrant who on a recent afternoon was waiting in the rain outside the migrant center for a transit visa which would give him 20 days to cross Mexico. He was hoping to reach Tijuana with his family after eight years living in Brazil, but had no idea when the document would be granted. \u201cYou have to be patient,\u201d he shrugged. When the first large-scale caravans passed through the region in late 2018, residents welcomed migrants with open arms, offering weary travellers water, food and clothing. That help has evaporated and some locals have turned hostile. A group of nuns was handing out food to migrants in Tapachula\u2019s central square, when a passing motorist screamed: \u201cDon\u2019t feed them! Put those lazy fucks to work!\u201d The nuns feed about 2,500 migrants once a day \u2013 rice, beans, eggs and bread \u2013 though donations are scarce and local traders often try to gouge prices, said Sister Bertha L\u00f3pez, the mother superior. \u201cThere\u2019s a climate of apathy when it comes to helping,\u201d she said. Officials have turned hostile, too. In Huixtla, up the road from Tapachula, patrol cars have circulated through town, warning over a loudspeaker: \u201cA dangerous caravan is coming.\u201d \u201cI have to defend my people,\u201d said Huixtla\u2019s mayor, Jos\u00e9 Luis Laparra, banging his fist on the table before boasting that his police force was \u201cbusting the heads\u201d of bad people. Unsubstantiated stories of migrants committing crimes circulate on social media and create scandalous headlines. \u201cThe state [government] and prosecutor\u2019s office doesn\u2019t have any statistics showing crime has increased,\u201d said Sandybell Reyes, migration coordinator with Voces Mesoamericanas, a human rights organisation. \u201cThere\u2019s a stigmatisation of the caravans and all the people coming with them.\u201d Migration experts say caravans formed so migrants could move openly and avoid the risks of the road through Mexico. Now they warn that, as in previous crackdowns, migrants will be forced to take longer, more risky routes \u2013 such as the Beast - to avoid immigration checkpoints. \u201cThey\u2019re more exposed to being robbed, being raped, attacks by organised crime,\u201d said Guadalupe Ram\u00edrez, a volunteer at the Brothers on the Road shelter in Ixtepec. \u201cThey\u2019re like the perfect target.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The government is set to disappoint backbench MPs who have called for a law to protect \u201creligious freedom\u201d, with the attorney general confirming it will present a \u201cbasic\u201d bill to prevent discrimination. On Wednesday Christian Porter told Radio National the proposed Religious Discrimination Act will \u201cfollow the basic architecture of discrimination bills\u201d by defining religion as a protected attribute. The comments appear to rule out demands for a broader bill to give a positive right to express religious opinions even where they breach employment codes of conduct, as occurred when rugby player Israel Folau claimed on social media that gay people go to hell. Coalition members who have publicly pushed for that option include Kevin Andrews, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells and Barnaby Joyce. But conservative Coalition members have not given up on agitating the issue, citing swings against Labor in some areas with high religious populations as indicating a mood for greater protections. Porter said the Coalition\u2019s plan is to release an \u201comnibus bill which tidies up a range of issues such as clarifying whether or not in the Charities Act you could be excluded from being a charity for proposing the traditional definition of marriage\u201d. He described the bill as \u201clargely uncontroversial\u201d, despite the fact in December it was described as a bill to provide \u201cequal status\u201d to freedom of religion alongside the right to non-discrimination, which will likely be controversial to LGBTI groups. The government has also referred the issue of religious schools\u2019 exemptions \u2013 which allow discrimination against LGBT students and staff \u2013 to the Australian Law Reform Commission. Porter said that when parliament resumes in early July or shortly after the government will present a religious discrimination bill that will follow the \u201cvery standard architecture of discrimination acts\u201d. \u201cWe define an attribute, in this case someone\u2019s religious qualities or indeed irreligious qualities \u2013 it will apply to people who don\u2019t believe in religion \u2013 and then we say that persons holding those attributes will be protected from certain behaviour in certain circumstances, again, just like the Race or Sex Discrimination Act. \u201cAnd then the third part of the act will be a range of logical exceptions that you\u2019ll have to have.\u201d Porter said the law would protect people \u201cbecause of the fact that they hold a particular religious view\u201d. On Tuesday Liberal MP Tim Wilson backed the more limited form of a religious discrimination act which he said would not be \u201coverly controversial\u201d but is \u201cquite different from a religious freedom act\u201d. \u201cAnd the reality is, freedom of religion includes people of faith and without faith because that\u2019s a legitimate exercise for your freedom of conscious as well, so once you start going down that path of religious freedom act, what you are actually arguing for is a human rights act,\u201d he told the ABC. Wilson said that such a law would \u201cempower bureaucrats and unelected judges to be able to make decisions about the limits of our freedom rather than the parliament and peoples\u2019 natural right to be able to live their life freely\u201d. LGBT rights groups agree in theory that discrimination on the basis of religion should be outlawed but have warned that the law must be a \u201cshield not a sword\u201d against LGBTI people.",

A day after the horrific mass shooting in the top-end, the NT police chief, Reece Kershaw, said police believe the alleged gunman, a 45-year-old, was searching for someone when he carried out the brutal murders using a stolen pump-action shotgun. Multiple witnesses reported hearing the gunman yelling for a man named Alex during the shooting and on Wednesday, and Kershaw said police believed the shooter had been searching for specific targets. He said at least one of the targets was interstate, and that some of the victims may not have known the gunman. \u201cWe\u2019re not 100% sure and we\u2019ve obviously got to interview that individual before he\u2019s charged with murder,\u201d Kershaw said. \u201cInitial indications [suggest] it may be that he was looking for certain individuals.

One of the victims of the shooting was Hassan Baydoun, 33, a taxi driver and recent university graduate originally from Lebanon who had been on a meal break at the Palms Motel in Darwin when he was killed. His employer, Blue Taxis, said in a statement it had lost one of its \u201clong term beloved drivers\u201d. \u201cOur company is heartbroken and his colleagues are in a state of shock,\u201d the company said in the statement. \u201cThis is not what our city stands for.

He has a long criminal history, was well-known to police, and Kershaw said he was believed to be an \u201cassociate\u201d of an outlaw motorcycle gang. Kershaw confirmed that the gunman had used a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun \u2013 a prohibited firearm \u2013 that may have been stolen as far back as 1997. The suspected gunman was wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet during the shooting and on Wednesday, the NT chief minister Michael Gunner announced the shooting had prompted a sweeping review of the parole board and everyone subject to electronic monitoring in the Territory. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked for a detailed report immediately from the parole review board into what happened with this alleged offender, and we have asked for everyone who is on parole and electronic monitoring to also be reviewed,\u201d Gunner, said. \u201cWe\u2019re not jumping to conclusions, but we are doing all the work we need to do to make sure Territorians are safe.\u201d NT police arrested the man on Tuesday night after an hour-long shooting in which four men were killed and a woman was injured at four sites in Darwin. The first reports of a man firing shots came at the Palms Motel, where Baydoun was killed, just outside the Darwin city centre about 5.50pm. The others were killed shortly after at the nearby Buff Club, Gardens Hill Crescent in the inner-city, and an industrial site at Jolly Street in the suburb of Woolner. Kershaw said one person was killed at the Palms Motel between 5.39pm and 5.52pm. The gunman then went to an address at the inner-city suburb of The Gardens between 5.54pm and 5.57pm, and was at the Buff Club by 5.59pm. He then went to an industrial site between 6.05pm and 6.13pm. One person is believed to have been killed at each site. Witness Leah Potter told the Today show she had followed a police officer to the scene of the shooting at the motel. \u201cWe followed him, and the scene that we came across, I could not even believe that this could happen in Darwin,\u201d she said. \u201cA man had come through the Palms Motel and shot every window.\u201d She said the man was looking for someone, and after shooting up the motel he shot one man dead.

      "body": "<p>The street where a terrible crime happens is always described as a \u201cnormally quiet\u201d place. I should be able to find a better word, but quiet generally does apply to Gardens Hill Crescent in Darwin. There\u2019s the hum of traffic from the Stuart Highway behind us, and if the wind is right, a disembodied voice from a loud speaker at one of the car yards over the back. Some unusually noisy birds have recently come to roost in the palms dotted around the backyards. But that\u2019s about it.</p> <p>So when three or four loud bangs sounded out through the suburb around 6pm on Tuesday, residents raised their heads from whatever they were doing: cooking dinner, hanging out the washing, watching television. No one was terribly alarmed, though. There were no raised voices, and it\u2019s not unusual for Darwinites to be illegally letting off the last of their fireworks stash from last year before Territory Day rolls around again on 1 July. Some neighbours say they looked up at the sky, waiting for the bursts of colour in the still-daylight.</p> <p>When a few moments later there were more loud bangs and some yelling, a few people close by went outside to have a look. They followed the voice of a woman to the blown-out door of a home in a small cluster of single-level units.</p> <p>One witness said the distressed woman told them a stranger had shot through her door, then said he was looking for a man named Alex.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/05/witness-describe-panic-and-carnage-in-darwin-during-hour-long-shooting-rampage\">Witnesses describe panic and carnage in Darwin during hour-long shooting rampage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another witness, who did not want to be named, said they spent about 40 minutes tending to the woman before someone asked about the first round of shots and they realised they hadn\u2019t checked the other units. She said when they entered the home closest to the street, they found a man long-dead, his blood spilled onto the tiles like a black carpet. The witness said in her former profession as a nurse she had dealt with death many times before, but never a violent death, never something like this. And certainly never in her street.</p> <p>She said she and her partner and some other men from neighbouring townhouses went inside to try to help, looking for a pulse or a wound they could put pressure on.

      "bodyText": "The street where a terrible crime happens is always described as a \u201cnormally quiet\u201d place. I should be able to find a better word, but quiet generally does apply to Gardens Hill Crescent in Darwin. There\u2019s the hum of traffic from the Stuart Highway behind us, and if the wind is right, a disembodied voice from a loud speaker at one of the car yards over the back. Some unusually noisy birds have recently come to roost in the palms dotted around the backyards. But that\u2019s about it. So when three or four loud bangs sounded out through the suburb around 6pm on Tuesday, residents raised their heads from whatever they were doing: cooking dinner, hanging out the washing, watching television. No one was terribly alarmed, though. There were no raised voices, and it\u2019s not unusual for Darwinites to be illegally letting off the last of their fireworks stash from last year before Territory Day rolls around again on 1 July. Some neighbours say they looked up at the sky, waiting for the bursts of colour in the still-daylight. When a few moments later there were more loud bangs and some yelling, a few people close by went outside to have a look. They followed the voice of a woman to the blown-out door of a home in a small cluster of single-level units. One witness said the distressed woman told them a stranger had shot through her door, then said he was looking for a man named Alex. Another witness, who did not want to be named, said they spent about 40 minutes tending to the woman before someone asked about the first round of shots and they realised they hadn\u2019t checked the other units. She said when they entered the home closest to the street, they found a man long-dead, his blood spilled onto the tiles like a black carpet. The witness said in her former profession as a nurse she had dealt with death many times before, but never a violent death, never something like this. And certainly never in her street. She said she and her partner and some other men from neighbouring townhouses went inside to try to help, looking for a pulse or a wound they could put pressure on. They could find neither through all the blood. The police had already been called, but now they phoned 000 again, this time requesting an ambulance. The witness said the wait for emergency services was long and that at the time they couldn\u2019t understand why no one was coming to help. At one point a witness tried to wave down a police car driving up the street, but it kept going. In hindsight, the police had a lot on their plates. Unbeknown to the people in Gardens Hill Crescent, a few minutes earlier a man had fired shots at the Palms Motel \u2013 a small, tired brown-brick building, just around the corner on McMinn Street. One man was dead and a woman injured. Police were out in force looking for the gunman, who was still on the loose. The NT police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, said after he\u2019d been to Gardens Hill Crescent, it\u2019s believed the gunman continued up the road by car to the Buff Club, an old Darwin watering hole popular with long-term locals, where another man was killed; then 3km away to an address in Jolly Street, Woolner, where a fourth man was killed. Kershaw said the gunman then drove 10km to the police headquarters at Berrimah, before heading back to the city where he was finally arrested at an intersection near the Palms Motel where the ordeal began. It was close to 7pm when officers turned up at Gardens Hill Crescent, met by a scrum of silent residents clustered around the mouth of a driveway, wondering what to do with themselves.

In Get Out he produced an even better masterpiece. Most incredibly of all, in Halloween he produced a Halloween sequel that wasn\u2019t an absolute horse turd. The man can do no wrong.</p> <p>Which is why I am confident in stating that his most recently announced film will be another Oscar-winning, genre-bending blockbuster. It is \u2026 let me see. Oh. It\u2019s a movie about a Magic 8 Ball. That can\u2019t be right.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/06/hello-kitty-is-heading-to-hollywood-branded-movie\">Hello Kitty is heading to Hollywood: the capitalist hellride thunders on!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No, apparently it is. Blumhouse, Mattel and director Jeff Wadlow really are teaming up to make a film about a toy that issues vaguely worded decisions if you shake it hard enough. \u201cSince the 1950s, Magic 8 Ball has inspired imagination, suspense and intrigue across generations,\u201d Robbie Brenner of Mattel Films told <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/06/magic-8-ball-blumhouse-mattel-movie-jeff-wadlow-directs-1202626269/\">Deadline</a>. \u201cThis iconic toy has a built-in connection with fans and untapped potential for storytelling.\u201d</p> <p>Obviously this is a good time to point out that \u201cuntapped\u201d doesn\u2019t automatically mean \u201cgreat\u201d. Maybe the cinematic potential for a Magic 8 Ball movie is untapped because it doesn\u2019t really exist. To make matters worse, the potential isn\u2019t actually all that untapped, because people have been unsuccessfully trying to make a Magic 8 ball movie for years. In 2006, Ace Ventura\u2019s Tom Shadyac was hired by Universal to make a Magic 8 Ball romcom. When that didn\u2019t work, Paramount hired Jon Gunn and John Mann to write <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2010/04/magic_8_ball_movie_paramount.html\">a National Treasure-style Magic 8 Ball movie</a> which similarly failed to see the light of day.</p> <p>But third time\u2019s a charm. And now the film has the best shot of getting off the ground, because it\u2019s a Blumhouse film, so it\u2019s bound to exist within the horror/thriller arena. And that suits a Magic 8 Ball much better than almost any other genre.</p> <p>You can\u2019t have a Magic 8 Ball make all the decisions in a romcom, because then the human protagonists would lose all their agency and invariably end up in a hellish, joyless variation of arranged marriage. And you can\u2019t make an action-adventure Magic 8 Ball movie, because imagine how crap Raiders of the Lost Ark would be if Indiana Jones had to keep grinding all his big set pieces to a halt so that he could shake a little novelty toy to see what he had to do next?</p> <p>But a horror? Fantastic. I already know exactly how this film will go. Two boys find a Magic 8 Ball in a secondhand store. The owner tries to warn them off buying it, because it\u2019s been said that this Magic 8 Ball contains the spirit of the man who invented the Magic 8 Ball, and his dying wish was to wreak a terrible revenge on a world that forgot his name.</p> <p>But the boys buy it anyway, and are horrified to learn that the haunted Magic 8 Ball actively encourages them to act on their worst impulses.

      "bodyText": "Jason Blum is on a hell of a roll right now. More or less everything he touches turns to gold. In Paranormal Activity, he produced the most profitable film ever made. In The Purge he helped produce a franchise of amazing longevity. In BlacKkKlansman, he produced Spike Lee\u2019s finest work in a decade. In Whiplash he produced a masterpiece. In Get Out he produced an even better masterpiece. Most incredibly of all, in Halloween he produced a Halloween sequel that wasn\u2019t an absolute horse turd. The man can do no wrong. Which is why I am confident in stating that his most recently announced film will be another Oscar-winning, genre-bending blockbuster. It is \u2026 let me see. Oh. It\u2019s a movie about a Magic 8 Ball. That can\u2019t be right. No, apparently it is. Blumhouse, Mattel and director Jeff Wadlow really are teaming up to make a film about a toy that issues vaguely worded decisions if you shake it hard enough. \u201cSince the 1950s, Magic 8 Ball has inspired imagination, suspense and intrigue across generations,\u201d Robbie Brenner of Mattel Films told Deadline. \u201cThis iconic toy has a built-in connection with fans and untapped potential for storytelling.\u201d Obviously this is a good time to point out that \u201cuntapped\u201d doesn\u2019t automatically mean \u201cgreat\u201d. Maybe the cinematic potential for a Magic 8 Ball movie is untapped because it doesn\u2019t really exist. To make matters worse, the potential isn\u2019t actually all that untapped, because people have been unsuccessfully trying to make a Magic 8 ball movie for years. In 2006, Ace Ventura\u2019s Tom Shadyac was hired by Universal to make a Magic 8 Ball romcom. When that didn\u2019t work, Paramount hired Jon Gunn and John Mann to write a National Treasure-style Magic 8 Ball movie which similarly failed to see the light of day. But third time\u2019s a charm. And now the film has the best shot of getting off the ground, because it\u2019s a Blumhouse film, so it\u2019s bound to exist within the horror/thriller arena. And that suits a Magic 8 Ball much better than almost any other genre. You can\u2019t have a Magic 8 Ball make all the decisions in a romcom, because then the human protagonists would lose all their agency and invariably end up in a hellish, joyless variation of arranged marriage. And you can\u2019t make an action-adventure Magic 8 Ball movie, because imagine how crap Raiders of the Lost Ark would be if Indiana Jones had to keep grinding all his big set pieces to a halt so that he could shake a little novelty toy to see what he had to do next? But a horror? Fantastic. I already know exactly how this film will go. Two boys find a Magic 8 Ball in a secondhand store. The owner tries to warn them off buying it, because it\u2019s been said that this Magic 8 Ball contains the spirit of the man who invented the Magic 8 Ball, and his dying wish was to wreak a terrible revenge on a world that forgot his name. But the boys buy it anyway, and are horrified to learn that the haunted Magic 8 Ball actively encourages them to act on their worst impulses. Should they eat their vegetables? \u201cMy reply is no.\u201d Should they break into the abandoned hospital at midnight? \u201cWithout a doubt.\u201d Should they perform a blood sacrifice on a kidnapped toddler to appease the dark lord Satan? \u201cIt is certain.\u201d Their gruesome hellride escalates and escalates against their will until \u2013 oh, actually, wait, it\u2019s just a toy, isn\u2019t it? The boys could just throw it in a river or something, couldn\u2019t they? Yeah, never mind, this will be a bad film as well.",

It posed a question: why did the gathering clouds of environmental catastrophe appear to present fiction \u2013 including his own, where he noted his tendency to address the subject only obliquely \u2013 with \u201cpeculiar forms of resistance\u201d? Future generations would surely conclude that \u201cours was a time when most forms of art and literature were drawn into the modes of concealment that prevented people from recognising the realities of their plight\u201d.</p> <p>A crisis of climate is, therefore, also a crisis of culture, one in which writers\u2019 fears of improbability, of depicting apocalyptic fractures of history and geography within the confines of a story expected to take its metre from the scale and scope of human lives, have resulted in evasion. Given that this dilemma affects science fiction and the scenarios of alternative history to a lesser degree, the problem seems to lie squarely with fiction in the realist mode.</p> <p>Much has changed in the last three years, albeit not enough for anyone to claim that art has got a handle on how to talk about the impending disaster. And Ghosh\u2019s response in his new novel is straightforward: if realism is not a capacious enough vessel to accommodate the truth, then dispense with it. <em>Gun Island</em> brims with implausibility; outlandish coincidences and chance meetings blend with ancient myth and folklore, tales of heroism and the supernatural set in a contemporary world disrupted by the constant migrations of humans and animals.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Amid the freak cyclones and oxygen-starved waters come the stories of migra\u00adtion across the ages</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Its narrator embodies scepticism and a frequently limiting adherence to empirical reality. A rare book dealer of Bangladeshi heritage, he has settled in Brooklyn after a politically adventurous youth. His name has mutated from Dinanath to the American-friendly \u201cDeen\u201d, and he mitigates his emotional and romantic difficulties with visits to a therapist while attempting to keep financial troubles at bay by amateurishly dabbling in stocks, shares and complicated insurances against the future.

      "bodyText": "In 2016, Amitav Ghosh published The Great Derangement, an examination of collective denial in the face of climate breakdown. It posed a question: why did the gathering clouds of environmental catastrophe appear to present fiction \u2013 including his own, where he noted his tendency to address the subject only obliquely \u2013 with \u201cpeculiar forms of resistance\u201d? Future generations would surely conclude that \u201cours was a time when most forms of art and literature were drawn into the modes of concealment that prevented people from recognising the realities of their plight\u201d. A crisis of climate is, therefore, also a crisis of culture, one in which writers\u2019 fears of improbability, of depicting apocalyptic fractures of history and geography within the confines of a story expected to take its metre from the scale and scope of human lives, have resulted in evasion. Given that this dilemma affects science fiction and the scenarios of alternative history to a lesser degree, the problem seems to lie squarely with fiction in the realist mode. Much has changed in the last three years, albeit not enough for anyone to claim that art has got a handle on how to talk about the impending disaster. And Ghosh\u2019s response in his new novel is straightforward: if realism is not a capacious enough vessel to accommodate the truth, then dispense with it. Gun Island brims with implausibility; outlandish coincidences and chance meetings blend with ancient myth and folklore, tales of heroism and the supernatural set in a contemporary world disrupted by the constant migrations of humans and animals. Its narrator embodies scepticism and a frequently limiting adherence to empirical reality. A rare book dealer of Bangladeshi heritage, he has settled in Brooklyn after a politically adventurous youth. His name has mutated from Dinanath to the American-friendly \u201cDeen\u201d, and he mitigates his emotional and romantic difficulties with visits to a therapist while attempting to keep financial troubles at bay by amateurishly dabbling in stocks, shares and complicated insurances against the future. But a visit back home to Kolkata \u2013 his family having relocated to India during Partition \u2013 threatens to derail his self-imposed and self-contained exile. Events turn on the mention of a Bengali legend, the tale of a merchant fated to travel the world seeking a safe haven from the goddess of snakes, Manasa Devi. It is a story passed down through centuries, with which Deen has been familiar since childhood; its retelling at a party sparks a journey that takes Deen from the mangrove swamps of the Sundarbans to a Los Angeles benighted by forest fires to a gradually sinking Venice. Along the way, we meet a glamorous Italian professor whose erudition allows for a belief in precognition and visitations from the dead; a pair of young Bengali men who submit to the vicious charges of the dalals (traffickers) in order to reach Europe; and an intense marine biologist who is tracking the disturbing rise in stranded whales and dolphins \u2013 the result, she believes, of the spread of oceanic and riverine dead zones. Many of the interactions take place by text, phone, email, social media; a facet of the carbon economy that Deen slowly comes to realise has shifted our perceptions of place and time entirely. It\u2019s little surprise to find Ghosh playing fast and loose with conventions; his Ibis trilogy, set against the backdrop of the opium wars, was founded on puckish digression and operatic swoops between tragedy and comedy.

Imagine, if you will, that Mariah Carey was a boat. And not just a boat, but a craft three storeys high and the length of a football pitch that was capable of hosting 1,500 passengers, with glitzy interiors, well-stocked bars, and lots of open deck space and dance floors. And a helipad. Of course.</p> <p> </p> <p>The company\u2019s first two ships, the original Ocean Diva and the Futura, have already hosted dozens of river events in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium.

What we will do is high-end corporate events, not just parties. Nobody does that on the Thames.\u201d Petersen\u2019s aim is that guests for the Ocean Diva will embark and disembark at Swan Lane Pier twice weekly, while the boat\u2019s permanent mooring will be at east London\u2019s Royal Docks.</p> <p>The Ocean Diva\u2019s website suggests it will give \u201cevery customer a unique and unforgettable experience\u201d, be that \u201cdinner on the outside deck, while enjoying the skyline of your own city\u201d or creating \u201can inspiring and immersive brand event\u201d.</p> <p>However the prospect of the Ocean Diva getting a central London berth has outraged many local residents. </p> <p>Amir Eden, chair of the Living Bankside group, which represents over 13,000 residents along the river from the Oxo Tower to City Hall, says the boat\u2019s presence would be detrimental to both people and river: \u201cIt will ruin views for thousands of people when it\u2019s moored. It will be a real eyesore blocking views for thousands of people when it\u2019s stationary and a safety risk when it\u2019s afloat.\u201d</p> <p>He also calls it a \u201cbitter coincidence\u201d that the new boat is planned to arrive near the 30th anniversary of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/apr/18/how-to-identify-a-body-the-marchioness-disaster-and-my-life-in-forensic-pathology\">sinking of the Marchioness</a> pleasure steamer, which was hit by a dredger on 20 August 1989, leading to the death of 51 people.

How difficult will it be for 1,500 people to disembark in an emergency on to an already congested foreshore?\u201d</p> <p>All passenger ships operating on UK inland waterways are required to be certified by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and have to meet strict safety standards.</p> <p>Objections have also been raised from everyone from the Church of England, which said the increase in party boats \u201chas had a detrimental effect upon the life of the communities around the river\u201d, to the Environment Agency, which said the new pontoon would destroy bird habitats and contribute to erosion, and that dredging work would release high levels of contamination from the sediment into the water.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/bradley-garrett\">Bradley L</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/bradley-garrett\"> Garrett</a>, a cultural and social geographer, and author of Explore Everything: Place-Hacking the City, goes further. He argues that the Ocean Diva plan marks a new and unprecedentedly dismal turn in the commercial exploitation of London\u2019s public spaces, and says it would see the city follow the likes of the Netherlands in \u201cturning working rivers into amusement parks for drunks\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone who has visited Amsterdam has seen the effects of the rampant privatisation of a city\u2019s waterways,\u201d Garrett says. \u201cWhen I was there a few months ago, you could almost walk across the canals on the private tour boats. It came as little surprise that this proposal for a 282-foot floating nightclub came from a Dutch company.</p> <p>\u201cIf this proposal is approved, the gaudy architectural turn that the city has taken in recent years will not only be reflected in the Thames, it will be moved on to it. Why don\u2019t they just turn Tower Bridge into a nightclub too, while they\u2019re at it?\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"937d649baba029c1825f18eedb51d81865edc778\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/937d649baba029c1825f18eedb51d81865edc778/0_155_4600_2760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boats and vessels on an Amsterdam canal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boats and vessels on an Amsterdam canal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Garrett has previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jul/25/squares-angry-privatisation-public-space\">argued</a> that the public spaces of London were being sold to corporations \u2013 in the biggest sell-off of common space since the enclosures of the 17th and 18th century.Many British cities\u2019 public spaces, he contended, were becoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jul/24/pseudo-public-space-explore-data-what-missing\">pseudo-public spaces</a> \u2013 large squares, parks and thoroughfares that appear to be public but are actually owned and controlled by developers and their private backers, as local authorities argue they cannot afford to create or maintain such spaces themselves.</p> <p>The fear now is that the Thames is poised to be similarly plundered. \u201cIt\u2019s a public asset, something for everybody, but we worry that it will effectively become privatised by the arrival of the Ocean Diva,\u201d says Eden. \u201cWe\u2019re not nimbys at Living Bankside. We\u2019re fighting against Ocean Diva for all Londoners.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Thames foreshore has been an important public space offering counter-balance to the rampant privatisation of the South Bank,\u201d says Garrett. \u201cIf this proposal goes through, the tiny slice of public space could be squeezed between shore development and a three-deck party boat the size of a football pitch cruising back and forth.\u201d</p> <p>Greg Lawson, the chief executive of Smart Group, which wants to operate Ocean Diva in London, has sought to allay residents\u2019 fears. \u201cLondon is still the business hub of Europe and a major tourist destination and we are confident that despite these times of uncertainty the vessel will be very popular,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/06/giant-luxury-events-boat-ocean-diva-makes-waves-pollution-disturbance/\">told the Telegraph</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe are totally cognisant that we must operate without causing local difficulties. The acoustics are fantastic and the design means that we are able to operate with very little sound escaping from inside the vessel. It is designed to work on the Thames without causing problems to local residents.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c1e22634a8dbad4afbd437599c6f6fd04cf5fba6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1e22634a8dbad4afbd437599c6f6fd04cf5fba6/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A floating pub on the Thames.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A floating pub on the Thames.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Sterling/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Documents submitted with the planning application state events would start between 6.30 and 7pm and end at 1am, and that noise would be \u201cwell contained within the boat\u201d, and the boat\u2019s owners recently announced the Ocean Diva will have a hybrid engine, thus reducing pollution and noise. Lawson of Smart Group says it will be \u201cthe first ship in London to be carbon-neutral and to clean and recycle all water on board, with zero waste going into the Thames\u201d.</p> <p>Will the Ocean Diva become part of the Thames party parade? On one hand, Eden has written to London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, expressing residents\u2019 fears that it is a done deal, saying: \u201c[S]o confident is the Ocean Diva of getting what it wants that its website has announced that its path to the Thames is clear and that it\u2019s already taking bookings for London parties.\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand, the planning process is still under way. The application to reinstate Swan Lane Pier will be considered by the City of London Corporation\u2019s planning and transportation committee this month. If it gets the go-ahead, then the Port of London Authority will consider the plan and look to make a decision on whether to grant the project a river works licence this summer. Then the plan will be referred to Khan and he will have a two-week window to make a decision.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jan/16/a-three-generation-project-riverside-development-divides-indian-city\">'A three-generation project': riverside development divides Indian city</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So far, the authority has received 10 objections from members of the public to the plan, the mayor\u2019s office claims to have received no comments either for or against, and the City of London has received nearly <a href=\"https://www.planning2.cityoflondon.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=makeComment&amp;keyVal=PMKFGWFHI8H00\">70 objections</a> to the Ocean Diva mooring at the pier.</p> <p>What are our urban waterways for now London\u2019s docks are dead and we live in a post-industrial, post-containerisation age?

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s 7.45 on a Saturday night in May and the revellers on London\u2019s Westminster Pier are ready to get their floating party started. \u201cWhat do we want?\u201d shouts the man in shorts and feather boa next to me in the queue to board the Viscount. \u201cParty!\u201d his mates reply. \u201cWhen do we want it?\u201d \u201cNow!\u201d Dress code? \u201cDress to glow in NEON or WHITE,\u201d goes the blurb. \u201cMake sure you bring your glow sticks.\u201d Party duration? Four hours. Incongruous person sporting dark clothes, clenched teeth and sensible scarf, carrying notebook and noise-cancelling headphones? That\u2019d be me. What\u2019s the attraction of spending four hours partying on a boat travelling up and down the Thames, I ask a hen party guest wearing a pink stetson. \u201cGreat views. Booze. Dancing. Dressing up. What\u2019s not to like?\u201d I make my excuses and disembark before we cast off. The 111-year-old Viscount, whose many ordeals prior to this evening included rescuing British troops from Dunkirk, is among a growing number of vessels offering night-time revels on Britain\u2019s rivers. Such \u201cparty boats\u201d are a feature of many UK cities \u2013 York\u2019s City Cruises specialises in hen parties on the River Ouse, complete with balloons, buffets and the chance to unleash your inner Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 but it is on the Thames that the rebranding of our waterways is most intense. Party boats are a common sight on the Thames \u2013 Martin Garside of the Port of London Authority says there are probably about 40 passenger boats in regular use on the tidal Thames in London for charter activities such as family celebrations, parties and corporate events. But these craft are about to be eclipsed by the biggest party boat Britain has ever seen, if a Dutch company has its way. It wants to reinstate Swan Lane Pier near London Bridge, once the home of the Regalia floating pub, to accommodate a mega-boat called the Ocean Diva. What does the Ocean Diva look like? Imagine, if you will, that Mariah Carey was a boat. And not just a boat, but a craft three storeys high and the length of a football pitch that was capable of hosting 1,500 passengers, with glitzy interiors, well-stocked bars, and lots of open deck space and dance floors. And a helipad. Of course. The company\u2019s first two ships, the original Ocean Diva and the Futura, have already hosted dozens of river events in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. Now it wants to bring its lucrative business model to the heart of London. Edwin Petersen, chief executive, recently told the London Evening Standard: \u201cI have always been surprised by the low quality of party boats on the Thames. What we will do is high-end corporate events, not just parties. Nobody does that on the Thames.\u201d Petersen\u2019s aim is that guests for the Ocean Diva will embark and disembark at Swan Lane Pier twice weekly, while the boat\u2019s permanent mooring will be at east London\u2019s Royal Docks. The Ocean Diva\u2019s website suggests it will give \u201cevery customer a unique and unforgettable experience\u201d, be that \u201cdinner on the outside deck, while enjoying the skyline of your own city\u201d or creating \u201can inspiring and immersive brand event\u201d. However the prospect of the Ocean Diva getting a central London berth has outraged many local residents. Amir Eden, chair of the Living Bankside group, which represents over 13,000 residents along the river from the Oxo Tower to City Hall, says the boat\u2019s presence would be detrimental to both people and river: \u201cIt will ruin views for thousands of people when it\u2019s moored. It will be a real eyesore blocking views for thousands of people when it\u2019s stationary and a safety risk when it\u2019s afloat.\u201d He also calls it a \u201cbitter coincidence\u201d that the new boat is planned to arrive near the 30th anniversary of the sinking of the Marchioness pleasure steamer, which was hit by a dredger on 20 August 1989, leading to the death of 51 people. The collision happened between Cannon Street and Southwark bridges \u2013 not far from Swan Lane. Eden is also worried about Ocean Diva\u2019s evacuation plans: \u201cWe know from the London Bridge attacks how hard it is to clear an area near the Thames in an emergency fast when there are so many tourists and people going out for the evening. How difficult will it be for 1,500 people to disembark in an emergency on to an already congested foreshore?\u201d All passenger ships operating on UK inland waterways are required to be certified by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and have to meet strict safety standards. Objections have also been raised from everyone from the Church of England, which said the increase in party boats \u201chas had a detrimental effect upon the life of the communities around the river\u201d, to the Environment Agency, which said the new pontoon would destroy bird habitats and contribute to erosion, and that dredging work would release high levels of contamination from the sediment into the water. Bradley L Garrett, a cultural and social geographer, and author of Explore Everything: Place-Hacking the City, goes further. He argues that the Ocean Diva plan marks a new and unprecedentedly dismal turn in the commercial exploitation of London\u2019s public spaces, and says it would see the city follow the likes of the Netherlands in \u201cturning working rivers into amusement parks for drunks\u201d. \u201cAnyone who has visited Amsterdam has seen the effects of the rampant privatisation of a city\u2019s waterways,\u201d Garrett says. \u201cWhen I was there a few months ago, you could almost walk across the canals on the private tour boats. It came as little surprise that this proposal for a 282-foot floating nightclub came from a Dutch company. \u201cIf this proposal is approved, the gaudy architectural turn that the city has taken in recent years will not only be reflected in the Thames, it will be moved on to it. Why don\u2019t they just turn Tower Bridge into a nightclub too, while they\u2019re at it?\u201d Garrett has previously argued that the public spaces of London were being sold to corporations \u2013 in the biggest sell-off of common space since the enclosures of the 17th and 18th century.Many British cities\u2019 public spaces, he contended, were becoming pseudo-public spaces \u2013 large squares, parks and thoroughfares that appear to be public but are actually owned and controlled by developers and their private backers, as local authorities argue they cannot afford to create or maintain such spaces themselves. The fear now is that the Thames is poised to be similarly plundered. \u201cIt\u2019s a public asset, something for everybody, but we worry that it will effectively become privatised by the arrival of the Ocean Diva,\u201d says Eden. \u201cWe\u2019re not nimbys at Living Bankside. We\u2019re fighting against Ocean Diva for all Londoners.\u201d \u201cThe Thames foreshore has been an important public space offering counter-balance to the rampant privatisation of the South Bank,\u201d says Garrett. \u201cIf this proposal goes through, the tiny slice of public space could be squeezed between shore development and a three-deck party boat the size of a football pitch cruising back and forth.\u201d Greg Lawson, the chief executive of Smart Group, which wants to operate Ocean Diva in London, has sought to allay residents\u2019 fears. \u201cLondon is still the business hub of Europe and a major tourist destination and we are confident that despite these times of uncertainty the vessel will be very popular,\u201d he told the Telegraph. \u201cWe are totally cognisant that we must operate without causing local difficulties. The acoustics are fantastic and the design means that we are able to operate with very little sound escaping from inside the vessel. It is designed to work on the Thames without causing problems to local residents.\u201d Documents submitted with the planning application state events would start between 6.30 and 7pm and end at 1am, and that noise would be \u201cwell contained within the boat\u201d, and the boat\u2019s owners recently announced the Ocean Diva will have a hybrid engine, thus reducing pollution and noise. Lawson of Smart Group says it will be \u201cthe first ship in London to be carbon-neutral and to clean and recycle all water on board, with zero waste going into the Thames\u201d. Will the Ocean Diva become part of the Thames party parade? On one hand, Eden has written to London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, expressing residents\u2019 fears that it is a done deal, saying: \u201c[S]o confident is the Ocean Diva of getting what it wants that its website has announced that its path to the Thames is clear and that it\u2019s already taking bookings for London parties.\u201d On the other hand, the planning process is still under way. The application to reinstate Swan Lane Pier will be considered by the City of London Corporation\u2019s planning and transportation committee this month. If it gets the go-ahead, then the Port of London Authority will consider the plan and look to make a decision on whether to grant the project a river works licence this summer. Then the plan will be referred to Khan and he will have a two-week window to make a decision. So far, the authority has received 10 objections from members of the public to the plan, the mayor\u2019s office claims to have received no comments either for or against, and the City of London has received nearly 70 objections to the Ocean Diva mooring at the pier. What are our urban waterways for now London\u2019s docks are dead and we live in a post-industrial, post-containerisation age? Eden argues that the Thames is London\u2019s biggest public space and needs protecting: \u201cIt\u2019s a public asset, free for the people, just like any commons, just like any public good. I suppose if you look at it another way, it\u2019s London\u2019s biggest unexploited asset, ripe for the taking.

We will fight with every last breath of our body to defend the principle of a healthcare system free at the point of need for everybody as a human right,\u201d he said. Corbyn turned down an invitation to the Queen\u2019s state banquet for Trump but it emerged during the press conference that he had requested a private meeting with the president. Trump said he had rejected the request from Corbyn, describing him as \u201csomewhat of a negative force\u201d. \u201cHe wanted to meet today or tomorrow, and I decided that I would not do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI really don\u2019t like critics as much as I like and respect someone who can get things done.\u201d He dismissed the protest attended by Corbyn as \u201cvery small\u201d and \u201cfake news\u201d, while implausibly claiming thousands had lined the streets to welcome him on Monday. Organisers of anti-Trump protests said up to 75,000 people had demonstrated against the state visit in central London. May appeared uncomfortable at the suggestion the NHS could be included in a trade deal, saying both sides would \u201cnegotiate and come to an agreement about what should or should not be in that trade deal for the future\u201d. However, she did not explicitly rule it out. That was left to Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who is running to be Conservative leader. \u201cDear Mr President. The NHS isn\u2019t on the table in trade talks \u2013 and never will be. Not on my watch,\u201d he tweeted. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, also ruled it out this week, saying: \u201cI can\u2019t conceive of any future prime minister, for any party, ever agreeing that we would allow NHS procurement to be part of trade talks, because the NHS as a publicly run, publicly owned institution is part of our DNA.\u201d Even Dominic Raab, a rightwinger in the Tory contest who has suggested offering tax breaks to companies wanting to provide NHS services, said: \u201cI want to see the UK get fair deals on trade with the US and many other countries when we leave the EU. But the NHS is not for sale to any country and never would be if I was prime minister.\u201d As well as backtracking on his NHS views, Trump also softened his stance towards Corbyn, holding out the prospect of a meeting in the future. Asked if he could imagine negotiating a trade deal with a government led by the Labour leader, Trump said: \u201cIt\u2019s always possible. Anything is possible.\u201d With May leaving office by the end of July, Trump was careful to praise her efforts to deliver Brexit but also made it known he was planning to talk to the leading candidates to replace her. The US president was due to have one-to-ones with Hunt and Michael Gove, the environment secretary, but Boris Johnson, the frontrunner, turned down the chance of a meeting in order to address One Nation Tory MPs at a hustings event on Tuesday night. Asked for his views on the candidates, Trump said: \u201cI know Boris. I like him. I\u2019ve liked him for a long time. I think he\u2019d do a very good job. I know Jeremy. I think he\u2019d do a very good job. I don\u2019t know Michael. Would he do a good job, Jeremy? Tell me.\u201d In fact, Gove had interviewed Trump for the Times in January 2017, with the pair pictured together with their thumbs aloft. Two hardline Brexit supporters, Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, and Owen Paterson, a former cabinet minister, both met Trump as well and Nigel Farage was later pictured driving into the US ambassador\u2019s residence for a meeting. Afterwards, the Brexit party leader tweeted: \u201cGood meeting with President Trump \u2013 he really believes in Brexit and is loving his trip to London.\u201d Trump and the first lady Melania also hosted Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, at Winfield House in Regent\u2019s PArk in London, the official residence of the US ambassador. Tory leadership candidates\u2019 views on any trade deal are likely to be high on the agenda when they meet Trump. But their position on Huawei, the Chinese tech firm, is also crucial as the US is opposed to its involvement in the UK\u2019s 5G communications network and has hinted it could harm US-UK intelligence sharing. However, Trump said there should be \u201cno problem\u201d with intelligence sharing between the US and UK based on his conversations with May, raising the prospect of a possible climbdown on the issue. \u201cWe are going to have an agreement on Huawei and everything else,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an incredible intelligence relationship and we will be able to work out any differences. We did discuss it. I see absolutely no limitations. We\u2019ve never had limitations. This is a truly great ally and partner and we\u2019ll have no problem with that.\u201d A No 10 spokesman said only that there was a review of the Huawei plans under way and declined to say whether the NHS could be part of any trade deal. After Trump\u2019s press conference, politicians called on the Conservative leadership candidates to rule out allowing it as the price of a trade deal. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said US corporations \u201ctaking over our NHS is a nightmare scenario\u201d. \u201cThe Tories appear happy to give Trump what he wants, and some want to offer up our NHS to get the no-deal Brexit they are campaigning for,\u201d he said. \u201cIf our NHS is taken over by US corporations, it will undermine it as a free, universal public service. The NHS is only safe in Labour hands.\u201d Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, said: \u201cMillions of people will be shocked and angry at the suggestion of selling off access to our NHS in return for the opportunity for Donald Trump to fill our shelves with chlorinated chicken,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Liberal Democrats will continue to fight for the people to get the final say on Brexit so that we can protect the NHS.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Solomon Islands, one of the few remaining countries to have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, will make a decision about whether to transfer its allegiance to China within 100 days, the Guardian has learned. The timeframe for the decision was set out by the Solomon Islands\u2019 foreign minister Jeremiah Manele during a bilateral meeting with Australian prime minister Scott Morrison on Monday, but the sensitive discussion was not meant to be made public. Ahead of Morrison\u2019s visit to the Pacific nation earlier this week, there was speculation about whether he would would push Solomon Islands leaders to maintain its relationship with Taiwan, due to the battle for influence in the Pacific region between Australia and China. The Solomon Islands is one of six Pacific nations, and 17 countries worldwide that recognise Taiwan, precluding them from having diplomatic relations with China. A government official told the Guardian that Morrison discussed the matter with Manele in their meeting in Honiara earlier this week, at which point the minister said the decision would be made in the next 100 days, meaning a decision would be made by mid-September. In recent years China has stepped up the pressure on these six nations to change allegiance, offering large amounts of aid and grant money to its allies in the region, a powerful incentive to low-income, aid-dependent countries to give up diplomatic relations with Taiwan. After meeting with the Solomon Islands\u2019 prime minister Manasseh Sogavare on Monday, Morrison would not confirm whether the leaders discussed the Taiwan-China question but said Australia would not put any pressure on Solomon Islands over the issue. \u201cDecisions on those issues are entirely the province of the government of Solomon Islands,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are an independent sovereign country who will make decisions in their national interests.\u201d Manele later said: \u201cIt is a sovereign decision, a matter for the Solomon Islands government to look at. On that note, the government is making a comprehensive assessment of the issue so that government, the caucus and the cabinet, is well informed on the matter.\u201d Australia has been seeking to counter China\u2019s growing influence in the Pacific region, which is part of the motivation for Morrison\u2019s \u201cPacific step-up\u201d policy, which has seen Australia put the region at the heart of its foreign affairs program, and has seen it receive 35% of Australia\u2019s aid budget.",

If someone cannot be discharged from hospital because their home does not meet their needs while convalescing, the NHS incurs extra costs of at least \u00a32,000 a week. A more likely explanation is simply failure \u2013 still \u2013 to recognise the importance of the issue. Habinteg, which wants the government to make the rest of England follow London\u2019s lead in setting targets, found that many of the 322 \u201clocal plans\u201d it analysed for the survey still cite out-of-date standards that should have been replaced in 2015. Across the whole West Midlands region, just 10% of planned new homes were found to be designated accessible, all of them according to the old standards. This may, of course, have not a little to do with the lamentable state of the austerity-ravaged planning system. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies has just reported, there have been real-terms cuts of more than 50% in spending on planning and development by English councils over the past decade, as dwindling funds have been desperately shifted to social care. Our political leaders would do well to remember that saving money on planning leads not just to fewer pen-pushers, but also to fewer older and disabled people able to live independent lives. \u2022 David Brindle is the Guardian\u2019s public services editor",

They live in safe neighborhoods with well-funded schools attended by high test-scoring peers. They almost all graduate high school and enroll in college, and a majority of those in college graduate with a degree. In contrast, children born to less educated, lower-income parents are increasingly being raised in single-parent homes with fewer resources. They often live in low-income neighborhoods and attend inferior schools. They graduate high school at much lower rates, and those who do enroll in college are much more likely to enroll in <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2013a_hoxby.pdf\">non-selective schools</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w17633.pdf?new_window=1\">much less likely to earn a degree</a>.</p> <p>Our country needs a new social contract, established with the aim of closing these class gaps in opportunity and ultimately outcomes. This will require a more complete social insurance system for children, improved educational institutions and stronger families.</p> <h2><strong>Social insurance system for children</strong></h2> <p>The US government provides adults with various forms of social insurance. Adults who live beyond their expected working years are entitled to social security cash payments to keep them from living in poverty, as well as Medicare to ensure they have health insurance. Adults who experience a work-limiting disability are similarly entitled to disability payments and Medicare. But, glaringly, the US does not offer robust social insurance to children. Children who, through no fault of their own, happen to be born to parents with limited resources are offered only limited, conditional help, with no guarantee of adequate material wellbeing. Our social contract must include the extension of the social insurance principle to children.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2018/demo/p60-265.html\">Roughly one in six children</a> in America are living in poverty today. About 15 million children are living in households <a href=\"http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/twelve_facts_about_food_insecurity_and_snap\">that are food insecure</a>. That means millions of children are arriving at school each day with the pangs of hunger and other associated ills of poverty. Research from a variety of disciplines makes it clear that early life deprivation of various kinds has lasting negative effects on a child\u2019s health, educational outcomes and ultimately their ability to work and earn high wages as an adult. On both moral and economic grounds, we need to do more in this country to ameliorate childhood deprivation.</p> <p>We need a much stronger support system for low-income families. Specifically, the government should maintain and expand existing programs that are working well. It should also expand the safety net to fill in existing holes. In the US, this means expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC); maintaining the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (Snap) and Medicaid entitlement programs; dramatically expanding funding for housing and childcare assistance for low-income families; and offering more support for parents who are out of work.</p> <p>The EITC subsidizes the annual earnings of low-income workers. It gives the most help to those with two or more children, and plays a pivotal role in reducing poverty rates among families with children. The EITC is favored across the political aisle because it both encourages work and reduces poverty. Two enhancements should be made: increase the credit for <a href=\"http://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/legacy/files/downloads_and_links/expand_earned_income_tax_credit_hoynes.pdf\">families with only one child</a> and for those with married families with two earners (who see less of a benefit from the program <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/04-proposal-help-low-income-families-kearney.pdf\">due to the way</a> the US tax code treats two-earner families).</p> <p>Next, food assistance and public health insurance for low-income families must be protected. There is a policy movement to make Snap and Medicaid contingent upon an individual\u2019s steady hours of work. This would be a terrible mistake. Snap provides a monthly credit to millions of qualifying low-income families that they can use to purchase nutritious food. <a href=\"https://gspp.berkeley.edu/assets/uploads/research/pdf/Hoynes_Why_SNAP_Matters_1-25-16.pdf\">Snap</a><a href=\"https://gspp.berkeley.edu/assets/uploads/research/pdf/Hoynes_Why_SNAP_Matters_1-25-16.pdf\"> lifts nearly 5 million</a> people out of poverty, including more than 2 million children. Medicaid provides health insurance coverage to approximately 37 million low-income children, roughly half of all children in the United States. Both <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130375\">Snap</a> and <a href=\"http://jhr.uwpress.org/content/early/2018/01/25/jhr.54.3.0816.8173R1.abstract\">Medicaid</a> not only help families in the short term, they lay the foundations for children to do better in the long run.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Denying poor children food stamps and health insurance because their parents cannot maintain steady employment would defy the very purpose of a safety net</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Denying poor children food stamps and health insurance because their parents cannot maintain steady employment would defy the very purpose of a safety net. It would also be morally cruel and economically counterproductive. Furthermore, there is <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w24333\">no compelling evidence</a> showing that access to these programs is damaging employment rates.</p> <p>A system of social insurance to children should also provide for safe housing. In addition to food and healthcare, children need a home \u2013 a decent, stable place to live. It should never cease to shock us that, on any given night in this nation of great wealth, there are roughly <a href=\"https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2018-AHAR-Part-1.pdf\">500,000 people experiencing homelessness</a>, including more than 180,000 people in families with children. Many more children live in crowded, unsafe living conditions and can thus hardly be expected to thrive in school and reach their full human potential. Compelling evidence documents the benefits to children of moving out of <a href=\"https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20161352\">high-poverty housing projects</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20150572\">neighborhoods</a>.</p> <p>Current federal spending on housing assistance programs is woefully inadequate. The federal government allocates less than $20bn a year to the Housing Choice Voucher Program, which is the largest federal program providing housing assistance to low-income families. There are far more eligible families than there are available vouchers, and as a result <a href=\"http://apps.cbpp.org/shareables_housing_unmet/chart.html\">more than 17 million eligible</a> renter households do not receive a voucher, including more than 6 million families with children under age 18. Millions of eligible families are placed on multi-year-long waiting lists for housing assistance, with some never receiving program benefits. Contrast this level of spending with the $130bn in annual tax expenditures attributed to tax deductions for mortgage interest payments and property taxes, which disproportionately benefit high-income home owners. On both equity and efficiency grounds, maintaining this tax break while underfunding housing assistance to low-income families makes no sense.</p> <p>Millions of families also struggle to afford high-quality childcare. Just as there is no entitlement to housing or housing assistance in the US, there is no entitlement to childcare or childcare assistance. The <a href=\"https://www.acf.hhs.gov/archive/occ/faq/what-is-the-child-care-and-development-fund-ccdf\">Child Care and Development Fund</a>, a federal and state partnership program, offers financial assistance to low-income families to access childcare so they can work or attend a job training or educational program. But with only $5bn in federal funding, this program does not have sufficient resources to help all eligible families. A <a href=\"https://www.childtrends.org/millions-eligible-children-miss-federal-child-care-grants\">recent estimate suggests</a> that only one out of 10 of the roughly 12.7 million qualifying children are aided through this fund. Too many working parents are left with no choice but to leave their children in informal childcare arrangements of questionable quality. This gaping hole in the US system of support for working families is counterproductive to both the goal of increasing employment and the goal of fostering positive child development.</p> <p>The final cornerstone of an expanded social insurance system for children is more help for out-of-work parents. Since the landmark 1996 welfare reform legislation, federal transfer programs provide very little aid by way of <a href=\"https://econofact.org/welfare-and-the-federal-budget\">cash assistance to non-working adults</a>. The only federal program that provides cash income to non-elderly, non-disabled individuals is Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). But benefits are time-limited and usually conditional on work requirements. To make matters worse, most states are only spending a small share of TANF dollars on cash assistance. The number of poor families receiving welfare benefits has <a href=\"http://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/files/bitler_hoynes_strengthening_tanf.pdf\">plummeted</a> since 1996, falling to roughly one-quarter in recent years. And the caseload <a href=\"https://gspp.berkeley.edu/assets/uploads/research/pdf/Bitler-Hoynes-JOLE-2016.pdf\">hardly increased at all</a> during the Great Recession, despite the surge in joblessness and economic insecurity. Our set of safety net supports should do much more to help out-of-work parents not only provide for their families, but also invest in themselves and their work capacity.</p> <h2><strong>Improved educational institutions</strong></h2> <p>Providing a strong social insurance system for our children should be the first obligation of government under a new social contract. The second is to provide a more robust set of educational institutions. Capitalism handsomely rewards those with high levels of skills and ingenuity. But those with lower levels of education and skill are being left further and further behind. It is more important than ever that <em>all</em> children have access to a high-quality education, from early childhood through adulthood.</p> <p>By the time children arrive in kindergarten, there are huge gaps in academic and school preparedness between children from low-income and high-income families. Children from high-income families are much more likely to have benefited from parental educational investments, including prolific reading and talking engagement, as well as from participating in a formal preschool setting. Only about <a href=\"http://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/legacy/files/downloads_and_links/expand_preschool_access_cascio_schanzebach.pdf\">half of four-year-old children</a> from families in the lowest income quintile attend preschool, compared to more than three-quarters of those from families in the highest income quintile.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is more important than ever that all children have access to a high quality education, from early childhood through adulthood</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Children are being done tremendous disservice by having no entitlement to education until the age of five. High-quality early childhood education should be available to all children, not just those lucky enough to win a lottery spot in an underfunded local program or to have parents who are able to pay for private early childhood education. Access to high-quality preschool programs for low-income children can yield large, lasting payoffs in terms of improved education and labor market outcomes.</p> <p>Primary and secondary schools in the US are vastly unequal across our residentially segregated neighborhoods. Far too often, our system of neighborhood schools relegates children from poor neighborhoods into inferior schools. Decades of experimentation with incremental school reform has yielded few compelling solutions. School choice has in some instances led to better outcomes for some students, but has generally not led to widespread system improvements. The introduction of charter schools has led to the creation of some <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w15740\">highly effective schools</a> that serve some students quite well; others have proved disappointing.</p> <p>Teachers matter. Students who have the good fortune of being assigned to a classroom <a href=\"https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.104.9.2633\">with a high-quality teacher</a> are more likely to graduate college and earn higher wages in later life. But there is not much policy evidence about how to successfully improve teacher quality or how to identify, recruit and retain good teachers. This is an area that warrants dedicated research and policy focus.</p> <p>Beyond primary and secondary education, the ideal government in a capitalist society will promise students access to well-funded, effective post-secondary institutions of education and training. Given the tremendous importance of a college degree to economic outcomes in today\u2019s capitalist system, it is imperative that more students complete college. A majority of high school graduates now enroll in college, but fewer than one-third of young adults actually complete a college degree. Completion rates are especially low among students from low-income families and at non-selective institutions. Money matters here: increased school funding and expanded student supports have been shown to lead to increased completion rates.</p> <p>Federal and state governments should commit to dramatically expanded public funding of public universities and <a href=\"https://assets.aspeninstitute.org/content/uploads/2019/01/1.1-Pgs-16-39-A-Policy-Agenda-to-Develop-Human-Capital-for-the-Modern-Economy.pdf?_ga=2.149951670.1016518277.1556230151-969604671.1509559607\">community colleges</a>. These are the engines of social mobility in this country. The promise to students should be that if you are willing to work hard and pursue post-secondary studies and programs, then in return for your tuition payment \u2013 whether it be privately or publicly financed \u2013 you can expect to develop meaningful skills that will be rewarded in the labor market.</p> <p>In addition, governments and school districts should continue developing and improving initiatives such as <a href=\"https://assets.aspeninstitute.org/content/uploads/2019/01/1.2-Pgs-40-54-What-Works-in-Career-and-Technical-Education.pdf?_ga=2.48523876.374998843.1556503862-970734357.1548769119\">Career and Technical Education (CTE)</a> programs that provide meaningful alternative pathways to successful employment.</p> <h2><strong>Strengthened families</strong></h2> <p>It is up to the government to meet the terms of the social contract through the creation of both a social insurance system and an improved educational system. But parents need to uphold their side of the bargain, too. There is only so much that public funds and public schools can do to make up for deficits in the home environment. We cannot ignore the role that family background and family structure play in shaping children\u2019s life trajectory.</p> <p>As I have argued, the government can and should do more to mitigate the material gaps between families of difference backgrounds. But parents are also making decisions that differ greatly across socioeconomic classes in ways that exacerbate inequality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/08/how-to-fix-capitalism-eight-experts-solutions\">How to fix capitalism: nine expert solutions for America's broken system</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today, fewer than two in three children are being raised in two-parent homes. This matters, because having only one parent in the home means <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-economics-063016-103749\">fewer resources</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.22.3.23\">less parental time investment</a>. There is a big class divide here. Eighty-five per cent of children whose moms have a college degree live in a two-parent home, compared with 60% or lower of children born to a mother without a college degree.</p> <p>Families headed by a single mother are <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/cps-pov/pov-03.html\">five times more likely </a><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/cps-pov/pov-03.html\">to live in poverty</a>: 36% versus 7%. Being born to an unmarried parent is an important predictor of whether a child will be raised in poverty, drop out of high school and live in poverty as an adult. The link between poverty and single-parent families runs both ways, of course: living in poverty is a leading predictor of whether someone will become an unmarried parent. This makes it hard to precisely parse out causality. But, recent <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.5.1.32\">work by economists</a> suggests that boys suffer even more than girls do when they are raised in a single-mother home, and that this might be contributing to boys\u2019 relatively worse performance in school.</p> <p>There is no easy solution to this challenge. But we cannot have an honest dialogue about children\u2019s outcomes without acknowledging the role that family structure is playing in perpetuating class divides.</p> <p>Many parents will need to do more to provide a secure, stable family life for their children. For some, this might mean delaying childbearing until they are in a more stable relationship and/or secure economic position. A terrific development in this regard is the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr63/nvsr63_04.pdf\">tremendous decline in teen births</a> over recent decades. Programs that <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20160039\">promote affordable access to effective birth control</a> have been shown to effectively lead to lower rates of teen and unplanned pregnancies. As to marriage, of course there are some parent unions that are harmful and should not remain intact. But initiatives that effectively encourage and support <em>healthy </em>marriages, or foster more father involvement in children\u2019s lives regardless of parental marital status, will put children on a more reliable path toward upward mobility. Unfortunately the evidence on what types of policies and programs effectively strengthen families is thin.</p> <p>Not all our social problems can be solved through public policy. Private decisions and commitments matter, too. For obvious reasons it is hard for governments to promote good parenting, stable families and healthy relationships \u2013 all of which are vital for child wellbeing, and opportunity. This part of the social contract has to be delivered, in large part, by individuals and communities.</p> <p>A capitalism that works for children, and for the future, is both possible and desirable. But it will require a new social contract, a contract that places obligations on government and citizens alike. The responsibility lies with us all.</p>",

If our capitalist system is going to be fair to children and families \u2013 if it is going to hold out any meaningful promise of equal opportunity \u2013 then a new social contract is needed. Government cannot promise equal outcomes to children, but it can promote equal opportunities. This is achieved through the provision of public goods and services, including safety net supports and quality educational institutions. Children should have the opportunity to rise as far as their talents and work will take them. Individual hard work will earn material comfort; with talent and some luck, it might even earn great riches. And all children should have that opportunity. At least that\u2019s how we imagine it\u2019s supposed to work. But in our modern capitalist society \u2013 characterized by tremendously high rates of income inequality, regional and local disparities, and extreme cultural and institutional divides \u2013 children from different family backgrounds do not have anything close to equal opportunities. Children born to highly educated, high-income parents are almost all being raised in high-resource, two-parent homes. They live in safe neighborhoods with well-funded schools attended by high test-scoring peers. They almost all graduate high school and enroll in college, and a majority of those in college graduate with a degree. In contrast, children born to less educated, lower-income parents are increasingly being raised in single-parent homes with fewer resources. They often live in low-income neighborhoods and attend inferior schools. They graduate high school at much lower rates, and those who do enroll in college are much more likely to enroll in non-selective schools and much less likely to earn a degree. Our country needs a new social contract, established with the aim of closing these class gaps in opportunity and ultimately outcomes. This will require a more complete social insurance system for children, improved educational institutions and stronger families. Social insurance system for children The US government provides adults with various forms of social insurance. Adults who live beyond their expected working years are entitled to social security cash payments to keep them from living in poverty, as well as Medicare to ensure they have health insurance. Adults who experience a work-limiting disability are similarly entitled to disability payments and Medicare. But, glaringly, the US does not offer robust social insurance to children. Children who, through no fault of their own, happen to be born to parents with limited resources are offered only limited, conditional help, with no guarantee of adequate material wellbeing. Our social contract must include the extension of the social insurance principle to children. Roughly one in six children in America are living in poverty today. About 15 million children are living in households that are food insecure. That means millions of children are arriving at school each day with the pangs of hunger and other associated ills of poverty. Research from a variety of disciplines makes it clear that early life deprivation of various kinds has lasting negative effects on a child\u2019s health, educational outcomes and ultimately their ability to work and earn high wages as an adult. On both moral and economic grounds, we need to do more in this country to ameliorate childhood deprivation. We need a much stronger support system for low-income families. Specifically, the government should maintain and expand existing programs that are working well. It should also expand the safety net to fill in existing holes. In the US, this means expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC); maintaining the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (Snap) and Medicaid entitlement programs; dramatically expanding funding for housing and childcare assistance for low-income families; and offering more support for parents who are out of work. The EITC subsidizes the annual earnings of low-income workers. It gives the most help to those with two or more children, and plays a pivotal role in reducing poverty rates among families with children. The EITC is favored across the political aisle because it both encourages work and reduces poverty. Two enhancements should be made: increase the credit for families with only one child and for those with married families with two earners (who see less of a benefit from the program due to the way the US tax code treats two-earner families). Next, food assistance and public health insurance for low-income families must be protected. There is a policy movement to make Snap and Medicaid contingent upon an individual\u2019s steady hours of work. This would be a terrible mistake. Snap provides a monthly credit to millions of qualifying low-income families that they can use to purchase nutritious food. Snap lifts nearly 5 million people out of poverty, including more than 2 million children. Medicaid provides health insurance coverage to approximately 37 million low-income children, roughly half of all children in the United States. Both Snap and Medicaid not only help families in the short term, they lay the foundations for children to do better in the long run. Denying poor children food stamps and health insurance because their parents cannot maintain steady employment would defy the very purpose of a safety net. It would also be morally cruel and economically counterproductive. Furthermore, there is no compelling evidence showing that access to these programs is damaging employment rates. A system of social insurance to children should also provide for safe housing. In addition to food and healthcare, children need a home \u2013 a decent, stable place to live. It should never cease to shock us that, on any given night in this nation of great wealth, there are roughly 500,000 people experiencing homelessness, including more than 180,000 people in families with children. Many more children live in crowded, unsafe living conditions and can thus hardly be expected to thrive in school and reach their full human potential. Compelling evidence documents the benefits to children of moving out of high-poverty housing projects and neighborhoods. Current federal spending on housing assistance programs is woefully inadequate. The federal government allocates less than $20bn a year to the Housing Choice Voucher Program, which is the largest federal program providing housing assistance to low-income families. There are far more eligible families than there are available vouchers, and as a result more than 17 million eligible renter households do not receive a voucher, including more than 6 million families with children under age 18. Millions of eligible families are placed on multi-year-long waiting lists for housing assistance, with some never receiving program benefits. Contrast this level of spending with the $130bn in annual tax expenditures attributed to tax deductions for mortgage interest payments and property taxes, which disproportionately benefit high-income home owners. On both equity and efficiency grounds, maintaining this tax break while underfunding housing assistance to low-income families makes no sense. Millions of families also struggle to afford high-quality childcare. Just as there is no entitlement to housing or housing assistance in the US, there is no entitlement to childcare or childcare assistance. The Child Care and Development Fund, a federal and state partnership program, offers financial assistance to low-income families to access childcare so they can work or attend a job training or educational program. But with only $5bn in federal funding, this program does not have sufficient resources to help all eligible families. A recent estimate suggests that only one out of 10 of the roughly 12.7 million qualifying children are aided through this fund. Too many working parents are left with no choice but to leave their children in informal childcare arrangements of questionable quality. This gaping hole in the US system of support for working families is counterproductive to both the goal of increasing employment and the goal of fostering positive child development. The final cornerstone of an expanded social insurance system for children is more help for out-of-work parents. Since the landmark 1996 welfare reform legislation, federal transfer programs provide very little aid by way of cash assistance to non-working adults. The only federal program that provides cash income to non-elderly, non-disabled individuals is Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). But benefits are time-limited and usually conditional on work requirements. To make matters worse, most states are only spending a small share of TANF dollars on cash assistance. The number of poor families receiving welfare benefits has plummeted since 1996, falling to roughly one-quarter in recent years. And the caseload hardly increased at all during the Great Recession, despite the surge in joblessness and economic insecurity. Our set of safety net supports should do much more to help out-of-work parents not only provide for their families, but also invest in themselves and their work capacity. Improved educational institutions Providing a strong social insurance system for our children should be the first obligation of government under a new social contract. The second is to provide a more robust set of educational institutions. Capitalism handsomely rewards those with high levels of skills and ingenuity. But those with lower levels of education and skill are being left further and further behind. It is more important than ever that all children have access to a high-quality education, from early childhood through adulthood. By the time children arrive in kindergarten, there are huge gaps in academic and school preparedness between children from low-income and high-income families. Children from high-income families are much more likely to have benefited from parental educational investments, including prolific reading and talking engagement, as well as from participating in a formal preschool setting. Only about half of four-year-old children from families in the lowest income quintile attend preschool, compared to more than three-quarters of those from families in the highest income quintile. Children are being done tremendous disservice by having no entitlement to education until the age of five. High-quality early childhood education should be available to all children, not just those lucky enough to win a lottery spot in an underfunded local program or to have parents who are able to pay for private early childhood education. Access to high-quality preschool programs for low-income children can yield large, lasting payoffs in terms of improved education and labor market outcomes. Primary and secondary schools in the US are vastly unequal across our residentially segregated neighborhoods. Far too often, our system of neighborhood schools relegates children from poor neighborhoods into inferior schools. Decades of experimentation with incremental school reform has yielded few compelling solutions. School choice has in some instances led to better outcomes for some students, but has generally not led to widespread system improvements. The introduction of charter schools has led to the creation of some highly effective schools that serve some students quite well; others have proved disappointing. Teachers matter. Students who have the good fortune of being assigned to a classroom with a high-quality teacher are more likely to graduate college and earn higher wages in later life. But there is not much policy evidence about how to successfully improve teacher quality or how to identify, recruit and retain good teachers. This is an area that warrants dedicated research and policy focus. Beyond primary and secondary education, the ideal government in a capitalist society will promise students access to well-funded, effective post-secondary institutions of education and training. Given the tremendous importance of a college degree to economic outcomes in today\u2019s capitalist system, it is imperative that more students complete college. A majority of high school graduates now enroll in college, but fewer than one-third of young adults actually complete a college degree. Completion rates are especially low among students from low-income families and at non-selective institutions. Money matters here: increased school funding and expanded student supports have been shown to lead to increased completion rates. Federal and state governments should commit to dramatically expanded public funding of public universities and community colleges. These are the engines of social mobility in this country. The promise to students should be that if you are willing to work hard and pursue post-secondary studies and programs, then in return for your tuition payment \u2013 whether it be privately or publicly financed \u2013 you can expect to develop meaningful skills that will be rewarded in the labor market. In addition, governments and school districts should continue developing and improving initiatives such as Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs that provide meaningful alternative pathways to successful employment. Strengthened families It is up to the government to meet the terms of the social contract through the creation of both a social insurance system and an improved educational system. But parents need to uphold their side of the bargain, too. There is only so much that public funds and public schools can do to make up for deficits in the home environment. We cannot ignore the role that family background and family structure play in shaping children\u2019s life trajectory. As I have argued, the government can and should do more to mitigate the material gaps between families of difference backgrounds. But parents are also making decisions that differ greatly across socioeconomic classes in ways that exacerbate inequality. Today, fewer than two in three children are being raised in two-parent homes. This matters, because having only one parent in the home means fewer resources and less parental time investment. There is a big class divide here. Eighty-five per cent of children whose moms have a college degree live in a two-parent home, compared with 60% or lower of children born to a mother without a college degree. Families headed by a single mother are five times more likely to live in poverty: 36% versus 7%. Being born to an unmarried parent is an important predictor of whether a child will be raised in poverty, drop out of high school and live in poverty as an adult. The link between poverty and single-parent families runs both ways, of course: living in poverty is a leading predictor of whether someone will become an unmarried parent. This makes it hard to precisely parse out causality. But, recent work by economists suggests that boys suffer even more than girls do when they are raised in a single-mother home, and that this might be contributing to boys\u2019 relatively worse performance in school. There is no easy solution to this challenge. But we cannot have an honest dialogue about children\u2019s outcomes without acknowledging the role that family structure is playing in perpetuating class divides. Many parents will need to do more to provide a secure, stable family life for their children. For some, this might mean delaying childbearing until they are in a more stable relationship and/or secure economic position. A terrific development in this regard is the tremendous decline in teen births over recent decades. Programs that promote affordable access to effective birth control have been shown to effectively lead to lower rates of teen and unplanned pregnancies. As to marriage, of course there are some parent unions that are harmful and should not remain intact. But initiatives that effectively encourage and support healthy marriages, or foster more father involvement in children\u2019s lives regardless of parental marital status, will put children on a more reliable path toward upward mobility. Unfortunately the evidence on what types of policies and programs effectively strengthen families is thin. Not all our social problems can be solved through public policy. Private decisions and commitments matter, too. For obvious reasons it is hard for governments to promote good parenting, stable families and healthy relationships \u2013 all of which are vital for child wellbeing, and opportunity. This part of the social contract has to be delivered, in large part, by individuals and communities. A capitalism that works for children, and for the future, is both possible and desirable. But it will require a new social contract, a contract that places obligations on government and citizens alike. The responsibility lies with us all.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s June, which means it is Pride month. Which means brands are desperately painting rainbows over their merchandise in an attempt to seem woke. Ikea, for example, has launched rainbow shopping bags to bring queer cheer to the budget-furniture shopping experience. The shaving-kit company Harry\u2019s has given us rainbow razors for a more progressive depilatory session. And Listerine has come out with a rainbow-themed bottle of mouthwash for gayer gargling. I was pretty sure that Pride-branded mouthwash was the peak of performative corporate ally-ship, but, just a few days ago, Budweiser UK came along and told Listerine: \u201cHold my beer.\u201d Rather than just smothering its cans in your run-of-the-mill rainbow flag, Budweiser \u2013 which is an official sponsor of Pride in London \u2013 decided to up the ante with limited-edition cups featuring nine flags that \u201ccelebrate the diversity within the LGBT+ community\u201d. So how does this diversity pan out via the medium of cup? Well, Budweiser gave us a taste of its campaign on Friday, tweeting explanations for the nine colour-coded vessels.

      "body": "<p>Even if you haven\u2019t personally seen The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Hulu\u2019s dystopian re-imagining of Margaret Atwood\u2019s classic novel about fertile women being forced into sexual servitude, you are probably deeply familiar with the iconography of the show, much of which is especially riveting because of its simplicity: the Handmaids in their long red dress and white bonnets, the Wives in a deep regal blue-green, the Marthas in dull green-grey, the Aunts in faded browns.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/04/gilead-on-steroids-five-things-to-expect-from-the-new-handmaids-tale\">What to expect from Handmaid\u2019s Tale season three</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Many of the show\u2019s most visually striking moments focus on how, in the world of Gilead, the individual is simply less important than the group. Overhead shots of Handmaids walking two-by-two, whether to participate in some grand ceremony or to simply go shopping with their assigned partner, are oddly beautiful, serene. The Handmaids look like otherworldly creatures, like brightly colored birds, standing out against the backdrop of the rest of the world. Though they are routinely tortured, raped and forced into compliance, they spend much of their time tottering about the gorgeous homes of the commanders and their wives, each designed to look like an oddly violent and fascistic Williams-Sonoma catalogue with regal kitchens, spacious living rooms and elegant bedrooms, complete with grand marital beds where handmaids are ceremonially raped.</p> \n<p>Shots of this kind, showing a creepy and strangely beautiful side of Gilead, are punctured with closeup looks at June\u2019s face, almost always grimacing. It\u2019s odd that after so many seasons, June, who bizarrely chooses to remain in Gilead in order to try to rescue her first daughter, hasn\u2019t perfected a convincing pretend-smile. Each time the camera homes in on one of her servile smirks, you can practically see her winking at the camera, reminding us that she hasn\u2019t drunk the Gilead Kool-Aid.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcTvQx1Wot0\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RcTvQx1Wot0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>You would think that learning to fake emotions might be especially useful skill in a place where female servitude is paramount, but, strangely, June\u2019s obstinacy seems to have earned her a little fan club, with the commander and his wife each seeking out June for genuine advice throughout the first episodes of the third season. While season two disturbed viewers with its emphasis on depicting heightened violence against women in lurid detail, season three aims to be a subtler psychological examination of the leadership of Gilead, and even asks that we feel some compassion towards June\u2019s tormentors, even as they continue to allow and encourage a terrible and brutal regime.</p> \n<p>Certainly, many of the great TV dramas of the past 15 years have offered humane and nuanced looks at complicated characters who do bad things. Indeed, the 21st century fascination with the antihero has made cheering on bad guys a veritable hobby. But while shows such as The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Mad Men and The Americans offer subtle examinations of morally dubious figures, the villains of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale simply haven\u2019t earned this tender second look. It feels like emotional whiplash to suddenly ask viewers to feel sorry for characters who have spent the majority of two seasons raping and torturing their captives. In the same way, focusing on whether or not Fred and Serena can get through marital problems, many of which stem from the commander chopping off his wife\u2019s pinky for her insubordination in season two, is strangely centered throughout much of the new season, another departure from the show\u2019s allegorical roots. Is there anyone out there who is actually rooting for this horrible couple and hoping that June can counsel them through tough times? Similarly, Aunt Lydia\u2019s character, though marvelously acted by actress Ann Dowd, isn\u2019t given enough backstory so that we actually feel sorry for her when she collapses in tears at one particularly tragic moment this season, as well as later embrace June in a tenderhearted and genuine hug before placing an even more dehumanizing piece of clothing on June, one that literally covers her mouth.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7f5cee1e2ec4de8c7d035eef5c2c2f2a15a741f8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f5cee1e2ec4de8c7d035eef5c2c2f2a15a741f8/0_506_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joseph Fiennes in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joseph Fiennes in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elly Dassas/Hulu</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It is clear that by extending June\u2019s stay in Gilead, the show\u2019s writers have placed themselves in a kind of conundrum \u2013 how to extend the story without simply repeating the same violence against women over and over again?

      "bodyText": "Even if you haven\u2019t personally seen The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Hulu\u2019s dystopian re-imagining of Margaret Atwood\u2019s classic novel about fertile women being forced into sexual servitude, you are probably deeply familiar with the iconography of the show, much of which is especially riveting because of its simplicity: the Handmaids in their long red dress and white bonnets, the Wives in a deep regal blue-green, the Marthas in dull green-grey, the Aunts in faded browns. Many of the show\u2019s most visually striking moments focus on how, in the world of Gilead, the individual is simply less important than the group. Overhead shots of Handmaids walking two-by-two, whether to participate in some grand ceremony or to simply go shopping with their assigned partner, are oddly beautiful, serene. The Handmaids look like otherworldly creatures, like brightly colored birds, standing out against the backdrop of the rest of the world. Though they are routinely tortured, raped and forced into compliance, they spend much of their time tottering about the gorgeous homes of the commanders and their wives, each designed to look like an oddly violent and fascistic Williams-Sonoma catalogue with regal kitchens, spacious living rooms and elegant bedrooms, complete with grand marital beds where handmaids are ceremonially raped. Shots of this kind, showing a creepy and strangely beautiful side of Gilead, are punctured with closeup looks at June\u2019s face, almost always grimacing. It\u2019s odd that after so many seasons, June, who bizarrely chooses to remain in Gilead in order to try to rescue her first daughter, hasn\u2019t perfected a convincing pretend-smile. Each time the camera homes in on one of her servile smirks, you can practically see her winking at the camera, reminding us that she hasn\u2019t drunk the Gilead Kool-Aid. You would think that learning to fake emotions might be especially useful skill in a place where female servitude is paramount, but, strangely, June\u2019s obstinacy seems to have earned her a little fan club, with the commander and his wife each seeking out June for genuine advice throughout the first episodes of the third season. While season two disturbed viewers with its emphasis on depicting heightened violence against women in lurid detail, season three aims to be a subtler psychological examination of the leadership of Gilead, and even asks that we feel some compassion towards June\u2019s tormentors, even as they continue to allow and encourage a terrible and brutal regime. Certainly, many of the great TV dramas of the past 15 years have offered humane and nuanced looks at complicated characters who do bad things. Indeed, the 21st century fascination with the antihero has made cheering on bad guys a veritable hobby. But while shows such as The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Mad Men and The Americans offer subtle examinations of morally dubious figures, the villains of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale simply haven\u2019t earned this tender second look. It feels like emotional whiplash to suddenly ask viewers to feel sorry for characters who have spent the majority of two seasons raping and torturing their captives. In the same way, focusing on whether or not Fred and Serena can get through marital problems, many of which stem from the commander chopping off his wife\u2019s pinky for her insubordination in season two, is strangely centered throughout much of the new season, another departure from the show\u2019s allegorical roots. Is there anyone out there who is actually rooting for this horrible couple and hoping that June can counsel them through tough times? Similarly, Aunt Lydia\u2019s character, though marvelously acted by actress Ann Dowd, isn\u2019t given enough backstory so that we actually feel sorry for her when she collapses in tears at one particularly tragic moment this season, as well as later embrace June in a tenderhearted and genuine hug before placing an even more dehumanizing piece of clothing on June, one that literally covers her mouth. It is clear that by extending June\u2019s stay in Gilead, the show\u2019s writers have placed themselves in a kind of conundrum \u2013 how to extend the story without simply repeating the same violence against women over and over again? Season three of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale attempts to go deeper into the emotional breadth of its story, but there is little the viewer needs to learn about Gilead at this juncture other than the obvious: that the regime is horrible, destructive, and deserves to be destroyed. In one scene in the middle of the season, we see a mutilated handmaid, a reminder that whatever personal growth that June has experienced is futile since she is up against a powerful regime that is so thoroughly monstrous that there is no humanity left to grapple with. At its best, season three of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale works as an exceptionally creepy psychological study of the delusional creators and facilitators of Gilead. In my favorite scene of the first six episodes distributed to critics, we see Fred and Serena play a game of tea party with another commander\u2019s child. They smile warmly at each other, as Serena lifts a hand-sewn pretend pinky finger, a gift from her Martha, as if her original pinky wasn\u2019t cruelly cut off her hand by the very husband she now plays a children\u2019s game with. Still, the main issue of the series is that it tends towards shocking viewers with the cruel horrors of Gilead rather than offering genuine character development. Though June repeatedly says that she is a different person after being in Gilead, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of evidence that she is. Certainly, it\u2019s a relief that June is as angry and resistant as ever, but I\u2019m not sure that continuing to drag June through the physical and psychological horrors of Gilead over and over again does much to advance the plot or move us emotionally forward. At a time when we see more and more reproductive freedoms being taken away from women, a show like The Handmaid\u2019s Tale needs to be more than a series of provocative and frightening images on repeat. June deserves a story that doesn\u2019t necessarily give her a pat, happy ending, but that does, ultimately, give her a potential way out.

      "body": "<p>Meat is dead. Carnivores are going the way of cigarette smokers and, by 2050, there\u2019s a good chance that it will be socially unacceptable to eat meat. In the same way that we\u2019re now horrified people used to smoke in offices and airplanes, we\u2019ll find it almost unthinkable that people used to consume animals so casually and frequently.</p> <p>Considering that humans have been meat-eaters for about 2.5m years, the idea that we\u2019re going to radically change our diets in a few decades might seem far-fetched. However, there has already been a significant shift in the way we think about meat consumption. In just the past few years veganism has gone from being a fringe movement associated with hippies to being downright trendy. The likes of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z have <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/beyonce-and-jay-z-free-concert-tickets-vegan\">challenged their fans</a> \u201cto move towards a more plant-based lifestyle\u201d and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/01/third-of-britons-have-stopped-or-reduced-meat-eating-vegan-vegetarian-report\">more people are talking loudly and proudly</a> about cutting down on meat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/07/green-new-deal-clean-meat-hamburger\">What the Green New Deal will mean for your hamburger | Jan Dutkiewicz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To be fair, changes in attitude haven\u2019t yet translated to changes in behavior. US consumption of meat in 2018 was the highest it has been for a long time, and it\u2019s a similar story in Europe. This is largely down to a better economy; <a href=\"https://www.hagstromreport.com/assets/2016/2016_0809_Rabobank_Chickens_Cows_Pigs_Sawyer_July2016.pdf\">according to Rabobank</a>, the downturn in meat-eating between 2005 and 2014 was due to high prices relative to income during the recession. But just because meat consumption in America hasn\u2019t plummeted yet doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t in the near future. This is particularly true when you consider the explosion in popularity of realistic plant-based meat substitutes from companies such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/mar/14/impossible-burger-meat-from-cells-change-eating-habits\">Impossible Foods</a> and Beyond Meat.</p> <p>If you haven\u2019t tried an Impossible Burger or Beyond Burger yet I\u2019d strongly advise you to give it a go. As a vegetarian I have suffered through various abominations that describe themselves as a \u201cveggie burger\u201d, from large soggy mushrooms to patties that look like reconstituted vomit; in contrast,<strong> </strong>the new breed of plant-based burgers are a game-changer. I even sent one back at a restaurant recently because I thought they had mistakenly given me real meat \u2013 and<strong> </strong>my girlfriend, a committed carnivore, had a bite and wasn\u2019t entirely sure herself.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Just because meat consumption in America hasn\u2019t plummeted yet doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t in the near future</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fast-food chains have begun to enthusiastically embrace plant-based meat substitutes, propelling these foods further into the mainstream. In April, Burger King started trialling the Impossible Burger in St Louis. According to a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/28/impossible-whopper-boosted-burger-king-traffic-by-18percent-report-says.html\">report</a> by inMarket inSights, this led to Burger King locations in St Louis seeing 16.75% higher foot traffic than the chain\u2019s national average. Meanwhile the popularity of Greggs\u2019s vegan sausage roll caused shares of the British fast-food chain to <a href=\"https://vegnews.com/2019/5/vegan-sausage-rolls-drive-greggs-stock-prices-to-double\">surge</a>, and KFC recently <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/30/business/kfc-plant-based-chicken/index.html\">said</a> it is searching for plant-based alternatives to chicken. Meatless meat is suddenly everywhere.</p> <p>As plant-based meat alternatives continue to proliferate and evolve it will become increasingly difficult for people to justify choosing the animal alternative. If you can easily get a meatless burger that tastes almost like the real thing \u2013 and eventually, I imagine, one tasting<strong> </strong>exactly like the real thing \u2013 why would you opt for real meat? Why would you make the crueler choice?</p> <p>Along with the increase in \u201cmeatless meat\u201d we\u2019re seeing the advent of the lab-grown, or cell-based, meat industry. Although there is still a fair way to go before we see lab-grown meat in stores, and <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2019.00005/full\">important questions</a> about just how environmentally friendly cultured meat actually is, it\u2019s another sign that technology is poised to revolutionize how we eat. Meat that comes from animals will eventually seem old-fashioned and barbaric.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/02/when-humans-became-meateaters/463305/\">There are theories</a> that the reason humans first started eating large quantities of meat 2.5m years was due to climate change; droughts made fruit and vegetables less abundant and humans were forced to go in search of meat. It seems inevitable that the climate crisis we now face will drastically change our diets once again. As the impact of the climate emergency becomes impossible to ignore, eating meat will be increasingly<strong> </strong>seen as selfish and socially unacceptable.</p> <p>If we don\u2019t willingly change our habits, of course, the consequences of the environmental disaster that is unfolding will force us. The climate crisis will affect the food supply in a way that means we simply won\u2019t be able to produce meat; indeed we won\u2019t be able to produce enough food at all. The most committed of carnivores will have to resort to eating the rich.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Meat is dead. Carnivores are going the way of cigarette smokers and, by 2050, there\u2019s a good chance that it will be socially unacceptable to eat meat. In the same way that we\u2019re now horrified people used to smoke in offices and airplanes, we\u2019ll find it almost unthinkable that people used to consume animals so casually and frequently. Considering that humans have been meat-eaters for about 2.5m years, the idea that we\u2019re going to radically change our diets in a few decades might seem far-fetched. However, there has already been a significant shift in the way we think about meat consumption. In just the past few years veganism has gone from being a fringe movement associated with hippies to being downright trendy. The likes of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z have challenged their fans \u201cto move towards a more plant-based lifestyle\u201d and more people are talking loudly and proudly about cutting down on meat. To be fair, changes in attitude haven\u2019t yet translated to changes in behavior. US consumption of meat in 2018 was the highest it has been for a long time, and it\u2019s a similar story in Europe. This is largely down to a better economy; according to Rabobank, the downturn in meat-eating between 2005 and 2014 was due to high prices relative to income during the recession. But just because meat consumption in America hasn\u2019t plummeted yet doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t in the near future. This is particularly true when you consider the explosion in popularity of realistic plant-based meat substitutes from companies such as Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat. If you haven\u2019t tried an Impossible Burger or Beyond Burger yet I\u2019d strongly advise you to give it a go. As a vegetarian I have suffered through various abominations that describe themselves as a \u201cveggie burger\u201d, from large soggy mushrooms to patties that look like reconstituted vomit; in contrast, the new breed of plant-based burgers are a game-changer. I even sent one back at a restaurant recently because I thought they had mistakenly given me real meat \u2013 and my girlfriend, a committed carnivore, had a bite and wasn\u2019t entirely sure herself. Fast-food chains have begun to enthusiastically embrace plant-based meat substitutes, propelling these foods further into the mainstream. In April, Burger King started trialling the Impossible Burger in St Louis. According to a report by inMarket inSights, this led to Burger King locations in St Louis seeing 16.75% higher foot traffic than the chain\u2019s national average. Meanwhile the popularity of Greggs\u2019s vegan sausage roll caused shares of the British fast-food chain to surge, and KFC recently said it is searching for plant-based alternatives to chicken. Meatless meat is suddenly everywhere. As plant-based meat alternatives continue to proliferate and evolve it will become increasingly difficult for people to justify choosing the animal alternative. If you can easily get a meatless burger that tastes almost like the real thing \u2013 and eventually, I imagine, one tasting exactly like the real thing \u2013 why would you opt for real meat? Why would you make the crueler choice? Along with the increase in \u201cmeatless meat\u201d we\u2019re seeing the advent of the lab-grown, or cell-based, meat industry. Although there is still a fair way to go before we see lab-grown meat in stores, and important questions about just how environmentally friendly cultured meat actually is, it\u2019s another sign that technology is poised to revolutionize how we eat. Meat that comes from animals will eventually seem old-fashioned and barbaric. There are theories that the reason humans first started eating large quantities of meat 2.5m years was due to climate change; droughts made fruit and vegetables less abundant and humans were forced to go in search of meat. It seems inevitable that the climate crisis we now face will drastically change our diets once again. As the impact of the climate emergency becomes impossible to ignore, eating meat will be increasingly seen as selfish and socially unacceptable. If we don\u2019t willingly change our habits, of course, the consequences of the environmental disaster that is unfolding will force us. The climate crisis will affect the food supply in a way that means we simply won\u2019t be able to produce meat; indeed we won\u2019t be able to produce enough food at all. The most committed of carnivores will have to resort to eating the rich.",

      "bodyText": "America\u2019s largest professional organization for doctors specializing in women\u2019s health has come out against the term \u201cfetal heartbeat bill\u201d to describe abortion bans recently enacted by US states. The president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists called the bills \u201carbitrary\u201d bans not reflective of fetal development or science. \u201cArbitrary gestational age bans on abortion at six weeks that use the term \u2018heartbeat\u2019 to define the gestational development being targeted do not reflect medical accuracy or clinical understanding,\u201d said Dr Ted Anderson, president of ACOG. The organization represents 58,000 physicians across the US. \u201cPregnancy and fetal development are a continuum. What is interpreted as a heartbeat in these bills is actually electrically induced flickering of a portion of the fetal tissue that will become the heart as the embryo develops,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThus, ACOG does not use the term \u2018heartbeat\u2019 to describe these legislative bans on abortion because it is misleading language, out of step with the anatomical and clinical realities of that stage of pregnancy,\u201d Anderson said. The ACOG president called on politicians to base policy on \u201cscience and evidence\u201d. In addition, the Guardian has updated its style guide more accurately to reflect abortion bans spreading across the United States. Instead of using \u201cfetal heartbeat bills\u201d, as the laws are often called by anti-abortion campaigners, the Guardian will make \u201csix-week abortion ban\u201d the preferred term for the laws, unless quoting someone, in order to better reflect the practical effect of the laws. State abortion bans have been enacted from Ohio to Kentucky, in a new and severe strategy from rightwing groups pushing to make abortion illegal. The bans, dubbed \u201cheartbeat\u201d bills by supporters, have the practical effect of banning abortion before most women know they are pregnant. Abortion is legal in all 50 states despite the bans. Anti-abortion campaigners hope the court battles will prompt the US supreme court to reconsider the 1973 landmark decision Roe v Wade, which legalized abortion. The laws are all expected to be challenged in court, and are highly unlikely ever to go into effect. While states have long sought to heavily regulate abortion, outright bans on the procedure were once rare. Nevertheless, abortion care has not always remained accessible. Highly restrictive state regulations have driven many clinics out of business. There are six states that each have only one abortion clinic. In Missouri, the state\u2019s last remaining abortion clinic is fighting the state health authorities in order to stay open. Obstetrician and gynecologist Dr Sarah Horvath said that accurately describing the bans is important, to avoid confusion among patients and providers alike. \u201cI don\u2019t think the coverage tends to line up with medical reality,\u201d said Horvath. \u201cNo one seems to know what is allowed \u2013 and what isn\u2019t \u2013 even when it\u2019s medically appropriate,\u201d she said. Several state bans allow for criminal penalties for doctors performing abortions, including a 99-year penalty in Alabama. Physicians said the bans, if they ever went into effect, will have life-threatening consequences for women. \u201cThere\u2019s this noble ideal you all have,\u201d she said about reporters, but added, \u201cBut one is a viewpoint, and one is science and medicine.\u201d",

As the trial wrapped for the day back in May, Pantaleo could be seen, among a mass of broad-shouldered police union officials and defence attorneys, flicking a brief smile to his attorney, the veteran police defense lawyer Stuart London. Those in the public gallery were led out of the trial room, row by row, and made to stand single file by a wall next to the fourth-floor elevator, watched by a phalanx of uniformed NYPD officers. They were then escorted from the building. \u201cIt all takes a toll,\u201d Carr said. \u201cIt keeps reminding me of everything I\u2019ve gone through, of what I\u2019m going through and what I will still have to go through.\u201d",

Mike Greene, expected to become the fledgling party\u2019s first MP on Thursday, was for two years an alleged office holder in E&amp;J Ground Rents No4 llp \u2013 a firm which bought and sold the rights to charge ground rent across the UK. Greene\u2019s former business partner in the firm, James Tuttiett, has built one of the biggest property empires in the UK made up of controversial freeholds, allowing him to charge homeowners for the land their house is built on. Ministers have committed to reforming the practice of buying and selling freeholds after it was criticised by a housing, communities and local government select committee report in March. Reacting to claims about Greene\u2019s former role, Clive Betts, the chair of the committee, said: \u201cOrdinary people are being ripped off by greedy management companies who exploit them to make an inflated profit. It shows the Brexit party\u2019s true colours as a Thatcherite party with no concern for the people of this country.\u201d Nigel Farage\u2019s party is the bookmaker\u2019s favourite to take Peterborough, a seat made vacant after the recall of the former Labour whip Fiona Onasanya for lying about a speeding ticket.

The chain was rebranded as My Local but fell into administration in June 2016, resulting in the closure of 90 stores with more than 1,200 employees laid off. Research by Guardian Money in 2017 found a web of 85 ground rent companies controlled by Tuttiett, where the freeholds included not just homes but also schools, health clubs and petrol stations. In 2016, one of these 85 companies recorded an \u00a380m increase in the value of its ground rents from the year before, taking them to \u00a3267.4m. The Brexit party was asked to respond to questions about Greene\u2019s submissions to Companies House as well as claims he decided to profit from the sale of freehold. A spokesman for Greene insisted that he was a member, not a director, of E&amp;J No4 and was never an active participant in running the investment vehicle. \u201cThe investment was made seven years ago and was disposed of, from memory, to a pension fund five years ago. \u201cThe investment is a recognised product and he participated as such.

      "bodyText": "Senior Liberal figures fear far-right identities are being allowed to cosy up to elements of the party\u2019s Victorian branch, a move they say could destroy their chances at the next state election. Last Thursday night, Dia Beltran, a far-right personality with links to Neil Erikson and Blair Cottrell, attended a Liberal fundraiser for the Sunbury, Sydenham and St Albans areas in Melbourne\u2019s western suburbs. The fundraiser was hosted by the Victorian state upper house MP Bernie Finn, and was attended by the party\u2019s state president, Robert Clark. A senior Liberal source alerted Guardian Australia to Beltran\u2019s presence at the event. He said associating with the far right would damage his party\u2019s chances in Victoria, a broadly progressive state. \u201cFrankly, the Liberal party does not need these people in it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t get hammered enough at the state election, we certainly will next time if this continues.\u201d Private Facebook posts obtained by Guardian Australia show Beltran \u2013 who also refers to herself as Claudia Benitez \u2013 and a fellow supporter of Fraser Anning at the event with Liberal figures. In one picture Beltran stands alongside the former Liberal state candidate Moira Deeming. Deeming confirmed she had met the woman pictured in one of the Facebook posts during the fundraiser, but said she did not know her by the name of \u201cDia\u201d. \u201cThe event was open for anybody to book online,\u201d Deeming said. \u201cYes, I met that woman. She did not introduce herself as \u2018Dia\u2019.\u201d Guardian Australia understands \u201cDia Beltran\u201d is an online alias. The Victorian Liberal party did not answer a series of questions about Beltran\u2019s attendance. The acting state director, Simon Frost, issued a one-line statement, saying: \u201cThere is no room for extremist views of any kind in the Liberal party.\u201d Finn did not return requests for comment. The presence of Beltran did not break any party rules or laws. But it has some in the party on edge. Last year a highly organised effort by alt-right figures to infiltrate the New South Wales Young Nationals prompted an internal investigation, and the involvement of Asio, Australia\u2019s domestic spy agency. Beltran regularly hosts the likes of Erikson, Cottrell and the former senator Fraser Anning on her YouTube channel. Although mostly a fringe figure in Australia\u2019s far right, Beltran has appeared on rightwing site the Unshackled and has given a platform to the likes of Andrew Nolch, the man who defaced the memorial of the murdered Melbourne woman Eurydice Dixon last year. More recently, Beltran was with Erikson when he disrupted a service at a progressive church in Melbourne\u2019s inner suburbs in May. Video from the event shows Erikson pointing to a rainbow flag and saying \u201cfaggots\u201d, before repeatedly disrupting the service. At one stage Erikson engaged in a heated confrontation with the parishioners, who had become increasingly upset by his refusal to leave. Erikson was one of the ringleaders of the former anti-Islam group the United Patriots Front. He has previously been convicted for inciting contempt against Muslims after he staged a mock beheading of a mannequin, and last year disrupted a church service held by the progressive reverend Rod Bowers in Gosford on the NSW central coast. On Friday a spokeswoman from the Victorian police told Guardian Australia the incident at the Melbourne church was under investigation. \u201cBoroondara police are currently investigating an incident at a church in Hawthorn East on Sunday 12 May,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is believed that a man interrupted a religious service and proceeded to protest using homophobic slurs and inappropriate language.\u201d Following the incident at the Melbourne church, Beltran posted a rambling \u201cclarification\u201d on her YouTube page in which she stated she \u201cstands with Jesus Christ [and] Israel Folau\u201d and that she \u201ccould not have predicted how the actions of others could have escalated to what occurred\u201d. \u201cLast night I had the idea to attend a progressive church with the intention of listening to their views, questioning their interpretation of the Christian doctrine and then making a video reviewing the events,\u201d she said. \u201cNeedless to say this did not take place. In my naivety I could not have predicted how the actions of others could have escalated to what occurred. \u201cThe approach used was not one I agree with or approve of. You are not the company you keep.\u201d When Guardian Australia contacted her for comment, she said: \u201cI do not give interviews to mainstream media. Thank you for your inquiry.\u201d",

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories at home and abroad today.</p> <p>A fierce backlash has forced Donald Trump to row back on comments that he wanted the NHS included in UK/US trade talks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/04/trump-says-he-turned-down-corbyn-request-to-meet\">as his state visit continued to fuel controversy</a>. After interfering with the Tory leadership race by backing Boris Johnson, the US president caused a furore by suggesting that Washington would try to win access to NHS contracts for US companies in post-Brexit trade talks. All sides of politics reacted angrily to the idea with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/04/trump-hate-division-corbyn-protesters-labour\">Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn</a> saying he would fight it with his \u201clast breath\u201d. As senior Tories such as Jeremy Hunt also condemned the remarks, Trump later said that the NHS \u201cwould not be on the table\u201d because the health service was \u201cnot trade\u201d.</p> <p>The backflip capped a lively day for Trump in which he met Theresa May but refused an audience with Corbyn because he is \u201csomewhat of a negative force\u201d. The president did however have time for two of May\u2019s would-be successors, Hunt and Michael Gove, as well as hardline Brexit supporters Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson, and Nigel Farage. Johnson turned down the president in order to speak at a One Nation Tory MPs hustings event on Tuesday night. He told them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/04/boris-johnson-tories-must-deliver-brexit-or-face-extinction\">the party faced \u201cextinction\u201d if it didn\u2019t deliver Brexit</a>.

A study by the Canal &amp; River Trust used data from 25 urban and rural spots on the 2,000-mile network and has urged local communities to help clean up the mess.

The vista from Brackenthwaite Hows was spotted by the artist on his first visit to the area and it was popular with Georgian and Victorian visitors. But despite offering splendid views of the north-west Lakes, it fell out of fashion as visitors flocked to high peaks such as nearby Scafell Pike. A couple who helped the deal by giving their share of the land back to the charity said they hoped \u201cthe natural beauty can be preserved\u201d for the nation.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Back with a bang \u2013</strong> Work on the new James Bond film has been hit after a \u201ccontrolled explosion\u201d on the set at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Corbyn vows to fight US access to NHS to \u2018last breath\u2019 Good morning briefers. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories at home and abroad today. A fierce backlash has forced Donald Trump to row back on comments that he wanted the NHS included in UK/US trade talks as his state visit continued to fuel controversy. After interfering with the Tory leadership race by backing Boris Johnson, the US president caused a furore by suggesting that Washington would try to win access to NHS contracts for US companies in post-Brexit trade talks. All sides of politics reacted angrily to the idea with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn saying he would fight it with his \u201clast breath\u201d. As senior Tories such as Jeremy Hunt also condemned the remarks, Trump later said that the NHS \u201cwould not be on the table\u201d because the health service was \u201cnot trade\u201d. The backflip capped a lively day for Trump in which he met Theresa May but refused an audience with Corbyn because he is \u201csomewhat of a negative force\u201d. The president did however have time for two of May\u2019s would-be successors, Hunt and Michael Gove, as well as hardline Brexit supporters Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson, and Nigel Farage. Johnson turned down the president in order to speak at a One Nation Tory MPs hustings event on Tuesday night. He told them the party faced \u201cextinction\u201d if it didn\u2019t deliver Brexit. Polly Toynbee agrees with Johnson that the Tories face extinction, but she predicts he will be the last ever Conservative PM because of a no-deal, not because of averting it. * * * Pell appeals \u2013 George Pell, the most senior Catholic convicted of child sexual abuse, has been taken from prison to hear the beginning of his appeal in a Melbourne court. The disgraced cardinal was dressed in black and wearing his clerical collar as he listened to his lawyer argue that the prosecution\u2019s case about when the historic offences took place were flawed and that his client should be acquitted on grounds that his conviction was unreasonable. * * * Plastic toll \u2013 Plastics waste makes up nearly 60% of the litter found in canals in England and Wales and more than half a million plastic items reach the sea every year from the waterway network. A study by the Canal &amp; River Trust used data from 25 urban and rural spots on the 2,000-mile network and has urged local communities to help clean up the mess. It says that if every visitor to the network picked up one piece of plastic per visit, the problem would be cleared up in a year. * * * \u2018Humiliating for us\u2019 \u2013 Supporters of India\u2019s first openly gay athlete, Dutee Chand, fear for her safety after her decision to come out prompted a backlash in her home village. Reaction in Chaka Gopalpur in the eastern state of Odisha was hostile after she said she was in a gay relationship with her partner. Chand\u2019s mother, Akhuji, told the Indian Express she had always supported her daughter in sport but this was \u201cnot permitted\u201d in the village. One local said the athlete\u2019s sexuality was \u201chumiliating\u201d. * * * Lakes land \u2013 The National Trust has spent \u00a3202,000 acquiring a hill in the Lake District, the view from which inspired JMW Turner to paint his watercolour Crummock Water, Looking Towards Buttermere in 1797. The vista from Brackenthwaite Hows was spotted by the artist on his first visit to the area and it was popular with Georgian and Victorian visitors. But despite offering splendid views of the north-west Lakes, it fell out of fashion as visitors flocked to high peaks such as nearby Scafell Pike. A couple who helped the deal by giving their share of the land back to the charity said they hoped \u201cthe natural beauty can be preserved\u201d for the nation. * * * Back with a bang \u2013 Work on the new James Bond film has been hit after a \u201ccontrolled explosion\u201d on the set at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire. No one inside the studio was hurt, but one crew member outside suffered a minor injury, the filmmakers said. The exterior of the stage was damaged. The Sun reported that the blast occurred when a stunt went wrong. Filming of the yet unnamed film was delayed earlier this year when 007 star Daniel Craig hurt his ankle on set. Today in Focus podcast: Decline and fall of a retail empire As Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail empire faces the prospect of entering administration, putting 18,000 jobs at risk, the Guardian business reporter Sarah Butler discusses how we got here. Plus: Sadiq Khan responds to being called a loser by Donald Trump. Lunchtime read: Why McDonald\u2019s is the centre of life for America\u2019s outsiders Chris Arnade has been chronicling the struggles of America\u2019s poorest communities for some time and he has now written a book about the people left behind in the world\u2019s richest country. In an extract from Dignity, Arnade visits the post-industrial rustbelt towns of Portsmouth, Ohio and Gary, Indiana where he talks to people in the place that usually doubles as a restaurant and community centre in such towns: McDonald\u2019s. It\u2019s a place to clean up (and sometimes shoot up), meet friends and charge your phone, with regulars preferring it to non-profit drop-in centres because McDonald\u2019s staff \u201cdon\u2019t tell us what to do\u201d. In devastated, drugs-ridden Gary, the big golden arches aren\u2019t just the town\u2019s community centre, they are the town square. Sport Chris Woakes insisted England did not suffer a car crash against Pakistan after the 14-run defeat that proved an early setback at the World Cup, a tournament which, writes Andy Bull, has brought diverse parts of Britain\u2019s cricket community together and made the sport feel bright and vital. Johanna Konta will draw on her experience of defeats in two previous grand slam semi-finals as she chases the French Open title after blitzing Sloane Stephens. Juventus have made contact with Manchester United to see whether they would consider selling Paul Pogba this summer. Anthony Joshua will get the chance to win back his IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight titles in a rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr later this year. And Kieran Shoemark says he hopes to be riding at Royal Ascot having enjoyed a winner on his return from a cocaine suspension. Business Neil Woodford, one of the biggest names in the City, faces more turbulence today after shares in his listed investment firm fell sharply along with other companies\u2019 stock prices after he blocked withdrawal from one of his funds.

St Giles also received funding to bring home Londoners arrested for dealing drugs in other parts of the county through so-called county lines networks \u2013 a drug distribution system in which criminals exploit thousands of predominantly 15\u2011 to 17-year-olds who are often groomed and forced to funnel hard drugs from cities to towns and rural regions across the country. Police have now identified around 2,000 drug supply chains as part of the county lines network, which is fuelling knife crime as rival gangs clash, while a majority of police forces say it is also linked to an increase in gun crime. A \u00a33.6m National County Lines Coordination Centre, jointly run by the National Crime Agency and the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, opened last September. It aims to improve intelligence on county lines across forces and improve safeguarding, while better protecting victims.

Not a severed ear or a still-beating heart, but the kind with a keyboard. \u201cThey never said anything,\u201d says Berry. \u201cThere was no explanation, no lessons, just me and the organ.\u201d</p> <p>In short order, he had mastered the keyboard, then the guitar, and soon his big goal as a teenager was to emulate multi-instrumentalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/feb/23/mike-oldfield-on-my-radar\">Mike Oldfield</a>. \u201cI read that he was 17 when he made Tubular Bells. I thought, \u2018I\u2019m 14 \u2013 better get a move on.\u2019 That\u2019s what led me to buy a secondhand bass guitar and a four-track recorder.\u201d</p> <p>This isn\u2019t what I expected at all, the revelations of a self-taught polymath. I\u2019d hoped to conduct this interview from two open-top sightseeing buses. Berry would be on one and I\u2019d shout questions through a megaphone from the other. This would have been a reprise of the bus-off between his most famous creation, the eponymous thespian lothario from TV comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/oct/20/matt-berry-toast-of-london\">Toast of London</a>, and that character\u2019s turtle-necked nemesis, Ray Purchase. \u201cEveryone in London knows your wife\u2019s a prostitute,\u201d shouted Toast . \u201cYou take that back, Toast,\u201d retorted Purchase.</p> <p>Instead, we\u2019re reclining on a leather sofa in a Soho club. Berry is sipping Diet Coke. Again, this is intolerable. The 45-year-old should be importuning waitresses, channelling the role of Douglas Renholm, the lecherous boss he played in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/sep/27/it-crowd-finale-great-comedy-ayoade-odowd\">The IT Crowd</a>, running about shouting: \u201cGod damn these electric sex pants!\u201d Or he could even be drinking the bar dry, like his latest TV incarnation: mutton-chopped, one-eyebrowed, foul-mouthed Victorian detective, Rabbit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbaa57b64e211ab394158272ea1f2683e76b85af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbaa57b64e211ab394158272ea1f2683e76b85af/644_61_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Don\u2019t mess with the mutton-chop \u2026 Berry with Susan Wokoma in Year of the Rabbit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don\u2019t mess with the mutton-chop \u2026 Berry with Susan Wokoma in Year of the Rabbit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Taylor/Objective/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, no, Berry\u2019s detailing his teenage recording techniques in a hushed voice. He is amiable but, and there\u2019s no easy way to say this, shy and sartorially uninteresting. Yet I\u2019m grateful for the organ story since it gives a rare insight into Berry\u2019s past. He scarcely mentions his upbringing or private life in interviews. \u201cI\u2019m a clown,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what everybody wants me to be. Nobody wants to hear about my \u2018psychic wound\u2019. Nobody wants me to be their life coach.\u201d</p> <p>What nonsense. Matt Berry Was My Life Coach \u2013 what a movie that would be. But he has a point. If we knew the dreary truth about Berry, that would ruin the fantasy. We want to imagine him as Toast, flatsharing with a similarly bitter thesp.

      "bodyText": "When Matt Berry was a little boy growing up in Bedford, his parents left an organ in his bedroom one night. Not a severed ear or a still-beating heart, but the kind with a keyboard. \u201cThey never said anything,\u201d says Berry. \u201cThere was no explanation, no lessons, just me and the organ.\u201d In short order, he had mastered the keyboard, then the guitar, and soon his big goal as a teenager was to emulate multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield. \u201cI read that he was 17 when he made Tubular Bells. I thought, \u2018I\u2019m 14 \u2013 better get a move on.\u2019 That\u2019s what led me to buy a secondhand bass guitar and a four-track recorder.\u201d This isn\u2019t what I expected at all, the revelations of a self-taught polymath. I\u2019d hoped to conduct this interview from two open-top sightseeing buses. Berry would be on one and I\u2019d shout questions through a megaphone from the other. This would have been a reprise of the bus-off between his most famous creation, the eponymous thespian lothario from TV comedy Toast of London, and that character\u2019s turtle-necked nemesis, Ray Purchase. \u201cEveryone in London knows your wife\u2019s a prostitute,\u201d shouted Toast . \u201cYou take that back, Toast,\u201d retorted Purchase. Instead, we\u2019re reclining on a leather sofa in a Soho club. Berry is sipping Diet Coke. Again, this is intolerable. The 45-year-old should be importuning waitresses, channelling the role of Douglas Renholm, the lecherous boss he played in The IT Crowd, running about shouting: \u201cGod damn these electric sex pants!\u201d Or he could even be drinking the bar dry, like his latest TV incarnation: mutton-chopped, one-eyebrowed, foul-mouthed Victorian detective, Rabbit. But, no, Berry\u2019s detailing his teenage recording techniques in a hushed voice. He is amiable but, and there\u2019s no easy way to say this, shy and sartorially uninteresting. Yet I\u2019m grateful for the organ story since it gives a rare insight into Berry\u2019s past. He scarcely mentions his upbringing or private life in interviews. \u201cI\u2019m a clown,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what everybody wants me to be. Nobody wants to hear about my \u2018psychic wound\u2019. Nobody wants me to be their life coach.\u201d What nonsense. Matt Berry Was My Life Coach \u2013 what a movie that would be. But he has a point. If we knew the dreary truth about Berry, that would ruin the fantasy. We want to imagine him as Toast, flatsharing with a similarly bitter thesp. As for psychic wounds, well, we inch closer to one when Berry tells me about his first day at Nottingham Trent University. It was there he studied contemporary art and dreamed of becoming a painter. \u201cA lecturer stood up and said, \u2018Here are six paintings.

It was an epiphany for me. I realised I didn\u2019t want to make the mistake of getting a proper job. I wanted to do art for ever.\u201d It didn\u2019t quite work out that way. After graduating, he made for London and slipped into miserable positions in telesales before landing a job at the London Dungeon. He was paid \u00a3178 a week to play a judge in the morning and Jack the Ripper in the afternoon. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t Rada, but you learned how to get the story right and not to fluff your lines.\u201d Then, in around 1999, he met Noel Fielding.

      "body": "<p>When discussing David Letterman, one incident always tends to crop up. It took place in April 1996, nine months after Letterman\u2019s rival Jay Leno had overtaken him in the ratings, and it tells us a lot about how he dealt with the pressure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/may/15/david-letterman-late-night-prankster-comedy-godfather\">David Letterman: the late-night prankster who became a comedy godfather</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During this episode, Letterman introduced a quick skit about a \u201cDavid Letterman doll\u201d, a floppy dummy in a double-breasted suit. The skit ended, and Letterman sat the doll in a chair. But, as he walked away, he circled back and punched it in the head. And then he did it again. And again. And again. And again. A minute later, he walked back and punched it another 10 times. Letterman\u2019s first guest that night was David Schwimmer; on introducing him, he unleashed another volley of punches at the dummy\u2019s head and invited Schwimmer to join him, screaming: \u201cGo ahead, teach him some manners!\u201d As the critic Jason Zinoman observes in his book Letterman: The Last Giant of Late Night, \u201cthe laughter got quieter. What was wrong with Dave?\u201d</p> <p>You can\u2019t help but think of the dummy-punching incident as you watch the second series of Letterman\u2019s Netflix show, My Next Guest Needs No Introduction, because there isn\u2019t a trace of that Letterman in it. He\u2019s absent. Sure, <em>a</em> Letterman is there, but it isn\u2019t the one you know. This Letterman is like the shadow that gets left on the wall after a nuclear bomb goes off.</p> <p>Especially if you were a Letterman fan, My Next Guest Needs No Introduction is a strange series to sit through. There are no jokes. There\u2019s no grouchiness. There is no longer any instinct for havoc. Instead, it\u2019s about a kindly old man being deferential to a succession of people who only partly deserve it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9-uAcpo9PE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/U9-uAcpo9PE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Take his interview with Kanye West, during which he sincerely compliments West\u2019s clothing line (\u201cI like the colour, I like the fit, I love the shoes,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFr3gT4sOpI\">he coos to Kim Kardashian in a filmed segment</a>), or his interview with Tiffany Haddish, where he clenches his fists with sincerity and says: \u201cYour talent is so powerful.\u201d The Letterman of old would have watched this show agape. He used to make his guests work for praise. Now he just wheels it out on a platter.</p> <p>The joy of old Letterman interviews was watching his guests struggle against him, whether they succeeded (when Cher called him an \u201casshole\u201d), or failed (when Letterman walked out midway through an excruciating Crispin Glover segment). But there\u2019s nothing for anyone to struggle against now. During his late-night days, Letterman was a subversive who looked like a straight. Now, with his cloudlike beard threatening to consume his body, he has become the opposite. He looks odd, but his interviews have become tediously, punishingly conventional.</p> <p>My Next Guest Needs No Introduction is so weirdly absent, so steadfastly unDave, that I have been trying to figure out what has happened.

      "bodyText": "When discussing David Letterman, one incident always tends to crop up. It took place in April 1996, nine months after Letterman\u2019s rival Jay Leno had overtaken him in the ratings, and it tells us a lot about how he dealt with the pressure. During this episode, Letterman introduced a quick skit about a \u201cDavid Letterman doll\u201d, a floppy dummy in a double-breasted suit. The skit ended, and Letterman sat the doll in a chair. But, as he walked away, he circled back and punched it in the head. And then he did it again. And again. And again. And again. A minute later, he walked back and punched it another 10 times. Letterman\u2019s first guest that night was David Schwimmer; on introducing him, he unleashed another volley of punches at the dummy\u2019s head and invited Schwimmer to join him, screaming: \u201cGo ahead, teach him some manners!\u201d As the critic Jason Zinoman observes in his book Letterman: The Last Giant of Late Night, \u201cthe laughter got quieter. What was wrong with Dave?\u201d You can\u2019t help but think of the dummy-punching incident as you watch the second series of Letterman\u2019s Netflix show, My Next Guest Needs No Introduction, because there isn\u2019t a trace of that Letterman in it. He\u2019s absent. Sure, a Letterman is there, but it isn\u2019t the one you know. This Letterman is like the shadow that gets left on the wall after a nuclear bomb goes off. Especially if you were a Letterman fan, My Next Guest Needs No Introduction is a strange series to sit through. There are no jokes. There\u2019s no grouchiness. There is no longer any instinct for havoc. Instead, it\u2019s about a kindly old man being deferential to a succession of people who only partly deserve it. Take his interview with Kanye West, during which he sincerely compliments West\u2019s clothing line (\u201cI like the colour, I like the fit, I love the shoes,\u201d he coos to Kim Kardashian in a filmed segment), or his interview with Tiffany Haddish, where he clenches his fists with sincerity and says: \u201cYour talent is so powerful.\u201d The Letterman of old would have watched this show agape. He used to make his guests work for praise. Now he just wheels it out on a platter. The joy of old Letterman interviews was watching his guests struggle against him, whether they succeeded (when Cher called him an \u201casshole\u201d), or failed (when Letterman walked out midway through an excruciating Crispin Glover segment). But there\u2019s nothing for anyone to struggle against now. During his late-night days, Letterman was a subversive who looked like a straight. Now, with his cloudlike beard threatening to consume his body, he has become the opposite. He looks odd, but his interviews have become tediously, punishingly conventional. My Next Guest Needs No Introduction is so weirdly absent, so steadfastly unDave, that I have been trying to figure out what has happened. There\u2019s an argument, posed by Zinoman in a recent New York Times piece, that Letterman has simply gained some perspective. He\u2019s off the treadmill. He has realised that there\u2019s more to life than his show. \u201cLetterman doesn\u2019t seem interested in looking back so much as discovering new things,\u201d Zinoman writes. \u201cHe approaches these interviews with modesty, putting the spotlight on the guest, deferring to them, rarely challenging or probing too far.\u201d I wonder if there\u2019s something else at play, though.

The charity spends more than \u00a31m every year to help keep its waterways free of plastics and other litter \u2013 money that could be spent in other ways \u2013 but says that if every visitor picked up and recycled just one piece of plastic on each visit, the network could be plastic-free in a year. The Trust is urging communities to take action on their doorstep to clean up their local neighbourhood and help tackle the global plastics crisis. Visitors and passersby could make their own small contribution to help keep canals clear of plastics, it says, whether by picking up and recycling a piece each time they visit, joining the Trust\u2019s growing band of volunteers, or even \u201cadopting\u201d a short stretch of their local canal with friends, neighbours or colleagues. \u201cWe know that life is better by water and more people than ever appreciate the benefits of spending time alongside our waterways, right at the heart of thousands of communities across the country\u201d said Richard Parry, chief executive of Canal &amp; River Trust. \u201cPlastic- and litter-free canals are beautiful, inspiring places for people to enjoy, whether for everyday use or a one-off visit, whilst also being hugely important habitats for some of the nation\u2019s much loved and endangered species.\u201d",

One tool campaigners hope will have an impact is the harnessing of emerging technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence, which have the potential to help in dealing with the complexity of the task at hand.</p> <p>A handful of new startups are focusing on tracing medications on blockchain-type technologies, as well as arming consumers with instant information about what they\u2019ve bought.</p> <p>The Nigerian start-up RxAll, for instance, has created a handheld scanner that can assess the compound of a drug in real time. The device connects to a cloud-based database of information of what the drugs should contain, which then feeds back that information.</p> <p>\u201cThe information collected is a spectral signature of the drug, and once checked, the database sends back information to an app on your phone,\u201d explains Adebayo Alonge, one of the co-founders. The vast information database is updated using an artificial intelligence algorithm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b00bb82edae1fea5b3179e1eb442a5750e9c4716\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b00bb82edae1fea5b3179e1eb442a5750e9c4716/0_66_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patients authenticate medicines by checking the scratchcard code via text message.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patients authenticate medicines by checking the scratchcard code via text message.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: mPedigree Global Image Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe app also shows you the other parts of your city that the drug has been tested in, meaning you can see where bad patches and bad suppliers are,\u201d says Alonge.</p> <p>Alonge and his colleagues launched <a href=\"https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/journey-far-adebayo-alonge-ceo-rxall/60055/\">Rxall</a> last October and have been rolling it out in countries including Ghana, Cambodia and Kenya. It has been in use commercially in Myanmar and has been sold to a large Nigerian teaching hospital and to Nigeria\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nafdac.gov.ng/\">National Agency for Food &amp; Drug Administration and Control</a>, whose officials have started training to use it.</p> <p>It\u2019s a personal cause for Alonge, who nearly died at the age of 15 after taking what turned out to be fake Ventolin for his asthma. The toxic tablets put him in a coma for 21 days, and it took six months for him to completely recover. That experience motivated him to train as a pharmacist himself before starting RxAll.</p> <p>Similarly, Raja Sharif, the chief executive of the UK-based data company <a href=\"https://thefintechtimes.com/farmatrust-saving-lives-building-trust/\">FarmaTrust</a> was also motivated by personal experience. He began researching the problem after he found out a relative had taken fake medicines.</p> <p>FarmaTrust offers a way to trace data about medicine moving through the supply chain on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/10/blockchain-music-imogen-heap-provenance-finance-voting-amir-taaki\">blockchain</a>, a technology originally created for the purpose of buying and selling bitcoin without going through a server belonging to a bank or government that could be hacked.</p> <p>Sharif explains: \u201cThe issue with fake medicines is that they usually enter the middle of the supply chain, not at the top at the point of manufacturing, and the useful thing about blockchain is that it creates an incorruptible record; once you\u2019ve made a record, you can\u2019t make it again or alter it.\u201d</p> <p>Another benefit of this technology, he says, is that information can be shared between pharmaceutical companies about what is going on in their supply chains on a need to know basis.

      "bodyText": "By the time the teenage boy was standing in front of Bernice Bornmai, feverish and delirious, it was already too late. It wasn\u2019t just the malaria that was killing the 17-year-old, it was the time he\u2019d wasted taking fake medicine. The antimalarials did nothing to stop the disease marching through the young Ghanaian\u2019s body: his organs were already shutting down. \u201cHe died waiting to be taken to a larger teaching hospital for dialysis,\u201d Dr Bornmai told the Guardian, from the small hospital in Accra where she works as a senior medical officer. \u201cIt was one of my saddest cases, but I have lost other patients who would have survived because of fake medicines too.\u201d It\u2019s not just ineffective malaria medication that can prove fatal. Bornmai\u2019s patients have sometimes taken counterfeit antibiotics that not only don\u2019t fight the illness but also increase bacterial resistance to effective medicines. \u201cSometimes I just throw up my hands when I see the results showing which antibiotics have a chance of working \u2013 often they will be not readily available or too expensive,\u201d the doctor says. \u201cIt makes my work frustrating, and it means patients have to stay here longer while I investigate.\u201d When it comes to trying to stop fake medicines getting into the hands of sick patients, experts describe a difficult task where they are constantly trying to stay one step ahead of counterfeiters. Law enforcement and legislation is needed, strong pharmaceutical regulation has to be in place and well-trained healthcare professionals are essential, explains Cynthia Genolet, an Africa policy expert at the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers. \u201cYou can\u2019t focus on one specific dimension to be successful in this fight \u2013 it has to be a holistic effort,\u201d she says. Genolet is a member of Fight the Fakes, a campaign group launched in 2010 to raise awareness of the problem among pharmacists and industry. One tool campaigners hope will have an impact is the harnessing of emerging technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence, which have the potential to help in dealing with the complexity of the task at hand. A handful of new startups are focusing on tracing medications on blockchain-type technologies, as well as arming consumers with instant information about what they\u2019ve bought. The Nigerian start-up RxAll, for instance, has created a handheld scanner that can assess the compound of a drug in real time. The device connects to a cloud-based database of information of what the drugs should contain, which then feeds back that information. \u201cThe information collected is a spectral signature of the drug, and once checked, the database sends back information to an app on your phone,\u201d explains Adebayo Alonge, one of the co-founders. The vast information database is updated using an artificial intelligence algorithm. \u201cThe app also shows you the other parts of your city that the drug has been tested in, meaning you can see where bad patches and bad suppliers are,\u201d says Alonge. Alonge and his colleagues launched Rxall last October and have been rolling it out in countries including Ghana, Cambodia and Kenya. It has been in use commercially in Myanmar and has been sold to a large Nigerian teaching hospital and to Nigeria\u2019s National Agency for Food &amp; Drug Administration and Control, whose officials have started training to use it. It\u2019s a personal cause for Alonge, who nearly died at the age of 15 after taking what turned out to be fake Ventolin for his asthma. The toxic tablets put him in a coma for 21 days, and it took six months for him to completely recover. That experience motivated him to train as a pharmacist himself before starting RxAll. Similarly, Raja Sharif, the chief executive of the UK-based data company FarmaTrust was also motivated by personal experience. He began researching the problem after he found out a relative had taken fake medicines. FarmaTrust offers a way to trace data about medicine moving through the supply chain on blockchain, a technology originally created for the purpose of buying and selling bitcoin without going through a server belonging to a bank or government that could be hacked. Sharif explains: \u201cThe issue with fake medicines is that they usually enter the middle of the supply chain, not at the top at the point of manufacturing, and the useful thing about blockchain is that it creates an incorruptible record; once you\u2019ve made a record, you can\u2019t make it again or alter it.\u201d Another benefit of this technology, he says, is that information can be shared between pharmaceutical companies about what is going on in their supply chains on a need to know basis. As they are siloed and competing with each other, vital information that could root out fakes might not be shared. Oksana Pyzik, a senior lecturer at UCL\u2019s school of pharmacy and Fight the Fakes campaigner, says blockchain looks as though it can become an effective tool. \u201cI think based on the fact the FDA is already piloting blockchain in the pharma supply chain in the US suggests it\u2019s a way forward to get the highest quality track and trace, and the cost is not as prohibitive as it was once,\u201d says Pyzik, who organised a panel on the topic of technology and fake medicines at the WHO\u2019s most recent annual health assembly in May. \u201cTechnology alone is not enough, however, it\u2019s a very effective tool. But we also still need to talk about human behaviour and corruption,\u201d Pyzik adds. A much simpler tech solution pioneered by Ghanaian company mPedigree offers a different approach. The company founders began by placing serial numbers under scratchcard surfaces on medicine bottles at the point of manufacture, and consumers can then check the text to see if it matches their database before taking it. \u201cThe company has grown because the counterfeiters grew,\u201d says Selorm Branttie, who co-founded the company with social entrepreneur Bright Simmons. \u201cWe\u2019ve studied where breaches in the supply chain happen, and we counteract it.\u201d The company now has offices in Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and India, and has branched out into tackling counterfeiting in the food supply chain too. \u201cHappily, from when we began to now, the prevalence of counterfeiting has dropped from the estimated 30% of the Nigerian pharmaceutical sector to less than 10% today,\u201d Branttie says. \u201cWe are now looking into ways we can use blockchain too \u2013 blockchain helps to demonstrate that we are ourselves trustworthy because its a permanent public ledger and therefore can show the data we have collected,\u201d says Branttie. The need for any solution being developed to have a global reach is clear. In 2011, Interpol seized 2.4m fake and illicit pills, and that number jumped to 20.7m seized in 2015. A large quantity is produced in China, but India, Pakistan, Paraguay and the UK are also among the top sources for fakes. An estimated 116,000 people die from malaria from ineffective anti-malarial drugs in subSaharan Africa, according to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The WHO estimates that between 72,000 and 169,000 children may be dying each year from pneumonia due to \u201csubstandard and falsified antibiotics\u201d. Counterfeited medicine, thought to be the most lucrative of illegally copied goods trades, ends up all over the world.

He talked about the aftermath of the allegation with sincerity and humility, explaining <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/13/i-felt-terrible-aziz-ansari-addresses-misconduct-claims-during-comedy-set\">again</a> that it made him \u201ca better person\u201d. But disappointingly, he stopped short of addressing any of the alleged behaviour, expressing regret only at how the woman felt. I was torn, simultaneously moved by his vulnerability as he shared a deeply personal, difficult experience with over 2,000 strangers, and disheartened by his refusal to talk about the complexities of the situation that led to it.</p> <p>Though he soon moved on from the topic, my unease lingered as he launched into bit after bit that seemed to almost aggressively mount a case in his defence. When Ansari joked about the excess wokeness that has flooded western society, his hurt at being on the wrong end of it threatened to overshadow the humour. When he insisted that we can\u2019t keep looking at past events and texts \u201cthrough 2019 eyes\u201d, it played like a rebuttal to his detractors \u2013 one that the current climate didn\u2019t afford him during the immediate fallout.</p> <p>At times the connection to his accusation was more explicit. Running through the set was the contention that we are all shitty people who are constantly growing, and he repeatedly used himself as an example. He cited a 2010 episode of beloved sitcom Parks and Recreation<em> </em>that saw his character, Tom, gift a woman a spycam teddy bear. If he was given the script today, he asserted, he would immediately reject it; back then, he (and we) thought it was funny.</p> <p>He described feeling dread when the documentary series Surviving R Kelly created <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/09/surviving-r-kelly-women-of-colour-docuseries\">renewed outrage upon its release earlier this year</a>: nine years ago Ansari enthusiastically praised the disgraced R\u2019n\u2019B star in his first standup special (\u201cI\u2019ve had a shaky year as it is,\u201d he joked when hypothesising about someone digging up the footage). The audience was also implicated, as Ansari challenged us to imagine having our previous R Kelly advocacy on camera. A second challenge was implied: <em>Imagine having a sexual misconduct allegation made very publicly against you.</em></p> <p>Though the defensiveness with which Ansari built his case continued to unnerve me, any temptation to judge him was equally uncomfortable. I couldn\u2019t begrudge his frustration and I agreed with many of his points. He\u2019s not wrong to question the sincerity of white people\u2019s sudden wokeness (\u201cThings just don\u2019t become racist when white people figure it out\u201d), particularly considering his lived experiences as a racial minority. His assertion that the past can\u2019t always be judged by today\u2019s standards is merely sensible; such rejection of retroactive \u201ccancel culture\u201d is justifiably gaining momentum with the recognition that society\u2019s morals are in constant flux.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/13/i-felt-terrible-aziz-ansari-addresses-misconduct-claims-during-comedy-set\">'I felt terrible': Aziz Ansari addresses misconduct claims during comedy set</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Further complicating my position was the warmth I felt towards him. Ansari is sharp, insightful and incredibly funny. More crucially, he is eminently likeable, due in large part to his relatability. Ansari has a profound ability to mine the idiosyncrasies of modern life in a way that makes him seem like he is one of your friends. He has also mastered the art of delivering wake-up calls with a spoonful of sugar: after ridiculing white wokeness, for example, he offered earnest gratitude for the progress it has ushered. While being likeable doesn\u2019t immediately discount a person\u2019s faults, it is significant here because for Ansari, it comes from a place of unfettered honesty.</p> <p>If there was a triumph on Monday night, this was it. Ansari didn\u2019t \u201cperfectly\u201d address the allegation, nor did he succumb to the anger or bitterness he might have felt after being burnt. Instead, he was deeply, imperfectly human, complete with all its attendant messiness. The thoughtful (dare I say <em>woke</em>) reflections on gender inequality that have populated his previous work may have waned, but in their place is an admirable vulnerability that exposes as many flaws as it does virtues.</p> <p>Like the allegation against him, Ansari resists easy categorisation, oscillating between good and bad, grateful and angry, offended and offender. With Road to Nowhere, he invites his audience to do the same. It was an uncomfortable space to sit in at times, but it was undeniably real.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.azizansari.com/\">Aziz Ansari\u2019s Road to Nowhere tour</a> continues through New Zealand, Paris and Ireland in June</em><br></p>",

When he insisted that we can\u2019t keep looking at past events and texts \u201cthrough 2019 eyes\u201d, it played like a rebuttal to his detractors \u2013 one that the current climate didn\u2019t afford him during the immediate fallout. At times the connection to his accusation was more explicit. Running through the set was the contention that we are all shitty people who are constantly growing, and he repeatedly used himself as an example. He cited a 2010 episode of beloved sitcom Parks and Recreation that saw his character, Tom, gift a woman a spycam teddy bear. If he was given the script today, he asserted, he would immediately reject it; back then, he (and we) thought it was funny. He described feeling dread when the documentary series Surviving R Kelly created renewed outrage upon its release earlier this year: nine years ago Ansari enthusiastically praised the disgraced R\u2019n\u2019B star in his first standup special (\u201cI\u2019ve had a shaky year as it is,\u201d he joked when hypothesising about someone digging up the footage). The audience was also implicated, as Ansari challenged us to imagine having our previous R Kelly advocacy on camera. A second challenge was implied: Imagine having a sexual misconduct allegation made very publicly against you. Though the defensiveness with which Ansari built his case continued to unnerve me, any temptation to judge him was equally uncomfortable. I couldn\u2019t begrudge his frustration and I agreed with many of his points. He\u2019s not wrong to question the sincerity of white people\u2019s sudden wokeness (\u201cThings just don\u2019t become racist when white people figure it out\u201d), particularly considering his lived experiences as a racial minority. His assertion that the past can\u2019t always be judged by today\u2019s standards is merely sensible; such rejection of retroactive \u201ccancel culture\u201d is justifiably gaining momentum with the recognition that society\u2019s morals are in constant flux. Further complicating my position was the warmth I felt towards him. Ansari is sharp, insightful and incredibly funny. More crucially, he is eminently likeable, due in large part to his relatability. Ansari has a profound ability to mine the idiosyncrasies of modern life in a way that makes him seem like he is one of your friends. He has also mastered the art of delivering wake-up calls with a spoonful of sugar: after ridiculing white wokeness, for example, he offered earnest gratitude for the progress it has ushered. While being likeable doesn\u2019t immediately discount a person\u2019s faults, it is significant here because for Ansari, it comes from a place of unfettered honesty. If there was a triumph on Monday night, this was it. Ansari didn\u2019t \u201cperfectly\u201d address the allegation, nor did he succumb to the anger or bitterness he might have felt after being burnt. Instead, he was deeply, imperfectly human, complete with all its attendant messiness. The thoughtful (dare I say woke) reflections on gender inequality that have populated his previous work may have waned, but in their place is an admirable vulnerability that exposes as many flaws as it does virtues. Like the allegation against him, Ansari resists easy categorisation, oscillating between good and bad, grateful and angry, offended and offender. With Road to Nowhere, he invites his audience to do the same. It was an uncomfortable space to sit in at times, but it was undeniably real. \u2022 Aziz Ansari\u2019s Road to Nowhere tour continues through New Zealand, Paris and Ireland in June",

All our vehicles are driven by professional, discreet and fully uniformed drivers.\u201d Organisers of Trump\u2019s trips were particular about vehicles even before he became president. During his fleeting visit to see his mother\u2019s birthplace in Stornoway, Scotland, in 2008, Trump used the only black Porsche Cayenne four-wheel drive available on the Isle of Lewis, which the Trump Organization had borrowed off a local businessman after days of searching. Trump insisted on hiring black Range Rovers for his sporadic visits to Aberdeenshire, including his trip to receive an honorary degree from Robert Gordon University in 2010 \u2013 an honour rescinded by the university in 2015 after Trump\u2019s insults against Muslims and Mexican migrants.",

      "bodyText": "Former South Australian premier Jay Weatherill and retired Queensland MP Craig Emerson are expected to review Labor\u2019s failed election campaign, as the party prepares for a confronting postmortem examination of its defeat. As MPs regroup under new leader Anthony Albanese following the 18 May election, the Labor executive has begun turning its mind to how it reviews the campaign that saw the party lose against public and polling expectations. Weatherill, a left-aligned member of the party who served as the South Australian premier from 2011 to 2018, has been named as the most likely figure to lead the \u201cwarts-and-all\u201d review of Bill Shorten\u2019s campaign. The party\u2019s Right faction has proposed that Emerson also have a key role in the evaluation of what went wrong in the party\u2019s campaign, with the former MP for Rankin to examine Labor\u2019s poor showing in Queensland. The ALP federal executive, which now has a majority of left-aligned members, with Albanese having the casting vote, will meet in Canberra next month to finalise the parameters of the review. Former Western Australian MP Gary Gray was also asked to be involved, but declined the offer. Weatherill confirmed he had been approached, and was prepared to conduct the inquiry. \u201cI\u2019m happy to serve the party in any way that they think is appropriate but it is entirely a matter for the Labor party and it\u2019s new leadership,\u201d Weatherill told Guardian Australia. Albanese, who convened the first meeting of shadow cabinet in Brisbane on Tuesday, has said the party will reset its policy agenda following the election loss after hearing the \u201cverdict of the people\u201d. \u201cWell, those of us who were in positions in the Labor party have to accept the outcome and have to accept that we made some strategic errors,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cWe listened to the verdict of the people. The people always get it right. There\u2019s no point complaining about what happened on the field. When you look at the scoreboard at the end of the day, we were defeated by about 77-68.\u201d Shorten, whose unpopularity has been raised as a key reason for the party\u2019s defeat, has blamed \u201cvested interests\u201d for the loss, suggesting Clive Palmer and the Murdoch press \u201cgot what they want\u201d with the election result. MPs, however, have said the party\u2019s controversial tax reform measures, particularly the winding back of franking credits, damaged the party\u2019s chances. In the aftermath of the campaign, WA Labor premier Mark McGowan criticised the federal campaign for being too ambitious. \u201cThey planted a huge target on themselves, their policies were way too grandiose, way too many, they didn\u2019t have a core theme to them,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cBecause they had so much to talk about, people couldn\u2019t latch on to a single thing, and then they allowed themselves to become the issue. \u201cIn an election campaign when you\u2019re fighting against the government, the government should be the issue, not the opposition.",

      "bodyText": "The ABC has vowed to continue to report on national security issues without fear amid a raid by the Australian federal police over a series of articles the broadcaster ran in 2017 into the clandestine operations of Australian special forces in Afghanistan. The raid on the public broadcaster\u2019s headquarters comes just one day after the AFP raided the home of a News Corp political editor over articles she published in 2018 on proposals to expand Australia\u2019s domestic surveillance capabilities. The searches have sparked concern about press freedom in Australia, with the media union denouncing them as a disturbing attempt to \u201cintimidate\u201d journalism. The ABC warrant names the reporters Dan Oakes and Sam Clark, as well as the ABC news boss, Gaven Morris. In a statement less than an hour after the AFP officers entered the office, the ABC managing director, David Anderson, called the raid \u201chighly unusual\u201d. \u201cThis is a serious development and raises legitimate concerns over freedom of the press and proper public scrutiny of national security and defence matters,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ABC stands by its journalists, will protect its sources and continue to report without fear or favour on national security and intelligence issues when there is a clear public interest.\u201d The AFP said it was investigating \u201callegations of publishing classified material, contrary to provisions of the Crimes Act\u201d after the stories were referred for investigation by the defence force chief the day after the ABC published them in July 2017. \u201cNo arrests are planned today as a result of this activity,\u201d the agency said. \u201cThis activity is not linked to a search warrant executed in Canberra yesterday.\u201d AFP officers entered the Harris Street premises just after 11.30am. It is understood the broadcaster had some notice of the raid. The executive editor of the broadcaster\u2019s news section and head of its investigative journalism unit, John Lyons, has been live tweeting the raid since it began. Lyons\u2019 reported on Twitter that AFP officers downloaded more than 9,000 items from ABC computers during the raid, and were then going through them one by one. In a radio interview on Wednesday afternoon, Lyons said he expected the raid to go on for hours if not days. \u201cWhat they are trying to do I think, is essentially send a message to people like us, people doing the job of journalists, that from now on you\u2019re on notice and anyone you talk to, anyone you have text contact with, any digital footprint at all \u2013 we will know about it,\u201d Lyons told 2GB Radio. \u201cIt really feels like a violation of what we do.\u201d Lyons said raids could have a chilling effect on journalists as well as the average person who sees wrongdoing and contemplates becoming a potential whistleblower. \u201cThe message to them is approach a journalist at your own peril,\u201d he said. In March 2019, David McBride, a former defence lawyer, was charged on five counts of leaking classified materials for blowing the whistle on the alleged misconduct by Australian special forces in relation to the The Afghan Filesspecial investigation. He has been committed to the supreme court for trial. The ABC raid comes less than 24 hours after AFP officers served Smethurst a warrant to search her Canberra home, phone and computer 14 months after she published a story about a top-secret proposal to expand the nation\u2019s domestic surveillance agency\u2019s capabilities. The AFP spent almost eight hours at Smethurst\u2019s home in a raid condemned by her employer, the media union, the national press gallery, some politicians and digital rights and human rights groups. On Tuesday afternoon the Sydney radio 2GB host and Sky News presenter Ben Fordham said he had been contacted by home affairs officials after he reported that asylum seeker boats were headed to Australia. Fordham said the officials had told him he was not the target of the home affairs investigation but the department was seeking to establish who had leaked him the information. During a press conference in London, prime minister Scott Morrison attempted to distance himself from the Smethurst raid, saying it was a matter for the AFP and he was \u201cuntroubled\u201d by the upholding of Australian laws, but believed in press freedom. The attorney general, Christian Porter, told ABC radio on Wednesday morning he had not been briefed over the Smethurst raid but did not believe she or her employer were the ultimate target, which appeared to contradict an AFP statement that the warrant related to the \u201calleged publishing of information classified as an official secret\u201d. \u201cSo the investigation, if I can summarise in broad terms, is not about the journalist per se, it\u2019s about someone who may or may not have made an unauthorised disclosure against the terms of a very well-known provision of the Crimes Act to a third party,\u201d Porter told Radio National. On Tuesday, the AFP said the warrant did relate to the publication of the information. The AFP has not clarified what law its investigations relate to in either case. Section 79 of the Crimes Act includes the offence of \u201ccommunicating or allowing someone to have access to prescribed information without authorisation with the intention of prejudicing national security\u201d. Labor\u2019s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, said the opposition had requested a briefing from home affairs \u201cto seek to understand why raids of such nature are warranted\u201d, describing it \u201ca very significant action\u201d. \u201cMinister Dutton must explain what he knew about these two raids \u2013 one on a journalist\u2019s home and one on the ABC,\u201d she said. In a media conference held before the news of the ABC warrant broke, the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, condemned the Smethurst raid as \u201coutrageous\u201d. \u201cPeople do have a right to know if the government has proposals to interfere with their privacy in a way which I believe, is something that Australians should have some say over or at least knowledge of,\u201d he said. The legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre, Emily Howie, said the government\u2019s new espionage laws, passed with the help of Labor last year, raised concerns about the future of public interest journalism. \u201cThe new espionage offence is just the latest law to cover government in a shroud of secrecy and prevent insiders from speaking out. It\u2019s a dangerous law that goes too far and damages press freedom and should urgently be reformed,\u201d she said. The media union, the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, said the ABC raid represented \u201ca disturbing attempt to intimidate legitimate news journalism that was in the public interest\u201d.",

Speaking to journalists in London, the prime minister endeavoured to avoid answering questions about the raid on the News Corp Sunday political editor Annika Smethurst\u2019s Canberra home, which came more than a year after she published a story about a top-secret proposal to broaden Australia\u2019s domestic surveillance capabilities. \u201cThese are matters for the AFP and not the government,\u201d he said. Despite repeated questions, including whether the government was seeking to expand the Australian Signals Directorate\u2019s powers to allow it to spy on Australian citizens domestically, which now sits outside its legal mandate, Morrison said he would not comment on \u201csecurity matters\u201d. Asked if it bothered him to see a journalist\u2019s home raided while speaking of the importance of freedom and democracy to Australia\u2019s allies, Morrison said he believed in those values but was unapologetic about the raid. \u201cAustralia believes strongly in the freedom of the press and we have clear rules and protections for the freedom of the press,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are also clear rules protecting Australia\u2019s national security and everybody should operate in accordance with all of those laws passed by our parliament \u2026 It never troubles me that our laws are being upheld.\u201d The raid on Smethurst\u2019s home, in which AFP officers accessed her phone and computer, came 14 months after she wrote a report pointing to correspondence between the home affairs departmental secretary and the defence departmental secretary proposing increasing the scope of Australia\u2019s surveillance agency. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, who had won a fierce cabinet battle to establish the portfolio less than six months before, dismissed the story as \u201cnonsense\u201d, while the departmental heads released a statement rejecting the report. At the same time, the leak was referred to the AFP for investigation and, in the weeks after the article, both Dutton and his department head confirmed that discussions about the ASD\u2019s capabilities were continuing.

Speaking to ABC radio, he said he had been unaware of it in advance, but conceded that Dutton, as the home affairs minister, may have known. While concerns about attacks on public interest journalism swirl at home, Morrison was also dealing with tensions between the UK and the US over reports Britain may allow Huawei to build part of its 5G infrastructure, despite fellow Five Eyes partners, including Australia, moving to lock the Chinese telco out of their networks. Australia shares intelligence with Britain, the US, Canada, New Zealand and the UK as part of the Five Eyes partnership. In 2018 Australia banned Huawei from building its 5G network, following advice from domestic security agencies. Australia has stepped up its assistance for the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea in building an internet cable, supplanting Huawei\u2019s own offer, after concerns about Beijing\u2019s \u201csoft diplomacy\u201d tactics. Asked if all Five Eye partners should have a consistent approach to dealing with Huawei, given its potential involvement in Britain\u2019s network, Morrison said those questions were \u201cmatters for other sovereign governments\u201d. \u201cThe matter when we considered it was done in accordance with Australia\u2019s national interest and based on our own considerations. It is a sovereign matter for each and every government to make decisions in relation to its own national security and that would be the case for any one of the members of that group or any other nation.\u201d Morrison\u2019s visit to the UK coincided with that of the US president, Donald Trump, and growing escalations in trade conflicts between the Trump administration and traditional trading partners, including China. The prime minister said it was in the interests of all the countries involved that tariff issues be \u201cresolved well and positively\u201d between themselves. But in a speech to the Australia-UK Chamber of Commerce, Morrison espoused the benefits of the World Trade Organisation as the \u201cbest foundation we have for securing continued prosperity in a fast-changing world\u201d and called for a dispute resolution process. \u201cSo we must remain committed to this task, to allow commercial society to flourish, to allow the people in this room \u2013 the entrepreneurs, the employers, the risk takers \u2013 to make the investment decisions so vital to future prosperity,\u201d he said, in a speech reported by Australian Associated Press. \u201cIt is critical, therefore, that like-minded countries, including Australia and the United Kingdom, lend their support to WTO reform \u2013 to mend, not end, the rules-based trading system.\u201d",

Former senate majority leader Harry Reid changes his stance on an impeachment inquiry, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not the right thing to do nothing\u201d. A second woman in less than 36 hours dies after crossing the border, according to US Border Control. On Saturday, a 25-year-old transgender asylum seeker from El Salvador, died at a hospital in El Paso, Texas. The House of Representatives will vote on 11 June on whether to hold both attorney general William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt of Congress. House judiciary chair Jerry Nadler does not appear to be willing to delay a minute longer. Following the Virginia Beach shooting in which 12 people were killed in a a city municipal building, governor Ralph Northam announced that he will summon lawmakers back to the state Capitol this summer on the issue of gun-control legislation, the Associated Press is reporting: Northam, a Democrat faced with a gun-friendly, Republican-controlled General Assembly in the middle of a legislative election year, also said he wants every lawmaker to go on record for or against his proposals during the special session, rather than avoid tough votes by quietly killing the bills in subcommittee. \u201cThe nation will be watching,\u201d the governor said, four days after Virginia Beach employee DeWayne Craddock used two semi-automatic handguns, a silencer and extended ammunition magazines to slaughter 12 people at a municipal building. Craddock was then killed in a gunbattle with police. Northam\u2019s bills include a ban on silencers and high-capacity magazines, as well as a broadening of the ability of local governments to prohibit guns in city buildings. The governor said he also wants mandatory, universal background checks before gun purchases; a limit of one handgun purchase per month; and a \u201cred flag\u201d law that would allow authorities to seize weapons from people deemed a threat to themselves or others. \u201cI will be asking for votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers,\u201d he said, mocking the usual response to gun violence by supporters of the gun lobby. David Smith was in Virginia Beach this weekend, writing about the shooting.

Reid, who as recently as last month was cautioning against pursuing impeachment, said he would likely reach out to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about the issue. \u201cThat has been one of the big arguments against the impeachment,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWhy make Trump a hero by saying \u2018they couldn\u2019t impeach me?\u2019\u201d And remove him from office. But Reid called that \u201call the more reason why the inquiry is the right thing to do.\u201d In the end, he said, \u201cI just think that Republicans are going arm-in-arm with Trump, right over the cliff.\u201d But he said public opinion might be affected by a systematic effort to explore allegations that Trump tried to obstruct the special counsel\u2019s investigation and engaged in other wrongdoing. \u201cI think that that\u2019s one reason an inquiry should go forward, to find out how the public reacts to this,\u201d he said. A 40-year old Honduran woman died in custody of US Border Control agents, the second person in less than 36 hours to die after crossing the border, according to US Customs and Border Protection. Agents detained the woman in Eagle Pass, Texas at 6:20 a.m. Monday, and collapsed minutes later, after arriving at Eagle Pass South Station. She was transported to a hospital, where she died. \u201cOn behalf of the men and women of CBP, we extend our deepest condolences to those who are just learning of the death of their loved one,\u201d Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders said in a statement. \u201cThis tragedy marks the second time in less than 36 hours that a person has died immediately following their perilous migration from their home in Central America, through Mexico and across our Southwest border.\u201d Authorities are not identifying the woman until her family is notified. On Saturday, Johana Medina Le\u00f3n, a 25-year-old transgender asylum seeker from El Salvador, died at a hospital in El Paso, Texas, after she was detained for over a month and complained of chest pains, officials said. Sam Levin reported on Johana Medina Le\u00f3n, and how her death echoed another in US custody that took place a year before.

CNBC is reporting that Amazon paid a lobbying firm run by an ally of President Trump to push against vendors selling counterfeit goods - an issue that has come under scrutiny in the US-China trade battle. From July 2018 until March 2019, Amazon has been paying Ballard Partners up to $70,000 each quarter for, in part, lobbying on issues related to \u201ctrade and tariff policy,\u201d according to three disclosure reports. However, people familiar with the matter said that the disclosure reports only tell part of the story. Brian Ballard, a leading fundraiser in Florida for Trump during the 2016 presidential election, has been lobbying members of Trump\u2019s administration and Congress on Amazon\u2019s behalf to fight back against third party vendors who are selling fake products to their customers. They\u2019re trying to \u201cstop third party actors from shipping fake Nikes to the United States under the guise that they\u2019re real products,\u201d said a person familiar with their efforts. Amazon is increasingly concerned about fake and pirated products on its marketplace. In a February warning to investors, the company used the word \u201ccounterfeit\u201d for the first time. One month after the firm\u2019s last recorded effort, Trump signed a memorandum to curb the sale of counterfeit items online. Read more here. Hey all, Vivian Ho taking over for Erin Durkin. Hope everyone is having a fine day. Donald Trump met with British Prime Minister Theresa May and held a joint press conference with her on his visit to the UK - encouraging her to \u201cstick around\u201d instead of resigning as planned, expressing support for Brexit, and ripping his British critics. The White House directed former staffers Hope Hicks and Annie Donaldson to defy a Congressional subpoena and refuse to turn over documents. Hicks, however, agreed to turn over documents related to her time on Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, but not her time at the White House. Joe Biden, after releasing a climate change plan, was called out for passages of it being lifted from other sources. The Trump administration slapped strict new travel restrictions on Cuba, prohibiting educational and cultural tours that many Americans had used to travel legally to the country. They also banned visits to Cuba by cruise ship. Vanity Fair got its hands on Donald Trump\u2019s pre-nuptial agreement with ex-wife Marla Maples. Among the revelations: Trump agreed to pay Maples only $1 million if they separated within five years, plus another $1 million to buy a house. Trump also would stop making $100,000 child support payments for [daughter] Tiffany when she turned 21. The agreement states that Trump\u2019s payments would cease earlier if Tiffany got a full-time job, enlisted in the military, or joined the Peace Corps. They ended up separating after four years. House Democrats are proposing a $4,500 pay hike for members of Congress, Politico reports. House and Senate members have made $174,000 a year since 2009. A Donald Trump supporter stabbed the Trump baby balloon flown by protesters in London, and was arrested. The balloon apparently suffered only minor wounds. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says Paul Manafort \u201cis going to be treated\u2014 as much as humanly possible\u2014 like any other inmate,\u201d the New York Times reports. Manafort, Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, is reportedly set to be moved to New York\u2019s Rikers Island ahead of his trial on state fraud charges. Business Insider reports that Joe Biden\u2019s climate change plan appears to have lifted multiple sentences directly from outside sources. The campaign says citations were left out inadvertently. Biden has been dogged with plagiarism accusations before, which helped derail his first presidential campaign back in 1988. House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff called Attorney General William Barr the \u201csecond most dangerous man in the country.\u201d \u201cWe find ourselves, I think, for the first time with an attorney general who really is the president\u2019s defense lawyer and spokesperson who\u2019s quite good at it and has the veneer of respectability to camouflage what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Schiff said Tuesday at a Council on Foreign Relations event, the Hill reported. \u201cHe is not the sophist that [presidential lawyer Rudy] Giuliani is, he\u2019s much more dangerous, and I think he\u2019s the second-most-dangerous man in the country,\u201d Former Vice President Joe Biden is asking bundlers to raise up to $100,000 to become members of his national finance committee, CNBC reports. The four tiers of fundraisers list on an invite obtained by the network: The \u201cAdvocate\u201d group requires members to raise $25,000 by June 30. The \u201cProtector\u201d group is required to bring in $50,000 in 2019. A \u201cUnifier\u201d must rake in $100,000 this year. A \u201cPower Raiser\u201d must acquire 10 unique contributions of $100 or more each month. Each of these donations \u201cmust be from a different, new-to-you donor,\u201d according to the invitation. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said there is \u201cnot much support\u201d among Republicans for the tariffs Donald Trump has announced against Mexico, the New York Times reports. Donald Trump may be preparing to declare another national emergency in order to impose his threatened tariffs on Mexico. Senator Tim Scott told CNN that was the plan after administration officials briefed Republican senators at a lunch Tuesday. Previously, Trump declared a national emergency to get money for a border wall, and then vetoed legislation passed by both the House and Senate that would have stopped him. White House counsel Pat Cipollone sent a letter to the House Judiciary Committee explaining the White House order to ex-staffers Hope Hicks and Annie Donaldson not to turn over subpoenaed documents, CNN reports. Rep. Jamie Raskin said the refusal adds more fuel for impeachment. Senator Bernie Sanders is weighing in on BuzzFeed\u2019s reluctance to recognize its employees\u2019 union. Donald Trump tweets about Monday\u2019s ruling rejecting a Congressional attempt to block him from using an emergency declaration to spend money to build a border wall without lawmakers\u2019 approval. Piers Morgan is teasing an interview with Donald Trump that will air tomorrow morning, saying it got \u201cfeisty\u201d and people including the Queen and the family of John McCain should tune in. Washington governor and presidential candidate Jay Inslee sent a letter to Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez urging him to hold a debate focused on the climate crisis, the Daily Beast reports. \u201cThe Democratic Party\u2019s response to climate change cannot only be a few quick questions in the first debates where, in 60 seconds, candidates merely agree that this issue is important, and move on,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe need a full debate to really wrestle with who has the best plans to defeat this existential crisis, who has demonstrated the commitment it will take to get this job done, and who understands the scale of ambition necessary to see this mission through to completion.\u201d New York\u2019s state assembly plans to pass a bill to allow undocumented immigrants to get driver\u2019s licenses, NY1 reports. Senator Mitt Romney predicts threatened tariffs on Mexican imports will never be carried out, per HuffPost. The UN deputy high commissioner for human rights called the abortion bans passing in states around the US \u201ctorture\u201d and a form of \u201cgender-based violence against women.\u201d \u201cWe have not called it out in the same way we have other forms of extremist hate, but this is gender-based violence against women, no question,\u201d Kate Gilmore told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s clear it\u2019s torture \u2013 it\u2019s a deprivation of a right to health,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a crisis. It\u2019s a crisis directed at women.\u201d Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said there must be a \u201cvast reduction\u201d in immigrants crossing the border before the US will back off threatened tariffs on Mexican goods. \u201cThe president was very clear, he wants to see a vast reductions in crossings through Mexico. He believes Mexico can do more to address this flow from Central America. That\u2019s the number one metric that we\u2019re looking for,\u201d he told the Hill. Brexit leader Nigel Farage was seen leaving the London residence where Donald Trump is staying, per a pool report. Farage says he had a \u201cgood meeting\u201d with Trump. House majority leader Steny Hoyer said Tuesday that Congress should subpoena special counsel Robert Mueller if necessary to get him to testify. \u201cI think he ought to testify. He may want a subpoena, for all I know,\u201d Hoyer said, the Hill reported. \u201cHe indicated that his report speaks for itself. Very frankly, ... questioning is an important fact-finding pursuit.\u201d Mueller has said his report on Russian election interference speaks for itself and he would prefer not to testify. Senator Mitt Romney gave his first speech on the Senate floor, defending the international alliances that have come under attack by Donald Trump. \u201cAlliances are absolutely essential to America\u2019s security, to our future, I can\u2019t state that more plainly,\u201d Romney said, the Hill reported. \u201cWe need to hold our friends closer not neglect them or drive them away.\u201d He argued such alliances are key to countering China, since the US has \u201cmany friends\u201d but \u201cChina has very few.\u201d Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement director Mark Morgan said Congress has \u201cabsolutely failed\u201d to stop immigrants from crossing the US border, Politico reports. He pushed Congress to change laws to allow families to be detained longer and permit the rapid deportation of unaccompanied minors. \u201cIt\u2019s unsustainable and nobody should want this,\u201d he said. After the White House instructed former staffers Hope Hicks and Annie Donaldson not to comply with subpoenas, House Judiciary Committee chair Jerry Nadler said: \u201cAs part of President Trump\u2019s continued obstruction of Congress, the White House has instructed both Hope Hicks and Annie Donaldson not to turn over records in response to subpoenas issued by our committee last month. I note that Ms Hicks has agreed to turn over some documents to the committee related to her time working for the Trump campaign, and I thank her for that show of good faith. \u201cFederal law makes clear that the documents we requested \u2013 documents that left the White House months ago \u2013 are no longer covered by executive privilege, if they ever were. \u201cThe president has no lawful basis for preventing these witnesses from complying with our request. We will continue to seek reasonable accommodation on these and all our discovery requests and intend to press these issues when we obtain the testimony of both Ms Hicks and Ms Donaldson.\u201d The White House has directed former communications director Hope Hicks to refuse to turn over documents to the House Judiciary Committee in response to a subpoena, CNN reports. Today is the deadline for her and former White House lawyer Annie Donaldson to comply with the subpoena. More from Guardian environment reporter Oliver Milman on the climate change plan released by Joe Biden this morning: The former vice president, current frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, said he would spur investment in a \u201cclean energy revolution\u201d that would ensure the US reaches 100% renewable energy and net zero emissions by 2050. Biden\u2019s plan would reestablish much of the Obama administration\u2019s work on climate, such as remaining in the Paris climate accords and setting stricter limits on pollution from cars, trucks and drilling operations. Biden said he would not take donations from the fossil fuel industry. \u201cOn day one, Biden will sign a series of new executive orders with unprecedented reach that go well beyond the Obama-Biden Administration platform and put us on the right track,\u201d Biden\u2019s plan states. Climate breakdown has become a top tier concern for Democratic voters and Biden\u2019s plan appears to have won over some previous critics who claimed the vice president wasn\u2019t ambitious enough to address the crisis. \u201cLast month, we put the national spotlight on Joe Biden\u2019s advisers talking about a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d climate plan that included more fossil fuel development,\u201d said Varshini Prakash, executive director of Sunrise, a grassroots climate group. \u201cThe pressure worked. We forced them to backtrack and today, he put out a comprehensive climate plan that cites the Green New Deal and names climate change as the greatest challenge facing America and the world.\u201d There\u2019s been some surprise at the news that former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort will likely be transferred to New York\u2019s Rikers Island jail. The jail complex is notorious for violence and abuse of detainees, and officials have announced plans to close it and replace it with smaller jails around the city. It is home almost exclusively to pre-trial detainees - which would include Manafort, who has been charged by the Manhattan district attorney with six state-level felonies. Manafort has also been convicted, twice, of federal crimes, and sentenced to federal prison. He\u2019s been serving that sentence in Pennsylvania, but is likely to be transferred to New York to be arraigned on the new charges. He\u2019ll likely be held in solitary confinement, and a law enforcement official told the New York Times he would probably be housed in a former prison hospital on the island, where most high-profile detainees are locked up. A New York public defender said liberals should not be celebrating: Senator Elizabeth Warren released a proposal Tuesday calling for a Cabinet-level Department of Economic Development and $2 trillion in green investment. The proposal is centered on the idea of \u201ceconomic patriotism,\u201d which she describes as \u201ca strategy for using all the tools of government to defend and create American jobs rather than continuing to cater to the interests of Wall Street and multinational corporations with no allegiance to America.\u201d China is going after Mike Pompeo for his remarks commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, as well as ongoing political repression in China. In a statement on its website, the Chinese embassy said the secretary of state spoke \u201cout of prejudice and arrogance\u201d and claimed falsely that his condemnation of human rights abuses is a violation of international law. \u201cWhoever attempt to patronize and bully the Chinese people in any name, or preach a \u2018clash of civilizations\u2019 to resist the trend of times will never succeed. They will only end up in the ash heap of history,\u201d the embassy said. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang went further at a press briefing Tuesday and said, \u201cThese lunatic ravings and babbling nonsense will only end up in the trash can of history,\u201d Channel News Asia reports. The new Trump administration restrictions on travel to Cuba ban many educational and recreational trips, the Associated Press reports. The treasury department said in a statement that the US will no longer allow the group educational and cultural trips known as \u201cpeople to people\u201d travel to the island. Those trips have been used by thousands of American citizens to visit Cuba legally. The department also said it will deny permission for private and corporate aircraft and boats to travel to Cuba. Former Donald Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort is likely to be moved as early as this week to the Rikers Island jail in New York City, Fox News first reported. He will most likely be held in solitary confinement while facing state fraud charges. He\u2019s now in a Pennsylvania prison after being convicted of federal charges in two related cases. Donald Trump claimed that protests against him in London were fake news. They are, of course, in fact real. Tariffs on Mexican goods will most likely take effect next week as scheduled, Donald Trump said Tuesday. \u201cMexico should step up and stop this onslaught, this invasion into our country,\u201d Trump said during his trip to the UK. Trump has said tariffs will start at 5% and escalate over time. He said of migration into the US, \u201cThey could stop it very quickly, and I think they will, and if they don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to put tariffs on.\u201d He predicted Republicans would not follow through with threatened action to block the tariffs. \u201cI don\u2019t think they will do that. I think if they do, it\u2019s foolish,\u201d he said. Donald Trump said on Brexit that Theresa May is probably a better negotiator than he is. \u201cI would have sued, but that\u2019s OK. She\u2019s probably a better negotiator than I am,\u201d he said of his past suggestion that May sue the EU. \u201cI would have sued and settled maybe, but you never know.\u201d Trump said the UK should go ahead with its scheduled exit from the European Union. \u201cIt will happen, and it probably should happen. This is a great, great country, and it wants its own identity. It wants to have its own borders. It wants to run its own affairs,\u201d Trump said at his joint press conference with May. The Trump administration has imposed major new restrictions on travel to Cuba, the Associated Press reports. Donald Trump renewed his attacks on London Mayor Sadiq Khan. \u201cHe\u2019s been a not very good mayor, from what I understand. He\u2019s done a poor job,\u201d Trump said at his London press conference with UK Prime Minister Theresa May, saying Khan should not be criticizing him. \u201cHe\u2019s a negative force, not a positive force,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe hurts the people of this great country.\u201d As for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who spoke at a protest against him, Trump said he has never met Corbyn and declined the chance to meet him on this trip. He called him \u201csomewhat of a negative force.\u201d \u201cI really don\u2019t like critics as much as I like and respect people who get things done,\u201d Trump said. He went on to dismiss protests against him as a \u201cvery very small group of people.\u201d May, asked directly if she agrees with Trump that the mayor is a \u201cstone cold loser,\u201d did not answer but said both Khan and Corbyn should focus on the importance of the US-UK relationship. Virginia\u2019s governor, Ralph Northam, will recall lawmakers to the state Capitol in coming weeks to take up a package of gun-control legislation he said is urgently needed to prevent killings like Friday\u2019s mass shooting in Virginia Beach. The Associated Press reports: Northam, a Democrat, told The Associated Press ahead of his Tuesday announcement that he plans to convene a special legislative session later this summer. He said in an interview that he wants the Republican-controlled General Assembly to hear from the public about the need for \u201ccommon-sense\u201d law related to guns and accessories. Republicans have previously rejected Northam\u2019s gun control bills out of hand, but a top GOP lawmaker signaled Monday that he\u2019s open to a legislative debate. Donald Trump and Theresa May are beginning their press conference after meeting for talks in London. They were greeted with boos from the crowd as they left the prime minister\u2019s residence at Downing Street, where they met privately, to the nearby Foreign Office where they are holding the press conference. Follow it here: Congressional Republicans do not like Donald Trump\u2019s plan for tariffs on Mexican goods but have no clear plan to stop it, CNN reports. Senate Republicans are set to meet Tuesday for a weekly policy lunch, where White House officials will defend the tariff plan. More tidbits from Tuesday\u2019s CNN poll: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has the worst net favorability rating among candidates with high name recognition. 19% of voters view him favorably and 22% unfavorably, for a net negative three point rating. Colorado Senator Michael Bennet has qualified for the Democratic presidential debates. The CNN poll is the third in which he has hit 1% support, the threshold to qualify. (With so many candidates, the party may tighten the rules, so qualifying doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he\u2019ll be on stage). Oddly, it appears to be voters who say they\u2019ve never heard of Bennet picking him as their choice in the poll. Joe Biden still leads the Democratic presidential field by a substantial margin, but support for the former vice-president has dropped some since the beginning of his campaign, a new CNN poll finds. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning registered voters nationwide, Biden gets support from 32%, followed by 18% for Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, 8% for California Senator Kamala Harris, and 7% for Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. In an April CNN poll, Biden was at 39%, but none of the other candidates have made substantial gains to catch up with him. Donald Trump said in his meeting with Theresa May that the UK is the Unites States\u2019 biggest trade partner, a fact he said many people may not know. That may be because it is false: China is actually the largest US trade partner. Larry the Downing Street cat has been spotted staking out a spot under Donald Trump\u2019s limo. The US government spent millions of dollars on luxury hotel suites, chauffeured vehicles and back-up generators for Donald Trump\u2019s state visit to London, the Guardian\u2019s Severin Carrell reports. Contracts placed by the state department show US taxpayers have spent $1,223,230 on VIP accommodation at the InterContinental hotel on Park Lane in Mayfair, a hotel linked to members of the Qatari royal family. Another $339,386 has been spent on \u201chotel rooms in support of a visit\u201d at the Hilton on Park Lane, one of London\u2019s most exclusive addresses, and also on \u201cpassenger car rental\u201d. As Donald Trump meets with Theresa May in London, he urged her to reconsider her plans to resign and instead \u201cstick around\u201d to work out a post-Brexit trade deal. He was greeted by crowds of protesters, who flew a giant balloon depicting Trump as an orange baby. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn spoke at the protest Tuesday. There\u2019s also a robotic likeness of Donald Trump on a golden toilet, per AP. Trump did not shake hands with May when he arrived at Downing Street, though he did shake hands with her husband. Follow our UK blog for more updates on the president\u2019s trip. Presidential hopeful Joe Biden released his plan to combat climate change on Tuesday. It proposes eliminating net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, CNN reports. It would cost $1.7tn over the first ten years. Biden proposes re-joining the Paris climate agreement, which Donald Trump pulled out of. The plan leaves a number of details to Congress to figure out, including how to require corporations to meet the emissions goals that the blueprint lays out. The plan embraces the framework of the Green New Deal, according to the Washington Post. He would reinstate many of the environmental policies in place under Barack Obama\u2019s administration, where he was vice-president, but with the target of eliminating net emissions goes significantly beyond what the previous White House achieved, per the New York Times. Progressive groups are expressing \u201cdeep disappointment\u201d over House Democrats\u2019 reluctance to impeach Donald Trump and pushing the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to move forward with impeachment in a new letter. The Associated Press reports: The groups said in a letter being released Tuesday that voters gave Democrats control of the House \u201cbecause they wanted aggressive oversight of the Trump administration.\u201d They said: \u201cThe Trump era will be one that evokes the question \u2014 what did you do? We urge you to use your power to lead and to stop asking us to wait.\u201d Pelosi has been reluctant to launch impeachment proceedings , despite growing numbers of Democrats saying it\u2019s time to start a formal inquiry. She says impeachment requires more public support and would detract from the legislative agenda. Instead, House Democrats are conducting dozens of investigations of the Trump administration , announced a series of new hearings and promised a vote next week to hold Attorney General William Barr and former White House Counsel Don McGahn in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with subpoenas. But the groups, whose members include millions of Americans, say those being hurt by the Trump administration\u2019s policies and behavior don\u2019t have the privilege of waiting. \u201cThere are people who feel Trump\u2019s boot on their necks every single day,\u201d said Heidi Hess, co-director at CREDO Action. \u201cWe expect moral leadership from you.\u201d The groups signing onto the letter to Pelosi include Indivisible and Democracy for America.",

      "bodyText": "Secondhand bookstores used to fill me with dread. They were the places of neglected stories, of lost hours, of the authors the world had forgotten. This is, of course, not entirely true, but back then I was trying to be someone \u2013 a writer \u2013 and I saw secondhand bookstores the same way I saw graveyards: as places stories went to die. The books that surround us say a lot about who we are \u2013 or were \u2013 and, two weeks ago, as I prepared to shift my life from Sydney to Barcelona, I sat on my bedroom floor staring at the 100 or so titles I had acquired over my six years in the city. Some were funny. A couple were classics. Most were depressing. I\u2019m going to get rid of all my books, I told my mum on the phone. It\u2019s no wonder I was sad; look at all this crap I was reading. But in the end, I found I couldn\u2019t get rid of all of them. As I separated them into piles \u2013 keep, throw, I don\u2019t know \u2013 seeing their covers, reading their opening pages, sometimes getting swallowed by whole chapters, certain books returned me to a world largely of firsts. With Richard Brautigan\u2019s An Unfortunate Woman, I became 20 again, little more than a boy, moving interstate for the first time. With Haruki Murakami\u2019s 1Q84, I was 21 and falling deeply in love. With Mira Gonzalez\u2019s i will never be beautiful enough to make us beautiful together, I was 25, back in that Marrickville apartment with the neighbour who kept trying to cough the cancer out, finishing my first book. With Tim O\u2019Brien\u2019s The Things They Carried, I saw myself at 28, in Brisbane, my family home, in the room I grew up in, reading after a 10-month migraine \u2013 after a year of not reading or writing anything at all. But these books were more than just firsts. They were whole worlds filled with laughter and sadness and magic and death and beauty and pain, and they had shaped and supported and made the world more tolerable when I needed them most. These were books with answers, or if not answers, then questions, which is to say that these books were my teachers. There was Alejandro Zambra\u2019s Bonsai and Ways of Going Home that taught the beauty of brevity, of pause, of quietness, of being heard. And there was Valeria Luiselli\u2019s Faces in the Crowd and Sidewalks that was an urgent, expert reminder that there were no rules, that a book could sing and stare and dance; that a book had fists and that, done correctly, a book could masquerade as a book before becoming a fist, trapping one forever inside the other. There was even a book by the poet Jamie Mortara. We had met, briefly, in 2015 in Minneapolis at a poetry reading, and I had purchased Some Planet, and it had brought me to tears. I knew suddenly that I could not abandon these texts, that I could not send them to the graveyard, to those dusty shops, to be forgotten, left, lost. So I did the thing I\u2019d always done. I picked up a pen. I wrote. On the inside covers of 10 of those books, I wrote messages to friends telling them that I would miss them, that they meant so much to me, that these books had meant everything to me too. I explained that these books had helped me, had been like mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters to me. I hoped that if my friends ever needed them, that those books would be there waiting for them too. Perhaps this was my way of cheating on goodbye, of keeping the story going with the people I would miss long after I had gone. The day before I left, one of those friends helped me pack up my room, and we drove the rest of the books to Sappho\u2019s in Glebe. The book clerk browsed the titles, smiled and said: \u201cI\u2019m sure we can find these books a home.\u201d Perhaps, it\u2019s best to stop there, on that word: home. Suddenly, looking around, I realised I was going far, far away. But I also knew that if I ever felt lonely, or lost or sad, I could simply take myself to a secondhand bookstore where I knew, between the covers, entire worlds were waiting for me \u2013 for anyone \u2013 to return. \u2022 Oliver Mol is the author of Lion Attack!
