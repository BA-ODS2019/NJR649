The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2019:&nbsp;</b>Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Both the protesters and the government have in recent weeks been trying to keep public opinion and attention on their side. The protesters have mostly been orderly, obeying traffic laws, cleaning up after themselves and allowing ambulances to pass even when tens of thousands are gathered.</p> \n<p>They even returned to bow and apologise to civil servants after a small-scale protest forced government offices to shut and the staff to go home early.</p> \n<p>Up until midnight police were far more restrained with their use of force, having been criticised for their actions against protesters at a smaller protest on 12 June, when they fired 150 rounds of teargas and rubber bullets, and videos of police beating and pepper-spraying unarmed protesters circulated over the internet.</p> \n<p>The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/01/jeremy-hunt-backs-hong-kong-citizens-right-to-protest\">on Monday</a> stressed \u201cUK support for Hong Kong and its freedoms\u201d, saying in a statement that \u201cno violence is acceptable but Hong Kong people must preserve the right to peaceful protest exercised within the law, as hundreds of thousands of brave people showed today.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f7ede9242f19e6547dc1eb74a05cca0a1068a80\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f7ede9242f19e6547dc1eb74a05cca0a1068a80/0_92_2736_1642/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Defaced portraits of Hong Kong officials in the legislative council building\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Defaced portraits of Hong Kong officials in the legislative council building.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>UK diplomats will be concerned that the Hong Kong executive might use the violence as a reason to impose severe penalties on protesters, including possibly reintroducing the suspended extradition law. The UK had been privately pressing for the legislation to be dropped altogether.</p> \n<p>China also reiterated its stance against what it called \u201cforeign interference\u201d in Hong Kong.

      "bodyText": "Hong Kong police have fired teargas at demonstrators and moved to disperse crowds after protesters stormed the legislative council building and raised the territory\u2019s former colonial flag on the 22nd anniversary of its handover to China. The dramatic scenes came after a peaceful march of half a million people made its way through other parts of the city as its deepest political crisis in two decades showed no sign of abating. For the past month protesters have been demanding the withdrawal of a bill that would allow extraditions to the Chinese mainland as anger has grown against Hong Kong authorities and the territory\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam. The police action came against a breakaway group of protesters, some of whom had forced their way into the legislative council building and vandalised its main chamber. Shortly after midnight local time (1600 BST), police in riot gear held up a black flag reading \u201cteargas warning\u201d before shooting several rounds of the gas into protesters. They then climbed over barricades put up by protesters earlier in the day and charged at the people gathered. Outside the legislative council building protesters wearing hard hats, goggles and masks ran away clutching umbrellas as smoke filled the air. Protesters had for hours been repeatedly striking reinforced glass walls with a metal trolley and poles as hundreds of others watched on. Once inside they threw chairs and tore down and defaced portraits of past lawmakers. After the protesters were dispersed, images of the vandalised building were broadcast. More than 50 people were reportedly taken to hospital for treatment after various protests throughout the day. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether this would work, but what other channels are there to make Carrie Lam listen to us?\u201d said a male protester outside the legislative council building, who declined to be named. \u201cWe used to protest peacefully but it didn\u2019t work, now we need to get out of this framework and tell them, we\u2019re willing to try anything until you give us an answer.\u201d Police had issued several warnings through the evening and appeared to be gearing up for violent clashes, but had left the protesters largely unhindered in their efforts even as the group tore up the inside of the building. Local TV footage showed police officers armed with non-lethal weaponry in other parts of the government complex as the protesters broke in. One lawmaker, Fernando Cheung, suggested to reporters that the inaction from police had been a trap, aimed at swinging public sentiment against the protest movement with the help of violent and destructive scenes. Half a dozen pro-democracy and independent lawmakers had earlier scuffled with protesters as they called for calm and pushed against the trolley that was being used to enter the council building. \u201cThey simply wouldn\u2019t listen to me,\u201d said Lam Cheuk-ting, one of the politicians. \u201cThe movement at large is peaceful, but some young people are overwhelmed by a strong sense of helplessness and they\u2019re emotionally charged.\u201d While a small splinter group was causing trouble at the legislature, 550,000 people marched peacefully through downtown Hong Kong without any scenes of violence or chaos. The organisers of that rally \u2013 the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) \u2013 issued a joint statement with democratic lawmakers placing the blame for the destruction at the legislative council squarely on Lam, saying she had \u201cignored the demands of the people and pushed youngsters towards desperation\u201d. The CHRF also reiterated its five demands: the full retraction of the controversial extradition law amendment bill; an investigation into police brutality; Lam\u2019s resignation; the release of arrested protesters; and the removal of the designation of the earlier clashes as a riot. Lam called a rare press conference early on Tuesday to condemn the \u201cextremely violent\u201d storming of the legislature, which she described as \u201cheartbreaking and shocking\u201d. Speaking beside Lam, police chief Stephen Lo said: \u201cProtesters\u2019 violent acts have far exceeded the bottom line of peaceful expressions of demands.\u201d A joint statement from 41 pro-government lawmakers condemned what they described as \u201cextremely radical and violent acts\u201d, such as the occupying of roads and vandalism of the council building. The rallies are the latest manifestation of growing fears that China is stamping down on the city\u2019s freedoms and culture with the help of the finance hub\u2019s pro-Beijing leaders. Although returned to Chinese rule in 1997, Hong Kong is still administered separately under an arrangement known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. The city enjoys rights and liberties unseen on the autocratic mainland, but many residents believe Beijing is reneging on that deal. While the recent protests were initially sparked by Lam\u2019s attempts to pass the proposed extradition legislation, the demonstrations have morphed into a wider movement against her administration and Beijing. Both the protesters and the government have in recent weeks been trying to keep public opinion and attention on their side. The protesters have mostly been orderly, obeying traffic laws, cleaning up after themselves and allowing ambulances to pass even when tens of thousands are gathered. They even returned to bow and apologise to civil servants after a small-scale protest forced government offices to shut and the staff to go home early. Up until midnight police were far more restrained with their use of force, having been criticised for their actions against protesters at a smaller protest on 12 June, when they fired 150 rounds of teargas and rubber bullets, and videos of police beating and pepper-spraying unarmed protesters circulated over the internet. The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, on Monday stressed \u201cUK support for Hong Kong and its freedoms\u201d, saying in a statement that \u201cno violence is acceptable but Hong Kong people must preserve the right to peaceful protest exercised within the law, as hundreds of thousands of brave people showed today.\u201d UK diplomats will be concerned that the Hong Kong executive might use the violence as a reason to impose severe penalties on protesters, including possibly reintroducing the suspended extradition law. The UK had been privately pressing for the legislation to be dropped altogether. China also reiterated its stance against what it called \u201cforeign interference\u201d in Hong Kong. Speaking in Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said the UK\u2019s rights and obligations under the joint declaration on the 1997 handover of Hong Kong had ended. \u201cBritain has no so-called responsibility for Hong Kong. Hong Kong matters are purely an internal affair for China. No foreign country has a right to interfere,\u201d Geng told a daily news briefing. \u201cRecently Britain has continuously gesticulated about Hong Kong, flagrantly interfering. We are extremely dissatisfied with this and resolutely opposed.\u201d Earlier in the day, Lam, had attempted to calm the mood, as during an official ceremony took place at a convention centre in WanHong Kong\u2019s Wan Chai todistrict to mark the 22nd anniversary of the handover. In her speech, Lam referred to the protests, saying they had made her realise \u201cthe need to grasp public sentiments accurately\u201d. She said: \u201cI am also fully aware that while we have good intentions, we still need to be open and accommodating.\u201d Additional reporting by Patrick Wintour",

The Local Government Association (LGA) said councils had little confidence that they would be able to deliver the already tough savings targets they had set themselves for this financial year, and would have to go back for extra cuts to meet their legal requirement to balance their budgets. A further one in three councils surveyed said prospects were so bleak that within three years they would be unable to meet their statutory obligation to provide an adequate service in core areas such as adult social care, child protection and homelessness prevention. Lord Porter, the LGA chairman and a Tory peer, said: \u201cAs this survey shows, if the government fails to adequately fund local government, there is a real risk to the future financial viability of some services and councils.\u201d The LGA, which holds its annual conference in Bournemouth on Tuesday, has called for urgent funding guarantees amid concerns that the government\u2019s three-year spending review planned for the autumn will be postponed because of uncertainty caused by the Tory leadership contest and the looming October Brexit deadline. Even if councils are given an emergency one-year \u201crollover\u201d financial settlement for 2020-21, this will lock austerity into town hall budgets for a 10th successive year, raising fears that a further round of cuts and redundancies will critically undermine the quality and safety of day-to-day services. Porter told MPs last month that vulnerable people would die as a result of social care cuts if the funding gap between resources and demand widened further, saying that \u201cthe first serious shock will be when a secretary of state has to stand up and explain to the public why those people died because the money was not available\u201d. He told the Commons housing, communities and local government committee: \u201cI am not sure anybody who gets elected to parliament wants to be the person who stands on the newsstand and explains why people died because of fiscal policy. It is only money, at the end of the day. Why do we need to lose people because of money?\u201d Last year Tory-run Northamptonshire county council in effect declared bankruptcy and imposed a ban on non-essential spending. Its failure to make planned savings after years of cutbacks and chaotic management left it unable to fulfil its legal requirement to meet its spending obligations and balance its budget. It reportedly stabilised its finances early this year after selling its headquarters and spending \u00a360m of the proceeds to balance the books. However, it has since reported a \u00a36m overspend on its adult social care budget, just three months into the new financial year. Councils have already had proposed cuts to statutory services such as libraries and Sure Start centres challenged \u2013 and sometimes overturned \u2013 in the courts on the grounds that the cuts breach the legal obligation to provide an adequate level of service. More judicial review challenges are expected. The shadow communities secretary, Andrew Gwynne, said community neglect was the legacy of a decade of municipal austerity. \u201cOur councils keep our streets cleaner and safer, protect the most vulnerable in society and maintain our green spaces \u2013 but a decade of austerity has eroded these vital services away.\u201d The LGA estimates that between 2010 and 2016, local authorities will have lost 60p out of every \u00a31 they received from central government. By next April the gap between council resources and demand will be \u00a33bn, rising to \u00a38bn by 2025, fuelled by wage inflation and the rising costs of adult and child social care. The LGA survey was completed by 141 out of 339 LGA member councils between 28 March and 5 June. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \u201cCouncils are a vital link to meet the needs of residents. That\u2019s why we\u2019re providing local authorities with access to \u00a346.4bn this year \u2013 a real-terms increase \u2013 including extra funding to support some of our most vulnerable groups.\u201d",

The survey by the charity Adoption UK reveals that adopted children often struggle to cope in schools, with significantly higher rates of exclusion \u2013 including internal, fixed-term and permanent \u2013 than their peers. Beyond school, those aged 16-25 are twice as likely not to be in education, employment or training (Neet) than other young people, and nearly two in five of the same age group (39%) have been involved with mental health services. Described as one of the most comprehensive studies into the realities of modern-day adoption in the UK, the survey provides a revealing snapshot of the experiences of those who adopt and the outcomes of the children they have adopted in a single year. Although almost eight out 10 parents (79%) are optimistic and would encourage others to adopt, seven out of 10 adoptive parents (70%) say it is a \u201ccontinual struggle\u201d to get the help and support their child needs, and more than half (56%) of established families say they face \u201csignificant or extreme challenges\u201d in parenting their children. Based on a survey of 3,500 adoptive families, with 4,000 adopted children and young people between them, the study documents their experiences from the adoption process and the early days of a child\u2019s placement, right through education and into young adulthood. While progress has been made, particularly in the early stages of adoption, the parents\u2019 responses document the challenge of parenting older adoptees.

The \u201cpartisan, and occasionally confrontational and aggressive environment at Westminster\u201d can also damage MPs\u2019 wellbeing, Poulter added. However, having a second job outside parliament does not increase their stress levels, it appears. The study is the first time that members of any of the UK\u2019s four parliaments or assemblies, or any parliament internationally, have given detailed insights into their mental health. Poulter said it was worrying that 52% of MPs with a mental health problem said they would not discuss it with a party whip, 48% would not talk about it with a fellow MP, and 55% did not know how to get mental health support at parliament. The parliamentary health and wellbeing service was set up at Westminster to help MPs and their staff with physical and mental health problems. But some reports suggest that it is not well used. Most MPs still do not know it exists, the study found. The authors admit the results may have been skewed by the small percentage (22.4%) of MPs who filled in a questionnaire in December 2016 upon which the findings are based. But they also say that enduring \u201cstigma and self-stigma\u201d about mental ill health at Westminster and beyond may have discouraged MPs from taking part. Claire Murdoch, NHS England\u2019s national director for mental health, said: \u201cThis should act as a stark reminder that no one is immune from mental ill-health. It doesn\u2019t discriminate and can happen to anyone at any time, disrupting life for hundreds of thousands of people.\u201d",

The five-star hotels lining the Qatari capital\u2019s Gulf shoreline are well known for hosting high-stakes political negotiations but Neville opted to remove his players temporarily from England\u2019s luxury beachside base as politeness and pleasantries were briefly replaced by somewhat harsher home truths. \u201cWe had a real big moment when we got beaten by Sweden,\u201d Neville said. \u201cMy whole Christmas was ruined by that game.

      "body": "<p>There is a programme on the Discovery Channel called MythBusters whose presenters and producers, I have long thought, must be among the happiest people on Earth. Their raison d\u2019\u00eatre is taking things people reckon are true and examining whether they are.</p> <p>Can a handgun held incorrectly \u2013 MythBusters is an American production \u2013 really blow off a man\u2019s thumb? Let\u2019s construct man\u2011hands out of chicken parts and wire and see \u2026 Boom! Yes, it can! Can gaffer tape be used to mend a boat leak? Well, not only can it fix a leak, my friends, but you can construct an entire boat out of the stuff and put it successfully to sea. When testing whether a stick of dynamite tossed in a cement mixer is the best way to get rid of the layer of building-glue therein, why not set off 390kg (850lb) of military-grade explosives inside a 15-metre-thick layer of concrete, too? Again, in slow motion, for the cheap seats!</p> <p>For a flagship science documentary series, Horizon\u2019s latest instalment \u2013 Britain\u2019s Next Air Disaster? Drones (BBC Two) \u2013 hath drunk surprisingly deeply from the MythBusters well. The presenter, Aldo Kane (a former Royal Marines commando and sniper, now an all-round action man and high-risk adviser to the kinds of people and companies who need to be advised on high-risk things \u2013 and sporter of a beard so vigorous it should have had separate billing), has all kinds of fun. He gets to see gelatine packages (mimicking birds) fired into aeroplane wings; smash up a drone \u2013 or \u201cunmanned aerial vehicle\u201d (UAV), if you are so minded \u2013 and fire its parts at another one; shoot a rifle all over the Lake District; and get to grips with something called <a href=\"https://www.uk.leonardocompany.com/en/news-and-stories-detail/-/detail/focus-on-falcon-shield\" title=\"\">Leonardo\u2019s Falcon Shield</a>, a name that shall be writ on a lake of testosterone and fire by a pen made of testicles.</p> <p>This is all to investigate how much danger this new technology poses, in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/19/gatwick-flights-halted-after-drone-sighting\" title=\"\">Gatwick\u2019s three-day drone </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/19/gatwick-flights-halted-after-drone-sighting\" title=\"\">incident</a>, during which 140,000 passengers on 1,000 diverted or cancelled flights were royally spragged after reports of the unmanned little buggers being seen near runways. What can we do about the people who would rather use these ever faster, ever cheaper devices not for delivering urgent medical supplies, going into disaster areas too unsafe for people to enter, dropping off new hardbacks and kitchen appliances at people\u2019s homes or otherwise adding to the sum of human happiness and progress, but for frustrating the pursuit of the peace and safety in which we had once hoped to live?</p> <p>Kane does his due diligence, duly and diligently. Drone pilots show him how far, fast and accurately a UAV can be sent anywhere, while experts testify that it can be done by operators hidden 1,000 miles away. The sharp metal drone parts he smashes up and fires off do far more damage to a plane than bird mush does \u2013 and there were 125 near-misses in 2018. Drone manufacturers\u2019 pledges to install new collision warnings won\u2019t \u2013 believe it or not \u2013 stop the drone operators for whom colliding with planes is the whole point. Ditto planned legislation for users of drones weighing more than 250g <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44293905\" title=\"\">to be registered </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44293905\" title=\"\">with the Civil Aviation Authority</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we watch footage from August 2018 of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/04/nicolas-maduros-speech-cut-short-while-soldiers-scatter\" title=\"\">attempted assassination by drone of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the embattled Venezuelan president</a>, which shows how easily geofencing \u2013 which is used to keep drones operating within a certain perimeter \u2013 can be hacked, and why shooting tiny things out of busy skies with bullets that can still kill people on their way down is sub-optimal.</p> <p>For all the boys-with-toys overlay, the programme\u2019s underlying message is sober and devoid of histrionics. The problem is that it all adds up to less than the sum of its parts. Yes, there is this threat and that threat, and these possibilities, and these loopholes in current defences against them. But despite Kane\u2019s assertions that various things are \u201cterrifying\u201d, there is too much distance between the evidence and the threat to induce much emotion.</p> <p>Whether this is the fault of the show or the fact that most of us are maxed-out, terror-wise, by clearer and more present dangers to factor in a new one is hard to say. Personally, I am at a point where worrying about drone strikes feels like a luxury my mental health can\u2019t afford. But it is on my list now. As soon as a space opens up, I will start. Thank you, Aldo; thank you, Horizon \u2013 I think.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is a programme on the Discovery Channel called MythBusters whose presenters and producers, I have long thought, must be among the happiest people on Earth. Their raison d\u2019\u00eatre is taking things people reckon are true and examining whether they are. Can a handgun held incorrectly \u2013 MythBusters is an American production \u2013 really blow off a man\u2019s thumb? Let\u2019s construct man\u2011hands out of chicken parts and wire and see \u2026 Boom! Yes, it can! Can gaffer tape be used to mend a boat leak? Well, not only can it fix a leak, my friends, but you can construct an entire boat out of the stuff and put it successfully to sea. When testing whether a stick of dynamite tossed in a cement mixer is the best way to get rid of the layer of building-glue therein, why not set off 390kg (850lb) of military-grade explosives inside a 15-metre-thick layer of concrete, too? Again, in slow motion, for the cheap seats! For a flagship science documentary series, Horizon\u2019s latest instalment \u2013 Britain\u2019s Next Air Disaster? Drones (BBC Two) \u2013 hath drunk surprisingly deeply from the MythBusters well. The presenter, Aldo Kane (a former Royal Marines commando and sniper, now an all-round action man and high-risk adviser to the kinds of people and companies who need to be advised on high-risk things \u2013 and sporter of a beard so vigorous it should have had separate billing), has all kinds of fun. He gets to see gelatine packages (mimicking birds) fired into aeroplane wings; smash up a drone \u2013 or \u201cunmanned aerial vehicle\u201d (UAV), if you are so minded \u2013 and fire its parts at another one; shoot a rifle all over the Lake District; and get to grips with something called Leonardo\u2019s Falcon Shield, a name that shall be writ on a lake of testosterone and fire by a pen made of testicles. This is all to investigate how much danger this new technology poses, in the wake of Gatwick\u2019s three-day drone incident, during which 140,000 passengers on 1,000 diverted or cancelled flights were royally spragged after reports of the unmanned little buggers being seen near runways. What can we do about the people who would rather use these ever faster, ever cheaper devices not for delivering urgent medical supplies, going into disaster areas too unsafe for people to enter, dropping off new hardbacks and kitchen appliances at people\u2019s homes or otherwise adding to the sum of human happiness and progress, but for frustrating the pursuit of the peace and safety in which we had once hoped to live? Kane does his due diligence, duly and diligently. Drone pilots show him how far, fast and accurately a UAV can be sent anywhere, while experts testify that it can be done by operators hidden 1,000 miles away. The sharp metal drone parts he smashes up and fires off do far more damage to a plane than bird mush does \u2013 and there were 125 near-misses in 2018. Drone manufacturers\u2019 pledges to install new collision warnings won\u2019t \u2013 believe it or not \u2013 stop the drone operators for whom colliding with planes is the whole point. Ditto planned legislation for users of drones weighing more than 250g to be registered with the Civil Aviation Authority. Meanwhile, we watch footage from August 2018 of an attempted assassination by drone of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the embattled Venezuelan president, which shows how easily geofencing \u2013 which is used to keep drones operating within a certain perimeter \u2013 can be hacked, and why shooting tiny things out of busy skies with bullets that can still kill people on their way down is sub-optimal. For all the boys-with-toys overlay, the programme\u2019s underlying message is sober and devoid of histrionics. The problem is that it all adds up to less than the sum of its parts. Yes, there is this threat and that threat, and these possibilities, and these loopholes in current defences against them. But despite Kane\u2019s assertions that various things are \u201cterrifying\u201d, there is too much distance between the evidence and the threat to induce much emotion. Whether this is the fault of the show or the fact that most of us are maxed-out, terror-wise, by clearer and more present dangers to factor in a new one is hard to say. Personally, I am at a point where worrying about drone strikes feels like a luxury my mental health can\u2019t afford. But it is on my list now. As soon as a space opens up, I will start. Thank you, Aldo; thank you, Horizon \u2013 I think.",

USA are the No 1 team in the world so people will back them,\u201d Parris says. \u201cUltimately both teams want to win. It\u2019s a massive game, for us and them, and a really exciting time for women\u2019s football. Especially in England \u2013 we\u2019ve come a long way. We\u2019ll be going toe-to-toe with the Americans and we want to win that game. We\u2019ve come here to win this tournament.\u201d</p> <p>Parris will be crucial to that task. Alongside Lucy Bronze, the pair form the most potent threat on England\u2019s right, with Jill Scott orchestrating their movements and combining with the pair to telling effect. They will be up against the left-back Crystal Dunn and the USA\u2019s player of the tournament thus far, on and off the pitch, Megan Rapinoe.</p> <p>Rapinoe and her five-goal compatriot Alex Morgan will need to try to breach the strongest defence in the tournament, with Steph Houghton and Millie Bright at its heart.</p> <p>The England manager has a decision to make in midfield, the usually assured Kiera Walsh has looking shaky shielding the defence. In America, Neville tried Bronze alongside her for the strength she offers though it is unlikely he will pull her away from the battle with Rapinoe. There is, though, the option of the more steely Jade Moore.</p> <p>In the buildup to this World Cup much was made of the 20th anniversary of the \u201c99ers\u201d, the USA World Cup-winning team who took the success of their victorious 1991 side to the next level and catapulted women\u2019s football into the mainstream. The 2019 USA shirts are a nod to the historic victory. Should England win then they have a chance to similarly write their names in history.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to respect America for respecting the pioneers of the game,\u201d Parris says. \u201cThat\u2019s important.

      "bodyText": "Ever the analyst, the defender Leah Williamson corrected Phil Neville when he said England want to win the World Cup, telling him that, yes, they wanted to win but, more than that, they wanted to be \u201cbadass women\u201d in the process. On Tuesday, though, England face the \u201cbaddest\u201d women footballers around, a USA team dripping with talent, swagger and a confidence that verges on arrogance. With their operations team sniffing around the England team hotel, scouting out digs for the final, there is an expectation they will win. With the USA there always is. It is a winning mindset that Neville has tried to emulate and drill into his players. He says he can feel it, see it in their eyes, that the Lionesses are ready to win. \u201cWhat I understand [badass women] to mean is, you don\u2019t just want to come to a World Cup, make an impact but then be forgotten,\u201d says England\u2019s Nikita Parris. \u201cMia Hamm, and those girls, have made an imprint on football for the rest of history. \u201cThat\u2019s what Leah is talking about. She\u2019s talking about making history. Giving young girls the chance to not only reach the top but make sure they make their mark.\u201d The winger, who will be playing on her new home turf having just signed for Lyon, believes England can knock the USA off their perch. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we think we can\u2019t be \u2018badder\u2019 than them when we went to the SheBelieves and we won it? We went toe-to-toe with them, you know? We have beaten the Americans in the past. We beat them 1-0 under Mark Sampson. Why shouldn\u2019t we think we can beat them? Why do we have to come to this tournament semi-final and think: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s America?\u2019 \u201cNobody fears America. Nobody fears Germany. Nobody fears England. They know that on the day, no matter who you are, if you perform and get the best out of each and every player on the field of play, you\u2019ll win the game. I don\u2019t fear America and I don\u2019t think my teammates do.\u201d A SheBelieves Cup is all well and good, an exhilarating 2-2 draw with USA in that friendly competition the highlight, but World Cup football is a different beast. USA\u2019s 13-0 defeat of Thailand in their opening game gave them momentum but hard-fought 2-1 wins over Spain and France in the knockout stages have cut through the air of infallibility. \u201cWe\u2019ll know tomorrow how we\u2019ve progressed as a team. USA are the No 1 team in the world so people will back them,\u201d Parris says. \u201cUltimately both teams want to win. It\u2019s a massive game, for us and them, and a really exciting time for women\u2019s football. Especially in England \u2013 we\u2019ve come a long way. We\u2019ll be going toe-to-toe with the Americans and we want to win that game. We\u2019ve come here to win this tournament.\u201d Parris will be crucial to that task. Alongside Lucy Bronze, the pair form the most potent threat on England\u2019s right, with Jill Scott orchestrating their movements and combining with the pair to telling effect. They will be up against the left-back Crystal Dunn and the USA\u2019s player of the tournament thus far, on and off the pitch, Megan Rapinoe. Rapinoe and her five-goal compatriot Alex Morgan will need to try to breach the strongest defence in the tournament, with Steph Houghton and Millie Bright at its heart. The England manager has a decision to make in midfield, the usually assured Kiera Walsh has looking shaky shielding the defence. In America, Neville tried Bronze alongside her for the strength she offers though it is unlikely he will pull her away from the battle with Rapinoe. There is, though, the option of the more steely Jade Moore. In the buildup to this World Cup much was made of the 20th anniversary of the \u201c99ers\u201d, the USA World Cup-winning team who took the success of their victorious 1991 side to the next level and catapulted women\u2019s football into the mainstream. The 2019 USA shirts are a nod to the historic victory. Should England win then they have a chance to similarly write their names in history. \u201cYou have to respect America for respecting the pioneers of the game,\u201d Parris says. \u201cThat\u2019s important. We do that a lot in our game in England. What they\u2019ve done for women\u2019s football across the world is massive. It\u2019s brought about a way in [which] people now respect the game. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to respect what people in the past have done to allow us to be in this moment. I\u2019m so grateful for people like Casey Stoney, Fara Williams, Alex Scott, Faye White \u2026 I could reel them all off because they\u2019ve brought the game into a position now where we\u2019ve really got something to fight for.\u201d Parris\u2019s fight, though, is seemingly in the genes. Her sister Natasha Jonas was the first British woman to box at the Olympics, in 2012. Jonas was also a promising footballer but when injury ended her dream she was forced to find another path to being an elite athlete. \u201cThe biggest thing I got from my sister\u2019s career was never to give up,\u201d she says. \u201cShe had so many ups and downs throughout her career. Injuries and big injuries \u2013 ACLs. And she never gave up, she always came back fighting. \u201cI\u2019m proud to say that my sister was the first female boxer in the Olympics. That\u2019s history. She made her mark. And that\u2019s what you want to do in any sport. \u201cHer and Jill Scott always said the same: never get too high and never get too low.

Edmund saved with a smash at the net that was a cross between a winning point and a statement of intent.

Just as the entranced gathering leaned forward for what they surely imagined would be the final act to the drama, Munar called for the trainer to inspect what looked like a paper cut on the middle finger of his right hand.</p> <p>Serving for a place in the second round, Edmund steeled himself to the task again, racing to two match points, untroubled behind some irresistible groundstrokes. An ace \u2013 his fourth of the match \u2013 did the job, and a clearly relieved Edmund raised his fist and smiled to the crowd.</p> <p>\u201cIt was good for him to show [his team] how much he does want it, if they didn\u2019t know it already,\u201d John McEnroe observed. \u201cHe\u2019s one ofthose likeable guys, hard worker, disciplined and dealing with a knee problem.

Edmund did what he had to and Munar provided some classy opposition, especially after going 0-4 and 1-5 down in the third set, where he then made the British player work hard all the way to the line. \u201cIt was a really nice surprise on day one to see my name on the schedule for Centre Court,\u201d Edmund said. \u201cWatching it is very cool but getting a chance to play on it is special.\u201d As for Verdasco, who beat the Polish qualifier Kamil Majchrzak 6-4, 6-4, 6-4, Edmund said, \u201cBoth times against him have been three sets [the most recent at the Rome Masters this year]. I have to reflect and see what I can do better. Both [Munar and Verdasco] are completely different, righty, lefty. But both are very aggressive.\u201d The conclusion to an otherwise flawless display by Edmund was a little messy. Munar, serving to stay in the championship from two sets and 1-5 down, saved match point with a smash from mid-court. He held serve and did well to stay calm while trying to rescue what was obvious to everyone but himself a lost cause. Edmund looked in control of his game and his emotions as he stepped up to serve out the match but Munar battled his way to break point. Edmund saved with a smash at the net that was a cross between a winning point and a statement of intent. The Spaniard got another look with an adventurous raid on the net \u2013 then broke back and held. Having surrendered a chunk of a lead that looked unassailable, Edmund had to regain his composure, trust in his game and finish the job. Just as the entranced gathering leaned forward for what they surely imagined would be the final act to the drama, Munar called for the trainer to inspect what looked like a paper cut on the middle finger of his right hand. Serving for a place in the second round, Edmund steeled himself to the task again, racing to two match points, untroubled behind some irresistible groundstrokes. An ace \u2013 his fourth of the match \u2013 did the job, and a clearly relieved Edmund raised his fist and smiled to the crowd. \u201cIt was good for him to show [his team] how much he does want it, if they didn\u2019t know it already,\u201d John McEnroe observed. \u201cHe\u2019s one ofthose likeable guys, hard worker, disciplined and dealing with a knee problem. But of course the better you get, the more pressure you put on yourself.\u201d The privilege of pressure, Djokovic called it. Everyone wants it. Not everyone handles it.",

In <a href=\"http://blog.whatscotlandthinks.org/2019/07/could-brexit-yet-undermine-the-future-of-the-british-state/\">a blog for the What Scotland Thinks website</a>, <strong>Prof Sir John Curtice,</strong> the leading psephologist, looks at the recent polling on Scottish independence and concludes that support for independence is rising because remain voters are becoming more nationalist. He explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In recent polls support for yes has on average been running at some four points above where it stood in the second half of last year among remain voters (and, indeed, those who did not vote in 2016). In contrast, there is no sign of any increase in support for yes among those who voted no \u2013 indeed, if anything, the opposite is the case.</p> <p>In short, not only have recent polls suggested that there has been something of an increase in support for independence in recent months, but also that this rise has occurred entirely among those who voted remain (and those who did not vote in 2016). It would seem that the Brexit impasse has motivated some remain supporters in recent months to re-evaluate their attitudes towards the union. If so, then we do not need to rely on the answers to hypothetical polling questions to conclude that the outcome of the Brexit process could potentially change the balance of support for independence versus staying in the union \u2013 and so determine the future of the British state.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here is the chart with the figures showing that switching remain voter explain the rise in support for independence.</p> <p>That\u2019s all from me for tonight.

When he was standing as Tory leadership candidate himself, he criticised Boris Johnson for being anti-business (saying <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/tory-leadership-matt-hancock-business-boris-johnson/\">\u201cI say fuck \u2018fuck business\u2019\u201d</a> - one of the more memorable lines of the contest) and he said that proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit, which Johnson is reserving as an option, would be<a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/matt-hancock-suspending-parliament-would-be-an-insult-to-dday-veterans-a4163511.html\"> an insult to D-day veterans.</a> But now he is a cheerleader for the Johnson campaign, and he had to explain why. Here are the key points. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Hancock claimed that there was now now realistic chance of Johnson needing to prorogue parliament to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit. </strong>When asked by <strong>John Humphrys</strong> about his comment about this being an insult to war veterans, Hancock said a subsequent vote in the Commons, <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/mps-fail-in-bid-to-seize-control-of-parliament-to-block-no-deal-brexit_uk_5d00e86ce4b0e7e781705b12\">which saw the government comfortably defeating an opposition attempt to let MPs take control for parliamentary timetable,</a> showed that the situation had changed. Hancock said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I just don\u2019t think that [proroguing parliament] is where this is going to end up ...</p> <p>I made the argument that [earlier in the leadership contest[ parliament would stop a no-deal Brexit. But during the leadership contest we had a vote in parliament. And I expected that vote to be to carry on the government to be defeated. It was a vote on whether we made parliamentary time to stop no-deal. Actually, it turned out that the government carried that vote by 11. And it is absolutely clear that the European election results have fundamentally changed the politics of this in Westminster too. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Hancock dismissed a question about why he was now backing Johnson given what he had said about business by replying: \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to look forward in life, you\u2019ve got to look forward, John.\u201d </strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said that he was backing Johnson because he was \u201cbest placed to deliver Brexit\u201d.</strong> Humphrys started the interview by adopting<a href=\"https://www.irishnews.com/magazine/entertainment/2017/04/18/news/mrs-merton-s-brazen-question-to-debbie-mcgee-voted-best-one-liner-999791/\"> the famous line to Debbie McGee</a> and asking what was it about the runaway favourite in the contest, Boris Johnson, that made Hancock want to support him. Hancock began his reply by saying:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, and the reason that I\u2019m backing Boris Johnson is because I think he\u2019s best placed to deliver Brexit, and then to unite the country, and the storey we\u2019re talking about this morning uniting the country on a path plan of higher pay not higher taxes is exactly the sort of thing that I want to see. </p> </blockquote> <p>That confirmed this line in <strong>Tim Shipman</strong>\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-recruits-team-of-rivals-to-prepare-for-first-100-days-as-prime-minister-lnds5fwhs\"> Sunday Times account yesterday (paywall) </a>about the rigid message discipline being imposed by the Johnson team. Shipman wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On Tuesday Mark Fullbrook, the business partner of Johnson\u2019s election guru Sir Lynton Crosby, was drafted in to take over the campaign, a move that was long planned but which contributed to a sense of panic.</p> <p>Fullbrook put MPs\u2019 noses out of joint at a presentation in parliament\u2019s Thatcher Room that evening when he outlined campaign messaging. One MP present said Fullbrook shot down Bob Seely, the MP for the Isle of Wight, \u201clike a heckler\u201d when he tried to ask a question, and mocked veteran Eurosceptic Sir Bernard Jenkin for yawning. Seely walked out.</p> <p>\u201cThe way he did it didn\u2019t go down well with colleagues,\u201d the MP said. \u201cThere are three messages: \u2018Boris will deliver Brexit on October 31; Boris will reunite the party and the country; and Boris will beat Jeremy Corbyn.\u2019 That\u2019s all we are allowed to say.\u201d These messages had been a feature of the campaign for weeks, but Fullbrook made clear they would now be rigidly enforced.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is some comment on the interview from journalists.</p> <p>From Sky\u2019s <strong>Rob Powell</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/robpowellnews/status/1145594568026525696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So in his own Brexit plan he was touting just weeks ago, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattHancock?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MattHancock</a> said no deal is not a policy available to next PM and any candidate saying they will secure changes to the Withdrawal Agreement is not being straight.

Even though Labour\u2019s manifesto had details of how it would raise money for these commitments, the jibe was intended to show that Labour\u2019s commitment to fiscal rigour was bogus, and that the party just expected to conjure money out of thin air.</p> <p>That was two years ago. Now the Conservative party is holding a leadership contest and the candidates seem to have discovered not just the magic money tree, not just a Heseltine-sized magic money arboretum, but an entire magic money Amazon rain forest. We\u2019ve got two good examples this morning.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Jeremy Hunt, the underdog in the contest, is proposing a \u00a36bn fund to protect farmers and the fishing industry from a no-deal Brexit, as part of a 10-point plan to prepare the UK for possibly leaving the EU at the end of October without an agreement.</strong> He will set out details in a speech this morning and, although he is still stressing that he would prefer to get a Brexit deal with the EU, this seem seems to be further evidence that he is engaged in what <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCHelenaLee/status/1145070156961501184\">the Sunday Times splash headline</a> yesterday called a \u201chard Brexit bidding war\u201d with Boris Johnson. Hunt\u2019s plan also includes setting up a no-deal cabinet task force, establishing a national logistics committee to produce a plan to keep goods moving in the event of no-deal and holding a no-deal budget, which would among other things cut corporation tax to 12.5%. <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14213\">Last week the Institute for Fiscal Studies said this tax would cost \u00a313bn a year. </a>(By comparison, abolishing tuition fees for new students, Labour\u2019s headline spending pledge at the last election, came in with a price tag of just \u00a39.5bn, which Labour costed through tax increases for high earners.) Commenting on his plan, Hunt is due to say in his speech:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you\u2019re a sheep farmer in Shropshire or a fishermen in Peterhead I have a simple message for you. I know you face uncertainty if we have to leave the EU without a deal.</p> <p>I will mitigate the impact of no deal Brexit on you and step in to help smooth those short term difficulties. If we could do it for the bankers in the financial crisis, we can do it for our fisherman, farmers and small businesses now ...</p> <p>I have made it clear that my preference is for us to leave with a new deal. One that removes the backstop and ensures we have a fully independent trade policy. And if the commission engages in good faith I believe this is possible. </p> <p>But Britain deserves a leader with the courage to not just tell the European commission he will walk away. But to show them he is willing and able to do so. </p> <p>Because in the end, without those abilities, without that determination, and without that plan, it is just a wing and a prayer.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/01/public-sector-to-get-fair-pay-rises-under-johnson-says-health-secretary\"><strong>Boris Johnson, the favourite in the contest, has signalled that he would increase public sector pay if he becomes prime minister.</strong></a> But he has not actually announced this himself, and his campaign has not issued a news release. Instead <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, the health secretary who is now one of his leading supporters, has made this comment on Johnson\u2019s behalf in a statement to the Times. Hancock does not give any figures to explain what sort of pay rises might be available to public sector workers under a Johnson premiership, but<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/tory-leadership-race-boris-johnson-to-boost-pay-for-public-sector-staff-vz879qs7w\"> he told the paper (paper):</a></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now that there\u2019s money available, we need to show the public sector some love \u2014 they do a brilliant job for the country. People in the public sector need to be properly rewarded for the brilliant work they do. Higher pay, not higher taxes, means a pay rise for everyone, including in the public sector.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MsHelicat/status/1145442191285850114\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Monday\u2019s TIMES: Johnson to boost pay for public sector staff <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tomorrowspaperstoday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#tomorrowspaperstoday</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FgXP9xrS6u\">pic.twitter.com/FgXP9xrS6u</a></p>&mdash; Helen Miller (@MsHelicat) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MsHelicat/status/1145442191285850114?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 30, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>It is important to stress that this is not the way politicians normally announce policy, and the effect of using proxies to make policy announcements on his behalf is to give Johnson what the Americans call \u201cplausible deniability\u201d; if questioned on this \u201cpromise\u201d in the Commons in six months\u2019 time, perhaps after the public sector pay rise has not materialised, Johnson can always say he never made this commitment himself.</p> <p>Hancock has also been giving interviews this morning. His Today programme one was not his finest hour. More on that soon.</p> <p>When challenged about how they would fund their spending plans, Johnson and Hunt have both pointed out that the Treasury has \u201cheadroom\u201d available for extra spending <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/06/02/philip-hammond-colleagues-tax-cutting-promises-eye-catching/\">(which is true, but only up to a point)</a> and that the country can afford to borrow more (which is also true, but counter to the main thrust of Conservative thinking on the economy for the whole of the last nine years).

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Hunt said German chancellor Angela Merkel told him she is willing to look at a new Brexit deal package (see 8.20pm). The foreign secretary also brought forward the operative Brexit deadline from 31 October to 30 September I\u2019ve had a conversation with Angela Merkel and... (she said) \u2018of course we will look at any proposals made by a new UK prime minister\u2019, because she wants to solve this problem. And providing we\u2019re sensible, and I think the approach that I\u2019ve laid out is a sensible approach and a fair approach, and I think that it\u2019s in Germany\u2019s interests as well. What she has said is she will look at the package and I think she will look at it with an open mind. Having rejected an invitation to take par in the interview, Tory leadership frontrunner Boris Johnson told a\u2019telephone town hall\u2019 phone-in from Tory members that he would increase stop and search powers in a bid to tackle rising knife crime. The leadership frontrunner, Hunt\u2019s predecessor as foreign secretary, also reiterated that only he can deliver Brexit by 31 October after his rival did not include an absolute deadline for withdrawing the UK from the EU in a 10-point plan released on Monday. (see 7.50pm) The pair will visit Northern Ireland on Tuesday where they are set to face further questions from party members about their Brexit plans at a hustings. Hunt has said he believes there is \u201ctechnology there now\u201d to provide a solution, while Johnson has suggested the backstop issue could be solved during the implementation period. The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday evening that allies of Johnson are urging him to shrink the size of the Cabinet by merging government departments. However a campaign source told PA: \u201cThis is absolute nonsense.\u201d The speaker John Bercow refused to allow vote on proposal to halt government spending if the prime minister presses ahead with no-deal (see 4.57pm). The shadow chancellor John McDonnell said that both Johnson and Hunt\u2019s public spending promises prove that austerity was a \u201cpolitical choice\u201d (see 5.32pm). Meanwhile, business leaders said their no-deal pledges were irresponsible. The SNP\u2019s Kirsty Blackman said support for independence in Scotland is growing (see 5.44pm) in remarks supported by the leading psephologist Prof Sir John Curtice who said that support for independence is rising because remain voters are becoming more nationalist (see 7.50pm). That\u2019s all for today, thanks for joining us. After Jeremy Hunt said that German chancellor Angela Merkel had indicated the EU would look at a sensible new proposal put forward by the new prime minister (see 20:02 pm), the foreign secretary asked in a tweet who Conservative members trusted to renegotiate a better Brexit deal. However, it is worth noting that there does not appear to have yet been confirmation from Merkel or her spokesman. Interviewer Beth Rigby also later noted what is potentially the key difference between Hunt and frontrunner Boris Johnson: On a slightly more lighthearted note, when asked to tell a joke, Hunt earlier told Sky News: I was dreading you asking something like that. Well I think in this campaign, the best jokes I\u2019ve probably seen have been on the internet. For the time time in my life actually, the internet has been quite kind to me .. because they think I\u2019m the underdog. They actually ran a campaign to tell Jeremy what his slogan should be for this leadership campaign. So we had #takeapuntonhunt, #jezzasthebezza, and then the one you\u2019re really not going to try and say is #huntymchuntface. He then tweeted in response to a former MP who claimed Johnson had recently asked him the same question twice. Here is the full story on Boris Johnson\u2019s phone-in from Amy Walker. After Philip Hammond tweeted today that no-deal funds would only be \u201cif we leave with an orderly transition\u201d, the chancellor told BBC News that the promises made insofar by leadership contenders Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson were unaffordable without increased borrowing, cuts or taxation rises. The promises that have been made so far greatly exceed the fiscal headroom. So they would either require borrowing to be increased way beyond the government\u2019s cap on borrowing, or they\u2019d require cuts in spending somewhere else, or they require increases in tax somewhere else. Pressed by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg on what he meant by \u201cfiscal headroom\u201d, Hammond said there was not a \u201cpot of money sitting in the Treasury\u201d in preparation in the event of no deal. So at the Spring statement i said that we\u2019d built up fiscal headroom to protect against the costs of a no-deal exit and that that fiscal headroom could be released for additional spending or tax cuts if we have a smooth Brexit with a transition period in an orderly way. But that isn\u2019t a pot of money sitting in the Treasury, it\u2019s actually more borrowing without breaching the government\u2019s borrowing limits. My concern is that this government has built up a reputation for fiscal responsibility and the British people have worked incredibly hard over a decade now to rebuild our public finances and I think it\u2019s very important that we don\u2019t throw that away. Asked whether he believed the candidates were putting what Kuenssberg said was the Conservative party\u2019s reputation for economic competence at risk, Hammond responded: Well whether it\u2019s a leadership competition or a general election, there is always a temptation to sort of get into a bidding war about spending more and cutting taxes. But you can\u2019t do both and if we\u2019re not careful all we end up doing is borrowing more, spending more on interest instead of on our schools and our hospitals and our police and delivering a bigger burden of debt to our children and our grandchildren. I don\u2019t think either of the candidates would want to do that, that is not what the Tory party is about, but we just need to sometimes stop and think about what we\u2019re doing. Though he recognised both Johnson and Hunt were people he was sure would take fiscal discipline and responsibility seriously, while ensuring borrowing does not rise unsustainably, Hammond said: I just think that everyone needs to bare in mind the importance of managing the public finances. Of course everybody wants to see the era of austerity behind us. but in order to be able to release the headroom we have built up we have to get a deal as we leave the EU so we that we do so smoothly. If we don\u2019t get a deal the all of the headroom and more will be needed to support the economy to deal with the consequences of a no-deal exit and the hole that will make in our public finances? I think [Johnson and Hunt] need to be very careful about setting out these ambitions and being clear about the consequences. After Jeremy Hunt elaborated on his plans in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the civil service union criticised the foreign secretary\u2019s suggestion that all August leave could be cancelled for civil servants in some departments if their plans are not \u201con time and on track\u201d. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: For a potential Prime Minister to unilaterally declare that leave for civil servants will be cancelled without consulting them or their union is utterly ludicrous. The government\u2019s handling of Brexit has been shambolic and civil servants have stepped up to the plate on numerous occasions and done their best to prepare for all eventualities. Our members working in job centres and other government departments are not responsible for the mess inflicted on them and the country by the sheer incompetence of ministers. They will not put up with their leave being cancelled. Dave Penman, head of the FDA union that represents senior civil servants, told the Times that Hunt\u2019s plan was \u201cdivorced from reality\u201d. This shows no understanding at all of how the civil service works. Is he suggesting that if a government department is not up to speed then officials who aren\u2019t even working on Brexit will have their leave cancelled? He is spouting macho nonsense that undermines the credibility of his plan and smacks of a teacher deciding to punish the whole class. This is a crisis made in parliament yet he is proposing that it is civil servants that should cancel their holiday. He added that it would be totally unacceptable to cancel civil service leave if parliament went into recess. An anonymous civil servant recently warned in the Guardian that \u201cwe can\u2019t make Boris Johnson\u2019s no-deal fantasy into reality\u201d. Hunt said he felt \u201cdeeply uncomfortable\u201d that his \u201cposh school\u201d education meant his life chances may be better than someone else who did not receive the same schooling. \u201cI went to a posh school, I had a fantastic education, and I was very lucky,\u201d he told Sky News. And I also felt deeply uncomfortable that because I was lucky enough to go to that school I might have better life chances than someone with equal talents, equal ambition, equal energy, who didn\u2019t have the chance to get such a great education. I am incredibly proud of the education reforms that have been championed by Michael Gove under this Conservative government that have improved the quality of state schools so that a number of them are as good as Charterhouse, the school I went to. And I think that\u2019s a fantastic reform, but I still think we have a national blind spot, and that\u2019s why I said I want education to be our social mission. The Guardian\u2019s political correspondent Peter Walker tweets: On the issue of the Irish border backstop, Hunt said he believes there is \u201ctechnology there now\u201d to provide a solution, adding checks can be done away from borders. \u201cMy impression having read many Government documents on this is that it is, I think, overall it is technically possible and it\u2019s a question of creating a negotiating environment where it is also politically acceptable to the EU and to the government in the Republic of Ireland,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why I think if we send the right prime minister we have a chance.\u201d Asked if it was possible before 2030, Hunt replied: \u201cI believe it\u2019s technically possible now.\u201d He went on to say: \u201cIt is imperative that we deliver on the referendum result .. with or without a deal. [However] I think we have to recognise that no deal will be scary to a lot of people.\u201d Citing possible difficulties farmers exporting produce to the EU may encounter, Hunt said there would be a \u00a320m support package for business, for farmers, and for the fishing community to \u201cweather the storm\u201d that a no-deal Brexit could spell. \u201cBut it\u2019s not my first choice,\u201d he added. Tory leadership contender Jeremy Hunt has been speaking to Sky\u2019s Kay Burley in an hour-long interview where he said the German chancellor Angela Merkel has told him she is willing to look at a new Brexit deal package put forward by a new prime minister. \u201cI\u2019ve had a conversation with Angela Merkel and .. she said \u2018Of course we will look at any proposals made by a new UK prime minister\u2019 because she wants to solve this problem,\u201d the foreign secretary told Sky News. \u201cAnd providing we\u2019re sensible, and I think the approach that I\u2019ve laid out is a sensible approach and a fair approach, and I think that it\u2019s in Germany\u2019s interests as well.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat she has said is she will look at the package and I think she will look at it with an open mind.\u201d Hunt then claimed Jeremy Corbyn would be blocked from delivering Brexit by the Labour party, as he warned against an \u201caccidental\u201d general election that would elect the current party of opposition. \u201cWe\u2019re at a very pivotal moment in the Brexit negotiations and we don\u2019t have a majority in Parliament, and if we get this wrong we could end up with an accidental general election that lets in Jeremy Corbyn and we would end up with no Brexit at all because the one thing the Labour Party would not allow him to do is to deliver Brexit,\u201d he said. Shown video footage of protesters clashing with police in Hong Kong, Hunt said his \u201cheart goes out\u201d to the demonstrators. When I look at those situations that we\u2019ve just seen, and those terrible scenes in Hong Kong, my heart goes out to people who do have to fight for their freedoms and who are worried they could lose very, very precious way of life. I don\u2019t support violence in any circumstances but I understand their worries about changes that are happening in Hong Kong. On Iran, Hunt said: \u201cIt is one of the biggest worries on my mind at the moment - if you look around the world you say \u2018which is the part of the world where we could have an unexpected war, a conflict which draws big powers in and becomes much, much more significant than might at first seem?\u2019 It is here.\u201d In a press release issued just before the phone-in, the \u2018Back Boris\u2019 campaign said Jeremy Hunt had today shown he was \u201cnot serious\u201d about a no deal Brexit given that his 10-point plan for Brexit did not include an absolute deadline for delivering it. The \u2018Back Boris\u2019 campaign said: It is impossible to prepare for a no deal without a fixed deadline for Brexit. Doing so would risk repeating the disaster of the two delays we have already had, the wasted money that has already gone into no deal preparation and the uncertainty that businesses and citizens have had to endure. Only Boris Johnson is committed to leaving the EU by 31stOctober. By delaying making a decision about no deal preparation, Jeremy Hunt is failing to provide the certainty that our businesses deserve and finally deliver on the result of the referendum once and for all. Boris Johnson said: What you can\u2019t do is to keep saying that we\u2019re going to have a deadline of October 31stand then say it\u2019s actually not really a deadline at all and we can delay beyond October 31st. Look at what happened on March 29th, a huge amount of work was done, the country did get ready and then we failed to get out. We failed to get out on April 8th. And a lot of the preparations then sagged back down again. What is vital now is that we commit to coming out on October 31st- we mean it, we get ready for a \u2018No Deal\u2019 outcome and we prepare. I just say to people, look this is a great country, we\u2019ve spent a long time now, three years, waiting to do this. Preparations were already been made to come out on March 29thand we were very nearly there. Those were allowed to sag back again as a result of not coming out and that was a mistake. So it\u2019s very important to have a hard deadline, to be absolutely clear about what we\u2019re doing and to come out on October 31st\u2019. Responding to a call from a \u201cpassionate Brexiteer\u201d who said it was the Remain side who had to compromise \u201cbecause they lost\u201d and respect the result of the referendum, Johnson said his primary duty was to \u201cdeliver on the verdict and the mandate of the people\u201d. \u201cTo have another referendum before we have done that would be peculiar, wrong and divisive,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople would think there was some sort of establishment conspiracy against them.\u201d A Polish national asked how Europeans can sleep peacefully, and Johnson said he wanted to pass immediately into law a provision for giving EU nationals automatic right to remain, while recognising it was crucial people living in the UK before the cut-off date get indefinite leave to remain. The UK must protect the 3.2m European nationals living and working in the country, he said. \u201cThey have done huge amount of good, including Polish community .. Polish pilots played a pivotal role in Battle of Britain, we owe them an incalculable debt.\u201d Johnson said \u201cuncontrolled immigration helps depress the lower end of wages\u201d, and the UK needs an Australian-style points based system to provide the country with the right skills, from software manufacturers to fruit pickers. He added that he also thought he found it odd when people complained about rises in wages. \u201c Lot of people live on modest incomes,\u201d he said. \u201cIts good if wages and productivity increases, which it generally does.\u201d The leadership frontrunner went on to say that he would prioritise home ownership for young people by building on brown field sites to increase supply, while expressing support for bringing the student loan interest rate down from the current level of more than 6%. Asked what practical plans Johnson has to \u201cget people together after Brexit\u201d, the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip asked whether the caller was referring to within the Tories or the country at large. \u201cI\u2019m the candidate who has the support of the most Remainers and leavers together, half the party, dozens on each side,\u201d he said, citing how an alliance is already forming and that he has been campaigning with Bob Neil and Jo Johnson today, who both opposed Brexit. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve got it done, actually you\u2019ll find people naturally become much less [irated] by the whole issue, once we have Brexit delivered, a lot of the stress with come out,\u201d he said. \u201c[There has been] No clarity of direction, which has fermented unrest on both sides.\u201d A caller said that Jeremy Hunt would defend the union at all costs, and asked why Johnson was putting it in danger. The former foreign secretary said that delaying Brexit \u201ckicks the can down the road\u201d and that Brexit could in fact entrench the union. \u201cWhat are the [Scot Nats] going to say about their plan to join the EU once we\u2019ve left? \u201c he said. \u201cAre they really going to say Brussels should take control of Scottish fisheries? This is a fantastic opportunity to get Brexit done and spike the guns of the SNP He proposed that the next prime minister should be minister for the union, adding that the United Kingdom is \u201cfar more together than the sum of our parts\u201d. On how to win the next general election, Johnson said his party must \u201cget back to basic message of conservatism\u201d which he lauded as a moral force and correct analysis of the human, society and nature. He called on the Conservative party to \u201clook after the interests\u201d of entrepreneurs in order to fund public services. \u201cCorbyn only understands one side,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe marches solely on the left.\u201d He added that the Labour leader \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand the need to have a strong dynamic economy, which supports the forces of the free market economy. Johnson claimed the Tories are \u201cstreets ahead of Labour\u201d on the environment, but that it needs to be the party which speaks to young people on the issue. He cited goals to expand wind turbines, increase use of electric vehicles and cracking down on plastic. Conservative party voters have been asking Boris Johnson a wide variety of questions during a phone-in this evening. The leadership frontrunner was characteristically vague about the exact policies he would pursue to achieve his stated aims, which seemed to focus on law and order, adult social care and infrastructure. Johnson said police should be given the \u201cpolitical cover and support\u201d they need to perform stop and search efforts in a bid to tackle rising knife crime in the UK. In response to a question from a veteran who said former service people were treated \u201cappallingly\u201d after leaving the military, having their mental health concerns ignored, Johnson recognised more must be done to help veterans when they face mental health issues. \u201cWe need wraparound care for homeless veterans,\u201d he said, adding that unfair prosecutions of people who have served their country loyally must be stopped. The former Mayor of London criticised how the government has \u201ckicked the white paper on social care down the road\u201d, saying \u201cno-one should be kicked out of their own home to pay for care\u201d. The precise details of how Johnson would achieve \u201csomething politically possible\u201d remain unclear, and he called for a national consensus \u201cto try to crack this one\u201d. The SNP\u2019s Kirsty Blackman says support for independence in Scotland is growing. (See 5.44pm.) She\u2019s right. In a blog for the What Scotland Thinks website, Prof Sir John Curtice, the leading psephologist, looks at the recent polling on Scottish independence and concludes that support for independence is rising because remain voters are becoming more nationalist. He explains: In recent polls support for yes has on average been running at some four points above where it stood in the second half of last year among remain voters (and, indeed, those who did not vote in 2016). In contrast, there is no sign of any increase in support for yes among those who voted no \u2013 indeed, if anything, the opposite is the case. In short, not only have recent polls suggested that there has been something of an increase in support for independence in recent months, but also that this rise has occurred entirely among those who voted remain (and those who did not vote in 2016). It would seem that the Brexit impasse has motivated some remain supporters in recent months to re-evaluate their attitudes towards the union. If so, then we do not need to rely on the answers to hypothetical polling questions to conclude that the outcome of the Brexit process could potentially change the balance of support for independence versus staying in the union \u2013 and so determine the future of the British state. And here is the chart with the figures showing that switching remain voter explain the rise in support for independence. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Mattha Busby is taking over now. Here is the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush on the Speaker\u2019s decision on the Beckett/Grieve amendment. (See 4.57pm.) Kirsty Blackman, the SNP\u2019s deputy leader at Westminster, has described Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt as the \u201cThelma and Louise of Brexit\u201d. She explained: The two men vying to be prime minister are locked in a no-deal Brexit bidding war to try and win over the Tory faithful \u2013 and it is ordinary people who are set to pay the price. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have become the Thelma and Louise of Brexit \u2013 it beggars belief that both are prepared to drive the UK economy off a Brexit cliff-edge, regardless of the catastrophic consequences for the economy and people\u2019s jobs. Even Chancellor Philip Hammond admits that Tory plans for a no-deal Brexit would waste billions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money, plugging the huge hole it would create in public finances \u2013 and leaving the UK poorer and worse off as a result. It\u2019s no wonder that support for independence in Scotland is growing, with polls showing a majority want a fresh independence referendum. People in Scotland deserve the choice of a better future than the Brexit Britain on offer from Westminster. And John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has released a statement saying that the fact that Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are proposing to increase public spending by so much shows austerity was a political choice. He said: The spending promises being thrown around by both Johnson and Hunt once again prove that austerity was a political choice for the Conservatives and not an economic necessity. With the two Tory candidates trying to outdo each other on who is more likely to pursue a no-deal Brexit, and who can make the largest and most reckless spending commitments, both Johnson and Hunt are putting our economy at risk and can\u2019t be trusted to follow through on their promises to invest. Here is Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, on the Jeremy Hunt speech. Here is some comment on the Speaker\u2019s ruling on the Beckett/Grieve amendment. (See 4.57pm.) From the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes From Nikki da Costa, a former head of legislative affairs for Theresa May in Downing Street From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn The earlier attempt was this one. MPs are just beginning the two-day debate on the estimates (Commons terminology for government spending plans). The Labour MP Margaret Beckett and the Conservative Dominic Grieve have tabled amendments that would have turned off government spending in some departments in the event of the new PM trying to implement a no-deal Brexit without the approval of parliament, but John Bercow, the Speaker, has just announced that he will not call them - ie, he will not put them to a vote. No votes were expected tonight anyway. The two-day estimates debate continues tomorrow, when voting will take place at 7pm. Lord Young of Cookham, the former cabinet minister George Young who is now a government whip in the Lords, told peers this afternoon he was viewing \u201cwith alarm\u201d the promises made by Tory leadership candidates. In response to a question about the UK Statistics Authority, and a suggestion from a Labour peer that it should investigate the claims made by Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, Young said: As a former Treasury minister I view with alarm the weeks that are passing under the contest that is under way with increasingly generous commitments being made out of the headroom which I think only lasts for one year. I hope that in due course there will be costings for all these commitments so members of my party, who are choosing which is the most responsible leader, can see which one has the most credible economic policy. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart. In the Commons Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, is raising a point of order. Jeremy Corbyn is sitting beside him. Trickett says Corbyn\u2019s fitness is \u201clegendary\u201d. He asks John Bercow, the Speaker, if any minister is planning to make a statement about a report in the Times (paywall) on Saturday saying: \u201cSenior civil servants have become increasingly concerned about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s health and warned that he may be forced to stand down as Labour leader because he is not up to the job \u2018physically or mentally\u2019.\u201d Trickett says for civil servants to be briefing against the leader of the opposition like this would be undemocratic and unconstitutional. Bercow says he has not been told about any statement but he says the civil service should be neutral. Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, who is on the front bench because DWP questions has just ended, says the government has complete confidence in the fairness of the civil service. She says Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, will be writing Corbyn about this matter. Momentum is vowing to flood Boris Johnson\u2019s west London constituency with hundreds of activists in a bid to unseat the Tory leadership front runner at the next general election, the Press Association reports. The pro-Corbyn organisation is planning a \u201cmass canvassing event\u201d in Uxbridge and South Ruislip ahead of the announcement on July 23 of the Conservative leadership race. It says it will follow up with further \u201cunseat\u201d events over the next year, as well as a social media operation targeting swing voters in the constituency. The move reflects a belief that Johnson - who saw his majority cut by more than half at the 2017 general election to 5,034 - could be vulnerable the next time the country goes to the polls. Yesterday the Sunday Times splashed on a story about how Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson are involved in a \u201chard Brexit bidding war\u201d and in his speech this morning Hunt effectively tried to use two manoeuvres to outflank Johnson on Brexit. Until now Johnson has always been seen as being tougher on Brexit because: a) he is committed to taking the UK out of the EU by 31 October, whereas Hunt would led that deadline slip by a few weeks; and b) he is willing to contemplate proroguing parliament to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit, which Hunt won\u2019t countenance. But today Hunt came up with two Brexiter virility USPs of his own. Hunt brought forward the operative Brexit deadline, from 31 October to 30 September. Both Hunt and Johnson are saying that, unless the EU agrees to compromise on the backstop, they will trigger a no-deal Brexit. Johnson has said the UK will leave without a deal on 31 October if necessary. But Hunt is saying the final point for the EU to effectively signal that a deal is doable is 30 September. He explained in his speech: Following the vote for the new plan in the House of Commons I will then allow 3 weeks for negotiations with the EU. As prime minister I will make a judgement on 30th September as to whether there is a realistic chance of a new deal being agreed that can pass the House of Commons. If my judgement - and the judgement of my cabinet - is that there is a deal to be done I will seek to conclude the negotiations and pass a new meaningful vote and any necessary legislation in the House of Commons before the end of October. If my judgement is that there is no deal to be done I will immediately cease all discussions with the European Union and focus the whole country\u2019s attention on no deal preparations. Hunt said that he would start his premiership on the assumption that a no-deal Brexit was the most likely outcome. He said: So from the start of my premiership, So I will work on the basis we are leaving on 31st October without a deal unless the commission changes its position. This is a concession to Brexiters, some of whom have been arguing for some time that no-deal should be the government\u2019s central planning assumption. With this line Hunt also differentiates himself from Johnson, who is claiming (implausibly) that the chances of a no-deal Brexit under her premiership would be a million to one. You can read the full text of Hunt\u2019s speech here. It includes the full details of his 10-point plan for Brexit. Of those 10 points, six of them are not especially new, because they are essentially rebadged descriptions of things that are happening, or would happen, anyway: ramping up no-deal planning; a cabinet task force; engaging with EU leaders; a committee to look at no-deal logistics; carrying on with the government\u2019s no-deal tariff policy; and financing work on alternative customs solutions. But four of his proposals were significant. 1) Hunt said a new Brexit negotiating team (see 11.22am) would produce a new Brexit plan for publication at the end of August. But he did not say anything about the Sunday Times report saying his team would include Stephen Harper, the former Canadian PM. 2) He gave details of his no-deal budget (see 11.26am), which he said he would introduce even if there were a deal. 3) He proposed a \u00a36bn no-deal bail-out for farmers and the fishing industry. (See 9.20am.) 4) He set 30 September as a deadline for when the EU would have to decide whether or not to compromise. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has been working overtime recently trying to ground the Tory leadership election promises in economic reality. Paul Johnson, its director, was on the World at One a few minutes ago with some comments on Jeremy Hunt\u2019s Brexit speech. Here are the main points. Johnson implied that the Boris Johnson campaign \u201cpledge\u201d this morning on public sector pay (see 9.20am) was meaningless because the public sector pay freeze was ending anyway. He said: In the normal run of things, supposing we get a deal in October, austerity can come to an end because there is in the order of \u00a315bn a year or so more that can be spent whilst keeping to normal sorts of fiscal rules about keeping the debt falling. The problem is, of course, if we don\u2019t get a deal, if we go out with a no-deal type Brexit, then the economy will grow less quickly, we will lose that fiscal headroom and there certainly won\u2019t be scope in the long run for spending increases and tax cuts, although you might need to do something in the short run to cushion the economy from the immediate shock. The Johnson camp got Matt Hancock to promise \u201ca pay rise for everyone\u201d in the Times this morning, but Johnson has not been willing to make that commitment himself in public. (See 12.43pm.) Paul Johnson said that Boris Johnson and Hunt were both misleading people by implying that the Treasury\u2019s Brexit \u2018war chest\u2019 would fund their spending commitments. And although Johnson and Hunt were both acknowledging they might borrow more, they were not saying how much, he said. Paul Johnson said Hunt\u2019s claim in his speech this morning that the UK spent just over \u00a31tr bailing out the banks after the financial crisis was not true. He said: It is simply not true that in any real sense we spent \u00a31tr bailing out the banks in the same way that he\u2019s referring to potentially finding \u00a36bn for the farmers and fishermen. He also said the financial crash was not something that the government has chosen as an outcome. He suggested that Hunt\u2019s proposed \u00a36bn bail-out fund for farmers and the fishing industry (see 9.20am) would not address the real problems caused by a no-deal Brexit. He said: Farming and fishing are tiny parts of the economy. It is actually manufacturing and services who are likely to suffer particularly badly, not as a result of tariffs - we obsess about tariffs - it\u2019s the non-tariff barriers ... the matching the regulations in other countries ... which potentially have really significant effects on things like the cars and the textile industries. Dan Dalton, who was a Conservative MEP until he lost his seat in the Euro elections this spring, has said that he is now backing Jeremy Hunt having originally started as a Boris Johnson supporter. He said: All Conservatives agree that we have to deliver Brexit before the next general election, but to actually do it will need considerable skill, compromise and flexibility. Of the two candidates in front of us, I have gradually come to the conclusion that Jeremy Hunt is the one more likely to do that. I do not say that lightly. I started this campaign as a Boris Johnson supporter, and he has many qualities, but having worked in Brussels throughout the Brexit negotiations, I just do not see how his strategy can work, whereas Jeremy Hunt\u2019s might. Yesterday the Observer published a report by Toby Helm based on a vox pop of Conservative party members who attended the hustings at Exeter. Toby picked up some evidence of swing towards Hunt. Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC\u2019s political editor, says the BBC is hearing people saying the same thing. It is important to stress, though, the Conservative membership surveys suggest Johnson remains the overwhelming favourite. It is perfectly possible for both propositions to be true; that Hunt is gaining support, but that Johnson is still on course to win. Make UK, the trade body representing the manufacturing industry has said the competition between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt to out hard-Brexit each other with \u201cno deal\u201d pledges is the \u201cheight of irresponsibility\u201d with \u201czero understanding\u201d of the consequences. It made its remarks after manufacturers suffered the sharpest fall in activity in more than six years last month indicating signs of economic weakness. Seamus Nevin, chief economist at the organisation, said the latest purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) data showed that the decline in manufacturing activity in May was not just a one-off linked to the aftermath of Brexit stockpiling in March and the stoppages of some car manufacturing in April. He said: Today\u2019s data proves that May\u2019s plunge below the 50-threshold was not just a one-off with UK manufacturing activity collapsing to its lowest level in six and a half years. Businesses are cutting back on both day-to-day and capital spending with the contraction in output a reflection of growing Brexit uncertainty and, worsening global trade winds. Ominously, the PMI\u2019s output measure dropped to 47.2 from 50.3 in May, the biggest contraction in a single month since October 2012. Firms are reporting that export demand is falling month-on-month as customers around the world are losing confidence in the future of the UK market. Looking ahead the picture shows little sign of improvement with signs of weakness now spreading across the eurozone. Given this outlook, increasing competition to see who can race to the bottom and act tough on \u2018no deal\u2019 is the height of irresponsibility with zero understanding of the consequences. Not everyone at the Polhill garden centre in Kent was pleased to see Boris Johnson, the Press Association\u2019s Lewis Pennock reports. On a visit to a garden centre in Kent this morning Boris Johnson was asked if could confirm that he would increase public sector pay, as his proxy Matt Hancock has told the Times he would. (See 9.20m.) Johnson said he thought public sector workers needed \u201cdecent pay\u201d but, in response to a question from the BBC, refused to guarantee above-inflation pay rises. He said: I certainly think that you need to have decent pay in the public sector, absolutely. When pressed again on this, he said: I used to run large public sector organisations in London. I was very proud of what we did. And it\u2019s very, very important when you\u2019re in charge of a great public service, whether it\u2019s the police or transport or local government, you\u2019ve got to make sure that you understand their cares and their needs. And the only way to get the reform that you sometimes need in public services is to be their champion and their support. This echoes the line Johnson used at a hustings on Thursday night, when talking about public services, about how: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to love up the people that you lead.\u201d Here are the main points from Jeremy Hunt\u2019s Q&amp;A on his speech. I will post more on the speech itself soon. Hunt dismissed Boris Johnson, his rival for the Tory leadership, as a \u201cshowman\u201d. Asked if he had the charisma to be prime minister, he replied: When I talk to people running their own businesses, to farmers, to shopkeepers, to people on the high street who are worried about the situation we are in now, they don\u2019t want a showman, they don\u2019t want to be entertained, they want a prime minister who is going to lead us out of this crisis. He challenged Johnson to debate with him on Sky News tonight. He dismissed claims that his spending pledges showed he was abandoning the Conservatives\u2019 reputation for fiscal responsibility. When this was put to him, he replied: The only reason I was able to negotiate that extra money was because we took those painful decisions, we put the economy back on its feet. And so we will never throw that fiscal responsibility away. It is essential to our prosperity. He also said proposing to spend more in response to an economic shock was sound economics. My response to an economic shock is the response that chancellors from all parties have made over the years, which is to allow some loosening in the system to support businesses that are most directly affected. What [these plans] do is allow businesses the time and the breathing space to change their business models and develop their business models so that they can survive. He rejected suggestions from Philip Hammond, the chancellor, that his plans for a no-deal Brexit involve the Treasury spending money it does not have. In a tweet this morning, Hammond said the \u201cfiscal headroom\u201d set aside by the Treasury was there to make up for the loss of revenue there would be to the exchequer from no-deal. Hammond did not mention Hunt by name, but the timing of his tweet, and its content, suggest it was directed at Hunt as well at Johnson. But when this was put to Hunt, he claimed the plans he announced today did not amount to spending the Treasury money twice. Hunt said: We have build up headroom, around \u00a326bn of headroom, which makes it possible to make the commitments that I\u2019m making today whilst still sticking to our plans to reduce the deficit and reduce the national debt as a proportion of GDP. Hunt accepted that some of his spending plans would have to be postponed in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He said: I think what Philip Hammond was talking about was the headroom that he has built up, and is jealously guarding at the moment, is headroom that is there to deal with the eventuality of a no-deal Brexit. So I was very explicit yesterday that some of my other spending plans, more money for education, for example, things I passionately want to do, they will take longer to do in a no-deal situation because our immediate priority is going to be to support businesses that are directly affected by a dramatic change in our economic circumstances. Q: What would your message to Boris Johnson be? Hunt says Johnson is a \u201cgreat guy\u201d and very talented. He says he has set out his plan. He says Johnson should agree a debate with him, so they can explain to Tories their respective plans. He says Sky News is willing to host a debate tonight. \u201cIt is time for some MoJo from BoJo,\u201d he says. And that\u2019s it. I will post a summary soon. Q: Do you have the character and charisma to be PM? Hunt says, when he talks to people, they do not want a showman. They wants someone who can lead us out of this crisis. Q: You said recently that a no-deal Brexit would be political suicide. Hunt says he said it would be political suicide to go into a general election promising no-deal. Q: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, says if there is a no-deal Brexit, the money you plan to spend won\u2019t be available. And do you accept that no-deal Brexit will lead to job losses? Hunt says he knows what it is like to have to lay off staff. He says he wants to support businesses in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Referring to Hammond\u2019s comment, he says he admits that, if there is no-deal, then there are some spending decisions he will have to postpone. Q: In the financial crisis you argued for lower public spending. Now you are arguing for more. Aren\u2019t you sounding like Comrade Corbyn? Hunt claims Labour was to blame for the financial crisis. He says, when you face a financial crisis, it is responsible to spend money. He says chancellors from all parties have loosened spending in the face of an economic shock. Q: Do you accept you are now abandoning the Tories\u2019 reputation for fiscal responsibility? Hunt says he was part of a cabinet that took \u201cpainful\u2019 decisions on budgets. He knows what it is like to have to make cuts. The NHS is only able to get extra money now because of decisions taken earlier. He says he will never throw away the Tories\u2019 reputation for fiscal responsibility. Q: Why do you think you can get a deal in three weeks? No one believes that. Hunt says the EU will not be seeing his ideas for the first time. But he has set a hard deadline. If he judges a deal is not possible on 30 September, he will go for no-deal. Hunt says, if MPs try to block a no-deal Brexit, that could make getting a deal harder. In any negotiation you need leverage, and part of ours is showing that we have a plan to ensure we succeed as a country through a no deal Exit from the EU, and we are willing to use it if an acceptable deal can\u2019t be done. So I urge any colleagues thinking of blocking a no deal Brexit to reflect that you may in fact be making it harder to get a negotiated exit, by giving the EU misplaced confidence that we will give ground, and ultimately increasing the chance that we leave without one. And he says Boris Johnson was wrong to put the chances of a no-deal Brexit at a million to one. I also urge others to be clear with people about the facts. There is no implementation period without a deal. There is no recourse to GATT 24 without the agreement of the other side. You can\u2019t do a trade agreement by yourself. And the chances of no deal, far from being a million to one, are real which is why we must prepare. The point about making no deal a credible threat is that you actually have to prepare for it. Hunt says he would guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in the UK in all circumstances. Sixth, he will start planning a no-deal budget. This will include my existing policies of cutting corporation tax cut to 12.5%, increasing the annual allowance to \u00a35m, and taking 90% of high street businesses out of rates, which I will introduce in any circumstance. Seventh, he will produce a no-deal \u201crelief programme\u201d. This will include a \u00a36bn fund for the fishing and farming sectors who export to Europe to ease transition out of the European Union whilst honouring our international obligations. It will also consider what relief other industries will require. Eighth, he will pursue the government\u2019s existing approach to tariffs. Ninth, he finance \u201cthe development of customs solutions which can help deliver our cast iron guarantee that we will never put up a hard border.\u201d And, tenth, he will follow a clear timetable for the negotiation. Following the vote for the new plan in the House of Commons I will then allow 3 weeks for negotiations with the EU. As prime minister I will make a judgement on 30th September as to whether there is a realistic chance of a new deal being agreed that can pass the House of Commons. If my judgement - and the judgement of my negotiating team - is that there is a deal to be done I will seek to conclude the negotiations and pass a new meaningful vote and any necessary legislation in the House of Commons before the end of October. If my judgement is that there is no deal to be done I will immediately cease all discussions with the European Union and focus the whole country\u2019s attention on no deal preparations. Hunt is now running through his 10-point no-deal plan. First, on day one of his premiership he will ramp up no-deal planning. All government departments will be expected to act on the basis that we are leaving without a deal on October 31st. All August leave will be cancelled unless I receive a signed letter from the relevant permanent secretary saying that preparations in his or her department are on time and on track. Hunt to cancel summer leave for civil servants unless their no-deal plans are ready. Second, he will set up a no-deal cabinet task force. Third, he will establish a new negotiating team. A new political negotiating team will be convened with members of the ERG, the DUP, members of the One Nation Group and Welsh and Scottish Conservatives. It will be led by the Brexit Secretary and supported at an official level by Crawford Falconer. He will be supported by top experts from around the world. They will be tasked with producing an alternative exit deal, based on the alternative arrangements proposals, that can command a majority in the House of Commons and addresses, seriously and forensically, legitimate EU and Irish concerns about the Irish border and the integrity of the single market. This plan will be published by the end of August. Fourth, he will engage with EU leaders and the commission in July and August. Fifth, he will set up a new national logistics committee to keep goods flowing in and out of the UK in the event of no-deal. Hunt says renegotiating Brexit will not be easy. But it will not be impossible either. But we also have to prepare for the possibility that the European Union refuses to budge. Which means a comprehensive no-deal plan. But, Hunt says, first the UK must leave the EU. And as one of the oldest democracies in the world we show the world that in this country it is the people not the politicians who are the boss. As your prime minister I will. But belief alone won\u2019t cut it. Rhetoric is not enough. This is about the hard graft, focus and attention to detail Deal or no deal. Every eventuality. Every law or statutory instrument. Every industry. And every part of the UK One slip, we lose our leverage, our security and possibly even Brexit itself. Jeremy Hunt is speaking now. He says, since the Tory leadership contest started, he has travelled more than 3,000 miles across the country. He starts with a summary of his overall pitch. As an entrepreneur I want to fire up our economy, cut corporation tax and scrap business rates for thousands of high street companies up and down the country. As a reformer I want our next social mission to be to abolish illiteracy and ensure that every young person has the skills they need to get a well-paid job. And as the son of a naval officer I want us to walk tall in the world with a decisive increase in defence spending so that Britain continues to defend the values we believe in. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, is introducing Jeremy Hunt, Fox says if the party is electing a prime minister, it has to choose someone ready for office from day one. And you need someone who can connect, he says. He says he has been impressed by the way Hunt connects with people. But Tories need to deliver Brexit first, he says. And he says, having seen Hunt in cabinet, he knows how meticulously he prepares for things. Jeremy Hunt is about to start his Brexit speech. He is addressing Policy Exchange thinktank. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. Turning to the other leadership contest, Jo Swinson and Sir Ed Davey, who are competing to replace Sir Vince Cable as Lib Dem leader, have been taking part in a debate on Sky\u2019s All Out Politics. Here are some of the key lines. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was in full word-munching mode on the Today programme this morning. When he was standing as Tory leadership candidate himself, he criticised Boris Johnson for being anti-business (saying \u201cI say fuck \u2018fuck business\u2019\u201d - one of the more memorable lines of the contest) and he said that proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit, which Johnson is reserving as an option, would be an insult to D-day veterans. But now he is a cheerleader for the Johnson campaign, and he had to explain why. Here are the key points. Hancock claimed that there was now now realistic chance of Johnson needing to prorogue parliament to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit. When asked by John Humphrys about his comment about this being an insult to war veterans, Hancock said a subsequent vote in the Commons, which saw the government comfortably defeating an opposition attempt to let MPs take control for parliamentary timetable, showed that the situation had changed. Hancock said: I just don\u2019t think that [proroguing parliament] is where this is going to end up ... I made the argument that [earlier in the leadership contest[ parliament would stop a no-deal Brexit. But during the leadership contest we had a vote in parliament. And I expected that vote to be to carry on the government to be defeated. It was a vote on whether we made parliamentary time to stop no-deal. Actually, it turned out that the government carried that vote by 11. And it is absolutely clear that the European election results have fundamentally changed the politics of this in Westminster too. Hancock dismissed a question about why he was now backing Johnson given what he had said about business by replying: \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to look forward in life, you\u2019ve got to look forward, John.\u201d He said that he was backing Johnson because he was \u201cbest placed to deliver Brexit\u201d. Humphrys started the interview by adopting the famous line to Debbie McGee and asking what was it about the runaway favourite in the contest, Boris Johnson, that made Hancock want to support him. Hancock began his reply by saying: Well, and the reason that I\u2019m backing Boris Johnson is because I think he\u2019s best placed to deliver Brexit, and then to unite the country, and the storey we\u2019re talking about this morning uniting the country on a path plan of higher pay not higher taxes is exactly the sort of thing that I want to see. That confirmed this line in Tim Shipman\u2019s Sunday Times account yesterday (paywall) about the rigid message discipline being imposed by the Johnson team. Shipman wrote: On Tuesday Mark Fullbrook, the business partner of Johnson\u2019s election guru Sir Lynton Crosby, was drafted in to take over the campaign, a move that was long planned but which contributed to a sense of panic. Fullbrook put MPs\u2019 noses out of joint at a presentation in parliament\u2019s Thatcher Room that evening when he outlined campaign messaging. One MP present said Fullbrook shot down Bob Seely, the MP for the Isle of Wight, \u201clike a heckler\u201d when he tried to ask a question, and mocked veteran Eurosceptic Sir Bernard Jenkin for yawning. Seely walked out. \u201cThe way he did it didn\u2019t go down well with colleagues,\u201d the MP said. \u201cThere are three messages: \u2018Boris will deliver Brexit on October 31; Boris will reunite the party and the country; and Boris will beat Jeremy Corbyn.\u2019 That\u2019s all we are allowed to say.\u201d These messages had been a feature of the campaign for weeks, but Fullbrook made clear they would now be rigidly enforced. Here is some comment on the interview from journalists. From Sky\u2019s Rob Powell From my colleague Peter Walker From the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves From the Times\u2019 David Aaronovitch From BuzzFeed\u2019s Stuart Millar From my colleague Patrick Wintour From my colleague Marina Hyde Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has told the Today programme that Scottish independence and a push for Irish reunification would be \u201creal threats\u201d from a no-deal Brexit. Speaking on the Today programme this morning Fox, who is backing Jeremy Hunt for the Tory leadership, was asked whether a no-deal Brexit could lead to Scottish independence and a border poll to reunite the island of Ireland. Fox replied: We know they are both real threats, there\u2019s no point in pretending they\u2019re not there. And therefore we have to put in place the details of what a no-deal would look like, including how we protect crucial industries like fishing and farming and how we deal with small businesses. It\u2019s not good enough to simply say we are going to have a no-deal; we need to prepare about it, that\u2019s what government is all about. At the last election Conservative politicians often accused Labour of resorting to \u201cthe magic money tree\u201d to fund its promises. Even though Labour\u2019s manifesto had details of how it would raise money for these commitments, the jibe was intended to show that Labour\u2019s commitment to fiscal rigour was bogus, and that the party just expected to conjure money out of thin air. That was two years ago. Now the Conservative party is holding a leadership contest and the candidates seem to have discovered not just the magic money tree, not just a Heseltine-sized magic money arboretum, but an entire magic money Amazon rain forest. We\u2019ve got two good examples this morning. Jeremy Hunt, the underdog in the contest, is proposing a \u00a36bn fund to protect farmers and the fishing industry from a no-deal Brexit, as part of a 10-point plan to prepare the UK for possibly leaving the EU at the end of October without an agreement. He will set out details in a speech this morning and, although he is still stressing that he would prefer to get a Brexit deal with the EU, this seem seems to be further evidence that he is engaged in what the Sunday Times splash headline yesterday called a \u201chard Brexit bidding war\u201d with Boris Johnson. Hunt\u2019s plan also includes setting up a no-deal cabinet task force, establishing a national logistics committee to produce a plan to keep goods moving in the event of no-deal and holding a no-deal budget, which would among other things cut corporation tax to 12.5%. Last week the Institute for Fiscal Studies said this tax would cost \u00a313bn a year. (By comparison, abolishing tuition fees for new students, Labour\u2019s headline spending pledge at the last election, came in with a price tag of just \u00a39.5bn, which Labour costed through tax increases for high earners.) Commenting on his plan, Hunt is due to say in his speech: If you\u2019re a sheep farmer in Shropshire or a fishermen in Peterhead I have a simple message for you. I know you face uncertainty if we have to leave the EU without a deal. I will mitigate the impact of no deal Brexit on you and step in to help smooth those short term difficulties. If we could do it for the bankers in the financial crisis, we can do it for our fisherman, farmers and small businesses now ... I have made it clear that my preference is for us to leave with a new deal. One that removes the backstop and ensures we have a fully independent trade policy. And if the commission engages in good faith I believe this is possible. But Britain deserves a leader with the courage to not just tell the European commission he will walk away. But to show them he is willing and able to do so. Because in the end, without those abilities, without that determination, and without that plan, it is just a wing and a prayer. Boris Johnson, the favourite in the contest, has signalled that he would increase public sector pay if he becomes prime minister. But he has not actually announced this himself, and his campaign has not issued a news release. Instead Matt Hancock, the health secretary who is now one of his leading supporters, has made this comment on Johnson\u2019s behalf in a statement to the Times. Hancock does not give any figures to explain what sort of pay rises might be available to public sector workers under a Johnson premiership, but he told the paper (paper): Now that there\u2019s money available, we need to show the public sector some love \u2014 they do a brilliant job for the country. People in the public sector need to be properly rewarded for the brilliant work they do. Higher pay, not higher taxes, means a pay rise for everyone, including in the public sector. It is important to stress that this is not the way politicians normally announce policy, and the effect of using proxies to make policy announcements on his behalf is to give Johnson what the Americans call \u201cplausible deniability\u201d; if questioned on this \u201cpromise\u201d in the Commons in six months\u2019 time, perhaps after the public sector pay rise has not materialised, Johnson can always say he never made this commitment himself. Hancock has also been giving interviews this morning. His Today programme one was not his finest hour. More on that soon. When challenged about how they would fund their spending plans, Johnson and Hunt have both pointed out that the Treasury has \u201cheadroom\u201d available for extra spending (which is true, but only up to a point) and that the country can afford to borrow more (which is also true, but counter to the main thrust of Conservative thinking on the economy for the whole of the last nine years). Generally, thought, Johnson and Hunt have not dwelled much on questions about how they will fund their promises, and at Conservative party hustings they have not been challenged much on this point either. Here is the agenda for the day. 11am: Jeremy Hunt delivers a speech on Brexit. After 3.30pm: MPs begin a two-day debate on the estimates. Backbenchers are trying to force a vote on amendments that cut off government funding if a new PM tried to take the UK out of the EU without a deal. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on the Tory leadership contest. I plan to publish a summary at lunchtime and then another when I finish. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Figures obtained by the Guardian show referrals relate to a range of alleged and suspected abuses, including sexual exploitation, forced marriage and bullying. Data released under freedom of information (FoI) legislation shows that nearly 1.3m records were created in the capital over the past five years \u2013 an average of about 700 a day \u2013 informing local safeguarding authorities about officers\u2019 concerns for children and vulnerable adults.

He had been either invisible or deliberately sober to the point of dullness, when his usual primary draw to Tory members is a self-created sense of optimism and fun. Much is also made of his supposed broad appeal to the electorate, evidenced by two terms as London mayor.</p>\n    <p>His bizarre claim to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/mesmerising-boris-johnsons-bizarre-model-buses-claim-raises-eyebrows\">make model cardboard buses</a> has raised eyebrows. In most political contests, Johnson\u2019s character \u2013 he has lost more than one job for lying, and has a complex and opaque personal life \u2013 would be a big issue, but among the Tory faithful he seemingly receives a free pass. It remains to be seen what impact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/22/neighbour-who-called-police-over-boris-johnson-row-goes-public\">late-night police visit</a> will have on his chances.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has promised to push for a new deal while insisting the UK will leave the EU come what may on 31 October, even if it involves no deal. While his hard Brexit supporters are adamant this is a cast-iron guarantee of leaving on that date, elsewhere Johnson has been somewhat less definitive. Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate, Johnson said only that it was 'eminently feasible', although he then went on to tell TalkRadio that the 31 October deadline was 'do or die'.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His main pledge has been to raise the threshold for the 40% higher tax rate from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at a cost of almost \u00a310bn a year, which would help about 3 million higher earners, a demographic with a fairly sizeable crossover into Tory members. Johnson\u2019s camp insist it would be part of a wider \u2013 and so far unknown \u2013 package of tax changes.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Public spending</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has said relatively little, beyond promising a fairly small increase in schools funding, as well as talking about the need to roll out fast broadband across the country. Johnson has generally hinted he would loosen the purse strings, but given his prior fondness for big-ticket projects \u2013 London\u2019s cancelled garden bridge, the mooted 'Boris island' airport \u2013 perhaps expect more of a focus on infrastructure projects than services.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Climate and environment</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is unlikely to be a big issue for Conservative party members, and Johnson has not said much on this beyond confirming his general support for the new government target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Foreign policy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Also unlikely to be a big issue among Tory members, beyond vague platitudes on 'global Britain', it could be a weak spot for Johnson given his poor performance as foreign secretary.

Wall Street investors have given a steady thumbs-up to Saturday\u2019s news that China and the US will resume trade talks. Here\u2019s the closing prices: Dow Jones industrial average: up 111 points of 0.42% at 26,711 S&amp;P 500: up 22 points or 0.75% at 2,963.83 points Nasdaq: up 82.95 points or 1% at 8,089.19 Technology stocks led the way, on relief that America won\u2019t impose new tariffs on electronics goods made in China. Financial stocks also gained, along with consumer goods makers and miners (whose commodities should be in higher demand without a trade war). Goodnight! GW Michael Wilson, equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, has warned investors not to get carried away by the trade war ceasefire. As he points out in a note to clients, there are other problems on the horizon - including signs of slowing growth. Wilson explained: \u201cA pause in rising trade tensions is not a fix for slowing U.S. economic activity and earnings pressure. In November, a truce brought a short-lived rally to the S&amp;P, but ultimately induced procurement managers to cancel orders as inventories were already high and there was no longer an incentive to stockpile ahead of incremental tariffs.\u201d Marketwatch has more details. Today\u2019s weak factory PMI reports from across the globe show that global manufacturing contracted for the second consecutive month in June. Two months of contraction in global trade has not happened in six-and-a-half years, according to the J.P. Morgan Global Manufacturing Index, points out Bloomberg. More here. Our news story on today\u2019s market action is now live, here: Here are some photos of traders on the the floor of the New York stock exchange, as stocks hit record highs today. Back in London, City investors shrugged off today\u2019s weak factory data - taking comfort in the US-China trade detente. The FTSE 100 ended the session 71 points higher at 7,497, a gain of almost 1%. That\u2019s its highest close in over two months, going back to late April (before the May selloff). Other European markets had a good day, lifted by hopes that trade turmoil may be easing. Germany\u2019s DAX finished 1% higher at 12,521, up 122 points, while the French CAC gained 0.5%. This is not encouraging: There\u2019s a sharp contrast between the optimism in the markets, and the struggles in the world\u2019s factories shown in today\u2019s PMI data: Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst at Forex.com, suspects the rally may fade: The US-China trade optimism is driving the markets and the S&amp;P 500 has opened at a fresh record, while safe havens gold, yen and franc have all fallen. Tech stocks jumped after Trump said he would allow US corporations to resume business dealings with Huawei on certain products after it was blacklisted earlier due to national security concerns. But July has started with a negative note for global manufacturing data, after purchasing managers reported deteriorating conditions in several key economic regions including China and the US. Initially, this was shrugged off by a market buoyed by the latest developments regarding the US-China trade spat, after Trump said trade talks are back on track. However, since the start of the US session, we have seen a bit of a pullback from the highs. If this latest trade optimism fades completely, the focus will turn very quickly to the ailing global economy. As such, the S&amp;P\u2019s latest breakout to a new all-time high could be brief, especially as some of the positivity regarding trade talks was already priced in. Wall Street is holding most of its early gains, with graphics card and chipmaker Nvidia among the risers (+2.5%). A second survey of US manufacturing has confirmed that growth was subdued last month: Donald Trump\u2019s trade war has hurt US manufacturing, warns Markit\u2019s chief economist Chris Williamson. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s PMI survey, which is quite a contrast to the booming markets. Although business optimism about the future lifted slightly higher, it remained close to survey lows to indicate persistent low morale. Worries centred on signs of slowing demand both at home and internationally, weaker sales, and geopolitical uncertainty. \u201cTariffs meanwhile continued to push up prices, but weak demand often limited the ability of firms to pass higher prices onto customers, suggesting overall inflationary pressures have weakened compared to earlier in the year.\u201d Just in: America\u2019s manufacturing sector barely grew last month -- but that\u2019s still good by global standards! Data firm Markit has just reported that US factories remained in \u201cnear-stagnation\u201d in June, due to weak output and cautious hiring. Its US manufacturing PMI has come in at 50.6, up from 50.5 in May, but barely above the break-even point. Markit explains: The rate of overall growth held close to May\u2019s near-decade low. On a positive note, the rate of output growth quickened slightly amid a renewed rise in new orders. However, in line with muted increases in output, firms reined in staff hiring, expanding workforce numbers at the slowest pace for almost three years. Subsequently, output expectations remained subdued. So, a weak result, but much better than Britain\u2019s factories -- the UK PMI fell to just 48.0 earlier today. China\u2019s manufacturing also contracted, with a PMI of 49.4, while the eurozone limped in with just 47.6. America\u2019s technology-focused Nasdaq index is really on a charge -- up a beefy 1.7% at the start of trading. That reflects relief that Washington and Beijing have agreed to resume trade talks, as tech companies were vulnerable to tariffs and other sanctions. The Dow Jones industrial average has also jumped 1% at the start of trading, gaining 264 points to 26,864. Boom! The New York Stock Market has hit a fresh record high at the start of trading. Investors are relieved that Donald Trump and Xi Jinping backed away from a deeper trade war, agreeing to restart negotiations during their meeting at the G20 last week. With stocks surging, the S&amp;P 500 index has hit a new intraday record high - up 34 points or 1.1% at 2,975 in early trading. Technology stocks are among the top rises, after the US decided to relax some of the blacklist against China\u2019s Huawei. After a strong first half of the year, the markets have begun the second half powerfully too..... Here\u2019s another chart showing how the world\u2019s factories have slowed sharply in recent months, with many now contracting (with a PMI below 50). Shares in Apple are expected to rally today too, thanks to trade optimism. Soybean prices have hit a one-year high in Chicago, following the news that China and the US will restart trade talks. Donald Trump\u2019s pledge on Saturday that China has agreed to buy more American agricultural products is helping push prices up. China had been a top market for America\u2019s soybean farmers, but have been hit by rising tariffs since the trade dispute blew up last year. Today\u2019s PMI report shows that business optimism among factory bosses has dropped this month, dragged down by \u201cBrexit uncertainty and softer global and domestic economic growth\u201d. As such, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt\u2019s pledges that they\u2019re prepared to take Britain out of the EU without a deal on 31 October aren\u2019t helping. Seamus Nevin, the chief economist at manufacturers\u2019 group Make, has warned: \u201cGiven this outlook, increasing competition to see who can race to the bottom and act tough on \u2018no deal\u2019 is the height of irresponsibility with zero understanding of the consequences.\u201d Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Business Secretary, has blamed the government\u2019s mismanagement of Brexit for the slump in factory growth. She says: \u201cThe Government\u2019s mishandling of Brexit, and above all the reckless threat of No Deal, has pushed UK manufacturing to a six year low, with consecutive months of falling production. Only Labour will deliver a comprehensive Industrial Strategy and the long-term investment needed to revitalise the UK\u2019s manufacturing base.\u201d The UK chancellor, meanwhile, has been busy reminding certain colleagues that they\u2019ll struggle to fund their spending pledges if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal: That firepower is the \u00a327bn of extra money that Britain could borrow, without breaking budget targets. The stock market rally has now driven the UK\u201ds FTSE 100 index up by exactly one hundred points, or 1.35%, to 7,525 points. That\u2019s its highest level in nearly 10 weeks, as the threat of a deeper US-China trade war fades. Britain isn\u2019t the only country whose manufacturing sector has weakened in recent months. As this tweet shows, most factory PMIs have fallen in recent months -- as bosses have reported slowing output and order growth. Those in red are now below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction: Wall Street could hit a fresh record high today -- which I\u2019m sure Donald Trump would hail as a sign of progress on his watch. The US stock market is expected to cheer the US-China trade truce when it opens, in just over three hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is tipped to gain around 250 point, or 1%, following the strong gains in Europe and Asia (where Japan and China\u2019s markets both gained over 2%). Several experts are warning that the prolonged period of uncertainty over the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union dragged the factory sector down last month. Seamus Nevin, Chief Economist at Make UK, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, says: \u201cToday\u2019s data proves that May\u2019s plunge below the 50-threshold was not just a one-off with UK manufacturing activity collapsing to its lowest level in six and a half years. Businesses are cutting back on both day-to-day and capital spending with the contraction in output a reflection of growing Brexit uncertainty and, worsening global trade winds. Lee Collinson, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays, says politicians need to help: Not only have manufacturers had to grapple with a prolonged period of uncertainty around Brexit, which has clearly impacted and delayed much needed investment decisions, but they also find themselves in the crosswinds of weakening demand from both home and overseas markets. With production and new order flows falling last month, the sector is increasingly looking to Westminster for the clarity they crave on the future relationship with the EU.\u201d Justin Benson, UK Head of Automotive at KPMG, is also concerned -- as both candidates to replace Theresa May say they could take Britain out without a deal. \u201cThe UK\u2019s manufacturing sector is experiencing historic lows in investment. New products and ideas are not being invested in to the extent that they were three years ago. The highs the sector saw in the first quarter of 2019 were clearly to mitigate Brexit issues, with many stockpiling to avoid or reduce delays to lead times and to manage customer expectations. \u201cRight now UK manufacturers need certainty, however, at the moment there\u2019s a high probability of a no-deal Brexit. The UK\u2019s makers need to start preparing for this eventuality, if they haven\u2019t done so already.\u201d Eurozone government bonds are also strengthening today, as relieved investors drive asset prices higher following the US-China trade truce. This is driving prices higher, pushing down the yield (or interest rate) on the bonds. Italy, for example, can now borrow for 10 years at just 2%, for the first time in over a year. Britain\u2019s stock market is continuing to rally, despite the decline in factory output last month. The FTSE 100 is holding firmly onto this morning\u2019s two-month high, currently up 82 points at 7,508 points. Nearly every sector is posting gains -- partly helped by the weaker pound (which boosts overseas earnings). Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City index, says investors are optimistic following the G20 meeting. The much anticipated Trump-Xi Jinping meeting in Osaka delivered as expected, not a full on resolution of the trade dispute between China and the US but some form of truce that includes picking up the broken off trade negotiations between the two countries. For the time being the existing import tariffs will remain in place but the markets will live off the hope that the resumption of the discussions between US and Chinese trade representatives will help lift those sooner rather than later. Better news: Unemployment across the eurozone has hit a fresh 11 year low, dropping to 7.5% in May. Statistics body Eurostat also reports that jobless levels fell in almost every member of the EU (only Denmark saw an increase, from 5% to 5.1%). But there are still sharp differences across the EU - with Germany boasting just 3.1% unemployment, while it\u2019s still over 18% in Greece. The decline in UK factory output in June has driven the pound down to a 10-day low. Sterling has shed half a cent against the US dollar to $1.2639, its weakest point since 20 June. In another worrying sign, UK consumer credit growth has slowed to a five-year low. The Bank of England reports that unsecured lending to consumers only grew by 5.6% per year in May, down from 5.9% in April Mortgage approvals also fell, from 66,045 to 65,409, suggesting the public are being cautious. That, combined with the decline in factory output, suggests Britain\u2019s economy has weakening in the last few weeks. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, says Brexit is hurting UK factories for two reasons: a) panicky stockpiling earlier this year has brought forward demand b) Anxiety over a no-deal crisis this autumn is making clients nervous. Dobson says this helped to drag the factory PMI to its lowest in over six years: \u201cThe downturn in UK manufacturing deepened during June, as the impact of firms unwinding stockpiles built before the original Brexit date continued to reverberate through the sector and exacerbate weak demand. \u201cThe stranglehold of sustained Brexit-related uncertainty and disruption also weighed heavily on business confidence and employment, as optimism ebbed to one of its lowest levels in the survey history and staff headcounts were reduced for the third straight month. Worryingly, UK factories don\u2019t have enough orders to help them quickly plough through their inventory stocks. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s factory sector has suffered its sharpest contraction in six years. Data firm Markit\u2019s UK manufacturing PMI, just released, is much worse than expected. The index has slumped to just 48.0, a 76-month low, showing that the sector shrank at a more rapid pace. Companies reported that output and new orders both slumped in June, hitting business confidence. One problem is that firms are now cutting their stockpiles, having furiously bought raw materials and parts earlier this year in case of a no-deal Brexit. Markit says that Britain\u2019s manufacturing downturn has deepened, as the UK PMI falls to lowest level since February 2013. It explains: The UK manufacturing sector continued to feel the reverberations of the unwinding of earlier pre-Brexit stockpiling activity during June. The already high stock levels at both manufacturers and their clients led to a scaling back of output and new order intakes, with demand from both domestic and export markets weakening. Output was lowered in response to reduced intakes of new business, which fell to the greatest extent for almost seven years. There were reports that high stock levels, ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the economic slowdown and rising competition all contributed to the decreases in new orders and production. More to follow..... Some City experts are sceptical about quite how much progress was made between the US and China at the G20 summit. Although Donald Trump talked up his meeting with Xi Jinping as a big success, we still don\u2019t know how Beijing and Washington will resolve their trade conflict. The two sides also haven\u2019t set any public deadlines. Russ Mould, investment director at stockbrokers AJ Bell, says: The fact that China and the US are restarting trade talks gives some reassurance to investors and triggers a small rally in stocks around the world. However, there are plenty of other negative factors to consider which explains why equity markets aren\u2019t experiencing massive surges. \u201cThe trade war is far from over, which means a continuation of uncertainties hanging over the market. Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments, is also cautious about the G20 summit, saying: \u201cIn the big picture, it doesn\u2019t change anything. It was never likely to solve the whole problem, but it\u2019s a useful stepping stone.\u201d Ditto Chris Bailey, analyst at investment bank Raymond James: \u201cSo the can was kicked down the road... but [there is] much more work to do on the details of a future stickable agreement,\u201d Economics professor Nouriel Roubini is concerned by the eurozone factory downturn: Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, sounds just as downbeat: \u201cEurozone manufacturing remained stuck firmly in a steep downturn in June, continuing to contract at one of the steepest rates seen for over six years..... The downturn is also showing no signs of any imminent end. The survey\u2019s forward-looking indicators remained worryingly subdued in June, adding to concerns about the economy in the second half of the year.\u201d Newsflash: Europe\u2019s factory sector continued to contract last month, taking the shine off today\u2019s market rally. Data firm Markir reports that its Eurozone manufacturing PMI report, which tracks thousands of firms, fell to a three-month low of 47.6 in June, from 47.7 in May. That shows that the sector kept shrinking, at a slightly faster rate. It\u2019s the fifth month in a row in which the manufacturing PMI has failed to hit the 50-point mark (which split expansion from contraction). Companies reported that output and new orders continued to shrink last month - a sign of weak economic demand. That could be partly due to the US-China trade tensions. Markit reports that Germany suffered the worst slowdown while France\u2019s economy picked up: Ouch! Spain\u2019s factory sector suffered a sharp contraction last month, with orders and output dropping. Data firm Markit blames \u201cdeteriorating market conditions, both at home and abroad\u201d -- a sign that the eurozone slowdown, and months of trade tensions, are hurting. Every European stock index has surged higher this morning, following the rally in Asia overnight. July is off to a \u201cflying start\u201d, says Connor Campbell of Spreadex. Though they have been here before, the global markets proved ready and willing to swallow the latest trade war retreat from the USA and China. The much-anticipated G20-sidebar between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping didn\u2019t disappoint. According to the US President trade negotiations are now \u2018right back on track\u2019, Trump then pledging that he won\u2019t be adding additional tariffs onto Chinese goods \u2013 \u2018for the time being\u2019. Xi, meanwhile, called for \u2018cooperation and dialogue\u2019, the Beijing leader no doubt keen to get talks up and running given Monday\u2019s Caixin manufacturing PMI unexpectedly contracted. The Stoxx 600 tech index, which tracks Europe\u2019s technology sector, has jumped 2.2% this morning to its highest level in more than a year. European stocks are also surging in early trading. Germany\u2019s DAX index, which is stocked with major exporters, has leapt by 1.8% to its highest level since August 2018. Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has hit its highest level in over two months, at the start of trading in London. The index of top blue-chip shares has gained 75 points, or over 1%, to 7,500 points -- its highest level since 24th April. Almost every stock on the index is higher, with financial stocks, technology firms, industrial groups, energy providers and miners leading the way. Traders are racing to buy shares, relieved that America and China have agreed to resume trade negotiations over the weekend. Investment bank Jefferies agree that the cessation of US-China trade hostilities should be taken well by markets: For investors sipping their Sunday morning coffee and perusing the weekend newspapers, the 180-degree tilt in US-North Korea relations probably edged out the 45-degree turn in US-China trade relations in terms of attention. The fact that President Trump announced that he would not be adding tariffs on US$300bn worth of Chinese imports and that trade talks would resume will be a relief for financial markets. The surprising U-turn that US companies will be able to continue to sell to Huawei has been regarded as a significant concession. The trade truce can\u2019t come soon enough for China\u2019s factories, who have suffered falling orders and output in June. Manufacturing production across China slumped into contraction last month, according to the latest survey of purchasing managers across country. The Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI fell from 50.2 in May to 49.4 in June, below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. It\u2019s the second lowest reading since June 2016. Firms reported that: Output and new work intakes decline for first time since January There was a renewed reduction in export sales Goods producers cutback input purchasing and payroll numbers Caixin says Jone was a \u201cchallenging month for Chinese manufacturers\u201d, with trade tensions driving down sales, export orders, and production levels. Companies responded by reducing headcounts further and making fewer purchases of raw materials and semi-finished items. At the same time, selling prices were raised following another increase in input costs, though rates of inflation were negligible. Business sentiment was broadly neutral at the end of the second quarter, with firms mainly concerned about the US-China trade dispute. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit doesn\u2019t believe the US-China ceasefire will hold for very long, given the underlying tensions between the two sides. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, predicts that the trade war ceasefire could last for several months. \u201cWe expect talks to continue over the coming months, with the most likely outcome \u2013 as we previously expected \u2013 a prolonged truce on trade. Both sides have strong incentives to avoid further rounds of retaliation. However, we also believe neither side is in a rush for a deal. Both Presidents Trump and Xi appear to be calculating that they have strong cards to play.\u201d Japan\u2019s Nikkei index has closed at a two-month high, driven by optimism over the US-China trade truce. President Trump\u2019s decision to ease restrictions on Huawei has boosted tech stocks, amid a general burst of optimism. Here\u2019s some latest prices: Japan\u2019s Nikkei: up 454 points or 2.1% at 21,729.97 points China\u2019s CSI 300: up 108 points or 2.8% at 3,933 points Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200: up 29 points or 0.44% at 6,684 points Stephen Innes of Vanguard Markets says: After spending the better part of two months in trade war purgatory and with G20 done and dusted, risk markets have responded to Saturday\u2019s events in a reveller tone. Indeed, investors heaved a massive, but exhausted, sigh of relief that both the U.S. and China opted to push the reset button and restart trade negotiations amidst other pleasantries \u2013 now we\u2019ll have to see, whether it all sticks. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Relief is sweeping the financial world this morning after the US and China agreed to restart trade talks, calming fears of a full-blown trade war. Investors are welcoming the news that Trump and Xi\u2019s meeting at the G20 in Osaka, Japan, appeared to go well. Share prices are romping higher, on hopes that further conflict can be avoided. The two leaders gave the green light to fresh trade negotiations, with America pledging not to put any more tariffs on Chinese goods in the meantime. In return, apparently, Beijing will buy more US agricultural goods. Trump declared that the relationship with China was \u201cright back on track\u201d after an \u201cexcellent\u201d meeting. He told reporters: \u201cWe will continue to negotiate, and I promise that at least for the time being we won\u2019t be adding additional [tariffs]. We\u2019re going to work with China to see if we can make a deal. China will consult with us and will be buying a tremendous amount of food and agricultural products, and they\u2019re going to start doing that almost immediately.\u201d Trump has also relaxed some of the measures recently imposed on Huawei, by allowing US companies to sell some technology to the Chinese telecoms firm. This move has angered some hawkish US politicians, who believe Huawei is a security threat. The truce is sparking a risk-on fever in the markets this morning, driving up asset prices. Asian stock markets are higher, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei up over 2% and China\u2019s CSI 300 gaining 2.5%. European stock markets are tipped to rally when trading being -- the FTSE 100 is expected to gain 58 points, or 0.9%, while Germany\u2019s DAX could gain almost 1.5%. But.... traders should remember that we don\u2019t yet have a comprehensive trade deal between the US and China. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada explains: The compromise reached between Trump and Xi at the week\u2019s G20 meeting went further than most had expected, with Trump putting the next tranche of tariffs on hold and reopening US companies\u2019 ability to supply Huawei. It is not clear, however, whether the latter will clear congress and there is plenty of scope for trade talks to break down again in the future. For now, however, risk is well supported. Also coming up today Data firm Markit is publishing its latest Purchasing Manager Index reports, showing how the world\u2019s manufacturers performed in June. Economists predict that Britain\u2019s factory sector shrank slightly, as the Brexit stockpiling rush earlier this year continues to fade. Europe\u2019s manufacturing base probably suffered a sharper decline, while America\u2019s industrial sector may have stalled again. Some top central bankers are gathered in Helsinki for a conference organised by the Bank of Finland, including Federal Reserve policymaker Richard Clarida and China\u2019s top central banker Yi Gang. The agenda 8am BST: People\u2019s Bank Of China chief Yi Gang speaks 9am BST: Eurozone manufacturing PMI for June (expected to remain at 47.8 - where 50 = stagnation) 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI for June (expected to rise to 49.5, from 49.4) 2.45pm BST: US manufacturing for June (expected to remain at 50.1)",

Both candidates in the race to be Britain\u2019s next prime minister are saying they are prepared to take Britain out of the EU without a deal if they cannot secure concessions from Brussels. Smith has tabled a motion, to be voted on in the Lords on Wednesday, calling for a joint committee of MPs and peers to be set up to examine the costs and implications for the UK leaving without a deal on 31 October. With cross-party support, the motion appears likely to succeed and Labour hopes it will put pressure on whomever is the next PM to avoid no deal. Speaking to Labour MPs at the weekly meeting of the parliamentary Labour party on Monday, Smith said the Lords was ready to force the pace on the issue, as it has at key moments in the Brexit debate over the past three years; \u201cjust like we did with the meaningful vote \u2013 working with others in the Lords and of course, hand in hand with Keir [Starmer], and then delivering that result for you to pick up in the Commons.

Aged 23, his highest international score was 63 and the run chase of 339 would be a World Cup record \u2013 but no matter.

There was no epilogue: Sri Lanka won by 23 runs.</p> <p>Their innings had been a revelation as they rattled along to their first score of 300 plus of the tournament, led by a gorgeous maiden ODI century from the 21-year-old Avishka Fernando, who drove and pulled with pure happiness. For the Sri Lanka team, who scored not one ODI century in 2018, and only two others this year, it was a breath of fresh air.</p> <p>West Indies \u2013 with the unlikely support of the watching singer Rihanna \u2013 had fielded with pantomime exasperation, the troop had their fingers in their pockets and their hands on their hips. Shannon Gabriel got a bail in the face; Holder left the field to use a set of nail clippers; Sunil Ambris twisted an ankle; a free-hit yorker fell through Shai Hope\u2019s legs; Pooran dropped Kusal Perera; Lahiru Thirimanne was caught at midwicket off a no-ball.

Coming in at 71 for three, Pooran had marshalled a cardboard batting display into respectability and then 3D-fantasy, alongside Jason Holder, Carlos Brathwaite and, most thrillingly of all, Fabian Allen. Aged 23, his highest international score was 63 and the run chase of 339 would be a World Cup record \u2013 but no matter. West Indies have had a dreadful World Cup but pride and shame are powerful catalysts. Allen and Pooran had put on 83 in 10 overs and from nowhere the scales had tipped towards West Indies when there was a terrible maroon headrush \u2013 with Allen ball-watching and forgetting to run as Pooran charged towards him on 99. Recriminations were sharp. Pooran went to his century next ball and, when he survived a possible catch after Thisara Perera strayed too far from the boundary, the momentum seemed with him. But Angelo Mathews rolled in to bowl his first ball in an ODI since December 2017 and Pooran chased it. He crawled off the field, dragging his shadow beneath. There was no epilogue: Sri Lanka won by 23 runs. Their innings had been a revelation as they rattled along to their first score of 300 plus of the tournament, led by a gorgeous maiden ODI century from the 21-year-old Avishka Fernando, who drove and pulled with pure happiness. For the Sri Lanka team, who scored not one ODI century in 2018, and only two others this year, it was a breath of fresh air. West Indies \u2013 with the unlikely support of the watching singer Rihanna \u2013 had fielded with pantomime exasperation, the troop had their fingers in their pockets and their hands on their hips. Shannon Gabriel got a bail in the face; Holder left the field to use a set of nail clippers; Sunil Ambris twisted an ankle; a free-hit yorker fell through Shai Hope\u2019s legs; Pooran dropped Kusal Perera; Lahiru Thirimanne was caught at midwicket off a no-ball. And as West Indies threatened to whip away their victory, Sri Lanka\u2019s fielding also disintegrated.",

It will be remembered in the main for Cori Gauff\u2019s astonishing victory over Venus Williams, who must have felt like she was taking part in a changing of the guard as she fell to her 15-year-old opponent. But it wasn\u2019t all good for the youngsters. While Felix Auger Aliassime secured his first ever grand slam win with a victory over Vasek Pospisil, there were unhappy exits for Naomi Osaka, Alexander Zverev and Stefanos Tsitsipas. Experience still counts, as Novak Djokovic demonstrated with a calm victory over Phillipp Kohlschreiber. Thanks for reading and emailing. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow.

Yet Williams saves the first with a huge forehand. Gauff challenges it unsuccessfully. Then Williams crunches a backhand down the line for deuce. What a shot. The next one\u2019s not so smart, though, a forehand into the net giving Gauff another match point. Again, though, Williams saves it, this time with a forehand into the corner. Stranded behind the baseline, there\u2019s a gasp as Gauff slips. She doesn\u2019t appear to have suffered any damage, but it\u2019s not long before an error hands Williams a break point. Amazingly, though, Gauff goes for an 108mph second serve and Williams hits a forehand return wide. A fourth chance arrives for Gauff. This time there\u2019s no reprieve for Williams, who nets her final forehand. Gauff can\u2019t believe it. She walks to the net to shake hands with her idol, who greets her with a big, generous smile. Then Gauff lets a few tears roll down her cheeks. In her box her parents are ecstatic.

Do you think they need more transparency with the council? Do you think players have more power when it comes to making the main decisions?</strong><br>KEVIN ANDERSON: There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s going on outside of the scenes, outside of the tennis court. Obviously I\u2019m involved with a lot of it, being on the council.<br>I think the main thing is really not to get too caught up in some of the negative stuff. I\u2019m really proud of everything we\u2019ve been able to achieve. I think tennis as a global sport has continued to reach new heights. Player prize money has gone up a lot. I think more guys are able to make a living playing tennis.<br><br>By no means are we done. We want to make tennis as an attractive sport to as many people as possible. That\u2019s what\u2019s been focused on.<br><br>There\u2019s been a lot of outside topics, I guess, or things that we\u2019ve had to deal with that we\u2019re still dealing with. It\u2019s been a bit of a tough process, to be honest with you.<br><br>I think, as always, the more we can stay together, especially as players, the more we\u2019ll be able to achieve at the end of the day.<br><br><strong>Q. </strong><strong>Do you think there should be more transparency, letting people know what\u2019s going on?</strong><br>KEVIN ANDERSON: I think yes and no. I still think that\u2019s something we can do better. I still think communication can be better. Obviously it\u2019s tough. There\u2019s a lot of information that goes on. I think sometimes management have a difficult time finding a balance between giving players enough information but also understanding and sometimes maybe just giving -- I mean, we\u2019re three days outside of Wimbledon. I feel like they\u2019re sometimes hesitant to give us that information. Sometimes players want maybe too much information. I think we\u2019re still trying to find that balance.<br><br><strong>Q. </strong><strong>Last year you spent six-plus hours locked in a deadlock with John Isner. Last Friday you spent seven hours locked in a deadlock with John Isner. Does the council need a tiebreaker system also? How much does it take out of you on the eve of a slam to be having these long things? Three of the people on your half of the equation already quit. What sort of toll does it have on you?</strong><br>KEVIN ANDERSON: I\u2019ve been on the council now for seven years. I remember years ago already having those feelings. I\u2019ve tried to be very vocal. I think that\u2019s been probably one of the more frustrating parts from my side: I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve been able to communicate or find a way with management yet to try and speed along the process.<br><br>I feel like it\u2019s amazing how different I\u2019m hearing some of the older guys, especially in the \u201890s, from what I\u2019ve heard, the top guys weren\u2019t nearly as interested in some of the matters that the players are right now. I think it\u2019s great that the players want so much information.<br><br>I think it\u2019s a very -- what I was saying earlier, there\u2019s a very delicate balance between also trusting our board reps and having them make the best decisions for us. Because we are so involved, these meetings are taking longer.<br><br>I do feel like one of the highlights from our last meeting was I think moving forward there will be a slightly different not necessarily structure, but the way we go about the meetings, the way we discuss, have the dialogue. I don\u2019t know what that looks like yet. Those are some of the messages I received from our management.<br><br>I really hope that\u2019s the case because it definitely takes a pretty long toll on me, starting at 5:00 and getting home at 11:30 just a few days before. Yeah, I mean, just not used to sitting around for long periods of time. Sometimes the discussions can get quite intense, as well.<br><br>I definitely feel like there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement there.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d1a1c7b8f088a7392736fc2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-01T14:50:24.636Z\">3.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Karen Khachanov made a bit of a meal of it, but the powerful young Russian is through to the second round after beating Soonwon Kown 7-6, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5. </strong>As for other young guns, Felix Auger-Aliassime is bidding to win in four sets against Vasek Pospisil, Alexander Zverev has won the first set 6-4 against Jiri Vesely (a dangerous qualifier) and Stefanos Tsitsipas remains a set down against Thomas Fabbiano.

Constructed specially this year, costing a cool \u00a323.6m to build, the centre has been put in place to deal with dissenting voices such as Nadal, who\u2019s in dire need of a large dose of SW19 nostalgia after all that complaining about the seeding formula they use here. Mark my words, he\u2019ll be back to gushing about strawberries and cream once he\u2019s finished watching the three-hour highlights reel of Tim Henman\u2019s very best volleys, complete with a Sue Barker voiceover of course</p> <p>Naughty Rafa, though! All that whinging about being shunted down to No3 seed to make way for Roger Federer. It\u2019s Wimbledon. They can do whatever they want. If they want Kyle Edmund Centre Court, they get Kyle Edmund on Centre Court. You can complain all you like about the fact Edmund\u2019s seeded 30th and hasn\u2019t done much all year, but he\u2019s the British No1, so he gets the prime slot. He\u2019s on third on Centre against the tricky Spaniard, Jaume Munar.<br></p> <p>Munar\u2019s from Mallorca. Rafa Nadal\u2019s from Mallorca! But that\u2019s enough Nadal chat for now. Despite the seed furore Nadal has at least ended up on the opposite side of the draw to Novak Djokovic, who begins his defence of his title with a tough one against the experienced German, Phillipp Kohlschreiber, in the first match on Centre Court. Djokovic is bidding for his fifth Wimbledon title, which would bring him level with Bjorn Borg, and his 16th major. But he has lost to Kohlschreiber this year and endured semi-final disappointment when he met Dominic Thiem at the French Open last month. Caution is advisable.<br></p> <p>Might there be a day of upsets, then? The second match on Centre sees Naomi Osaka face the pugnacious Kazakh, Yulia Putintseva, who might fancy her chances of upsetting the world No2. Osaka is the Australian Open and US Open champion, but she\u2019s been troubled by injury of late, lost early in the French Open and is uncomfortable on grass.<br></p> <p>As ever, you never know what to expect from the women. Simona Halep, the seventh seed, opens on Court 1 against Aliaksandra Sasnovich and suffered an early exit last year. And in the last match of the day on that venue, a potential firecracker: Venus Williams, the brilliant veteran champion, in an all-American tussle with the potential future of US tennis, the precociously talented Cauri \u201cCoco\u201d Gauff, at 15 the youngest player ever to qualify for the main draw here. <br></p> <p>The first round offers so many delights. Look around and you\u2019ll see Felix Auger-Aliassime, seeded 19th despite possessing no grand slam record, against another Canadian, Vasek Pospisil. There\u2019s Kevin Anderson, a beaten finalist last year, up against Pierre-Hugues Herbert, Andy Murray\u2019s doubles partner. Stefanos Tsitsipas against Thomas Fabbiano. Stan Wawrinka against Ruben Bemelmans. Grigor Dimitrov on Court 15. Poor Grigor! <br></p> <p>There\u2019s the power of Jelena Ostapenko, unseeded despite winning the French Open two years ago, against the wiles of Hsieh Su-wei. Caroline Wozniacki against Sara Sorribes Tormo. An intriguing unseeded battle between Alize Cornet and Victoria Azarenka. Marketa Vondrousva, beaten in the French Open final by Ash Barty, against the USA\u2019s Madison Brengle. And let\u2019s not forget Britain\u2019s Heather Watson trying to prove she deserves her main draw wild card when she faces the USA\u2019s Madison Brengle.<br></p> <p>Come on, Rafa! Turn that frown upside down.<br></p> <p><strong>Play begins at:</strong> 11am BST on the outside courts, 1pm BST on the show courts.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ef08cd660f877e1a7284adc2da55695fceaa6d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ef08cd660f877e1a7284adc2da55695fceaa6d4/0_186_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ground staff set up the net on an outer court.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ground staff set up the net on an outer court.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-01T11:00:26.900Z\">at 12.00pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

It will be remembered in the main for Cori Gauff\u2019s astonishing victory over Venus Williams, who must have felt like she was taking part in a changing of the guard as she fell to her 15-year-old opponent. But it wasn\u2019t all good for the youngsters. While Felix Auger Aliassime secured his first ever grand slam win with a victory over Vasek Pospisil, there were unhappy exits for Naomi Osaka, Alexander Zverev and Stefanos Tsitsipas. Experience still counts, as Novak Djokovic demonstrated with a calm victory over Phillipp Kohlschreiber. Thanks for reading and emailing. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow.

Grigor Dimitrov has shown exactly why he was plonked on Court 15. A former semi-finalist here, the ATP World Tour Finals champion in 2017, the world No49 is nothing more than an afterthought at a grand slam at the moment. If you\u2019re on Court 15 it\u2019s a sign of irrelevance. Unfortunately you just can\u2019t rely on Dimitrov. He\u2019s lovely to watch at times, but there\u2019s no substance to him and he\u2019s done very well to contrive to lose this one, going down 2-6, 3-6, 7-6 (4), 6-3, 6-2 to Corentin Moutet, a French qualifier who plays Felix Auger Aliassime in the second round. Elsewhere David Goffin, the 21st seed, has beaten Bradley Klahn 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. Medical timeout over for Jaume Munar, Kyle Edmund\u2019s able to have another go at serving for the match. And he makes sure there\u2019s no funny business this time. He earns two match points and finishes off his Spanish opponent with an ace. A good performance from the British No1 means he\u2019ll play the fiery and unpredictable Fernando Verdasco in the second round. Jaume Munar holds. Kyle Edmund will serve for it again at 6-4, 6-4, 5-4. He\u2019ll have to wait, though. Munar has the trainer on because of a finger problem and is having a medical timeout. Jelena Ostapenko\u2019s French Open triumph in 2017 might end up going down as one of the weirdest slam wins of all time. The Latvian, unseeded here, has gone out in the first round after losing 6-2, 6-2 to Hsieh Su-wei, the 28th seed. Serving for the match, Kyle Edmund squanders a match point before netting a forehand to gift a break to Jaume Munar. It\u2019s not over yet. Edmund\u2019s lead is cut to 6-4, 6-4, 5-3. Munar will serve. Another retirement. This time it\u2019s Gael Monfils, the 16th seed, who was trailing his fellow Frenchman 6-7, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5, 3-0 when he called it a day. Cori Gauff\u2019s dad was so happy he ripped his baseball cap off his head. Dads, eh? His daughter\u2019s look at the end was quite something. That bottom lip sure was trembling. To put it into context Venus Williams won four of her seven grand slams before Gauff was born. In other news Caroline Wozniacki is through to the second round after Sara Sorribes Tormo retires injured in the first set on Court 2. Woznacki was 4-0 down, but she was leading 5-4 by the time Sorribes Tormo called it quits. Serving for the match, Gauff begins by sending a backhand wide. She wins the next point, though, and follows it up with a cool ace for 30-15. Then Williams nets a forehand return, giving up two match points. This has been an incredible performance from Gauff. Yet Williams saves the first with a huge forehand. Gauff challenges it unsuccessfully. Then Williams crunches a backhand down the line for deuce. What a shot. The next one\u2019s not so smart, though, a forehand into the net giving Gauff another match point. Again, though, Williams saves it, this time with a forehand into the corner. Stranded behind the baseline, there\u2019s a gasp as Gauff slips. She doesn\u2019t appear to have suffered any damage, but it\u2019s not long before an error hands Williams a break point. Amazingly, though, Gauff goes for an 108mph second serve and Williams hits a forehand return wide. A fourth chance arrives for Gauff. This time there\u2019s no reprieve for Williams, who nets her final forehand. Gauff can\u2019t believe it. She walks to the net to shake hands with her idol, who greets her with a big, generous smile. Then Gauff lets a few tears roll down her cheeks. In her box her parents are ecstatic. Their daughter\u2019s 15! She\u2019s just knocked the great Venus Williams out of Wimbledon! Oh my! Coco Gauff shakes off the disappointment of dropping her serve by earning a break point with some expert hustling that draws an error from Venus Williams, who then proceeds to clip a volley wide! Gauff breaks to lead 6-4, 5-4 and will serve for the match. Victoria Azarenka, not the unseeded player you want in a first-round draw, takes the first set 6-4 against Alize Cornet on Court 12. On Court 18, Jelena Ostapenko, the former French Open champion, is a set down to Hsieh Su-wei. Jaume Munar\u2019s fizzling out. He plonks an overhead into the net and Kyle Edmund breaks to lead 6-4, 6-4, 3-0. Nice and simple for the British No1. If only the same was true for Grigor Dimitrov, though. The former future Roger Federer\u2019s lowly ranking is demonstrated by his spot on Court 15 and he\u2019s busy making life difficult for himself at the moment. He was two sets up against French qualifier Corentin Moutet, but now he\u2019s a break down in the fourth. Oh Grigor. The youngster finally wobbles. Coco Gauff double-faults on break point and Venus Williams is back in it at 4-4 in the second set. Kyle Edmund is a set away from round two. He leads 6-4, 6-4 against the entertaining but flawed Jaume Munar. The joint second fastest serve of the day has been hit by Coco Gauff. She\u2019s 15. It registered at 116mph. Since you\u2019re asking Venus Williams, her opponent here, is level with Naomi Osaka at the top of the board on 118mph. But here\u2019s a reminder that fasting serving doesn\u2019t always mean accurate serving. A few untimely double faults from Williams are enough for the eerily composed Gauff to earn what could be a pivotal break. The youngster leads 6-4, 3-2. Caroline Wozniacki, the 14th seed, has made a slow start against Sara Sorribes Tormo on Cout 2. She trails 0-4 against the unseeded Spaniard. Elsewhere Daria Kasatkina, the 29th seed, is out after losing 6-3, 6-1 to Australia\u2019s Ajla Tomljanovic. It increasingly looks like Andy Murray and Serena Williams are going to partner up in the mixed doubles. Let\u2019s hope she doesn\u2019t end up withdrawing, though. That\u2019s what happened to John McEnroe when he came out of retirement to partnet with Steffi Graf in 1999. She ended up going deep in the singles, reaching the final, and pulled out of their mixed doubles semi-final. The kid\u2019s serious. Serving for the set, Coco Gauff zings an ace down the middle to lead 40-15. Two set points. She only needs one. Venus Williams, the former champion, nets a backhand and we are one set away from one hell of a story. Venus Williams lashes a few thudding forehands away to stay in the first set. Coco Guaff will serve for it at 5-4. How are her nerves? Jangling, I assume. Such composure from Coco Gauff, easy power in her groundstrokes enough for her to consolidate the break and lead 4-2 against Venus Williams. The 15-year-old\u2019s enjoying her Wimbledon debut at the moment. While all that was going on Coco Gauff broke Venus Williams, who dropped her serve when she fired wide. Gauff, at 15 the youngest ever qualifier into the main draw here, leads 3-2 against her fellow American on Court 1. Kyle Edmund finally decides he might as well take a set point. After plenty of faffing around he converts at the 10th time of asking to win the first set 6-4 against the sprightly Jaume Munar on Centre Court. It\u2019s an entertaining match and it wouldn\u2019t be hugely surprising if Munar nicks a set. Another seed bites the dust: Dusan Lajovic is out, beaten in four by Poland\u2019s Hubert Hurkacz. On Court 2 Caroline Wozniacki has arrived. The 14th seed takes on Spain\u2019s Sara Sorribes Tormo. Does Kyle Edmund want to win the first set on Centre Court? I\u2019ve lost track of how many set points he\u2019s blown now. He needs to be careful here. Daniil Medvedev, the 11th seed, will play Alex Popyrin in the second round after beating Paolo Lorenzi 6-3, 7-6, 7-6. That should be tasty. Meanwhile Milos Raonic has seen off Pranjesh Gunneswaran, beating the Indian 7-6, 6-4, 6-2, while Venus Williams and Coco Gauff are underway on Court 1. Serving to stay in the match, Tsitsipas lets the game run to 30-40, at which point he balloons a forehand long. Thomas Fabbiano gets there in the end, as I always knew he would. The world No89 has beaten the sixth seed, who hastily follows his bitter rival Alexander Zverev out the SW19 exit. This side of the draw suddenly looks rather open. Right, Stefanos Tsitsipas might be about to lose. As, er, I predicted. Thomas Fabbiano leads 5-3 in the fifth set on Court 2. Tsitsipas is serving. Naomi Osaka was so upset about her defeat to Yulia Putintseva that she had to cut her press conference short. Here\u2019s an excerpt: Q. Has it been difficult to get used to the new level of fame that you have? You\u2019ve pretty much become a global superstar over the past few months. NAOMI OSAKA: Can I leave? I feel like I\u2019m about to cry. From 0-2 down to 4-3 up. Things are going encouragingly for Kyle Edmund on a subdued Centre Court, where he leads by a break in the early knockings against Jaume Munar. You sense the crowd are yet to to fully take to young Kyle. They don\u2019t get him yet. He\u2019ll probably need to go on a run to make a name for himself here. Okay, this one is legit. Down goes Alexander Zverev, a pretty lazy, conviction-free volley into the net summing up his afternoon. The sixth seed\u2019s quest to make an impact at a grand slam goes on. He\u2019s been well beaten by Jiri Vesely, a Czech qualifier who\u2019s right to look very pleased with himself given all his recent bad luck with injuries. If you\u2019re willing to believe anything I ever say again, trust me when I tell you Milos Raonic is now two sets up against Pranjesh Gunnerswaran. Meanwhile Guido Pella has beaten Marius Copil 7-6, 5-7, 6-3, 6-4. I did wonder why they were showing endless highlights of Tsitsipas\u2019s best shots on the Court 2 feed. Then I realised it was a fifth set. In my defence I\u2019m sleep deprived. I should probably get a coffee. Ignore that! I got distracted by Matthew Engel and misread the score. Stefanos Tstipas is not out. He\u2019s into a fifth set with Thomas Fabbiano after winning the fourth-set tie-break. Sorry for prematurely penning your demise, Stefanos. Stefanos Tsitsipas sees two set points come and go in the fourth-set tie-break. Thomas Fabbiano is quite the fighter. It\u2019s 6-6 in the breaker. Kyle Edmund and Jaume Munar have arrived on Centre Court. The British No1 has never played the 22-year-old Spaniard before. Stefanos Tsitsipas holds for a tie-break. His hopes are still on the line. Over on Court 2, Thomas Fabbiano is a game away from the second round. The Italian leads 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, 6-5 against Stefanos Tsitsipas, who will serve to stay in the tournament. Elsewhere Gael Monfils, the 16th seed, has won a first-set tie-break against fellow Frenchman Ugo Humbert. And if we\u2019re talking tie-breaks we have to mention Milos Raonic, who\u2019s won one against India\u2019s Pranjesh Gunneswaran on Court 12. Raonic leads by a set and a break. Speaking of feisty competitors, the spiky Danielle Collins is through to the second round. The unseeded American\u2019s beaten Zarina Diyas 6-3, 7-5. A lame attempt at a drop shot from Osaka gives Putintseva two match points. The end is nigh for the world No2. Though she saves the first match point with a big return, she\u2019s only delaying the inevitable, a limp backhand slice into the net sealing her fate. That\u2019s it: the Australian Open and US Open is out, her third-round defeat at the French Open followed by an even earlier exit at Wimbledon. It isn\u2019t easy, you know, this grand slam lark. Mind you, Putintseva is a horrible first-round draw to land. The feisty Kazakh, who has plenty of tricks up her sleeve, appears to have Osaka\u2019s number on grass. Alex Popyrin, the teenage Australian qualifier, has secured a very good win over Pablo Carreno Busta, a former US Open semi-finalist. Popyrin took it 7-6, 7-5, 6-2. Naomi Osaka is on desperately thin ice now. She pulls a backhand wide and Yulia Putintseva breaks to lead 7-6, 5-2 on Centre Court. I should have put money on her. Back to Centre Court, where Yulia Putintseva can spy the finishing line. She leads Naomi Osaka by a set and a break. The world No2 wasn\u2019t kidding when she said she wasn\u2019t comfortable on grass. Not much is going right for her at the moment, as demonstrated by the moment she dumps a backhand volley into the net to hand Putintseva a 7-6, 4-2 lead. Alexander Zverev doesn\u2019t learn. The sixth seed, still so unreliable in grand slams, concludes a dreadful third set by dropping his serve for a second time. Jiri Vesely, who\u2019s had rubbish luck with injuries recently, leads 4-6, 6-, 6-2. Jiri Vesely fights back from 0-40 to hold for a 4-6, 6-3, 5-2 against Alexander Zverev, who really needs to pull his finger out. Back on Centre Court, there\u2019s no sign of a break in the second set between Naomi Osaka and Yulia Putintseva, who continues to cause the world No2 problems. Ivo Karlovic keeps on going. The Croatian ace machine has beaten Andrea Arnaboldi 6-4, 6-4, 7-6. Pierre-Hugues Herbert, Andy Murray\u2019s doubles partner, calmed fears about his fitness after losing to Kevin Anderson earlier. Q. Were you worried yesterday you wouldn\u2019t be able to play? PIERRE-HUGUES HERBERT: I didn\u2019t know the pain I was feeling, so I was -- yes, you start, when you\u2019re in pain and you\u2019re having a Grand Slam, like, the next day, you start imagining bad things. But I\u2019m more positive now that I played my match. Maybe not the best match I could play, but I was playing. My quad feels good, so, yeah, I hope it\u2019s going to be all right. I think it\u2019s gonna be all right. Q. We saw you had the strapping on. Could you feel the pain at all while you were playing today? PIERRE-HUGUES HERBERT: No, it was all right. Really was all right. He was just better today. He played the better match. It was all right. Yeah, for sure when I entered the court, having stopped the practice yesterday after half an hour, I was, yeah, a little bit scared, I would say, but as the match went, I played and, yeah, so from that point it\u2019s positive. Q. Did you speak to Andy yesterday after... PIERRE-HUGUES HERBERT: No (smiling). No, no, no. As soon as I did the medical tests and it was all right, I was feeling better, because I was really scared of the tests. But I don\u2019t want to imagine me having to say anything to Andy about an injury or anything. So, no. There\u2019ll be no repeat of Marketa Vondrousova\u2019s French Open exploits. A finalist at Roland Garros, the 16th seed is out in the first round here after losing 6-4, 6-4 to the USA\u2019s Madison Brengle. At least she\u2019s free to play mixed doubles if she gets a message from Andy Murray. A more surprising shock is on the cards on Court 2. Thomas Fabbiano, the world No89, forges ahead to lead 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 against Stefanos Tsitsipas, whose bitter rival Alexander Zverev also finds himself in a spot of bother on Court 1, where Jiri Vesely leads 4-6, 6-3, 3-0 against the sixth seed. An unsurprising shock on the cards on Centre Court. Yulia Putintseva, always an awkward opponent, has fought back from a break down to take the first set on a tie-break against Naomi Osaka, the world No2. Alexander Zverev isn\u2019t known for winning in straight sets in slams, so it\u2019s no surprise to see him drop the second set against Czech left-hander Jiri Vesely. Zverev still seems to be struggling with his focus. Vesely took it 6-3. Stefanos Tsitsipas has gathered his thoughts and got himself back on level terms on Court 2. The Greek won the second set 6-3 against the impertinent Thomas Fabbiano. It\u2019s still on serve in the third set, as it is in the second on Court 1, where Alexander Zverev is a set up against Jiri Vesely. Felix Auger-Aliassime has his first ever win at a grand slam. The Canadian whizzkid charges to the net to put away a punchy volley and seal a 5-7, 6-2, 6-4, 6-3 win over Vasek Pospisil. The 18-year-old looked very assured despite all the attention that\u2019s been on him in the last few weeks. Coming back from a set down against an experienced opponent is a sign of a strong character. He believes in himself. Anastasija Sevastova is through to the second round. She\u2019s thrashed American qualifier Kristie Ahn 6-3, 6-4. Robin Haase, one of the four players who resigned from the ATP player council over the weekend, has put off-court distractions to one side and reached the second round with a 6-1 6-3, 6-1 win over Jozef Kovalik. Speaking of which, here\u2019s what Kevin Anderson, the vice-chair of the council, said after his win over Pierre-Hugues Herbert. Q. In recent weeks a lot of people said many things about the players council. Do you think they need more transparency with the council? Do you think players have more power when it comes to making the main decisions? KEVIN ANDERSON: There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s going on outside of the scenes, outside of the tennis court. Obviously I\u2019m involved with a lot of it, being on the council. I think the main thing is really not to get too caught up in some of the negative stuff. I\u2019m really proud of everything we\u2019ve been able to achieve. I think tennis as a global sport has continued to reach new heights. Player prize money has gone up a lot. I think more guys are able to make a living playing tennis. By no means are we done. We want to make tennis as an attractive sport to as many people as possible. That\u2019s what\u2019s been focused on. There\u2019s been a lot of outside topics, I guess, or things that we\u2019ve had to deal with that we\u2019re still dealing with. It\u2019s been a bit of a tough process, to be honest with you. I think, as always, the more we can stay together, especially as players, the more we\u2019ll be able to achieve at the end of the day. Q. Do you think there should be more transparency, letting people know what\u2019s going on? KEVIN ANDERSON: I think yes and no. I still think that\u2019s something we can do better. I still think communication can be better. Obviously it\u2019s tough. There\u2019s a lot of information that goes on. I think sometimes management have a difficult time finding a balance between giving players enough information but also understanding and sometimes maybe just giving -- I mean, we\u2019re three days outside of Wimbledon. I feel like they\u2019re sometimes hesitant to give us that information. Sometimes players want maybe too much information. I think we\u2019re still trying to find that balance. Q. Last year you spent six-plus hours locked in a deadlock with John Isner. Last Friday you spent seven hours locked in a deadlock with John Isner. Does the council need a tiebreaker system also? How much does it take out of you on the eve of a slam to be having these long things? Three of the people on your half of the equation already quit. What sort of toll does it have on you? KEVIN ANDERSON: I\u2019ve been on the council now for seven years. I remember years ago already having those feelings. I\u2019ve tried to be very vocal. I think that\u2019s been probably one of the more frustrating parts from my side: I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve been able to communicate or find a way with management yet to try and speed along the process. I feel like it\u2019s amazing how different I\u2019m hearing some of the older guys, especially in the \u201890s, from what I\u2019ve heard, the top guys weren\u2019t nearly as interested in some of the matters that the players are right now. I think it\u2019s great that the players want so much information. I think it\u2019s a very -- what I was saying earlier, there\u2019s a very delicate balance between also trusting our board reps and having them make the best decisions for us. Because we are so involved, these meetings are taking longer. I do feel like one of the highlights from our last meeting was I think moving forward there will be a slightly different not necessarily structure, but the way we go about the meetings, the way we discuss, have the dialogue. I don\u2019t know what that looks like yet. Those are some of the messages I received from our management. I really hope that\u2019s the case because it definitely takes a pretty long toll on me, starting at 5:00 and getting home at 11:30 just a few days before. Yeah, I mean, just not used to sitting around for long periods of time. Sometimes the discussions can get quite intense, as well. I definitely feel like there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement there. Karen Khachanov made a bit of a meal of it, but the powerful young Russian is through to the second round after beating Soonwon Kown 7-6, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5. As for other young guns, Felix Auger-Aliassime is bidding to win in four sets against Vasek Pospisil, Alexander Zverev has won the first set 6-4 against Jiri Vesely (a dangerous qualifier) and Stefanos Tsitsipas remains a set down against Thomas Fabbiano. And do keep an eye on young Alex Popyrin. The Australian qualifier, who made the third round at the Australian Open, has just taken the first set on a tie-break against Pablo Carreno Busta. Er, as I was saying. Naomi Osaka wastes no time breaking Yulia Putintseva, taking advantage of some dismal serving to stomp into a 2-1 lead. In the second match on Centre Court Naomi Osaka faces Yulia Putintseva. Osaka\u2019s form has been scratchy recently. She struggled at the French Open, going out in the third round, and lost to Putintseva on the grass of Birmingham last month. Don\u2019t be surprised if the world No2 goes out here. Stefanos Tsitsipas is shaking his head and trying to contain his frustration. It isn\u2019t going his way at the moment on Court 2. The young Greek can do nothing to stop Thomas Fabbiano from breaking for a 5-4 lead on the first set, before serving it out comfortably. Fabbiano, ranked 89th in the world, is playing very well. Latvia\u2019s Anastasija Sevastova, the 12th seed, leads 6-3, 2-0 against the American qualifier Kristie Ahn. And in more bad news for American hopes Jessica Pegula has lost 6-4, 6-4 to Romania\u2019s Mihaela Buzarnescu on Court 6. Felix Auger-Aliassime clenches his fist after watching a Vasek Pospisil forehand drift into the net. The youngster leads 5-7, 6-2, 6-4 on Court 12. It\u2019s bizarre to think he\u2019s never won a grand slam match before. He\u2019s the 19th seed! The defending champion looks as good as ever, lashing a forehand away to seal a doddle of a win over his German opponent. That was very smooth from Djokovic. He was broken in the first game of the match but was never in any real peril thereafter. A five-set battle ends on Court 15 and former top-1o player Janko Tipsarevic is through,a a 6-4, 6-7, 6-2, 5-7, 6-2 winner over Japan\u2019s Yoshihito Nishioka. Back on Court 12 Felix Auger-Aliassime lands a telling blow midway through the third set, piercing returns and glorious passing shots helping him to a crucial break and a 5-7, 6-2, 4-3 lead over Vasek Pospisil. Ernests Gulbis is out. Alas. The Latvian dandy lost 6-1, 7-6 (12), 6-2 to Leo Mayer. Plenty of budding wonderkids about today. On Court 18 Karen Khachanov has been dragged into a fourth set by Soonwoo Kwon. Khachanov, the 10th seed, leads 7-6, 6-4, 4-6, 1-1. As for Stefanos Tsitsipas, the fascinating young Greek is down an early break to the unseeded Italian Thomas Fabbiano. Simona Halep produces a delightful dink at the net to seal her place in the second round with a 6-4, 7-5 win over Aliaksandra Sasnovich, who will be kicking herself after blowing a 5-2 lead in the second set. A good win for Halep, though, as she had to absorb a lot of heavy hitting from the other side of the net. With that one done the next match on Court 1 sees Alexander Zverev take on Jiri Vesely. Simona Halep survives a set point and holds for 5-5 in the second set on Court 1. Aliaksandra Sasnovich will feel she should have forced a third set now. Aliaksandra Sasnovich serves for the second set on Court 1 and dumps a backhand into the net to let Simona Halep break to love. Ouch. Halep will serve to keep the set alive at 4-5. It\u2019s all square on Court 12. Felix Auger-Aliassime takes the second set 6-2 against Vasek Pospisil. Iga Swiatek made the fourth round at the French Open, but the 18-year-old Polish prodigy\u2019s Wimbledon is over. She\u2019s lost 6-2, 7-6 to Switzerland\u2019s Victoria Golubic. Novak Djokovic holds easily to lead 6-4, 7-5 on Centre Court. Move along, nothing to see here. Novak Djokovic does one of his loud roars. That would have given anyone who\u2019d dozed off in the lunchtime son on Centre Court quite the jolt. \u201cCome onnnnnnnnn!\u201d Djokovic cries, really giving it some, really stretching out that \u201connnnnnnn\u201d, after breaking to lead 6-3, 6-5 against Phillipp Kohlschreiber. There haven\u2019t been too many surprising results so far, but here\u2019s one, Magdalena Rybarikova thumping Aryna Sabalenka, the 10th seed, 6-2, 6-4. That said Rybarikova did reach the semis here in 2017. Thanks, Gregg. And hello again. Away from Centre Court, Karolina Pliskova, a player who really should have a better record here, romps to a 6-2, 7-6 win over Lin Zhu of China. What else is happening? Well, in the all-Canadian affair on Court 12, it\u2019s getting intriguing. Vasek Pospisil stole the first set 7-5, but Felix Auger-Aliassime is 4-1 up in the second. Meanwhile Petra Martic, seeded 24th, has recovered from a set down to defeat the Jennifer Brady 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. What a hold by Kohlschreiber! Here\u2019s giving Centre Court a proper match to watch. He has clung on to his serve again, saving two break points and making it known to the world No 1 that he won\u2019t be a pushover. He leads 5-4 in the second set. Raise your game Novak! Right, Jacob\u2019s back. So, I\u2019ll hand back over to him. Enjoy your afternoon. Halep is moving freely again after her fall. She needs to because Sasnovich is proving a fierce competitor. She has saved a break point to take a 2-1 lead over Halep in the second set. Both players are firing shots at each other with some incredibly loud grunts too. It\u2019s making for a fine spectacle. Tock! Tock! Tock! The pace of the match between Kohlschreiber and Djokovic has picked up. After Djokovic held his serve to love to level the second set at 3-3, he put pressure on the German\u2019s serve by increasing the intensity. Remarkably, the 35-year-old responded brilliantly and raised his game, outlasting the world No 1 from the back of the court in a couple of highly entertaining rallies to get his head in front again at 4-3. Kohlschreiber hasn\u2019t completely folded. He\u2019s kept his head and he\u2019s now 3-2 up in the second set. Simona Halep wins the first set against Aliaksandra Sasnovich 6-4! The seventh seed and 2018 French Open champion was made to work hard by the world No 36 over 50 minutes. She also had to run off a nasty-looking tweak of her knee ligaments after slipping on the lush grass on No 1 court. Come on, hands up who\u2019s going down to the hairdresser\u2019s and asking for this: Kohlschreiber can\u2019t back up the break, though. Djokovic is back in the set at 2-1 and the German is giving himself a good talking to on his chair in the drinks break. He tried to force a couple of rallies there and went long with his forehand when he perhaps should have just stayed in the rally and waited for better opportunities. Perhaps Djokovic has not quite warmed up fully just yet. Kohlschreiber holds serve to love and then breaks Djokovic to give himself the chance of taking a 3-0 lead. Rybarikova takes the first set against No 10 seed Sabalenka 6-2! Quite a surprise that. Djokovic wins the first set against Kohlschreiber 6-3! The German appears to have peaked way too early in this match with that surprise break of the world No 1\u2019s serve in the opening game. The 35-year-old is giving it a go, mind. He controlled a wonderful winning backhand volley at the net at 0-30 in that last game but the defending champion is in full control now. He wraps up the set in 38 minutes. Kohlschreiber is battling gamely with Djokovic. He saves a set point to stay in the first set at 5-3 but the world No 1 is still moving through the gears, calibrating his forehand and stretching his limbs. Here\u2019s Gerard\u2019s Meagher\u2019s report from Wimbledon on Heather Watson\u2019s victory over Caty McNally. The women\u2019s 10th seed, Aryna Sabalenka, is having a stinker of a first set against the world No 139, Magdalena Rybarikova. She\u2019s trailing 5-1 on No 3 court having made a whopping 12 unforced errors. She needs to shake off that rust quickly. Thanks Jacob. Djokovic has broken Kohlschreiber again. Here\u2019s 3-1 up now and serving. That was quite possibly the shortest moment of panic in the history of tennis. The day\u2019s bubbling along nicely but I need some lunch. So allow me to hand over to Gregg Bakowski for a bit. Novak Djokovic breaks back. Panic over. Alert! Alert! Alert! Novak Djokovic has dropped his serve in the very first game on Centre Court! This is not a drill! Phillipp Kohlschreiber has broken the world No1. The USA\u2019s Reilly Opelka will play Stan Wawrinka in the second round. He\u2019s beaten Cedrik-Marcel Stebe 6-3, 7-6, 6-1 to secure his first ever win at Wimbledon. And did you know the 21-year-old is even taller than Ivo Karlovic at 6ft 11in? Now you do. At the moment it looks likely Annett Konetatveit will be Heather Watson\u2019s second-round opponent. The 28th seed won the first set 6-0 against Shelby Rogers, though she\u2019s a break down in the second. There\u2019s still time to turn that round and win in two, though. Elsewhere Petra Martic, the 24th seed, is in a spot of bother against the USA\u2019s Jennifer Brady, who took the first set 6-3 n Court 17, while Karolina Pliskova, fresh from winning the Eastbourne title on the weekend, is 3-0 up in the first set against China\u2019s Lin Zhu on Court 1. Play will begin soon on Centre Court and Court 1. Novak Djokovic and Phillipp Kohlschreiber have arrived on the former and Simona Halep and Aliaksandra Sasnovich are going through the formalities on the latter. Meanwhile the kid everyone\u2019s talking about, Felix Auger-Aliassime, is about to begin against fellow Canadian Vasek Pospisil. That one could be hugely entertaining. Good news for Andy Murray: Pierre-Hugues Herbert is out of the singles and free to concentrate on his doubles partnership with the Scot. The Frenchman was no match for the fourth seed Kevin Anderson, who\u2019s raced through with a 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 win. \u201cPeak Heather Watson,\u201d Tim Griffiths says. \u201cJust about to go for lunch but thought I\u2019d catch the last game. Wowser, four match Points and threee saved breaks in that last game! I don\u2019t just need lunch but a lie down.\u201d Someone tell Judy Murray that Feliciano Lopez has won. The veteran Spaniard appears to have recovered from his epic run at Queen\u2019s. He\u2019s beaten Marcos Giron in three comfortable sets. Watson sees three match points come and go, but she carves out a fourth and is rewarded for her persistence when her 17-year-old opponent nets a forehand on the run. That\u2019s a big win for Watson, who\u2019s been on a rotten run. She roars after the final point, letting it all out, and then buries her face in her towel after returning to her chair. Could this be the jumpstart her career needs? She awaits the winner of Annett Kontaveit, the 28th seed, and the USA\u2019s Shelby Rogers. Stan Wawrinka is through after beating Ruben Bemelmans 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. That\u2019s also how you do it. Roberto Bautista Agut was in no mood for messing around. He\u2019s sent Peter Gojowczk on his way, beating the German 6-3, 6-2, 6-3. That\u2019s how you do it. The scoreline has a deceptive look to it now on Court 12. Heather Watson leads 7-6, 5-1 against Caty McNally, who\u2019s serving to keep the match alive. After all the drama of the first set it\u2019s turned into a cruise for Wild Card Watto. There\u2019s no sign of any drama for either Kevin Anderson or Stan Wawrinka. The former leads 6-4, 6-4 against Pierre-Hugues Herbert, who should be nice and fresh for the doubles with Andy Murray, and the former\u2019s closing in on a straight-sets win over Ruben Bemelmans. The tide is turning on Court 12. After scrapping away for most of the match Heather Watson now leads by a set and a break against Caty McNally. The 10-year age gap is starting to make a difference. We\u2019ve got some completed matches. Elina Svitolina has crushed Daria Gavrilova 7-5, 6-0. Madison Keys has cruised to victory over Luksika Kumkhum, winning 6-3, 6-2. Sofia Kenin, seeded 27th, has beaten Australia\u2019s Astra Sharma 6-4, 6-2. Marie Bouzkova, a lucky loser, is through after beating Mona Barthel 6-3, 6-3. And Dayana Yastremka has seen off Italy\u2019s Camila Giorgi 6-3, 6-3. Heather Watson has somehow won the first set on Court 12. Watson has landed 43% of her first serves and won 60% of her first serves and 38% on her second. She\u2019s made 15 unforced errors and Caty McNally has twice served for the set. Yet it\u2019s Watson\u2019s good fortune to be up against a young opponent whose talent is being undermined by nerves and inexperience on her first grand slam outing. McNally has made 22 unforced errors, dropped her serve four times and run out of steam in the tie-break, losing it 7-3. In scenes akin to last night Under-21 Euros final, Spain\u2019s Roberto Bautista Agut is continuing to make life miserable for Germany\u2019s Peter Gojowczky. The Spaniard leads 6-3, 6-2. Heather Watson saves one set point with a gorgeous forehand down the line. Then Caty McNally fails to take advantage of an inviting high ball on the second and ends up netting a forehand for deuce. She follows that with a double-fault and Watson takes the break point with a rasping forehand that\u2019s too hot for McNally to handle. Tie-break! On Court 18 Elina Svitolina leads by a set and a break against Daria Gavrilova, while Maria Sakkari has just snatched the first set on a tie-break against the USA\u2019s Bernarda Pera. In better news for American fans, though, Caty McNally has just broken again, a brilliant forehand down the line setting her up for a volleyed winner at the net. The American youngster leads 6-5 and will serve for the first set again. Look who\u2019s here. Ach, I\u2019m only kidding. This is Caty McNally\u2019s first ever match in a grand slam main draw. She\u2019s actually playing some really lovely stuff at times, but she\u2019s bound to be nervous. The rollercoaster continues. Caty McNally double-faults on break point, Heather Watson earns a reprieve. It\u2019s 5-5 and, quite frankly, both there\u2019s an argument both players deserve to lose. Heather Watson is chucking in some dismal, powderpuff serves, all of them just begging to be hit. Caty McNally duly obliges, taking command of the game with some fizzing returns, and earning two break points with a deft backhand volley. She converts the first to lead 5-4 and will serve for the opening set. Heather Watson has done well to get back on serve on Court 12. It\u2019s been an error-strewn match. The quality isn\u2019t particularly high. But while Watson\u2019s there for the taking, Caty McNally hasn\u2019t quite been able to press on yet. It\u2019s 4-4. Watson is serving. Feliciano Lopez, triumphant in the singles and the doubles at Queen\u2019s (can someone remind me who partnered the Spaniard in the doubles?), is a set up against American qualifier Marcos Giron on Court 11. I can barely keep up! Stan Wawrinka waits for an error from Ruben Bemelmans on set point and one duly arrives, allowing the Swiss to take the opener 6-3 on Court 2, while Madison Keys has won the first set 6-3 against Luksika Kumkhum. Kevin Anderson bangs down a few heavy serves and takes the first set 6-3 against Pierre-Hugues Herbert on Court 3. Just the six aces from Anderson, who\u2019s won 88% of points off his first serve so far. Things are starting to move now. A few first sets have been settled. Roberto Bautista Agut is a set to the good against Peter Gojowczyk, Reilly Opelka is on top against Cedrik-Marcel Stebe and Marie Bouzkova is looking to take full advantage of entering as a lucky loser - she\u2019s taken the first set 6-3 against Mona Barthel on Court 9. Elina Svitolina, the eighth seed, is up a break and leads 4-3 against Australia\u2019s Daria Gavrilova, who is yet to quite fulfil her potential. Elsewhere Madison Keys, a player who surely has the weapons to flourish on grass, leads 5-2 against Thailand\u2019s Luksika Kumkhum. I recently became a proud father and now I can\u2019t stop whistling nursery rhymes. Current favourite: the one about a short and stout teapot. Anyway on Court 2 Stan Wawrinka, who\u2019s not got much of a pedigree on grass, is in command against Belgium\u2019s Ruben Bemelmans. Is this Wawrinka\u2019s year? He has added Dani Vallverdu in his camp for some grass-court expertise. If he gets going he always poses a threat. But it\u2019s still hard to see him lasting the course here. The surface just doesn\u2019t seem to suit his game. Finally, a hold on Court 12, and it goes to Caty McNally, who comes through deuce to lead 3-1 against the floundering Heather Watson. The crowd would love to see more from Watson, but at the moment she\u2019s showing why it\u2019s been such a struggle for her this year. The atmosphere is very subdued. Kevin Anderson is up and running on Court 3. The South African saved break points in the first game of the match against Pierre-Hugues Herbert and has since broken for a 3-1 lead. Here, if you\u2019d like to find out more about last year\u2019s beaten finalist and semi-final marathon man, someone interviewed him recently. That didn\u2019t last long. Caty McNally mishits a forehand and it flies past the baseline to let Heather Watson back on level terms. Elsewhere Roberto Bautista Agut, the 23rd seed, is dominating against Peter Gojowczyk on Court 4. The Spaniard leads 3-0 already. Oh dear. Heather Watson serves three double-faults in the very first game on Court 12, finds herself down a break point and dumps a backhand wide to lose her serve straight away. Caty McNally\u2019s quick out the blocks. And ... play! Wimbledon 2019 is underway! Balls are flying, lines are facing judgement, the Pimm\u2019s is flowing. Do you think Heather Watson deserves a wild card? She failed to make it out of French Open qualifying and lost in the first round of the Australian Open. She\u2019s had a rotten year and hasn\u2019t done anything of note in singles competition for a while. She\u2019s 27 now; you can\u2019t talk about potential any more. But she is a Brit, so she didn\u2019t have to go through qualifying. Lucky her. Still, she\u2019ll need her wits about her in the first match on Court 12, where she faces American teenager Caty McNally, ranked 165th in the world and making her grand slam debut. Players are heading out now. Tok! Tok! Tokity tok! That\u2019s the sound of them knocking up. We\u2019ll have play soon! The sun\u2019s out, the gates are open and we\u2019re waiting for players to take to courts. The forecast looks good at the moment, so we might not need the new roof on Court 1 to spring into action for a while. Preparatory reading Hello and welcome to day one of Wimbledon 2019! And a very good day to you too, unless you happen to be Rafael Nadal, who was seen being frogmarched into one of the re-education holding pens they have under Centre Court by a stern-looking All England Club official. Constructed specially this year, costing a cool \u00a323.6m to build, the centre has been put in place to deal with dissenting voices such as Nadal, who\u2019s in dire need of a large dose of SW19 nostalgia after all that complaining about the seeding formula they use here. Mark my words, he\u2019ll be back to gushing about strawberries and cream once he\u2019s finished watching the three-hour highlights reel of Tim Henman\u2019s very best volleys, complete with a Sue Barker voiceover of course Naughty Rafa, though! All that whinging about being shunted down to No3 seed to make way for Roger Federer. It\u2019s Wimbledon. They can do whatever they want. If they want Kyle Edmund Centre Court, they get Kyle Edmund on Centre Court. You can complain all you like about the fact Edmund\u2019s seeded 30th and hasn\u2019t done much all year, but he\u2019s the British No1, so he gets the prime slot. He\u2019s on third on Centre against the tricky Spaniard, Jaume Munar. Munar\u2019s from Mallorca. Rafa Nadal\u2019s from Mallorca! But that\u2019s enough Nadal chat for now. Despite the seed furore Nadal has at least ended up on the opposite side of the draw to Novak Djokovic, who begins his defence of his title with a tough one against the experienced German, Phillipp Kohlschreiber, in the first match on Centre Court. Djokovic is bidding for his fifth Wimbledon title, which would bring him level with Bjorn Borg, and his 16th major. But he has lost to Kohlschreiber this year and endured semi-final disappointment when he met Dominic Thiem at the French Open last month. Caution is advisable. Might there be a day of upsets, then? The second match on Centre sees Naomi Osaka face the pugnacious Kazakh, Yulia Putintseva, who might fancy her chances of upsetting the world No2. Osaka is the Australian Open and US Open champion, but she\u2019s been troubled by injury of late, lost early in the French Open and is uncomfortable on grass. As ever, you never know what to expect from the women. Simona Halep, the seventh seed, opens on Court 1 against Aliaksandra Sasnovich and suffered an early exit last year. And in the last match of the day on that venue, a potential firecracker: Venus Williams, the brilliant veteran champion, in an all-American tussle with the potential future of US tennis, the precociously talented Cauri \u201cCoco\u201d Gauff, at 15 the youngest player ever to qualify for the main draw here. The first round offers so many delights. Look around and you\u2019ll see Felix Auger-Aliassime, seeded 19th despite possessing no grand slam record, against another Canadian, Vasek Pospisil. There\u2019s Kevin Anderson, a beaten finalist last year, up against Pierre-Hugues Herbert, Andy Murray\u2019s doubles partner. Stefanos Tsitsipas against Thomas Fabbiano. Stan Wawrinka against Ruben Bemelmans. Grigor Dimitrov on Court 15. Poor Grigor! There\u2019s the power of Jelena Ostapenko, unseeded despite winning the French Open two years ago, against the wiles of Hsieh Su-wei. Caroline Wozniacki against Sara Sorribes Tormo. An intriguing unseeded battle between Alize Cornet and Victoria Azarenka. Marketa Vondrousva, beaten in the French Open final by Ash Barty, against the USA\u2019s Madison Brengle. And let\u2019s not forget Britain\u2019s Heather Watson trying to prove she deserves her main draw wild card when she faces the USA\u2019s Madison Brengle. Come on, Rafa! Turn that frown upside down. Play begins at: 11am BST on the outside courts, 1pm BST on the show courts.",

It has long been known that people find it easier to tell apart members of their own race than those of a different race. But the mechanism behind this has been the topic of much research. Now a new study backs up the idea that the phenomenon is rooted, at least in part, in visual and neural processes. Nick Camp, the co-author of the research from Stanford University, said: \u201cWhat it tells us is that our tendency to see members of our own [racial] group as individuals and de-individuate members of other racial groups, that is something that happens on sight.\u201d The team said the study was important as it showed that what human senses picked up was not necessarily an accurate representation of reality.

Here\u2019s the full statement:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>With regard to the actions by the crowd in admiralty, pan-democratic legislators and Civil Human Rights Front make the following joint statement.</p> \n   <p>Carrie Lam states today at the July 1 reception, that she would respond to people\u2019s demands, become more open and tolerant. She has not shown any sincerity to respond or to communicate so far. She has rejected to face the society, ignored the demands of the people and pushed youngsters towards desperation.</p> \n   <p>Pan-democratic legislators have requested to meet with Lam today to seek solution in this political crisis. But the request of dialogue has been rejected by Lam. We cannot be angrier at her rejection to the request, which proves her \u201cwillingness to listen\u201d to be the ugliest political lie. Lam\u2019s arrogance revealed by her public responses since June 9 have only poured fuel to the flame, and lead to the crisis today. Lam is the culprit.</p> \n   <p>We hereby request that Lam faces the public view directly, respond to the demands of the people raised since June 9, solves the crisis that she started. She should also stop any crackdown on the public demands and avoid any injury.</p> \n   <p>We reiterate the five demands of Civil Human Rights Front, Pan-democratic legislators and Hongkongers raised since June:</p> \n   <p>1. Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill;</p> \n   <p>2. Investigate responsibility to shoot;</p> \n   <p>3. Retract the characterisation of protest as riot;</p> \n   <p>4.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to end our live coverage now, thanks for reading. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s main news story on today\u2019s events, from Christy Choi and Verna Yu in Hong Kong. Police stopped a public bus following the demonstration outside the Legco building, Verna Yu says, reportedly searching for protesters. They stopped the bus around 1.15am and checked all the passengers. Police scrutinized their ID cards, ordered passengers to remove their masks, and at 1.45am were still searching people. Passengers were made to stand on one side of the bus while the police searched others. Mainland China\u2019s entirely state-controlled media made no mention of Monday\u2019s protests, according to the Associated Press: The main evening news broadcast carried video of the flag-raising ceremony, along with parts of Lam\u2019s address and shots of Hong Kong residents praising displays put on by the People\u2019s Liberation Army garrison in the territory. Chinese media outlets have barely reported on the protests since they began last month, other than to blame foreign forces for stirring up unrest. This was the scene outside Legco earlier: The Hong Kong hospital authority said it had treated 54 people following today\u2019s protests, according to the South China Morning Post. Three people are reportedly in a serious condition: As of 11pm, 38 men and 16 women had been taken to hospital after the various protests on Monday, including the July 1 march, according to the Hospital Authority. They did not give a breakdown of how many injured came from each protest. Among them, one man and two women are in serious condition. Five men and three women are stable. All others have been discharged. This is from Phila Siu, a journalist at the South China Morning Post: Here\u2019s some pictures from outside the Legco building in Hong Kong, as police clear protestors from the scene: Christy Choi sends this report from Hong Kong, where it looks set to be a long night as police are clashing with protesters outside the Legislative Council building: Police armed with shields and riot gear held up black flag the reads: \u201cTear gas warning,\u201d then shot off several rounds of teargas into the protesters. They climbed over hurdles and barricades put up by protesters earlier in the day and charged at the people gathered. Outside Legco protesters wearing hard hats, goggles and masks, clutching umbrellas ran away, as smoke filled the air around them. Several protesters poured water to extinguish a tear gas shot that landed on the ground. The police special task squad in black gear were at the scene. Earlier in the evening, protesters stormed the Legislative building and vandalized the interior heavily, after hours spent trying to break into the government HQ complex. Police left protestors largely unhindered \u2013 a move that lawmaker Fernando Cheung suggested may police have been a deliberate tactic, aimed at swinging public sentiment against the protest movement with the help of violent and destructive scenes. Christy writes that for the past month, protesters have been demanding the withdrawal of a bill that would allow extraditions to the Chinese mainland. The rallies are the latest manifestation of growing fears that China is stamping down on the city\u2019s freedoms and culture with the help of the finance hub\u2019s pro-Beijing leaders. Although returned to Chinese rule in 1997, Hong Kong is still administered separately under an arrangement known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. The city enjoys rights and liberties unseen on the autocratic mainland, but many residents fear Beijing is already reneging on that deal. This update is from Reuters: Police arrived by bus and ran into position as about a thousand protesters gathered around the Legislative Council building in the heart of the former British colony\u2019s financial district. Police fired several rounds of tear gas as protesters held up umbrellas to protect themselves or fled. Plumes of smoke billowed across major thoroughfares and in between some of the world\u2019s tallest skyscrapers. Here\u2019s a look at the scene outside Legco: Live footage from outside Legco shows police gathered at one of the holes in the glass that protesters created earlier. Some officers are holding blue signs which say: \u201cThis meeting or procession is in breach of the law. Disperse or we may use force.\u201d Other officers are waving black signs which say: \u201cTear smoke\u201d. Verna Yu reports that some protesters are throwing objects at police. Hong Kong police are using teargas outside the Legco building, Verna Yu reports. \u201cThe scene outside Legco is filled with smoke, people screaming and running away,\u201d Verna says. The livestream set up by protesters shows clouds of gas filling the air outside Legco. Scores of police officers, wearing riot gear and carrying plastic shields, are moving towards protestors. Protesters wearing hard hats, goggles and mask with umbrellas running away, Verna reports. Police have climbed over hurdles and barricades put up by protesters earlier in the day. This is from Jon Williams, managing director of RTE News: Hong Kong police claim some protestors have scattered \u201charmful powder\u201d towards its officers. The Guardian is unable to confirm this. Earlier police said it will \u201cuse appropriate force\u201d to clear protestors from the Legco building. Here\u2019s the police statement: A group of violent protestors stormed the Legislative Council Complex by mills barriers, iron poles and miscellaneous objects this afternoon, leaving the complex facilities seriously damaged. During the period, some protestors scattered unknown powder at police officers at scene, causing some of them to feel unwell. Initial inspection by the Fire Services Department confirmed the unknown powder is slightly toxic and prolonged contact will lead to swollen and sensitive skin. Large amount of water is required to cleanse and decontaminate the substance. Feeling unwell, two police officers were sent to hospital after getting in touch with the powder at the Legislative Council Complex. They were discharged after treatment and decontamination. Police severely condemn the protesters who used harmful powder to attack police officers. Police will conduct comprehensive investigation and follow up the case in stringent manner. The Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), the organizers of the main protest march downtown, and pan-democratic lawmakers say Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam has rejected their approach for talks to end the crisis. CHRF has reissued its call for Lam to step down. Here\u2019s the full statement: With regard to the actions by the crowd in admiralty, pan-democratic legislators and Civil Human Rights Front make the following joint statement. Carrie Lam states today at the July 1 reception, that she would respond to people\u2019s demands, become more open and tolerant. She has not shown any sincerity to respond or to communicate so far. She has rejected to face the society, ignored the demands of the people and pushed youngsters towards desperation. Pan-democratic legislators have requested to meet with Lam today to seek solution in this political crisis. But the request of dialogue has been rejected by Lam. We cannot be angrier at her rejection to the request, which proves her \u201cwillingness to listen\u201d to be the ugliest political lie. Lam\u2019s arrogance revealed by her public responses since June 9 have only poured fuel to the flame, and lead to the crisis today. Lam is the culprit. We hereby request that Lam faces the public view directly, respond to the demands of the people raised since June 9, solves the crisis that she started. She should also stop any crackdown on the public demands and avoid any injury. We reiterate the five demands of Civil Human Rights Front, Pan-democratic legislators and Hongkongers raised since June: 1. Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill; 2. Investigate responsibility to shoot; 3. Retract the characterisation of protest as riot; 4. Release arrested protesters; 5. Carrie Lam, step down! The Legislative Council Secretariat has announced that the Legco will be closed to the public indefinitely. The full statement: The Legislative Council Secretariat announced today [July 1] that all guided tours and services to the public in the LegCo Complex, including the service of the Public Complaints Office and visits to the LegCo Library, Archives and Children\u2019s Corner, are suspended until further notice. Verna Yu, our reporter on the ground in Hong Kong, has been speaking to a 24-year-old protester, who asked not to be named. (A number of participants fear repercussions for their actions.) \u201cWe all know that the rioting charge carries 10 years in jail, [the maximum sentence] but why did we still do it? It\u2019s because we have utterly lost hope in this place,\u201d the protester said. \u201cThey have not responded to any of our demands [of withdrawal of the extradition law and investigating police violence].\u201d The 24-year-old said he didn\u2019t particularly want to barge into the Legco, but since there were a small number of people who went in already, he thought he should support them and make up the numbers, because he believed it would make it harder for the police to charge many people. Hong Kong police have issued a statement on their Facebook page, warning they will \u201cuse an appropriate level of force\u201d if protesters do not leave the Legislative Chamber building. [I\u2019ve added bold for emphasis]: The police issues the strongest condemnation to the rioters who violently mobbed and forcibly entered the Legislative Council. The police will clear the vicinity shortly and if obstructed or resisted, the police would use an appropriate level of force. The police urge protesters who are not involved to leave the Legislative Council vicinity as quickly as possible. After hours of trying to break into government HQ, protesters have stormed the Legislative Chamber building and have vandalised the interior heavily, spraying graffiti on the chamber walls and attempting to install a Hong Kong colonial flag featuring the British Union Jack Police have issued several warnings and appeared to be gearing up for violent clashes with the crowd, but have left the protesters largely unhindered in their efforts It has been suggested that this inaction from the police was a trap, aimed at swinging public sentiment against the protest movement with the help of violent and destructive scenes The majority of people who turned out in today\u2019s protests marched peacefully through downtown Hong Kong without any scenes of violence or chaos I am now handing over to my colleague Adam Gabbatt. Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt just tweeted about the Hong Kong protests: Verna Yu reports that protesters have unfurled a black banner inside the chamber with the words \u201cThere are no rioters, only a violent regime.\u201d Christy Choi writes: Protesters are sensitive about the government referring to them as rioters. This is partly because a rioting charge carries an up to ten year jail term, and also because the government had labelled an earlier much less violent clash on June 12 as rioting. Videos had circulated of mostly peaceful protesters \u2013 a handful had been seen throwing bricks \u2013 being beaten and pepper sprayed by police. Police that day fired 150 rounds of teargas and even rubber bullets. They and the government later back-tracked on this designation after an estimated 2 million people took to the streets in protest \u2013 and kept calling for the shelving of the controversial extradition law amendment bill. James Griffiths from CNN International says there will be a public backlash and quotes the vice-chair of the democratic Labour party Fernando Cheung, who describes the latest events as a \u201ctrap\u201d set by the government for the protesters. Images from the Legislative Council chamber: Still no sign of police, it seems: Verna Yu reports that other graffiti slogans tagged on the chamber walls read \u201crelease the righteous fighters\u201d and \u201cwe want genuine universal suffrage\u201d. Protesters have barged into the council chamber and sprayed the walls with graffiti such as \u201canti extradition law\u201d. One young man was seen trying to install a Hong Kong colonial flag - which features the Union Jack - over the Hong Kong special administration region emblem, and eventually resorting to black spray paint instead. Pretty incredible scenes of chaos from inside the Ledco building. Somehow, protesters have set up a feed with nine different screens simultaneously showing live footage from various points inside the building, providing a flood of visuals from the epicentre of destruction. At some point, protesters took to framed portaits of politicians - unclear of whom exactly, but said to be those of past chair people from the Legislative Council - and started defacing them with poles and hammers. Live footage shows protesters vandalising the building\u2019s interior, driving metal trolleys into walls and throwing chairs around. Hundreds of protesters have now properly broken into the Legislative Council building, and are moving in with home-made shields. Our reporter Christy Choi says, judging from local TV live coverage, it appears the police have cleared from the areas they had been occupying earlier inside the building. It looks as if protesters are running through the entire complex. Previously, an internal barrier had prevented the crowd from penetrating the building properly. The police now seem to be using pepper spray or smoke against the protesters at the legislative council building. The Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), the organisers of the main protest march downtown, have said they \u201ccannot reach an agreement with police\u201d regarding the protests around the Legco building. Issuing a warning to protesters who decide to join the Legco crowd, CHRF said: \u201cDue to the above changes, march from Southorn Playground to Chater Road is not covered by letter of no objection issued by police. We hereby urge protesters to note possible legal implications. And please always take care of your own safety.\u201d Our reporter on the ground Verna Yu says she has been urged at least ten times today not to take pictures of the protests outside the Legco building, as participants fear repercussions for their actions. While the main march is officially authorised by police, the smaller one at Legco is not, and protesters could face riot or illegal assembly charges and up to ten years of prison. This from Quartz\u2019s Isabella Steger on the atmosphere outside the damaged Legislative Council building: As night sets, yet more protesters are pouring into the area surrounding the government HQ, building a sea of yellow helmets. The crowd is fired up with megaphone announcements and occasional chants. The main protest march still flows through downtown Hong Kong. In a joint statement, 41 pro-government lawmakers condemn what they describe as \u201cextremely radical and violent acts\u201d, such as the occupying of roads and damaging the Legco building, the South China Morning Post reports. \u201cThese extremely radical violent elements seriously undermined social order and peace. They did these deliberately, disrupted public order and challenged the rule of law. It is not what they call acts to show they love and cherish Hong Kong,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe sternly condemn their wrongdoings and appeal to the general public who love peace, and firmly believe in the core values of Hong Kong, to draw a line with them. Jointly send them a message that they cannot undermine social order.\u201d The legislators also say they are grateful to police for holding fast to their posts with professionalism and restraint. The question is for how long police will tolerate that protesters have thus far ignored all warnings and continue to charge. This from BuzzFeed\u2019s Rosalind Adams: Hong Kong protesters are not only protesting against the extradition law and leadership: The latest statement from Hong Kong police goes: \u201cThe HKSAR government strongly condemns and deeply regrets the extremely violent acts committed by some protesters who stormed the Legislative Council (LegCo) Complex this afternoon (July 1), using a roll cage trolley as a ram and iron poles to shatter glass doors of the LegCo. A government spokesman said Hong Kong is a society that respects the rule of law, and has never tolerated violence. Protesters who resort to violence must stop their acts immediately. The Police will take appropriate enforcement action to protect public order and safety.\u201d There is evidence that the government is trying to be restrained in their response to protesters. Our reporter Christy Choi says there has been no sight of Special Tactical Squad police yet, a special force that was sent into tamer clashes on previous occasions. So far, the authorities are sticking to verbal appeals. Another protester, 32, who had his head and neck covered with a black scarf and gave his name as Alan, told Verna Yu: \u201cMillions have come out to protest and the government ignored our requests. This [violence] is to give the government more pressure. We don\u2019t know if it will work but we\u2019re hoping to find a way to get the government to take us seriously. If it doesn\u2019t work, we have nothing to lose. We\u2019ve got to try it. What channel is there to make Carrie Lam listen to us? We want to show our determination to get what we need to get, whatever the cost is!\u201d Our reporter Verna Yu says more protesters are pouring into the vicinity of the Legislative Council building, filling the Tamar park and nearby areas, estimates there are thousands. The crowd is chanting \u201cgo!\u201d, again, and is \u201crowdy and noisy\u201d, she says. The main protest march in downtown meanwhile seems to be perfectly peaceful. Protesters can now be seen entering the building. Images of now green-vested riot police in formation inside the Legislative Council building are appearing on local live feeds. They carry rifles with the words \u201cless lethal\u201d on them, suggesting they are prepared to fire rubber bullets or bean bag rounds. This from Bloomberg\u2019s Fion Li: This from Laura Warne from the South China Morning Post: Protesters can now be seen stripping large metal poles away from the building facade, before passing them backwards through the crowd. One young protester in his 20s, called Carl, told our reporter on the ground Verna Yu: \u201cEverything that has happened is the outcome from the government ignoring us. They asked for it. No one wants to come out on a hot day like this. But if I don\u2019t come out today HK will be finished!\u201d Riot police inside the Legislative Council building are now holding a red poster with the words \u201cStop charging or we use force\u201d up from behind the windows. This from the main protest march: Protesters are still working on smashing through the building\u2019s front, although it is not clear whether it is their intention to actually break in or whether they only seek to cause damage. Large wooden panels could be seen being carried through the crowd, one protester hurled a stone against one window, with minimal effect. Riot police are moving inside the building, but so far they have let protesters carry on. Christy Choi says they are looking \u201cantsy\u201d. Protesters are finding it hard to break through the glass completely, but have found a technique and now attack edges first, before tearing pieces of glass front away with their hands. Some members of the press on the ground can be seen climbing through holes in the buildings the protesters have made. Riot police are now in motion, and can be seen running inside the fence. The efforts of protesters are now frenzied, they are using metal shields and poles, tirelessly pounding into the building. Although the glass is pretty resilient, it has been smashed in various places. The crowd is cheering on the frontline protesters hammering away at doors and windows and saying: \u201cGo for it!\u201d, Verna Yu reports from the scene. Much of the action is masked by umbrellas. Protesters have started pounding against the building\u2019s glass front again. A metal barricade has been carried away by the crowd, and protesters are kicking it to make noise. More scenes of protesters hacking against other windows emerge on live footage. After a period of relative calm, protesters are now rushing to the forecourt of the Legislative Council building, where riot police have got into formation a short while ago, inside the fence. Despite sweltering heat at currently 33\u00b0, protesters are turning out in the third anti-extradition bill march in a month, albeit in smaller numbers so far it seems. This from CNN International\u2019s Julia Hollingsworth: These are secenes from the main protest march taking place in Hong Kong today, tweeted a short while ago by local reporter Eric Cheung: Protesters are now calmly surrounding the door, from which the lower half is now completely missing. Dozens of police in riot gear can be seen standing inside the building. Riot police inside the building can be seen putting helmets on and adjusting gear on live footage. Protesters have further damaged the door, but retreated again. There is a lot of shouting, and things seem to be getting more hectic. A few moments ago, a protester resumed smashing into the already severely cracked glass door with what looked like a metal pole, then retreated again. Many protesters are shielding themselves with umbrellas from the cameras. Our reporter on the ground Verna Yu says the crowd is getting fired up again with \u201cHong Kong people, go for it!\u201d chants like earlier. Here a picture from AFP: Hello everyone, I\u2019m taking over from my colleague Kate Lyons now. Reuters have tweeted a video capturing dramatic scenes outside Hong Kong\u2019s Legisalative Council building from earlier, showing protesters ramming a glass door with a metal trolley. A short while ago loud, frantic ramming of the door could be heard again on local live footage, but right now things seem to have calmed down somewhat for the moment. Pro-democracy protesters have attempted to storm the Legislative Council building in Hong Kong during a day when huge protests are expected across the city. Protesters are using a metal trolley and metal bar to ram the glass doors of the building, while dozens of police officers stand inside the Legislative Council in full riot gear. Pro-democracy lawmakers tried to stop the protesters by physically blocking the metal trolley. They were dragged away and tackled by other protesters. They report being beaten and injured in the struggle. The protests come as Hong Kongers have taken to the streets for protests marking the 22nd anniversary of the handover of the former British colony to China. Protesters were out from the early hours of Monday morning, blocking streets around key buildings, as Carrie Lam, the leader of Hong Kong, took part in a ceremony to mark the anniversary. Police were involved in violent clashes with protesters, who report being beaten with batons and sprayed with pepper spray. Several people were taken away in ambulances. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s leader, attended a ceremony to mark the anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong to China, which is traditionally held outdoors. This year it was held inside, ostensibly due to rain, but it is thought the protests may have also played a part. In her speech Lam referred to the protests, saying they had made her realise \u201cthe need to grasp public sentiments accurately\u201d. She also said: \u201cI am also fully aware that while we have good intentions, we still need to be open and accommodating.\u201d The sanctioned protest started at 2:30pm local time. It was due to make its way through the city before ending at the entrance to the Legislative Council, but the path has had to be diverted due to the violence outside the building. Verna Yu, on the ground at the site of the Legislative Council building protest, interviewed pro-democracy lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting, who said that together with about five lawmakers, he was roughly handled by dozens of young protesters, some of whom punched him and pulled his arms when he was trying to stop them ramming the doors of the building with the metal trolley. \u201cThey simply wouldn\u2019t listen to me, the movement at large is peaceful, but some young people are overwhelmed by a strong sense of helplessness and they\u2019re emotionally charged,\u201d he said. A rally was scheduled to leave from Victoria Park at 3pm, says Christy Choi, but the violence at the Legislative Council building looks set to disrupt that. The United Civil Human Rights Front, the organisers, said the end of march would be diverted to Chater Garden, Central in the central business district of Hong Kong, given what\u2019s happening at the legislature, which was the original destination of the march. It\u2019s unclear if police have approved the change of plan. The force had earlier asked organisers if they could: 1. End the rally in Wanchai 2. Postpone the rally 3. Hold a gathering in Victoria Park. The rally route runs just parallel to Harcourt road on the southern side of the government complex, where the legislature the protesters are trying to break into is located. From what we can see the violence is limited to that one entrance, and as of now doesn\u2019t look likely to spread to the rest of the rally \u2013 though this will be of concern to police and marchers alike. The map below gives a sense of where all this is going on. \u2018They were ramming for the sake of ramming,\u2019 says pro-democracy politician Pro-democracy lawmaker Kwok Ka-ki, who was trying to stop protesters from ramming the Legislative Council entrance, who was roughly handled, spoke to Verna Yu, our reporter on the ground after he was forcibly pulled away from the entrance of the building: \u201cI was trying to reason with the young people, persuading them to stay peaceful. I told them if they\u2019re convicted with a riot charge they could be sentence to ten years, but they said they didn\u2019t care. I guess it is their choice. \u201cThey were ramming for the sake of ramming.\u201d The protesters have managed to make a huge hole in the glass. The rest of the pane is holding, but they have done serious damage to the door. Police are spraying protesters with liquid through the hole in the glass doors of the Legislative Council that protesters have made by repeatedly ramming them with a metal trolley and metal bar. A flurry of umbrellas went up to protect protesters when the spray \u2013 most likely pepper spray \u2013 came out from inside the building, where dozens of armed police in full riot gear are waiting. This group of protesters outside the Legislative Council building are just one group of protesters in Hong Kong today. There is an officially sanctioned march that is due to take place throughout the city today, that was meant to end at the Legislative Council building, but now looks like it will take a different route. Protesters are shouting: \u201cRelease the righteous fighters!\u201d and \u201cRetract the evil law!\u201d and are attaching more metal poles to the front of the trolley that they are using to ram into the glass doors of the building. Police are still waiting inside the Legislative Council building holding a large red banner that warns protesters not to charge or police will use force. Protesters have resumed smashing the glass door \u2013 confirmed from live footage and our reporter on the ground \u2013 using the metal recycling trolley. There is a huge amount of noise and shouting, with the crowd shouting \u201cHong Kong people, go for it!\u201d Things are very tense. Apologies, we had up a post that said the group were beating the glass door with a pole again. That was actually from about half an hour ago, but was being rebroadcast and had been mistakenly captioned \u201clive\u201d. Our reporter on the ground confirms that no one is beating the door now and we have taken that post down. The lawmakers who are trying to stop the attempt to break into the council building are pushing back the metal recycling trolley that was being used to bash into the glass door. Wu Chi Wai, chairman of the Democratic Party is refusing to let go of the trolley. Our reporter Verna Yu is in front of the Legislative Council building, where protesters have gathered and in the last half an hour were attempting to storm the building, repeatedly smashing into the glass doors with a metal trolley and a metal pole. She says the atmosphere is \u201cvery tense\u201d. Demonstrators have stopped trying to beat in the door, and it seems some among the protesters are trying to stop the group, including lawmakers Lam Cheuk Ting, Roy Kwong and Eddy Chu. Protesters are yelling at them and telling them to go away. At one point the lawmakers resisted against the metal trolly used to smash against one of the legislature\u2019s glass doors, using themselves as a human shield to prevent more damage to the building. People restrained a man with a red helmet who was clinging to the same metal trolly, calling for calm. The lawmakers are repeating: \u201cDon\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it.\u201d They have been telling protesters to look at the policemen behind the glass. \u201cWhat good will it do if they come out?\u201d Christy Choi reports that legislators from the pro-democracy camp and an independent lawmaker are standing between the protesters and the police. Lawmaker Ted Hui told police not to come out to avoid further injuries. It\u2019s unclear how the standoff will be resolved, but some officers inside Legco have begun removing their helmets. Those in the front line, pressed up against the glass, have keep on full protective gear. Independent lawmaker Eddie Chu is standing facing the police with two hands held up in the air. Legislators are using hand gestures, moving their hands downwards with open palms, to call for calm from both sides. We\u2019re seeing videos of deliveries of helmets and umbrellas arriving for the protesters and being passed to the front of the group, as well as barricades being moved toward the front of the group. But the protesters seem to have stopped their attempts to break into the Legislative Council building for now. The group are now standing up against the glass doors \u2013 rather than before, when the group had left a large gap in front of the door, that left room for the metal trolley to be pushed against the door. Some protesters at the front of the group are trying to talk to police through the glass. It seems protesters have stopped ramming the glass doors for now, but there is still a large group of protesters standing outside the doors and a large group of police officers, in riot gear, standing on the other side of the glass door. It is tense. Christy Choi, in Hong Kong, has sent this report: A handful of protesters are ramming the glass door using a metal paper recycling trolly, cracking the glass on an entryway that lawmakers usually use to enter the legislative council building. Lines of riot police are standing by right behind the glass panels. They\u2019re holding up a red flag that says \u201cstop charging or we use force\u201d. Civic Party\u2019s Kwok Ka-ki and other Pan-democratic lawmakers were on site earlier asking both police and protesters not to resort to violence. As today is a public holiday, no meetings are taking place. It\u2019s unclear why the protesters are taking aim at the building. Legislators Lok Yu Chung, Kwok Ka-ki and Fernando Cheung dressed in black have now come between the protesters and the building. Police inside the Legislative Council building can be seen in footage bracing against the window with shields, as protesters gathered outside ram the glass door, which is cracked, with a metal trolley. Some of the protesters are trying to stop the attempt to storm the building, standing in front of the trolley, but they are dragged away or tackled., when they try to stand int he way of the trolley. We\u2019re seeing footage out of Hong Kong that shows protesters trying to break into the Legislative Council building. It seems that a large group of protesters, holding umbrellas have gathered outside the Legislative Council building and are trying to break down the glass door of the building by ramming a metal trolley into it. It seems that the group of protesters is divided about this tactic, with pro-democracy legislator Leung Yiu-chung trying to stand in the way of the trolley, before he was tackled by others in the group. A very inflammatory image from the Hong Kong protests. Winnie the Pooh has become a lighthearted way for people across China to mock their president, Xi Jinping, who allegedly resembles the beloved bear. In 2018, Chinese censors banned the release of Christopher Robin, a new film adaptation of AA Milne\u2019s story about Winnie the Pooh, for fear of mocking the president. Christy Choi in Hong Kong reports that Hong Kong police say 13 of their officers were injured and sent to hospital in this morning\u2019s clashes. They also told protesters to leave immediately, and warned the public to stay away from Wanchai and Admiralty for the time being. It\u2019s unclear how many protesters have been sent to hospital, though images on social media have shown several people being carried away on stretchers and treated by emergency services. Public hospitals in recent weeks faced heavy criticism after media reported police were arresting protesters who had sought treatment for their injuries- on hospital premises. The hospitals issued a statement after saying they would strictly protect patient confidentiality. Protesters have gathered in the streets of Hong Kong on the 22nd anniversary of the handover of the former British colony to China, where they were involved in tense standoffs with protesters, that occasionally turned violent. There are traditionally both pro- and anti-China protests on 1 July, but this year the protesters are expected to be much bigger and more heated in light of the fact that the city is in the grip of its biggest political crisis in decades. Protesters arrived in the early hours of the morning, carrying umbrellas and wearing masks. They have seized three key thoroughfares, deploying metal and plastic barriers to block the way. Police were involved in violent clashes with protesters, who report being beaten with batons and sprayed with pepper spray. Several people were taken away in ambulances. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s leader, attended a ceremony to mark the anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong to China, which is traditionally held outdoors. This year it was held inside, ostensibly due to rain, but it is thought the protests may have also played a part. In her speech Lam referred to the protests, saying they had made her realise \u201cthe need to grasp public sentiments accurately\u201d. She also said: \u201cI am also fully aware that while we have good intentions, we still need to be open and accommodating.\u201d After the ceremony concluded, police retreated and the atmosphere in the streets became more relaxed. The sanctioned protest is due to be held at 2:30 local time (in about three hours) and thousands are expected to take to the streets. We\u2019re going to pause the blog for now, but will kick things off again when action starts up again in the afternoon. Our full story is here. Some of the protesters\u2019 signs today. Verna Yu reports that after the flag ceremony ended, police have retreated and the atmosphere is more relaxed. Protesters are digging up bricks from pavements today, to be used as weapons, our reporter on the ground Verna Yu reports. Virginia Lau at TicToc has curated these front pages of Hong Kong papers. Verna Yu explains the significance of today\u2019s ceremony, at which Carrie Lam spoke, being held indoors. The handover anniversary ceremony, normally held at the Golden Bauhinia square, was moved indoors, apparently due to rain but also probably so that dignitaries would not be able to hear the loud protests outside the venue. Giant water-filled barriers have already been set up in the vicinity of Wanchai North, where the flag-raising ceremony and handover reception are held, but protesters got as near as possible and occupied several roads. Christy Choi reports that just outside the government offices in Admiralty protesters have replaced the Chinese flag with a black flag flying at two-third mast and lowered the Hong Kong flag to half-mast. While Carrie Lam said she is wiling to open channels of discussion, reporters in Hong Kong are expressing disappointment after Lam left the ceremony without speaking to the press. Earlier, lawmaker Helena Wong was led out by security after she yelled out for Carrie Lam to step down and withdraw the extradition bill. Our reporter Verna Yu interviewed someone who was pepper sprayed this morning by police when he was among dozens of protesters advancing towards the police line. He said that police used batons to hit protesters, who defended themselves with umbrellas. Adding that protesters did not throw things. Our reporter Verna Yu is out on the streets of Hong Kong. She says the atmosphere is tense on Tim Mei Avenue outside the Legislative Council. Hundreds protesters in black wearing hard hats, masks and goggles and holding umbrella in stand off with police in front of Citic building. On Lung Wo Road, some protesters have dug up bricks and built make shift barricades from road side metal barriers. Here\u2019s more on Carrie Lam\u2019s speech from Christy Choi. In her speech marking the 22nd anniversary of Hong Kong\u2019s return to Chinese rule, Chief Executive Carrie Lam offered an apology, saying she knew that the government has \u201ca lot to improve.\u201d \u201cThis has made me fully realise that I, as a politician, have to remind myself all the time of the need to grasp public sentiments accurately,\u201d she said. \u201cI am also fully aware that while we have good intentions, we still need to be open and accommodating. While the Government has to ensure administrative efficiency, it still needs to listen patiently.\u201d It was a very different tone to her defiant speech just weeks ago announcing the indefinite shelving of the controversial extradition bill. She outlined a step-by-step plan to address the government\u2019s deficiencies, and said her administration would make more time for meeting with individuals from different political parties, walks of life and backgrounds, and said she hoped for a \u201cnew start\u201d for the city. Carrie Lam strikes a conciliatory note in speech Hong Kong\u2019s leader says a series of protests that have rocked her city have taught her that she needs to listen better to the youth and people in general. Chief Executive Carrie Lam struck a conciliatory note Monday at a ceremony marking the 22nd anniversary of the return of the former British colony to China. She said she has to remind herself all the time of the need to grasp public sentiments and ensure the government\u2019s work is closer to the aspirations of the people. Security guards pushed a pro-democracy lawmaker out of the room as she shouted at Lam to resign. Lam has come under criticism for pushing legislation that many saw as eroding Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms as a semi-autonomous territory of China. Our reporter Christy Choi says protesters and police are locked in a standoff. Protesters have made a barricade against pepper spray and water cannons using umbrellas, and riot police are standing by. The standoff has been going on for hours. Protesters began obstructing key roads around the convention centre just before 5am. Carrie Lam made her first public appearance since her apology at the convention centre in a ceremony to mark the handover of Hong Kong to China. The crowd is estimated to be in the thousands. Demonstrators have brought objects to obstruct streets and have been at work dismantling public road barriers constructed by police to block roads. As the Hong Kong and Chinese flags were being flown in by helicopter, protesters below gave them the finger. It\u2019s unclear how the clashes might affect a planned march later today. There are two groups protesting today. Pro-China, pro-government, pro-police protesters, began assembling in the city yesterday, to show their support for China on this important anniversary. Our reporter, Verna Yu, has this account of their arrival in the city yesterday, where things got heated between this group and the anti-China protesters, who are largely dressed in black. The pro-government protesters \u2013 mostly middle-aged and older people arriving on coaches \u2013 gathered at Tamar Park outside the Legislative Council and government headquarters from Sunday afternoon. Mostly dressed in blue and white, they waved Chinese national flags and placards with messages supporting the police, who have been under fire for their use of teargas and rubber bullets in anti-extradition protests. Angry exchanges took place on both sides when pro- and anti-government protesters met. \u201cWe were completely besieged by thousands of them at one point. They were very emotional \u2013 it felt really dangerous,\u201d said an anti-extradition protester who gave his name as Jim. A number of journalists were spat at, had mud slung at them, and were kicked and insulted by protesters who accused them of being sympathetic to earlier anti-extradition protests. A pro-democracy lawmaker, Lam Cheuk-ting, was surrounded by dozens of protesters on a walkway near the legislature, some of whom used umbrellas or placards to assault him and tried to snatch his mobile phone. At the flag-raising ceremony to mark the anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong to China, Carrie Lam said Hong Kong benefited from China\u2019s economic strength and celebrated the \u201caffluence of the motherland and the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong\u201d with Chinese officials, including military officials, reports Verna Yu. The Hong Kong government has issued this press release: Police strongly condemn illegal acts in Admiralty At about 4am this morning (July 1), a large number of protesters dashed onto Lung Wo Road, Tim Mei Avenue and Harcourt Road. They blocked the roads and obstructed traffic with mills barriers and sundries. At the same time, some protesters stole iron poles and bricks from nearby construction site and guard rails from nearby roads. Some protesters also pried up bricks on Lung Wo Road and transported them towards Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. Police strongly condemn these illegal acts and warn protesters not to throw bricks or charge Police cordon lines. Police appeal to protesters not to resort to violence, stop blocking roads and leave the scene as soon as possible. Ends/Monday, July 1, 2019 There are images coming through showing violent interactions between protesters and police. There are fears that today\u2019s protests could turn violent. The protests throughout June about the controversial extradition law have been largely peaceful, but on 12 June, the scene turned violent when police used rubber bullets, teargas, pepper spray and batons to disperse crowds and some protesters threw objects back at the police. Protesters have also surrounded the police headquarters twice in past weeks in noisy and emotionally charged protests in which young people spray-painted obscenities on its front wall and barricaded its entrances. On Sunday, police set up giant water-filled barricades in anticipation of overnight rallies by anti-extradition protesters to lock down the area where the handover anniversary ceremony is to take place. Tensions spiked as dawn rose on Monday after small groups of mainly young, masked protesters seized three key thoroughfares, deploying metal and plastic barriers to block the way. Rows of riot police with helmets and shields faced protesters on one of the streets but did not move against the barricades. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of today\u2019s protests in Hong Kong. It is a huge day for Hong Kong, which is marking the 22nd anniversary of the handover of the former British colony to China. There are traditionally both pro- and anti-China protests on 1 July, but this year the protesters are expected to be much bigger and more heated in light of the fact that the city is in the grip of its biggest political crisis in decades. Protesters, mostly dressed in black, have already taken to Hong Kong\u2019s streets, carrying umbrellas and wearing masks. They have seized three key thoroughfares, deploying metal and plastic barriers to block the way. If huge crowds gather today, as expected, this will be Hong Kong\u2019s fourth mass protest in a month against a controversial extradition law. Millions have taken to the streets to protest against the proposed law allowing for the extradition of individuals for trial in mainland China, where the opaque court system is controlled by the Communist party. We will bring you updates from the ground as they unfold.",

In 2015, the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite started to trend when the acting and directing nominees included no one of color, a situation that repeated itself the following year. In 2016, the Academy president, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, announced a diversity initiative to produce a more representative membership, doubling both women and people of color by 2020. This year\u2019s ceremony saw Rami Malek become the first actor of Arab heritage to win best actor, Ruth E Carter become the first black person to win best costume design, Mahershala Ali become only the second black actor to win multiple acting Oscars and Hannah Beachler become the first black person to win best production design.",

Trump told the Atlantic earlier this year: \u201cIf [Ivanka] ever wanted to run for president. I think she\u2019d be very, very hard to beat.\u201d Ivanka\u2019s brothers, Donald Jr and Eric, have become outspoken defenders of their father and are set to play leading roles in the 2020 election. Jordan Libowitz, communications director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics (Crew) in Washington, said: \u201cIt is questionable what Ivanka Trump was doing at the G20 summit, but it is also questionable what she does in the White House. \u201cShe takes a very prominent public role without defined duties or qualifications further than being the president\u2019s daughter. \u201cMore troubling is the fact that she continues to own significant problematic assets, from which she makes millions of dollars \u2013 including a share of the Trump hotel in Washington, which has become a haven for people looking to influence the Trump administration.\u201d",

She next plays Magdalena Rybarikova of Slovakia.</p> \n<p>It was a shock because of the reputation of Williams, but really only because few people have had the chance to see Gauff play at the biggest events until now. In front of a packed No 1 Court, there was no signs of nerves, no fear of the five-times champion; she seemed calm as she put away one of the game\u2019s best ever players with the minimum of fuss.</p> \n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t expect to win the match,\u201d Gauff said. \u201cI knew that I was going to go out there and play the way I play. I wasn\u2019t surprised that I won. I mean, I was just overwhelmed at the end. I\u2019ve never played on a court that big, the crowd was really wild. I was just surprised that people were cheering me on.\u201d</p> \n<p>Williams had won four of her seven grand slam tournaments, including two of her Wimbledons, before Gauff was born. Much as it was when Williams and her sister Serena arrived on Tour, there has been huge anticipation about the first sight of Gauff at this level. The youngest finalist in the US Open junior event at 13, she won the French Open juniors last year, shares a management group with Roger Federer and already has sponsorship deals worth more than $1m this year alone.</p> \n<p>But despite the hype, Gauff seems grounded and her confidence does not quite spill over into arrogance, even when she discusses how good she thinks she may one day become. \u201cI said this before: I want to be the greatest,\u201d she said. \u201cMy dad told me that I could do this when I was eight. Obviously you never believe it. I\u2019m still not 100% confident. But you have to just say things. You never know what happens.\u201d</p> \n<p>On the eve of her final-round qualifying match, Gauff stayed up late sitting a science exam. Nothing, not even playing on No 1 Court against a woman who inspired her to play the game, seems to faze her. \u201cOn my science test, I got a B,\u201d Gauff said. \u201cToday I\u2019d give myself an A. Hopefully my next test I can get an A but you never know.\u201d</p> \n<p>Only when Williams dropped a final forehand into the net did Gauff, who prefers to be known as Coco, realise what she had done, falling to her haunches and putting her hands over her head. Her father, Corey, who had been jumping up and down in the stands throughout, was jubilant.</p> \n<p>\u201cOn the court they were saying Cori [and] in the middle of the match I think random things,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just like, I hope my dad doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re cheering for him. He likes to say every time they call me Corey, they\u2019re cheering for him. I was like, OK.\u201d</p> \n<p>Gauff broke in the fifth game and held the advantage to take the first set and having broken again for 3-2 in the second, her only moment of concern came when she dropped serve for 4-4. But Gauff broke again in the next game and clinched victory on her fourth match point. \u201cI knew it was going to be mine, no matter what,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I just kind of hit my serves pretty hard.\u201d</p> \n<p>As for Williams, she has little doubt how far Gauff can go. \u201cThe sky\u2019s the limit,\u201d she said.</p>",

The youngest finalist in the US Open junior event at 13, she won the French Open juniors last year, shares a management group with Roger Federer and already has sponsorship deals worth more than $1m this year alone. But despite the hype, Gauff seems grounded and her confidence does not quite spill over into arrogance, even when she discusses how good she thinks she may one day become. \u201cI said this before: I want to be the greatest,\u201d she said. \u201cMy dad told me that I could do this when I was eight. Obviously you never believe it. I\u2019m still not 100% confident. But you have to just say things. You never know what happens.\u201d On the eve of her final-round qualifying match, Gauff stayed up late sitting a science exam. Nothing, not even playing on No 1 Court against a woman who inspired her to play the game, seems to faze her. \u201cOn my science test, I got a B,\u201d Gauff said. \u201cToday I\u2019d give myself an A. Hopefully my next test I can get an A but you never know.\u201d Only when Williams dropped a final forehand into the net did Gauff, who prefers to be known as Coco, realise what she had done, falling to her haunches and putting her hands over her head. Her father, Corey, who had been jumping up and down in the stands throughout, was jubilant. \u201cOn the court they were saying Cori [and] in the middle of the match I think random things,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just like, I hope my dad doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re cheering for him. He likes to say every time they call me Corey, they\u2019re cheering for him. I was like, OK.\u201d Gauff broke in the fifth game and held the advantage to take the first set and having broken again for 3-2 in the second, her only moment of concern came when she dropped serve for 4-4. But Gauff broke again in the next game and clinched victory on her fourth match point. \u201cI knew it was going to be mine, no matter what,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I just kind of hit my serves pretty hard.\u201d As for Williams, she has little doubt how far Gauff can go. \u201cThe sky\u2019s the limit,\u201d she said.",

He just could not convert starts and was left out shortly after the 4-0 Ashes defeat Down Under at the start of last year.<br><br>Since then, the Surrey man has rarely looked like getting back into contention. But here, there was a reminder of what might have been.</p> <p>Not a million miles away from home turf in Newcastle, Stoneman scored only a second Championship century since being discarded by England - his first of the summer - to help <strong>Surrey</strong>, who lost six wickets after tea to be bowled out for 362, claim a lead of 35 at the halfway point of their clash with <strong>Yorkshire</strong>. Starting day two on 28, he moved through to a century off 165 balls with 13 fours, only to fall two balls later when caught behind down leg off the South African seamer Duanne Olivier. Unfortunately, replays suggested the deflection was more sweatband than glove. Then again, he has become accustomed to frustration hasn\u2019t he.</p> <p>You can draw comparisons between Stoneman\u2019s England record and his start to the ongoing Championship summer, with him failing to convert three fifties prior to this innings. But he was one of five centurions around the counties on day two, four of them in Division One.</p> <p>Essex\u2019s Nick Browne, another left-handed opener, and Kent\u2019s Daniel Bell-Drummond also posted their first hundreds of the campaign, and they were big ones. Browne\u2019s unbeaten 163 helped <strong>Essex</strong> pile the pressure on struggling <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong> (213) at Trent Bridge with a close of play 345 for three. Bell-Drummond\u2019s 166 was the top-score in <strong>Kent</strong>\u2019s 585 for seven declared against a threadbare <strong>Warwickshire</strong> attack at Canterbury. But Ashes hopeful Dom Sibley\u2019s 60 not out gave the Bears a boost late in the day at 142 without loss.</p> <p>Leaders <strong>Somerset</strong> were made to work by <strong>Hampshire</strong> in defence of 408, with Sam Northeast\u2019s 101 helping ensure they closed on 329 for eight. Jamie Overton claimed five wickets.</p> <p><strong>Derbyshire</strong>\u2019s Leus du Plooy was the day\u2019s fifth centurion as they took charge of their home clash with <strong>Middlesex</strong>, who were 135 for three replying to 557 for six declared. <br><br>Division Two leaders <strong>Lancashire</strong> are in a hard-fought battle with <strong>Durham</strong> - 199 for five replying to the Red Rose\u2019s 337. Jimmy Anderson bowled Australian Cameron Bancroft for 77. <strong>Sussex</strong> are on course for defeat against <strong>Northamptonshire</strong> at Hove.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d1a35b78f088a73927370f2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-01T16:38:44.788Z\">5.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Right, that\u2019s all from me for the day. </strong>Thanks for your comments.

      "bodyText": "Mark Stoneman was so near yet so far from cementing his place at the top of England\u2019s Test order through late 2017 and early 2018, scoring five fifties in eleven matches. He just could not convert starts and was left out shortly after the 4-0 Ashes defeat Down Under at the start of last year. Since then, the Surrey man has rarely looked like getting back into contention. But here, there was a reminder of what might have been. Not a million miles away from home turf in Newcastle, Stoneman scored only a second Championship century since being discarded by England - his first of the summer - to help Surrey, who lost six wickets after tea to be bowled out for 362, claim a lead of 35 at the halfway point of their clash with Yorkshire. Starting day two on 28, he moved through to a century off 165 balls with 13 fours, only to fall two balls later when caught behind down leg off the South African seamer Duanne Olivier. Unfortunately, replays suggested the deflection was more sweatband than glove. Then again, he has become accustomed to frustration hasn\u2019t he. You can draw comparisons between Stoneman\u2019s England record and his start to the ongoing Championship summer, with him failing to convert three fifties prior to this innings. But he was one of five centurions around the counties on day two, four of them in Division One. Essex\u2019s Nick Browne, another left-handed opener, and Kent\u2019s Daniel Bell-Drummond also posted their first hundreds of the campaign, and they were big ones. Browne\u2019s unbeaten 163 helped Essex pile the pressure on struggling Nottinghamshire (213) at Trent Bridge with a close of play 345 for three. Bell-Drummond\u2019s 166 was the top-score in Kent\u2019s 585 for seven declared against a threadbare Warwickshire attack at Canterbury. But Ashes hopeful Dom Sibley\u2019s 60 not out gave the Bears a boost late in the day at 142 without loss. Leaders Somerset were made to work by Hampshire in defence of 408, with Sam Northeast\u2019s 101 helping ensure they closed on 329 for eight. Jamie Overton claimed five wickets. Derbyshire\u2019s Leus du Plooy was the day\u2019s fifth centurion as they took charge of their home clash with Middlesex, who were 135 for three replying to 557 for six declared. Division Two leaders Lancashire are in a hard-fought battle with Durham - 199 for five replying to the Red Rose\u2019s 337. Jimmy Anderson bowled Australian Cameron Bancroft for 77. Sussex are on course for defeat against Northamptonshire at Hove. Right, that\u2019s all from me for the day. Thanks for your comments. Tanya Aldred will be helming the blog tomorrow and there will be a roundup here later on. Bye. A few wickets around the traps \u2026 Surrey 303-7 now, trailing by 24. Yorkshire have struck three times with the new ball. Hampshire are 311-7 against Somerset, trailing by 97. Jamie Overton has taken a couple of quick wickets, and in Division Two Durham are 148-4 against Lancashire (337). Jimmy Anderson has bowled Cam Bancroft for 77. A few wickets around the traps....Surrey 303-7 now, trailing by 24. Yorkshire have struck three times with the new ball. Hampshire are 311-7 against Somerset, trailing by 97. Jamie Overton has taken a couple of quick wickets, and in Division Two Durham are 148-4 against Lancashire (337). Jimmy Anderson has bowled Cam Bancroft for 77. Surrey may have lost Ben Foakes for 40 in the last 15 minutes, superbly caught by a diving Jack Leaning in the gully off Ben Coad, but the visitors are closing in on 300. Northants are really piling the pressure on Sussex at Hove as the hosts bid to avoid a second home defeat in a fortnight. Having gained that first-innings lead of 167, they are now 137-1 second time around with Ricardo Vasconcelos on 65. Durham may have lost Alex Lees at Sedbergh, but they are going nicely against Lancashire in reply to 337. Cam Bancroft has an unbeaten 66 at tea, with Durham 115-1. New ball wicket at Scarborough as I type. Curran slices Coad to backward point for 43. Surrey 267-5. I make it there have been five centuries scored today so far, four in Division One - Stoneman, Bell-Drummond, Browne, Northeast and, in Division Two, du Plooy. There are plenty of opportunities to add to that as well. Tea here at Scarborough. Surrey are 253-4, trailing by 74. Hampshire are going along ok against leaders Somerset, with Sam Northeast posting a century before falling as one of two wickets to Dom Bess. They are now 225-5 in reply to 408. A partnership between all-rounders James Fuller and Keith Barker would cement some earlier good work. Here at Scarborough, Sam Curran and Ben Foakes are both in the twenties, and Surrey are 90 behind at 237-4 as we approach tea. There have been a couple of declarations in the last 15-20 minutes. Kent have declared on 585-7 against Warwickshire and Derbyshire have pulled out on 557-6 against Middlesex, with Anuj Dal falling for 92. Here, Surrey are 210-4, trailing by 117. Jubilation and then despair for Mark Stoneman, who reaches a 165-ball century - his first of the season, edging Duanne Olivier wide of slips for four to secure his milestone. But then he falls two balls later, caught behind down leg. Surrey have lost two in as many overs, including a first for Keshav Maharaj as he has Ryan Patel caught behind. Surrey are 186-4. Anuj Dal is 83 not out for Derbyshire and will either become their third centurion of the innings against Middlesex \u2013 the score is 542-5 \u2013 or the third man to narrowly miss out. While Billy Godleman and Leus du Plooy both reached three figures, Luis Reece and Fynn Hudson Prentice both fell in the nineties. When you look down the list of scores around the country, Sussex at 94-9 stands out like a sore thumb amongst a host of strong batting displays. Ben Sanderson and Ben Hutton have shared eight of the wickets for Northants at Hove, with Sanderson taking five. I really can\u2019t help but think that period when Yorkshire slipped from 187-1 to 231-7 after lunch yesterday will end up being the decider in the match. Surrey look well set here on 154-2. Division One Kent 448-4 v Warwickshire at Canterbury \u2013 Daniel Bell-Drummond has ploughed on to 154 not out against the depleted Bears, who looked so good at York a fortnight ago before losing to Surrey last week. Essex 155-2 v Nottinghamshire 213 at Trent Bridge \u2013 R Ashwin claimed his first Notts wicket this morning, Tom Westley caught at slip, but Essex are on course for another win to maintain the pressure on leaders Somerset. Hampshire 105-2 v Somerset 408 at Taunton \u2013 Ajinkya Rahane and Sam Northeast have shared an unbroken 68 and are into the forties. This feels like a key period in that contest. Surrey 148-2 v Yorkshire 327 at Scarborough \u2013 Mark Stoneman\u2019s 71 not out has equalled a season\u2019s best. Surrey have the edge. Division Two Derbyshire 488-5 v Middlesex at Derby \u2013 96 for Luis Reece, 102 for Billy Godleman, 99 for Fynn Hudson-Prentice, 118 for Leus du Plooy and 57 not out for Anuj Dal represents a fair old top order performance and has piled the pressure on the promotion-chasing visitors. Glamorgan 449 v Worcestershire 6-0 at Cardiff \u2013 7-92 for Brett D\u2019Oliveira and his leg-spinners, but Glamorgan remain in control. Lancashire 337 v Durham 1-0 at Sedbergh \u2013 There\u2019s been a bit of rain in Cumbria (or the Yorkshire Dales as some would say), and Durham have had a decent morning, claiming five wickets. Aussie Nathan Rimmington (4-74) took three of them. Sussex 83-7 v Northamptonshire 273 at Hove \u2013 Horrible morning for Sussex, 7-2 overnight. New ball seamer Ben Sanderson has taken four wickets. Keshav Maharaj, Yorkshire\u2019s new short-term overseas, is into the attack as Surrey advance to 139-2. Maharaj, the South African left-arm spinner, arrived in England mid last week and part of his preparation involved him net bowling to Afghanistan ahead of their World Cup clash with Pakistan at Headingley on Saturday. Yorkshire leg-spinner Josh Poysden was also there and spoke at length to Rashid Khan about the art of leg-spin. Yorkshire have a wicket, and it\u2019s Scott Borthwick caught low down at first slip by Tom Kohler-Cadmore off David Willey. Surrey have moved to 121-2. That was Kohler-Cadmore\u2019s 28th catch of the season in all cricket. They\u2019re underway at Sedbergh, and Durham have claimed two wickets in the opening half hour of play - Steven Croft to Brydon Carse and Dane Vilas to Chris Rushworth for 72, the latter driving to mid-off. Lancashire are 293-7. The Notts Post are reporting that Notts have put contract talks with Alex Hales, out of contract this year, on hold until the end of the summer following his recent troubles and that he has yet to receive any approaches from other counties for his services. Meanwhile, at Trent Bridge, R Ashwin has just taken his first wicket for the county - Tom Westley. Essex are 95-2 replying to 213. Sean Dickson has fallen for 166, leaving Kent 383-3. He has fallen, caught on the pull, to hand James a maiden first-class wicket on his Warwickshire debut. Big Ben chiming, hey. Sussex are under the cosh at 15-4 as Northants\u2019 pair of Bens, Sanderson and Hutton, strike early at Hove, getting rid of Luke Wells and Aaron Thomason. Here, Dean Elgar has just fallen, bowled by another Ben - Coad - via an inside edge as he attempted to leave alone. Surrey 68-1. An early rain delay at Sedbergh. They will be starting at 11.30am. The heavy bails have already been called for here at Scarborough due to the breeze. Umpires Wharf and Blackwell have been busy boys in the first 10 minutes of play as they\u2019ve also been trying to push the crowds sat behind the boundary rope back a few yards in a bid to avoid collisions with fielders sliding to save fours. Surrey 59-0. Before we get into the thick of this week\u2019s action, this look back on last week around the counties from Gary Naylor is worth a read \u2026 How nice it is to be writing that as I think the last two or three times I\u2019ve been with you on the blog it\u2019s been a story of will it, won\u2019t it rain. Yesterday seemed to largely be a batting day around the country, with the odd exception. A host of high scores, centuries for players young and old and some interesting games developing \u2013 none more so than here on the East Coast at North Marine Road, where Surrey are 48-0 replying to Yorkshire\u2019s 327, which included opener Will Fraine\u2019s 106, a maiden first-class century. Yorkshire may have a decent score on the board, one they would have probably taken before play yesterday on a pitch which is usually fruity. But they let the champions off the hook. They were 187-1 after all. Instead Jordan Clark, he of last season\u2019s remarkable Roses hat-trick fame, charged in and claimed 5-77, continuing a love affair of playing against Yorkshire, no matter whether is wearing the colours of Lancashire or Surrey. Seam did the trick for title-chasing Essex against hapless Notts (213 all out at Trent Bridge), with Messrs Porter, Beard and Siddle all taking three wickets apiece. Sir Alastair fell for two in reply to an old mate, Stuart Broad, but Essex still replied with 72-1. How frustrated must Joe Denly feel? Kent are 338-2 at home to Warwickshire and he only gets 22 when in need of big runs to press his Ashes case. Instead, Zak Crawley made 77, opening partner Sean Dickson 146 not out and Daniel Bell-Drummond 68 unbeaten. Warwickshire\u2019s attack is threadbare to be fair to them. Ravaged by injuries, they are playing three seamers who didn\u2019t start the season with the Bears in on loan duo Toby Lester and Ben Mike and James Wainman, released by Yorkshire over the winter. James Hildreth\u2019s 105 underpinned Somerset\u2019s 408 all out against Hampshire (15-1 in reply) at Taunton. I see Dom Bess is playing there. That is a fascinating situation. Somerset refused Yorkshire permission to extend his loan as they wanted him for their clash with Essex at Chelmsford last week and then didn\u2019t pick him.

Rob Warnes, the rail firm\u2019s network planning director, told the all-party parliamentary group (AAPG) on rail in the north that all of its antiquated fleet of Pacers would be gone by the end of the year, according to Ian Mearns, the Labour MP who chairs the AAPG.

Having restored confidence with a muscle-flexing victory against India, Eoin Morgan\u2019s side meet New Zealand in Chester-le-Street on Wednesday looking to cement their place in the final four. There is little question that the centurion Jonny Bairstow and Jason Roy combining for a 160-run opening stand \u2013 and Ben Stokes lighting the afterburners with a 54-ball 79 \u2013 provided the foundation on which Sunday\u2019s 31-run win at Edgbaston was built. Morgan told his players to remember their methods in previously reaching No 1 in the rankings and this trio of batsmen certainly took heed, delivering purposefully for a total of 337 for seven that asked India to break the World Cup\u2019s record chase in reply. Nevertheless it would be remiss to ignore the role played by two of England\u2019s bowlers who, despite a fine century from Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli\u2019s 66, managed to puncture enough holes in India\u2019s batting to leave MS Dhoni and Kedhar Jadav struggling for boundaries at the end. The five India wickets to fall in this successful strangulation job were shared by Chris Woakes and Liam Plunkett, cricketers who seldom crave the spotlight yet over the course of England\u2019s four-year project have become Morgan\u2019s seam-bowling bankers. Woakes first, whose three successive maidens at the start \u2013 during which came a smart caught and bowled to remove the opener KL Rahul \u2013 set the tone perfectly. The player teammates have called \u201cThe Wizard\u201d ever since a darts tournament in his under-19s days is now being referred to as \u201cMr Perfect\u201d \u2013 and not just because of the impeccable haircut. It relates instead to the 30-year-old\u2019s polished all-round game, two facets of which came to the fore on the ground where, as a Warwickshire junior, he assisted the groundstaff during the 2005 Ashes Test. As well as final figures of two for 58 that included the arguably match-sealing wicket of Sharma, caught behind for 102, there was also the spectacular catch in the deep to remove Rishabh Pant. \u201cI actually dived a little early and had to stretch a bit more,\u201d Woakes said, in typically self-effacing fashion.

It is a virtue to be this way during the current big-hitting era, even if the squad\u2019s oldest campaigner had been quietly straining to play after sitting out four group games (including, notably, the defeats by Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Australia). Plunkett, in for Moeen Ali on the day owing to the pitch and a short boundary, said: \u201cWe came into this World Cup ranked No 1 and, yes, we\u2019ve had a few defeats.

In a speech broadcast live on state TV, Zarif vowed that Iran would never give in to US pressure. \u201cIf they want to talk to Iran, they should show respect,\u201d he said. \u201cNever threaten an Iranian \u2026 Iran has always resisted pressure and has responded with respect when respected.\u201d Zarif hailed Instex as potentially a historic route to combating the pernicious dominance of the dollar in international trade. \u201cAlthough it does not meet the demands of the Islamic republic [or] Europeans\u2019 obligations \u2026 it has a strategic value [in showing] that the closest allies of the United States are distancing themselves from America in their economic relations. This will certainly have long-term effects,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Right then, I\u2019m off. It was, well, not the best. Morocco win Group D, and Ivory Coast follow them into the round of 16. Whether South Africa will join them there remains to be seen, but whether they\u2019d be likely to distinguish themselves if they did is something we probably already know. Bye! There were 34 free kicks. Not as many in the second half as there had been in the first, but certainly more than enough. South Africa committed 22 of those fouls. South Africa had four shots, none on target. Morocco hardly had a hatful of chances, but they were certainly the more adventurous team - they had 11 shots, three on target - and a third successive 1-0 win is probably just reward for their efforts, for all that the goal was scrappy and very late. South Africa have the worst record of the three third-placed side to have completed their group-stage matches so far, and their prospects are looking decidedly ropey. 90+3 mins: Ten seconds before the end of those three minutes South Africa lash the ball hopefully forwards, and the referee blows for full time! 90+3 mins: There will be three minutes of stoppage time, and we\u2019re already in the last of them. 90+2 mins: Suddenly South Africa have discovered how to hurry. Defeat here wouldn\u2019t end there chances of sneaking through as one of the four best third-placed teams, but it\u2019s not exactly helpful. 90 mins: Thirty seconds from the end of normal time Morocco finally break through! A free kick from the left goes into the box, where one South African heads it into another and it drops handily for Boussoufa, who lashes it into the top corner from 10 yards! 89 mins: Morocco bring Faycal Fajr on for Ziyech. 89 mins: Another GOAL for Ivory Coast in the other game, Maxwel Cornet making it 4-1 for them against Namibia. 88 mins: Kekana goes down clutching his head, and play, such as it is, is eventually stopped. 85 mins: As we stand, then, Morocco win the group and will play one of the third-placed sides; Ivory Coast come second and play the winner of Group E (currently Mali), while South Africa finish third and, if they go through, will play Egypt or Madagascar. 83 mins: GOOOOAAALLLLL! Yes, it\u2019s 3-1 to Ivory Coast in the other game, Wilfried Zaha, apparently subject of a bid from Arsenal today, has scored it with a hard, low shot that sped under the diving keeper. 80 mins: Another substitution. Zungu trudges off, and Hlompho Kekana comes on. Zungu takes a ludicrous amount of time to reach the touchline, which tells you everything you need to know about South Africa\u2019s approach to the remainder of this game. It seems they have decided that a draw will do. 78 mins: Dirar has gone to the right flank, shunting Amrabat back over to the left. He tries a cross from there, which goes to the nearest defender. 75 mins: Morocco bring Nabil Dirar on, replacing Mazraoui. 74 mins: And another save! What a game this is turning into! Amrabat crosses from the right, En-Nesyri heads straight at Williams, and this match is fast becoming mildly interesting. 73 mins: South Africa take off Lebo Mothiba, and bring on Lars Veldwijk. 71 mins: GOOOOAAAAALLLLL to Namibia in the other game. Joslin Kamatuka has scored it. It\u2019s now 2-1 to Ivory Coast there. 69 mins: What a chance for Morocco! Amrabat\u2019s pass through the defence is fabulous, and El-Nesyri runs onto it, goes round the goalkeeper (he could perhaps have taken the penalty he would surely have been awarded had he gone down at this point) and then, off balance and eight yards wide of goal, he shoots hard, confidently and absurdly wide, as if he thought the goal was somewhere entirely different to where it actually was. 68 mins: Morocco are starting to look like the side stuffed with highly-rated players with experience of Europe\u2019s top leagues, and South Africa\u2019s like a squad that isn\u2019t. 64 mins: Morocco hit the bar! It\u2019s a beautiful first-time lay-off from Ziyech infield to Hakimi, and from 25 yards the full-back curls an absolute beauty of a shot that hits the underside of the bar, bounces down and away from goal. 61 mins: An hour gone, and something interesting still hasn\u2019t happened. If it weren\u2019t for those two dodgy offside decisions in the first half, both involving Youssef En-Nesyri, things might all be different. 57 mins: GOOOAAAALLLL! Ivory Coast have scored it, in the other Group D game. They now lead Namibia 2-0. On the downside, this means that even if South Africa end up winning this one 1-0 there will no longer be a drawing of lots to decide the top three spots, as there might have been had the score in the other game remained at as it was. 56 mins: I\u2019m sure the first half was played entirely in daylight, but it\u2019s the dead of night now. At some point around half-time the sun set with a vengeance. 54 mins: A substitution! Karim El Ahmadi is going off, and Youssef Bennasser is coming on. 52 mins: A corner has been won, by South Africa. And it has been headed clear. 49 mins: The ball hits the back of the net! It\u2019s a blistering drive from Thamsanqa Mkhize, but it goes a couple of yards wide before rebounding off an advertising hoarding into the aforementioned netting. 47 mins: If a team from this group claims one of the four spots for third-placed teams in the knock-out rounds, they will face either Egypt or Madagascar. One of those fates would be very much worth avoiding. 46 mins: South Africa kick off, and half two is under way. The players are back out. The only way is up! In tonight\u2019s other game it\u2019s Namibia 0-1 Ivory Coast, and as it stands it\u2019s they and Morocco who will qualify automatically from Group D. It\u2019s been a disappointing game so far, but I suspect that both sides would be reasonably happy with the point they are currently getting. Still, we live in hope. 45+2 mins: The first half is complete. To sum up the key incidents from the opening period: Morocco had a shot on target. 45+1 mins: We are in stoppage time. There have been a lot of stoppages, but there will be only one minute of additional time. 44 mins: The referee just refused an opportunity to award a free-kick, after Zungu went down not far from the edge of Morocco\u2019s penalty area. 42 mins: Amrabat is seeing more of the ball since his switch to the right (or during the periods when he\u2019s on the right, anyway) but he continues to demonstrate the inability to accurately cross it that Watford fans will be so familiar with. 40 mins: 14 free-kicks, apparently, at the rate of one every two and a half minutes or so. 39 mins: Another foul, this one on Mothiba. There have been a lot of free kicks. 36 mins: Amrabat, who appears to be switching wings every 30 seconds or so, crosses but it comes off Mkhwanazi and deflects into the arms of Ronwen Williams. Amrabat thinks it came off the defender\u2019s arm, but it looks like a header on the replays. 35 mins: And then a save at the other end! Amrabat\u2019s lovely cross looks destined for En-Nesyri\u2019s head, but somehow he gets nothing on it. The ball is headed clear, but Belhanda runs onto it 22 yards out and hammers a low shot goalwards, but it\u2019s a straightforward stop. 34 mins: Oooof! Nearly a goal for South Africa! Percy Tau checks onto his left foot, scampers across the edge of the area and shoots just wide of the far post! 31 mins: Bongani Zungu becomes the second name in the referee\u2019s book, for a foul on Amrabat, who has switched to the right on a semi-permanent basis. 29 mins: I\u2019d really like to have more to tell you, but almost all of the play is happening more than 40 yards from either goal. Amrabat pops up on the right and tries to cross, but doesn\u2019t succeed. 24 mins: En-Nesyri is played through again, is given offside again, and it looks very much like he wasn\u2019t again. 21 mins: \u201cAny hope for Bafana to pull this off and qualify?\u201d wonders Ian van Reenen. \u201cI\u2019m clearly desperate.\u201d Certainly, given that four of the six third-placed teams will go through. A draw here will most probably be enough. 19 mins: A shot! The first of the day by my count, and it comes from the right foot of Younes Belhanda, who is lurking beyond the far post when the cross from that free-kick is headed straight to him. 18 mins: A first booking, and Themba Zwane is the man punished, for pushing the Morocco captain, M\u2019Bark Boussoufa, in the back. 15 mins: A hint of a chance for South Africa, thanks to a smart dummy on the edge of the area, but all they get from it is a corner, which is headed clear. 12 mins: Very little by way of goalmouth action to report. What I can tell you is that the referee, Jean Jacques Ngambo, appears quite fond of his whistle. 8 mins: We have seen very little so far of Amrabat, who has had an excellent tournament so far. The most I can say of him is that he was standing nearby when Serero was caught by El Ahmadi. There was little contact, but much reaction. 5 mins: Chance for Morocco! Ziyech plays a beautifully-time and weighted pass from the halfway line to Youssef En-Nesyri. He is given offside, so strictly speaking it wasn\u2019t a chance at all, but he wasn\u2019t actually offside, so it should have been. 3 mins: South Africa win a corner, and attempt a rehearsed manoeuvre of complete idiocy which involves Percy Tau passing into the area, where a player who has peeled away into space returns it to Tau, who is offside. Free kick to Morocco. 2 mins: Early days, of course, but South Africa have started with greater urgency. 1 min: We\u2019re under way! Anthems done, both teams are having a little pre-match huddle, and we\u2019ll soon by under way. The players are out, and the national anthems are being played. South Africa\u2019s anthem starts superbly, I think, but then meanders along disappointingly before eventually giving up. The sun is shining over Cairo, and the stands of the al-Salam stadium are very slightly more populated than they would be on a day when there isn\u2019t a match on. Still, there\u2019s plenty of time before kick-off. The players have arrived, and seem in good voice: The teams are in, and here they jolly well are: South Africa: Williams, Mkhize, Hlanti, Mkhwanazi, Hlatshwayo, Mokotjo, Zwane, Zungu, Serero, Mothiba, Tau. Morocco: Munir, Mazraoui, Da Costa, Saiss, Hakimi, El Ahmadi, Boussoufa, Ziyech, Belhanda, Amrabat, En Nesyri. For Group D and at least one of the teams in it, the end is nigh. So far, every single game in the group has ended 1-0, the upshot being that Morocco are safely through with six points, while Ivory Coast and South Africa are tied on three points apiece with identical records but for the fact that Ivory Coast won the game between them. Namibia, with no points, require a healthy and apparently unlikely victory over Ivory Coast if they are to progress, but for the rest it\u2019s game very much on. Herv\u00e9 Renard, Morocco\u2019s French coach, revealed before the game that he has previously been approached by South Africa, but failed to reach an agreement with them because \u201cof course I am not cheap\u201d.

Long-time climate campaigner and Boggabilla farmer Pete Mailler said there was a \u201cwidespread wilful ignorance\u201d about climate change and that was creating the impasse on public policy responses. \u201cThere\u2019s this big issue that says we can\u2019t really admit to climate change because that means we have to change all these other things and that\u2019s really hard, we don\u2019t really want to shut down coal-fired power stations,\u201d Mailler said. \u201cThe reality is I can\u2019t stand by and let people glibly talk up agriculture if they are not prepared to start tackling the hard issues now.

The NFF declared its \u201cpriority ask\u201d was a $1bn eco-systems services fund, following on from a $30m biodiversity stewardship fund announced in the federal election that would develop a framework to pay farmers to improve landscape and capture carbon. Mahar echoed the Craik report, which also recommended the government introduce \u201cmarket-based\u201d National Biodiversity Conservation Trust fund for eco-services. \u201cWe are talking about this as the new Landcare and being a system that will recognise, reward, and put a value on some of the systems and services and land management processes that farmers undertake every day, every year, and have done for decades but haven\u2019t been able to get an income stream from that.\u201d The World Wildlife Fund has backed has backed the principle of paying farmers for good environment practices. The WWF\u2019s Ian McConnel said farmer payments for eco-system work would be an important driver for positive change. \u201cWe need to reward people when they are adopting practices, especially when those practices don\u2019t come as a win-win to production,\u201d McConnel. \u201cWe need to prove there\u2019s a biodiversity measurement.

The NFF\u2019s $1bn target was \u201cabsolutely\u201d achievable, he said, and could come from a mix of government funding and private investors. \u201cThe world needs pretty large-scale investment if we are going to turn the head on biodiversity loss and carbon so we are going to have to see some pretty big investment in that space and I think the willingness is there from both the public and private to invest,\u201d McConnel said.",

      "body": "<p>In less than a month the political strategy of exiling and incarcerating refugees on Manus Island and Nauru will hit the six-year mark \u2013 we enter the seventh year of illegal imprisonment. If we pay attention to the discourse and propaganda techniques of consecutive governments over these years we notice that essentially the same language and rhetoric has been maintained without the slightest change. Every government has imposed the same logic on society: the policies have been designed and implemented to \u201cstop the boats\u201d. As a result of this simplistic reasoning they have justified an inhumane political program.</p> <p>The most prominent slogan for groups opposing this policy over all these years has been \u201cBring Them Here\u201d. This slogan has been the basis for many pro-refugee activist groups and featured in so many campaigns to free the refugees from offshore prisons. Unfortunately, this slogan and these campaigns have been unsuccessful in achieving their objectives. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/27/former-manus-island-detainee-tells-un-human-beings-are-being-destroyed\">Former Manus Island detainee tells UN 'human beings are being destroyed'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The greatest error that many have committed is accepting the government\u2019s reasoning which is based on the simple formula: \u201cWe have incarcerated these people on Manus and Nauru to \u2018stop the boats\u2019\u201d. If one analyses the different dimensions of this particular exile policy it becomes obvious that the government is lying. </p> <p>The policy of exiling refugees to offshore prisons is in no way a deterrent. Even if we just entertained the idea that the policy of exile really worked then it would have been relevant to roughly the first six months to a year of its implementation. There is no reasoning that justifies over six years of incarceration of innocent people \u2013 an imprisonment that continues to this day. This is a lie that the Australian Liberal party has ingrained in the minds of the public and the media for years. However, it is very likely that at some point they actually started to believe their own lie.</p> <p>A simple question needs to be discussed in detail regarding the refugees in Indonesia, those people who the Australian government has always considered a danger to national security and Australian values: why haven\u2019t refugees in Indonesia been coming to Australia by boat over recent years?</p> <p>The Australian media have continuously validated and promoted the announcements of the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton. But have any mainstream media organisations investigated the situation and experiences in Indonesia? How many of them have considered the details and dynamics from the place where they fear the boats might embark? The truth is that refugees stuck in Indonesia will never risk losing their money to people smugglers, risk their lives battling the dangers of the ocean, and risk being pushed back to Indonesia in the end.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Why has the Liberal party failed to resolve this issue after all these years and after spending billions of dollars?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The reality is that no one is observing the situation in Manus and Nauru, no one considers our fate, no one is waiting to see when we are freed, no one is looking to see where we will be settled.</p> <p>Many Australians liken the policy of exiling people to Manus and Nauru to a brick constituting a structure constructed by the government. According to this view, if one brick is removed from this building the whole edifice will suddenly collapse. I argue that this view is completely wrong. Over six years the Australian government has transferred about 1,000 people from these two islands to Australia. In contrast to the government logic, not one boat has come into Australian waters. In addition to this, since 2013 the government has transferred to Australia hundreds of refugees who had been incarcerated on Christmas Island. These refugees were always told they would never make it to Australia and would be eventually exiled to Manus and Nauru. Again, no boats made it into Australian waters. According to official statistics the government sent more than another 700 to the US. Again, no boats came in. The group of refugees in Manus has reduced from 900 individuals in 2016 to 450. In Nauru the numbers reduced from 1,200 to 250 in the same period.</p> <p>One conclusion can be reasonably arrived at. Obviously, the government\u2019s intention has never been to close these prisons. Dutton says he would like to free everyone overnight if he could but cannot because the boats would start coming again. This is an outright lie.</p> <p>The question remains, however, if this policy has no relationship with boats arriving in Australia then why does the government insist on keeping people imprisoned on these islands over these years?</p> <p>The exile and incarceration of refugees on Manus and Nauru is based on three fundamental pillars. 1) Political profit for both major parties; 2) Economic gain; 3) An ideological basis which is associated with the individual psychology of people such as Dutton.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2019/jun/25/peter-dutton-has-manipulated-the-truth-so-much-how-can-australians-trust-him\">Peter Dutton has manipulated the truth so much, how can Australians trust him? | Kristina Keneally</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Firstly, this policy guarantees the accumulation of political capital for the Liberal party. In the 2016 elections they made very good use of the issue of \u201cborder protection\u201d for gaining votes, putting the Labor party on the defence. During the last elections two months ago the Liberal party again tried to make use of this approach as part of the campaign of fear they were planning \u2013 the most prominent example of this intention was manifested in Scott Morrison\u2019s visit to Christmas Island as a campaign tool. However, the Christchurch terrorist attack in New Zealand influenced the government\u2019s decision not to use the \u201crefugee card\u201d for the first time since the Howard era.</p> <p>The existence of these two-island prisons has always been a justification for the political profit-making of the Liberal party. By making these sites the highlight of their campaign they were sending a message to voters that they were prioritising national security. They were creating the impression that they were strong and the Labor party weak.</p> <p>For years the Labor party sought to resist the political attack by adamantly supporting the same political project, especially before the last election. For years the two parties have been in competition over who could better sustain the cruel and inhumane policy. Over the years the government has been open about the fact that they do not want to do away with this political tool; a policy that has been instrumental in keeping the Labor party on the defensive.</p> <p>The second pillar of this political project is the economic gain involving these two island prisons. According to the architects of this very political strategy there has always been the need for secrecy around the contracts given to operate the prisons. There has been a lack of transparency on how the Manus and Nauru contracts are run.</p> <p>Exact figures are difficult to establish but more than $9bn has been spent on this state-sanctioned hostage taking and boat turnbacks. At least 10 large companies have signed multimillion-dollar contracts with the government over these years. </p> <p>The healthcare company IHMS has been working in these island prisons for six years \u2013 why hasn\u2019t any other company been able to take their place? There is also the contract scandal involving security company Paladin, an agreement worth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/18/home-affairs-denies-it-was-desperate-when-423m-manus-island-contract-awarded\">$423m</a>. How is this money being spent? Where is the money going?</p> <p>What is clear is this: There are strong lobbies that see it in their best commercial interests to maintain this political strategy. Through this whole process millions of dollars have exchanged hands. Financial profit is one of the main pillars of this political program.</p> <p>But the third fundamental pillar pertains to individual gain and can be understood by a psychological examination of Dutton and the home affairs department secretary, Mike Pezzullo. The roots of this pillar are ideological.</p> <p>Dutton has become the most influential minister in the country\u2019s history by abusing the concept of national security.<strong> </strong>Over recent years he has increased his power step by step and at one time was vying for the post of prime minister. His political success has come from maintaining this political project at any cost. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/03/how-many-more-people-must-die-on-manus-before-australia-ends-indefinite-detention\">How many more people must die on Manus before Australia ends indefinite detention? | Behrouz Boochani</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dutton uses every opportunity available to attack the character of refugees. In one recent example he targeted women who have been victims of rape and other kinds of sexual abuse and were transferred to Australia for treatment. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/20/peter-dutton-says-women-using-and-abortion-claims-as-ploy-to-get-to-australia\">He accused them</a> of lying. On many occasions he has labelled refugees as criminals, rapists and murderers. Without a doubt, this political strategy has ideological foundations based on racism. </p> <p>In the beginning the policy of exiling refugees to Manus and Nauru might have been a simple policy; it was supposed to be in place for less than one year. However, with the passing of time and the influence of historical, ideological and sadistic dimensions the policy mutated. Now after six years we must pose some fundamental questions. Why has the Liberal party failed to resolve this issue after all these years and after spending billions of dollars? Why are they still exploiting the public and lying to them using the fabricated notion of national security? Why are they still terrifying the public regarding boats? Why are they exploiting Manus and Nauru and justifying their actions using the rhetoric of stopping the boats?</p> <p>A general look at this situation reveals that the Australian government never had the intention of resolving this issue.</p> <p>If the government had intended to gradually remove one person from this island every three days then all the refugees would be freed by now. By accepting the New Zealand offer to take 150 people a year the government would have ended this situation. Right now they could use the medevac law to evacuate all the sick refugees from the island over a period of two to three months. Over these years the government could have easily emptied these prison camps, but the reality is that they earn political profit for their parties; there are people who benefit financially; and there are also the individual ideological gains. For these reasons they have never intended on solving this issue. \u201cThe boats are coming\u201d is one of the greatest lies told to the Australian people in decades. History will reveal all.</p> <p>\u2022 Behrouz Boochani is a writer, journalist, associate professor at UNSW, and refugee in Manus<br><br>\u2022 Translation: Omid Tofighian, American University in Cairo/UNSW</p>",

      "bodyText": "In less than a month the political strategy of exiling and incarcerating refugees on Manus Island and Nauru will hit the six-year mark \u2013 we enter the seventh year of illegal imprisonment. If we pay attention to the discourse and propaganda techniques of consecutive governments over these years we notice that essentially the same language and rhetoric has been maintained without the slightest change. Every government has imposed the same logic on society: the policies have been designed and implemented to \u201cstop the boats\u201d. As a result of this simplistic reasoning they have justified an inhumane political program. The most prominent slogan for groups opposing this policy over all these years has been \u201cBring Them Here\u201d. This slogan has been the basis for many pro-refugee activist groups and featured in so many campaigns to free the refugees from offshore prisons. Unfortunately, this slogan and these campaigns have been unsuccessful in achieving their objectives. The greatest error that many have committed is accepting the government\u2019s reasoning which is based on the simple formula: \u201cWe have incarcerated these people on Manus and Nauru to \u2018stop the boats\u2019\u201d. If one analyses the different dimensions of this particular exile policy it becomes obvious that the government is lying. The policy of exiling refugees to offshore prisons is in no way a deterrent. Even if we just entertained the idea that the policy of exile really worked then it would have been relevant to roughly the first six months to a year of its implementation. There is no reasoning that justifies over six years of incarceration of innocent people \u2013 an imprisonment that continues to this day. This is a lie that the Australian Liberal party has ingrained in the minds of the public and the media for years. However, it is very likely that at some point they actually started to believe their own lie. A simple question needs to be discussed in detail regarding the refugees in Indonesia, those people who the Australian government has always considered a danger to national security and Australian values: why haven\u2019t refugees in Indonesia been coming to Australia by boat over recent years? The Australian media have continuously validated and promoted the announcements of the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton. But have any mainstream media organisations investigated the situation and experiences in Indonesia? How many of them have considered the details and dynamics from the place where they fear the boats might embark? The truth is that refugees stuck in Indonesia will never risk losing their money to people smugglers, risk their lives battling the dangers of the ocean, and risk being pushed back to Indonesia in the end. The reality is that no one is observing the situation in Manus and Nauru, no one considers our fate, no one is waiting to see when we are freed, no one is looking to see where we will be settled. Many Australians liken the policy of exiling people to Manus and Nauru to a brick constituting a structure constructed by the government. According to this view, if one brick is removed from this building the whole edifice will suddenly collapse. I argue that this view is completely wrong. Over six years the Australian government has transferred about 1,000 people from these two islands to Australia. In contrast to the government logic, not one boat has come into Australian waters. In addition to this, since 2013 the government has transferred to Australia hundreds of refugees who had been incarcerated on Christmas Island. These refugees were always told they would never make it to Australia and would be eventually exiled to Manus and Nauru. Again, no boats made it into Australian waters. According to official statistics the government sent more than another 700 to the US. Again, no boats came in. The group of refugees in Manus has reduced from 900 individuals in 2016 to 450. In Nauru the numbers reduced from 1,200 to 250 in the same period. One conclusion can be reasonably arrived at. Obviously, the government\u2019s intention has never been to close these prisons. Dutton says he would like to free everyone overnight if he could but cannot because the boats would start coming again. This is an outright lie. The question remains, however, if this policy has no relationship with boats arriving in Australia then why does the government insist on keeping people imprisoned on these islands over these years? The exile and incarceration of refugees on Manus and Nauru is based on three fundamental pillars. 1) Political profit for both major parties; 2) Economic gain; 3) An ideological basis which is associated with the individual psychology of people such as Dutton. Firstly, this policy guarantees the accumulation of political capital for the Liberal party. In the 2016 elections they made very good use of the issue of \u201cborder protection\u201d for gaining votes, putting the Labor party on the defence. During the last elections two months ago the Liberal party again tried to make use of this approach as part of the campaign of fear they were planning \u2013 the most prominent example of this intention was manifested in Scott Morrison\u2019s visit to Christmas Island as a campaign tool. However, the Christchurch terrorist attack in New Zealand influenced the government\u2019s decision not to use the \u201crefugee card\u201d for the first time since the Howard era. The existence of these two-island prisons has always been a justification for the political profit-making of the Liberal party. By making these sites the highlight of their campaign they were sending a message to voters that they were prioritising national security. They were creating the impression that they were strong and the Labor party weak. For years the Labor party sought to resist the political attack by adamantly supporting the same political project, especially before the last election. For years the two parties have been in competition over who could better sustain the cruel and inhumane policy. Over the years the government has been open about the fact that they do not want to do away with this political tool; a policy that has been instrumental in keeping the Labor party on the defensive. The second pillar of this political project is the economic gain involving these two island prisons. According to the architects of this very political strategy there has always been the need for secrecy around the contracts given to operate the prisons. There has been a lack of transparency on how the Manus and Nauru contracts are run. Exact figures are difficult to establish but more than $9bn has been spent on this state-sanctioned hostage taking and boat turnbacks. At least 10 large companies have signed multimillion-dollar contracts with the government over these years. The healthcare company IHMS has been working in these island prisons for six years \u2013 why hasn\u2019t any other company been able to take their place? There is also the contract scandal involving security company Paladin, an agreement worth $423m. How is this money being spent? Where is the money going? What is clear is this: There are strong lobbies that see it in their best commercial interests to maintain this political strategy. Through this whole process millions of dollars have exchanged hands. Financial profit is one of the main pillars of this political program. But the third fundamental pillar pertains to individual gain and can be understood by a psychological examination of Dutton and the home affairs department secretary, Mike Pezzullo. The roots of this pillar are ideological. Dutton has become the most influential minister in the country\u2019s history by abusing the concept of national security. Over recent years he has increased his power step by step and at one time was vying for the post of prime minister. His political success has come from maintaining this political project at any cost. Dutton uses every opportunity available to attack the character of refugees. In one recent example he targeted women who have been victims of rape and other kinds of sexual abuse and were transferred to Australia for treatment. He accused them of lying. On many occasions he has labelled refugees as criminals, rapists and murderers. Without a doubt, this political strategy has ideological foundations based on racism. In the beginning the policy of exiling refugees to Manus and Nauru might have been a simple policy; it was supposed to be in place for less than one year. However, with the passing of time and the influence of historical, ideological and sadistic dimensions the policy mutated. Now after six years we must pose some fundamental questions. Why has the Liberal party failed to resolve this issue after all these years and after spending billions of dollars? Why are they still exploiting the public and lying to them using the fabricated notion of national security? Why are they still terrifying the public regarding boats? Why are they exploiting Manus and Nauru and justifying their actions using the rhetoric of stopping the boats? A general look at this situation reveals that the Australian government never had the intention of resolving this issue. If the government had intended to gradually remove one person from this island every three days then all the refugees would be freed by now. By accepting the New Zealand offer to take 150 people a year the government would have ended this situation. Right now they could use the medevac law to evacuate all the sick refugees from the island over a period of two to three months. Over these years the government could have easily emptied these prison camps, but the reality is that they earn political profit for their parties; there are people who benefit financially; and there are also the individual ideological gains. For these reasons they have never intended on solving this issue. \u201cThe boats are coming\u201d is one of the greatest lies told to the Australian people in decades. History will reveal all. \u2022 Behrouz Boochani is a writer, journalist, associate professor at UNSW, and refugee in Manus \u2022 Translation: Omid Tofighian, American University in Cairo/UNSW",

      "bodyText": "Proposed new laws could give the Australian government greater powers to block websites from access in Australia, as the internet industry deals with hastily passed legislation designed to prevent another livestream of a terrorist massacre being shared widely. Shortly after the Christchurch massacre, Australian telecommunications companies and internet providers began proactively blocking websites hosting the video of the Christchurch shooter murdering more than 50 people or the shooter\u2019s manifesto. The internet providers were praised by the government for this effort, despite being in a legally grey area by blocking the sites from access in Australia for people not using virtual private networks (VPNs) or other workarounds. \u201cThe ISPs were left in an invidious position post-Christchurch,\u201d John Stanton, the chief executive of Communications Alliance, which represents the ISPs, said. \u201cThe government and public praised them for doing the right thing but some site owners were angry about having their sites blocked.\u201d The government also passed legislation in April that made companies and their staff liable for not quickly removing abhorrent violent material from access. Maximum penalties include fines of up to 10% of annual turnover for corporations or imprisonment for up three years for individuals. At the time, the government, which passed the laws with the support of Labor, faced criticism for rushing the legislation. The sudden change meant internet service providers such as Telstra, Optus, and TPG were in a bind.

The report came up with a short-term solution to fix the legally murky issue of blocking websites hosting the Christchurch shooter video and manifesto. The companies would continue to block those sites at the direction of the eSafety commissioner, using powers that the eSafety commissioner already had to direct telecommunications companies to act under Section 581 of the Telecommunications Act. This would mean they were legally protected. The group then proposed developing protocols for the commissioner to issue new notices of sites to be blocked in the event of another Christchurch-style incident, with landing pages to tell people visiting those sites why they are blocked. Eventually the protocols would be enshrined in legislation. But the proposal raises the spectre of mandatory internet filtering \u2013 something the Coalition government, and Labor before it, have considered but ultimately shied away from. Currently there are limited circumstances where websites can be blocked from view in Australia. Government agencies can issue notices under section 313 of the Telecommunications Act to block websites but, aside from blocking child abuse websites, it is a seldom-used power, following one agency accidentally blocking 1,200 websites by mistake. In the 2017-2018 financial year, no state or federal agencies used the law to block websites, according to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma). Sites hosting copyright infringing material such as torrents for TV shows and movies can also be blocked \u2013 but only with a court order. The proposal takes the eSafety commissioner\u2019s powers one step further from its role in compelling companies into removing bullying material or revenge porn from websites to compelling the internet service providers into actively blocking content deemed by the commissioner to be terrorist or extreme violent material. How that material is defined is likely to be a matter for debate but the taskforce has said that it should be material that: depicts actual violent crime encourages or instructs a terrorist, terrorist group, terrorist act or a person to commit a violence crime murder, attempted murder, torture, rape, violent kidnapping The definition of violent crime could include graphic violence, violent content or gore. But the taskforce identified that there needed to be exemptions to ensure news organisations and journalists are not caught up by the law, nor those raising awareness about human rights abuses, acts of terrorism, as well as those making social commentary or doing so for academic, artistic, education or law enforcement purposes. The detail of how the new site-blocking regime would work in practice still needed to be worked out by the government and industry, Stanton said. In a statement, a spokesperson for the eSafety commissioner said they would work closely with industry and those affected to ensure the scheme \u201cwill achieve the right outcomes for all parties concerned, including Australian internet users\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Kazan Brown\u2019s father helped build Warragamba Dam \u2013 under a kind of duress \u2013 after he was forced off his land by it. The first walls went up in 1948, 138m high, flooding the Burragorang Valley. The Gundungurra people had known it for over 50,000 years, as a place, in creation stories, carved out by a battle between two spirits: Mirragan and Gurangatch. It took 12 years to trap all that water, a greater volume than in Sydney harbour, and the toil of 1,800 workers \u2013 15 of whom died. And they lost the valley. The government evicted some of the Indigenous occupants, acquired land, and put it underwater. Brown\u2019s great-grandmother refused to leave, and her sons had to walk in and carry her out, leaving all the furniture behind. \u201cMy mother was born there. My grandfather was born there. We go back before settlement in this area,\u201d she says. \u201cWe grew up looking after it. We lived here. My family came out of the valley and moved into Warragamba and it has just been part of us \u2013 part of our life.\u201d Warragamba Dam now provides water to the 4.5m people of greater Sydney and surrounding areas. In the 1980s, they raised the wall by 5m. Now the state government is planning to raise the wall again \u2013 by 14 or 17 metres, the figures differ. This would create an extra 995 gigalitres to store flood waters and mitigate the flood risk to the houses of the Hawkesbury-Nepean floodplain \u2013 suburbs like Richmond and Windsor, which lie just east of the Blue Mountains. But a leaked report said this would also \u201cpermanently\u201d change the Blue Mountains \u2013 which are world heritage listed for their beauty, biodiversity and Indigenous sacred sites. Over 40 endangered plant and animal species are found there, and while the impact estimates vary and are incomplete, the change would increase the severity and frequency of floods in parts of the world heritage areas. It would \u201chave an overall high direct (physical) impact\u201d on 1,300 hectares and \u201cresult in permanent environmental changes\u201d, according to a draft impact report prepared for the government. The UN has said the move will \u201clikely have an impact on the outstanding universal value\u201d of the mountains, and have warned the government they will be watching. Brown is a Gundungurra woman, a traditional custodian of the land. \u201cWhat could be lost?\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got burials, art sites. Ceremony sites, camp sites, you name it. It\u2019s all there. It\u2019s our culture \u2013 that\u2019s what will be lost.\u201d Brown\u2019s daughter, Taylor Clarke, 21, is with her at a lookout over the dam. A university student who spends her free time with her mother on the campaign, Clarke just wrapped up six months working in the office of the former Greens NSW upper house MP Justin Field. She speaks quickly \u2013 the figures at the front of her mind. \u201cAlso at risk are two more of the waterholes sacred to the creation story. Eleven were inundated when the dam was made. There are only 15 altogether. \u201cI think part of the problem is that we don\u2019t know the full breadth of what will be lost. When the dam was made, a lot of people moved out of the area, and they took with them their knowledge and custodianship of these areas. \u201cMum spent her whole life researching it and finding family members again, and neighbours to figure it all out again. If the dam wall goes ahead there is so much that will be lost that we don\u2019t even know.\u201d Brown and Clarke say there are alternatives to raising the dam wall. A September 2018 report, from the Australian National University, says the same. Prepared by associate professor Jamie Pittock, the report recommends lowering the storage level of the dam instead \u2013 which would provide space for floodwater. Desalination plants and other water saving measures would then make up the shortfall. Stuart Ayres, the minister for western Sydney, has stressed that no final decision has been made to raise the wall. \u201c[It] will only take place after financial, environmental and cultural assessments have concluded,\u201d he said in a statement. But Ayres and the government say the proposal has to be looked at, and the positive impacts on the floodplain balanced with the negative impacts on the Blue Mountains. \u201cRaising the dam wall is a key part of the strategy to reduce the existing risk to life and property on the Hawkesbury-Nepean floodplain \u2026 While there will be environmental impacts from temporarily holding flood water from behind a raised dam wall, they must be measured against the social and financial impact a catastrophic flood would have on Western Sydney communities.\u201d Both the Blue Mountains\u2019 valleys and the Hawkesbury-Nepean plains are naturally prone to flooding \u2013 and flood mitigation needs to be taken \u2013 that much is agreed. But Pittock\u2019s report says the government ignored other options that would have less of an effect on the world heritage sites. In May 2017, announcing the dam raising plan, Water NSW described the floodplain as \u201cthe most flood-prone region in NSW, if not Australia\u201d. \u201cWhile major flooding has not happened in the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley for more than 25 years, it can occur at any time. Sometimes, extreme weather events will strike without warning, so we all need to be prepared.\u201d If the worst flood on record struck today, 90,000 people would be evacuated, 12,000 homes flooded and it would cause $5bn in damage. Raising the wall, the government says, would reduce flood damage by 75% on average. Any resulting flooding of world heritage areas would be \u201ctemporary inundation\u201d, which already \u201coccurs now during flood events\u201d. \u201cThe duration and depth of temporary flooding would vary\u201d, it says, depending on the location and size of the flood. But the Pittock report says the alternatives are better. \u201cLowering the full storage level of Warragamba Dam by 12 metres would free 795 billion litres of airspace for flood control [and] would have no upstream environmental impacts and can be implemented immediately,\u201d it says. \u201cThis option was briefly mentioned as part of the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley Flood Risk Management Strategy but dismissed on the grounds that it would compromise Sydney\u2019s water security.\u201d But according to the report, analysis from the University of Technology Sydney says the alternative would be \u201cmore cost effective\u201d than raising the dam wall and \u201calso enhances Sydney\u2019s water security\u201d. The report slammed the NSW government, saying these alternatives had been discarded in favour of developments. \u201cFlood risk has been exacerbated by local councils and the NSW Government approving housing developments on low lying lands over several decades,\u201d it said. \u201cThe NSW Government\u2019s strategy is constrained by two overriding policy decisions, namely that it will not reduce the 5,000 houses on the most flood-prone lands, and that it will allow an additional 134,000 people to settle in harm\u2019s way on the floodplain over the next 30 years.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning As Brown says: \u201cThere are alternatives.

Greenhill hopes the UN will have sway. \u201cThe UN are people of mild language,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd when they indicate real concern, that means real concern. We are at a crossroads. Very soon this won\u2019t be recoverable, once that work begins.\u201d Back at Warragamba, Brown and Clarke say they will see this through to the end. \u201cI expected to have my whole life to learn about this,\u201d says Clarke about the area, her family and its history. \u201cAll of a sudden there is a time limit. That\u2019s what I\u2019m working against. I\u2019m fighting for that opportunity to keep learning and to have my kids keep learning as well.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s been learning since she was little,\u201d says Brown. Naturally, the conversation circles back to their family. It underscores the connection \u2013 their family lived here, saw the dam start, were dislocated by it, helped build it, and know this place and its importance. They say they know what is best for it now. Brown stresses that her father built the dam out of necessity \u2013 it is a bittersweet connection. \u201cHe worked on the dam because he wanted to stay close to home,\u201d she says. \u201cIt would have been pretty hard for him. He lost everything. He\u2019d just been kicked out of his home. \u201cIt\u2019s strange, I know,\u201d says Brown. \u201cBut if it was up to me, they would leave it as it was. It wouldn\u2019t be touched.\u201d",

Elmes told the court: \u201cHe was trying to console me over the phone.\u201d Elmes said Nicholson, 25, called him again about an hour later, and added: \u201cHe sounded depressed \u2026 he didn\u2019t sound himself, it just sounded dark.\u201d The witness said he called Nicholson, who had been his best friend, at 3pm to tell him Lucy\u2019s death had been confirmed, and he spoke to him again that night. He said Nicholson, a carer and tattooist, \u201cweirded\u201d him out because he talked about where her body had been found, which had not yet been published by the media. Elmes said that after Lucy had failed to return home by her normal time of 7.30pm on 25 July, her mother began searching for her. He added: \u201cIt was complete panic, everyone was distraught.\u201d He said a note was found that had gone through their washing machine entitled \u201cAbuse\u201d. Elmes read out the phrase from the mostly illegible note: \u201cWalk away from my sex with him, forced me back in.\u201d The court has been told that Nicholson allegedly sexually abused Lucy while he was lodging at her family home in Southampton. Elmes said that he believed Lucy had a \u201cschoolgirl crush\u201d on Nicholson and, in May 2018, he walked in on \u201cLucy giving him a hug\u201d before the defendant pushed her away. The witness said that on 23 July during a row between Nicholson and Lucy, she shouted at the defendant: \u201cI have got a hold on you anyway.\u201d Elmes said: \u201cI told him that basically he had to grab his stuff up and he had to leave.\u201d Dr Basil Purdue, a pathologist, told the court that Lucy\u2019s death was caused by 11 stab wounds to the right of her neck caused by a knife at least 7cm long. Purdue said: \u201cThe cause of her death was catastrophic bleeding from a series of 11 injuries to the right side of the neck. This would have been rapidly followed by further sharp injuries to the face, neck, chest and lower forearms.\u201d He added that one injury to Lucy\u2019s left wrist area, appeared as if it could have been inflicted deliberately in a bid \u201cto divert suspicions away from homicide\u201d. The trial has heard that the defendant told police that Lucy had sent him a message saying she was pregnant but Purdue said blood tests showed she was not. Nicholson is charged with Lucy\u2019s murder as well as three counts of rape against her when she was aged 12. He also faces two charges of sexual activity with a child against Lucy on multiple occasions when she was aged 13. In addition, Nicholson is also charged with sexual activity with a child in relation to another girl aged 14 in 2012. The defendant denies the charges and the trial continues.",

The world\u2019s largest oil-producing nations have reportedly agreed to extend until March a deal, first struck after the 2016 oil price crash, to cut 1.2m barrels of oil a day from the global market. The 14-country cartel is meeting in Vienna this week to determine a coordinated response to the growth of the US shale oil industry and the slowdown of the global economy. Market commentators fear that these twin threats risk destabilising the balance between supply and demand in the oil market which could cause prices to drop. Manuel Quevedo, the president of the Opec conference, said: \u201cOver the past month or so we have seen a growing list of escalating uncertainties.\u201d Quevedo, who is also Venezuela\u2019s energy minister, said the oil market exposed concerns over \u201ctrade negotiations, monetary policy developments, as well as geopolitical issues\u201d, adding: \u201cThere are clear signs of some economic bearishness, and many institutions are pointing to a more challenging outlook for oil supply and demand fundamentals.\u201d Opec will seek the backing of an alliance of large oil producers from outside the cartel, led by Russia, at a separate meeting of the Opec+ group in the Austrian capital on Tuesday. The Opec+ agreement is expected to move ahead after Iran and Russia both offered public support to the plan despite concerns they might block it. The agreement caused oil prices to rise by a dollar to more than $66 a barrel on Monday. It followed a rally across global markets after the G20 meeting over the weekend raised hopes of a peace deal in the US-China trade war. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said over the weekend that he had agreed with Saudi Arabia, Opec\u2019s de facto leader, to extend the existing output cuts until December 2019 or March 2020. Iran has also said it will not stand in the way of the deal despite being sidelined within Opec while it faces tough US sanctions, which have taken a heavy toll on Iranian oil exports. The Iranian oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh, said in Vienna that Iran was not going to leave Opec but warned that the cartel would \u201cdie\u201d if Saudi Arabia and Russia continued to make unilateral decisions for the group. \u201cThe important thing to me is that Opec remains Opec. It has lost its authority and it is on the verge of collapse,\u201d he said. The cartel is also under pressure from Donald Trump, who has called on the group to increase its output to make up for the lost Iranian oil barrels. The US has imposed sanctions on Tehran amid deepening geopolitical tensions, but hopes to avoid raising pump prices. Meanwhile, leading oil producers are said to favour oil prices of at least $70 a barrel.",

Then he decided to go it alone, and set up his own firm, Woodford Investment Management, in 2014.</p>\n    <p><b>Why has he shut his main fund?<br></b>The Woodford Equity Income Fund is Woodford\u2019s flagship fund, and it is understood it has several hundred thousand investors. On 3 June he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/03/neil-woodford-blocks-investors-from-pulling-cash-from-flagship-fund\">blocked investors from pulling their cash out of the fund</a> after a dramatic jump in customer withdrawals after its performance went south following a series of bad stock market bets. The move gives him time to restructure the fund\u2019s portfolio and sell off some assets in order to raise cash to meet the likely flood of redemptions when the fund does eventually reopen. On 1 July Woodford announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/01/block-on-withdrawals-from-neil-woodford-fund-extended\">the fund will remain suspended</a> until \u2013 at the earliest \u2013 the next review deadline of 29 July.</p>\n    <p><b>What does it mean for investors?<br></b>Put simply, they are blocked from accessing their investments until further notice. Existing investors will continue to own units in the fund, and they are being reassured that their money is safe. But there\u2019s no certainty about what their investment will be worth. While the official position is that no exceptions are being made, if you are facing a real crisis and badly need your cash, it is probably worth giving the firm a try to see if they might budge for you.</p>\n    <p><b>When will the fund open again?<br></b>Most commentators seem to expect the fund to effectively stay shut for some time to come. Woodford will need to build up a big pot of cash ready to meet redemptions when the fund reopens \u2013 easily several hundred million pounds.

Labour has demanded an independent investigation into claims made in the Times on Saturday, which said senior civil servants had discussed their worries about what may happen if the Labour leader became prime minister. The report cited anonymous senior civil servants who said they were concerned that Corbyn seemed to lack a firm grasp of issues and was being \u201cpropped up\u201d by his advisers. The shadow Cabinet Office minister, Jon Trickett, raised the leak in parliament on Monday, saying: \u201cI\u2019m standing next to the leader of the opposition, whose fitness I must say is legendary.\u201d He condemned what he called an \u201cundemocratic and unconstitutional intervention attributed to senior civil servants and based on a falsehood printed in Saturday\u2019s Times\u201d. Trickett added: \u201cThere must be no hesitation at all to condemn the kind of behaviour reported, and I would hope that the government roots out any miscreants or behaviour in this way.\u201d Asked about the leak, Theresa May\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cImpartiality is one of the fundamental values of the civil service and underpins its ability to effectively serve the government of the day.

Sedwill is a former diplomat who served as Nato\u2019s civilian representative to Afghanistan, where he struck up a close relationship with the US general Stanley McCrystal. Corbyn\u2019s allies believe the motive for the leak was political, based on concerns among securocrats in Whitehall about Labour\u2019s stance on the Middle East. As cabinet secretary, Sedwill could play a key role in any constitutional wrangle over a no-deal Brexit in the coming months and would be expected to liaise with Labour during a general election, as his predecessor did in 2017. Labour sources suggested there would be a lack of trust if he could not provide an adequate explanation for where the Times story came from. One unnamed senior civil servant was quoted as telling the Times: \u201cThere is a real worry that the Labour leader isn\u2019t up to the job physically or mentally but is being propped up by those around him.

      "bodyText": "The US art photographer and activist Nan Goldin has led a protest outside the Louvre in Paris demanding that the world\u2019s most visited museum change the name of its Sackler wing because some of the multibillionaire family of art philanthropists benefited from the business of addictive prescription painkillers. In recent months Goldin has taken part in protests at US museums and threatened UK gallery boycotts over donations from one branch of the Sackler family, which is accused of profiting from the US opioid crisis as the owners of the American pharmaceutical company that makes the highly addictive prescription painkiller OxyContin. The Louvre demonstration on Monday was the first time Goldin had taken her international campaign to France. The artist waded into the fountains beneath the Louvre\u2019s pyramid with more than a dozen activists carrying red banners stating: \u201cTake down the Sackler name.\u201d About 40 protesters chanted, \u201cShame on Sackler\u201d as crowds of tourists looked on. One activist lay down in the fountain and others played dead around the edge. The Louvre\u2019s Sackler wing is made up of 12 rooms of near eastern antiquities, including key pieces from the museum\u2019s Persian collection. The Sackler name is prominent at many global art institutions as a result of financial support given by the family. The Louvre confirmed that the Theresa and Mortimer Sackler foundation had donated to the refurbishment of its rooms of Persian and Levantine art in the period 1996 to 1997. No donation from the Sackler family has been made to the museum since. Demonstrators from the campaign group Pain (Prescription Addiction Intervention Now) said they believed that the Louvre was not contractually bound in perpetuity to display the Sackler name. They urged it to be the first major museum to remove the name from its galleries. Goldin said: \u201cThe museum world must act. I hope the Louvre understands that artists and activists are mobilised to get the name removed, and the Louvre could be the first museum to take the Sackler name down. Often there\u2019s a domino effect among museums and galleries.\u201d In March, London\u2019s National Portrait Gallery became the first major art institution to drop a plan for a grant from the Sackler family, in a move that campaigners said was a landmark victory in the battle over the ethics of arts funding. The gallery said it had been jointly agreed with the branch of the Sackler family whose company makes OxyContin that it would \u201cnot proceed at this time\u201d with a \u00a31m donation. Goldin has also staged protests at the Guggenheim and Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Goldin said: \u201cThe Louvre is one of the world\u2019s greatest museums and one of the most visited museums on Earth. It has 12 Sackler rooms. But this crisis has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans and it\u2019s coming Europe\u2019s way. This is an emergency.\u201d During the protest, Goldin, who currently has work on show at a modern art exhibition at the Palace of Versailles, wore her medal, the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres, an honorary award from the French state for her art. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve worn it,\u201d she said. Goldin began her campaign against the Sacklers after she became addicted to powerful prescription painkillers. She has since demanded that arts institutions in the US and Britain refuse further Sackler donations and argued that the family should instead pay for treatment and rehabilitation for opioid addicts. The Louvre security guards allowed the protest to take place peacefully for more than 30 minutes before the activists moved away of their own accord. Goldin said she would seek a meeting with museum staff to discuss the campaign to rename the Sackler wing. A spokesperson from the Louvre confirmed that about 15 people were involved in the protest inside the fountain, but declined to comment further. Representatives for the members of the Sackler family who own Purdue declined to comment. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 July 2019 to clarify a reference to the decision to drop a proposed donation to London\u2019s National Portrait Gallery by some Sackler family members \u2013 the gallery and the family members said it had been a joint decision.",

      "bodyText": "A lab run by one of Britain\u2019s foremost academics published fraudulent scientific papers for more than a decade, according to investigators. Work at Prof David Latchman\u2019s laboratory at UCL Institute of Child Health came under scrutiny from senior academics after an anonymous whistleblower alleged that dozens of papers from the lab were doctored. Latchman, a prominent geneticist with hundreds of papers to his name, oversaw research by about two dozen scientists at the laboratory from the early 1990s until 2003 when he became master of Birkbeck, University of London. UCL initially refused to release the reports from two separate misconduct investigations in 2014 and 2015 but finally made them public on Monday. The Guardian had requested the documents under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 in January and, after a lengthy delay, referred the case to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office. The reports show that experts convened by UCL found evidence of research fraud in each of the investigations and called for the doctored papers to be retracted. One panel said fabricated data it had spotted \u201cmight be just the tip of the iceberg\u201d and said work in many other papers was \u201cvery sloppy\u201d. The studies covered a range of topics from human genetics to heart attacks. While the reports did not claim that Latchman fabricated data himself or had any knowledge of the behaviour, an allegation of research misconduct against him was upheld. \u201cWhilst he did not intentionally commit the misconduct in research identified in this investigation, his recklessness in the conduct of his laboratory and his involvement as author on many publications facilitated that misconduct,\u201d one panel found. The first expert panel checked 28 papers from Latchman\u2019s lab dating back to 1997 and found evidence for research misconduct in eight of them.

In some papers, fabrications were \u201cfundamental\u201d to the conclusions reached by the authors. \u201cIn the panel\u2019s view the evidence clearly indicates that the researchers in the laboratory had developed a culture outside the accepted standards of research integrity,\u201d one panel found. Latchman\u2019s department has so far retracted at least six papers and corrected two more. One retracted study contained an old image that was dressed up as new data. In a second retraction, six images had been flipped or copied and relabelled to make them look new. A co-author of the second paper, Anastasis Stephanou, who is now at the European University in Cyprus, admitted responsibility for the latter manipulations and said Latchman and the paper\u2019s other authors were \u201ccompletely unaware\u201d of the changes. Further questions have been raised over dozens of studies from Latchman\u2019s group on the PubPeer website, a forum used by academics to discuss scientific research. UCL said: \u201cThese reports concluded that manipulation of research data had occurred in many research papers during the period of Prof David Latchman\u2019s time as head of the unit.\u201d As a result, it said, UCL started formal disciplinary action against a former member of Latchman\u2019s research group, who it did not identify, but the individual resigned before it was completed.

      "body": "<p>Min Hogg was past 40 and out of work when she read the PO box newspaper ad: wanted, an editor for \u201can international arts and interiors magazine\u201d to be published by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Kelly_(publisher)\" title=\"\">Kevin Kelly</a>, who had found a gap in the glossy market. She replied with not just her robust CV but a detailed critique proposing a mag unlike any other house monthly available. Thus Hogg and Kelly, from an unsmart office over a flower shop on Fulham Road, London, created Interiors (later the World of Interiors), the most influential UK decor publication since <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann%27s_Repository\" title=\"\">Ackermann\u2019s Repository of the Arts</a> two centuries before. Just to have a copy in your home (not on a coffee table: Hogg despised coffee tables) was to be living well.</p> <p>For Hogg, who has died aged 80, Interiors was a chance to turn her hobby of snooping on the innards of other people\u2019s houses into a mission. She never met a front door she didn\u2019t want to go through and had already scouted years of picture-worthy houses before the first edition came out in 1981, while her social network tipped her off about likely premises. Imagination, not importance, was her chief criterion for inclusion, plus the evident delight of people in what they had put together, whether an art collection in Albany or 10 tin trays on the walls of a South African mud house, every inch of that earth hand-smoothed.</p> <p>Hogg rejected perfection to show dusty attics, flaking frescoes, crowded shelves, worn carpets, the kitchens of the schloss or the potting shed of the palazzo. Her curiosity was ethnographic, about how landscape, society and history shape local habitations and living, and she realised that, by the 1980s, national styles could travel: a Gustavian country house glimpsed in an Ingmar Bergman film led her to pursue such Swedish buildings, and people are still painting their walls the Scandinavian blue-greys she promoted.</p> <p>She ignored magazine rules about pacing layouts to blow half a dozen spreads a month on barmy subjects \u2013 wrought-iron latches or taxidermied Victorian squirrels. Interiors\u2019 front and back pages, in the early years unencumbered by much advertising, were also rethought (Hogg considered neither advertisers nor readers: \u201cYou mean you actually care what they think?\u201d) Most glossies then had colonnades of filler text supporting small ads; Interiors ran very personal essays on decorative arts with fine illustrations. As for the sacred monthly magazine tradition of cover lines emblazoned on the front, trailing the stories inside, her view was that few or no words should impede a striking picture.</p> <p>Born in London, Hogg claimed that her assured taste came from her mother, Pollie (nee Dalby), who decorated the family house, a villa in <a href=\"http://www.londongardenstrust.org/features/regents.htm\" title=\"\">John Nash\u2019s 1820 Regent\u2019s Park development</a>, and took her to stately homes and museums; Hogg\u2019s own first venture in decor was to wallpaper her bedroom.

      "bodyText": "Min Hogg was past 40 and out of work when she read the PO box newspaper ad: wanted, an editor for \u201can international arts and interiors magazine\u201d to be published by Kevin Kelly, who had found a gap in the glossy market. She replied with not just her robust CV but a detailed critique proposing a mag unlike any other house monthly available. Thus Hogg and Kelly, from an unsmart office over a flower shop on Fulham Road, London, created Interiors (later the World of Interiors), the most influential UK decor publication since Ackermann\u2019s Repository of the Arts two centuries before. Just to have a copy in your home (not on a coffee table: Hogg despised coffee tables) was to be living well. For Hogg, who has died aged 80, Interiors was a chance to turn her hobby of snooping on the innards of other people\u2019s houses into a mission. She never met a front door she didn\u2019t want to go through and had already scouted years of picture-worthy houses before the first edition came out in 1981, while her social network tipped her off about likely premises. Imagination, not importance, was her chief criterion for inclusion, plus the evident delight of people in what they had put together, whether an art collection in Albany or 10 tin trays on the walls of a South African mud house, every inch of that earth hand-smoothed. Hogg rejected perfection to show dusty attics, flaking frescoes, crowded shelves, worn carpets, the kitchens of the schloss or the potting shed of the palazzo. Her curiosity was ethnographic, about how landscape, society and history shape local habitations and living, and she realised that, by the 1980s, national styles could travel: a Gustavian country house glimpsed in an Ingmar Bergman film led her to pursue such Swedish buildings, and people are still painting their walls the Scandinavian blue-greys she promoted. She ignored magazine rules about pacing layouts to blow half a dozen spreads a month on barmy subjects \u2013 wrought-iron latches or taxidermied Victorian squirrels. Interiors\u2019 front and back pages, in the early years unencumbered by much advertising, were also rethought (Hogg considered neither advertisers nor readers: \u201cYou mean you actually care what they think?\u201d) Most glossies then had colonnades of filler text supporting small ads; Interiors ran very personal essays on decorative arts with fine illustrations. As for the sacred monthly magazine tradition of cover lines emblazoned on the front, trailing the stories inside, her view was that few or no words should impede a striking picture. Born in London, Hogg claimed that her assured taste came from her mother, Pollie (nee Dalby), who decorated the family house, a villa in John Nash\u2019s 1820 Regent\u2019s Park development, and took her to stately homes and museums; Hogg\u2019s own first venture in decor was to wallpaper her bedroom. Her father, Sir James Cecil Hogg, became physician to the Queen; not unconnectedly, the first issue of Interiors had unprecedented pictures of Buckingham Palace\u2019s private quarters, and Hogg had entry to most venues. After boarding at Benenden school in Kent, she studied interior design at the Central School of Arts (now Central Saint Martins), with lectures from Terence Conran, whose then wife Caroline, working on Queen magazine, offered her a typist\u2019s job there. Apart from a mistaken interlude as a photography agent (she would have preferred to do the shoots herself), Hogg worked her way into, and up, in journalism, writing on design for the Observer, and joining Harpers &amp; Queen as a fashion editor, later chief fashion editor, in 1974. But rapid turnover in clothes didn\u2019t satisfy her the way the slow accretion of a household did; slow was the operative word, as she detested fast makeovers by interior designers.

Please don\u2019t tell me you had to have been there. I have been there, which is why I will never go back. Nonetheless, loads of people have a brilliant time, and good luck to them. And every year someone astonishes me. This year it was Billie Eilish, who seems to have been alive for less time than the set the Cure played to end the festival. She is a dark star. In control, but slightly out of it. Scarily good at tapping into the angsty teenage girl in all of us. The one who sets fire to things for fun. The one who puts spiders in her mouth. The one who wonders a lot about being dead. She wears baggy clothes because she does not want to be sexualised, but, at 17, she already is. This is the territory she is having to negotiate.

The case shocked the United States, bringing renewed attention to the lynching of African Americans, and is considered a watershed moment in the civil rights movement.",

      "bodyText": "The footwear chain Office is considering a restructure that could result in some store closures in the latest sign of tough times on the high street. The retailer, which has about 100 UK stores and 20 concessions in other stores including Topshop, House of Fraser and Selfridges, suffered a 3% fall in UK sales in the six months to December 2018 as it closed six outlets. Sources said Office was considering plans for a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency process which companies including the Topshop owner, Arcadia, Mothercare and Carpetright have all used to close stores and cut rents. A CVA is one of a number of options being considered after Office\u2019s owner, the South African retailer Truworths, appointed advisers from the turnaround firm Alvarez &amp; Marsal. A plan for the UK group, which employs nearly 3,000 people according to accounts filed at Companies House, is expected to be finalised in coming weeks, according to Sky News, which first reported the appointment of Alvarez &amp; Marsal. Truworths, which is listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange, said online sales rose 7.2% during the six months to 30 December 2018 so that they now made up a third of Office\u2019s sales, reflecting the industry-wide switch to shopping on the internet. In its interim financial report, Truworths said the UK had a fragile retail economy which was expected to remain under \u201cextreme pressure\u201d amid uncertainty over Brexit but that staff morale at Office was high as sales had risen in the first weeks of the new year.",

That holds true. But my attitude to Tuesday\u2019s game of soccer is a little more complicated, even more existential. I want the USA to beat England because I think the USA is a better place to be.</p> <p>What follows is literally based on the last book I read, but I think it bears explaining. It was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2017/11/10/a-guide-to-presidential-impeachment-just-in-case-not-thinking-of-anyone-in-particular-really/?utm_term=.715909d201e8\">Impeachment: A Citizen\u2019s Guide by Cass Sunstein</a>, a law professor at Harvard. It\u2019s a history of the constitutional mechanism by which the Americans can remove their leader, and are indeed supposed to if he or she has abused their power. It is obviously written for those who wish such a fate on the current occupant of the White House. As I do.</p> <p>The reason I want the USA to beat England is to be found in its title. Sunstein has written \u201ca citizen\u2019s guide\u201d.</p> <p>If you are an American, New York or anywhere else born, you are a citizen. Nominally at least \u2013 I\u2019m aware of America\u2019s past, present and future of massive and shattering injustice \u2013 you are one of 329 million equals. You and your fellow Americans have the power to remove your leader, because that leader is deemed to be equal to you. You may not choose to remove him or her, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/30/democrats-impeach-trump-pelosi-congress-pressure\">for political reasons perhaps</a>, but you have the power to do so. The same cannot be said for Englishmen, or indeed anyone else in Britain.</p> <p>I live in New York and I have family and friends in Boston, Washington, California and plenty of points in between. But I am not a citizen. Should impeachment come, I cannot take part. Sunstein has prompted me to remember what in fact I am.</p> <p>I am a subject of the Queen, a leader I would rather not have. Short of revolution, I cannot remove her. I am simply deemed unequal to one other Briton, London born if with German roots, and the whole rotten caste that supports her.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/30/trump-lincoln-sidney-blumenthal\">Trump's 4 July hijack merely proclaims his megalomania | Sidney Blumenthal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And so here I am, in the week of 4 July, living in a country which deems all men and women to have been created equal, a truth that holds self-evident whatever the shortcomings of the government built upon it.</p> <p>Abraham Lincoln <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/liho/learn/historyculture/independence-hall.htm\">said</a> he \u201cnever had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence\u201d.

At another World Cup, in Japan later this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/usarugby\">the US men\u2019s rugby team</a> will attempt to compete with England. Go Eagles.</p> <p>Heavy thinking boosts a simple love of family. I love my homeland but I love my adopted home too. For all its travails, the United States of America was built in service of its people. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland \u2013 three fourths of which may join me in rooting for America tomorrow \u2013 was not.</p> <p>I cannot be an American, New York born. But if America will have me, I can be one yet by oath.</p> <p>So much for weighty decisions. Switching allegiance is easier in front of a TV, with a beer, watching a US team play a strong attacking game with stars like Megan Rapinoe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/27/megan-rapinoe-american-values-trump-criticism\">unafraid to speak truth to power in the best American way</a>.</p> <p>Go USA.</p>",

What follows is literally based on the last book I read, but I think it bears explaining. It was Impeachment: A Citizen\u2019s Guide by Cass Sunstein, a law professor at Harvard. It\u2019s a history of the constitutional mechanism by which the Americans can remove their leader, and are indeed supposed to if he or she has abused their power. It is obviously written for those who wish such a fate on the current occupant of the White House. As I do. The reason I want the USA to beat England is to be found in its title. Sunstein has written \u201ca citizen\u2019s guide\u201d. If you are an American, New York or anywhere else born, you are a citizen. Nominally at least \u2013 I\u2019m aware of America\u2019s past, present and future of massive and shattering injustice \u2013 you are one of 329 million equals. You and your fellow Americans have the power to remove your leader, because that leader is deemed to be equal to you. You may not choose to remove him or her, for political reasons perhaps, but you have the power to do so. The same cannot be said for Englishmen, or indeed anyone else in Britain. I live in New York and I have family and friends in Boston, Washington, California and plenty of points in between. But I am not a citizen. Should impeachment come, I cannot take part. Sunstein has prompted me to remember what in fact I am. I am a subject of the Queen, a leader I would rather not have. Short of revolution, I cannot remove her. I am simply deemed unequal to one other Briton, London born if with German roots, and the whole rotten caste that supports her. And so here I am, in the week of 4 July, living in a country which deems all men and women to have been created equal, a truth that holds self-evident whatever the shortcomings of the government built upon it. Abraham Lincoln said he \u201cnever had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence\u201d. Nor did I. Increasingly, it\u2019s the same when it comes to sports. At another World Cup, in Japan later this year, the US men\u2019s rugby team will attempt to compete with England. Go Eagles. Heavy thinking boosts a simple love of family. I love my homeland but I love my adopted home too. For all its travails, the United States of America was built in service of its people. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland \u2013 three fourths of which may join me in rooting for America tomorrow \u2013 was not. I cannot be an American, New York born. But if America will have me, I can be one yet by oath. So much for weighty decisions. Switching allegiance is easier in front of a TV, with a beer, watching a US team play a strong attacking game with stars like Megan Rapinoe, unafraid to speak truth to power in the best American way. Go USA.",

When she gets the service she needs, she is deadliest when racing in behind defences and finishing from difficult, wide angles. Although she played in France with Lyon for a short stint in 2017 and improved her ability to take on defenders, her bread and butter remains the very American approach of relying on pace and power to blast past the opposition.</p> <p>But after scoring five goals against Thailand in USA\u2019s first game of the World Cup, she has not scored since. That Thailand game was a weird one \u2013 it set the record for the biggest win in World Cup history \u2013 and since it might have been alarming if Morgan had not scored multiple goals, it is easy to write off.</p> <p>For most strikers, no goals in four World Cup games would be a disappointment but it has allowed Morgan to show off other vital parts of her game.</p> <p>\u201cIn general our team has been able to adapt to what the game has given us, and that includes myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been given different roles within the team defensively and on the attacking side. All I want to do is execute that and I think that I have.\u201d</p> <p>She displayed a different role in the quarter-final against France, which USA won 2-1 thanks to two goals from the effervescent left-winger Megan Rapinoe. Rather than hanging around up top, waiting for balls in behind, Morgan dropped deeper, holding up the ball and finding the wings. She was the one who threaded the ball to Tobin Heath, racing past her on the right for what turned into the winner.</p> <p>\u201cThe kudos to Alex is that she has a balance in her game, in terms of penetration or, like in the France game, being more of a player who can hold the ball up for us,\u201d the USA manager, Jill Ellis, said. \u201cSometimes you get one or the other but Alex has worked on that and has that balance.\u201d</p> <p>The centre-back Abby Dahlkemper said Morgan\u2019s ability to shift from a target striker to a holding player shows why she is so potent. \u201cShe is that link player, dropping off the centre-backs to connect for the transition,\u201d Dahlkemper said. \u201cShe did awesome and proved why she\u2019s one of the top strikers in the world \u2013 not only being able to score goals but set them up as well.\u201d</p> <p>While Morgan is adept at using her movement to drag defenders around and create space, her back-to-goal hold-up play is perhaps the most underrated part of her game. That is especially true when teams target her, just as Spain and France tried to do.</p> <p>\u201cAs a No 9 I\u2019m going to be ploughed through quite often and that comes with the job,\u201d Morgan said.</p> <p>At this point, however, teams may be more worried about Rapinoe, who has tied Morgan\u2019s five goals for the competition. Unless Phil Neville mixes it up and asks Lucy Bronze to play in the midfield \u2013 a switch he teased was a possibility in his pre-match press conference \u2013 then Bronze, who Neville calls the best right-back in the world, will have the opportunity to contain Rapinoe.</p> <p>That could force Morgan to take up more of the goalscoring load again. Though she has almost always played as a central striker for USA, the left-footed Morgan played on the left wing for Lyon and she is comfortable floating wide into different areas in front of goal. That could allow her to be a roaming presence in a bid to overload Bronze.</p> <p>Whether Morgan\u2019s role on Tuesday will involve scoring goals or not, her teammates and manager are sure she will do whatever it takes to reach the World Cup final. \u201cI think there\u2019s a single-mindedness right now in Alex,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cI see that in her play and I see it off the field as well.\u201d</p> <h2>Four more to watch</h2> <p><strong>Megan Rapinoe</strong></p> <p>Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, Rapinoe has been the star of the USA team. With five goals in five games, it seems no one can stop her \u2014 not even the president of the United States, who apparently has nothing better to do than chastise Rapinoe for declining an invitation to the White House that he hadn\u2019t extended yet. Just look for the player with the pink hair delivering pinpoint crosses from the left wing. That\u2019s Pinoe.</p> <p><strong>Alyssa Naeher</strong></p> <p>The USA goalkeeper\u2019s biggest flaw is perhaps simply that she\u2019s not as good as Hope Solo, who holds the world record in clean sheets. But Naeher, who is playing in her first World Cup, has had her nervy moments, with a poor decision allowing Spain to score, and another error nearly letting Chile pull one back as well. Given England\u2019s attacking prowess, especially the co-Golden Boot leader Ellen White, Naeher is going to have a good game in the semi-final. If not, that may decide who advances.</p> <p><strong>Crystal Dunn</strong></p> <p>She doesn\u2019t consider herself a defender, but Dunn is the starting left-back for the Americans \u2013 and it\u2019s going to be her difficult task to shut Nikita Parris down. That could be deeply worrying, since one-on-one defending has never been Dunn\u2019s strongest skill, but she acquitted herself rather well against France\u2019s Kadidiatou Diana in the quarter-final. Dunn is a modern full-back who pushes high up the field to create a numerical advantage in the midfield, but she will still have to track back and stop Parris, which could be the key to keeping England off the scoreboard.</p> <p><strong>Julie Ertz</strong></p> <p>Unless Jill Ellis mixes things up, look for Ertz to start as a defensive midfielder and play a crucial role in preventing England\u2019s advancement up the field. Ertz, who is easy to spot with her bright blue headband, is a physical player who flies into tackles and is given a huge responsibility in covering a lot of the central-midfield. At times, she\u2019ll drop between the centre backs and help the USA build out of the back, too. But Ertz is the their best player in the air on set pieces, and this tournament has seen set pieces decide plenty of games, which means she may play an especially important role.</p>",

Requests are alleged to have been made to the UK through private Dubai channels seeking her return to the United Arab Emirates and she is believed to have been concerned about her personal safety in the UK. The Foreign Office, however, is understood to regard the matter as a private dispute. The UAE\u2019s embassy in London has denied that it has been involved in any discussion of Princess Haya\u2019s presence in the UK. A spokesperson for the UAE embassy said: \u201cThe UAE government does not intend to comment on allegations about individuals\u2019 private lives. As for whether it has raised such an issue with its German or British counterparts, the answer is no.\u201d The princess was reported to have travelled initially from Dubai to Germany and supposedly sought asylum there. Radha Stirling, chief executive of the campaign group Detained in Dubai, which follows events in the Gulf state closely, said: \u201cWe already know that Princess Latifa, Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s daughter, fled the UAE seeking asylum and alleging unspeakable abuse at the hands of her father. Now, it seems, Princess Haya, Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s wife, has also fled the country and sought refuge in Germany. \u201cObviously, this raises serious questions as to what prompted her to flee \u2026 She is, after all, a free adult woman, and the sister of the King of Jordan; yet apparently, she feels unsafe.\u201d Lawyers for Sheikh Mohammed declined to comment about the case.",

We have been in this situation before, decades ago, in the context of adult education. By focusing on women\u2019s return to learning and then access to higher education, we discovered that their children followed them.</p> <p>The answer seemed to lie in the home as much as school. None of my parents or grandparents went to university. After leaving school, I followed my father into shipbuilding and coal mining.

As a gauche, just 17-year-old in 1964, I went to Somerville (Oxford) and Girton (Cambridge) for interviews, from a tiny Pembrokeshire grammar school. I didn\u2019t get an offer from Oxford.

      "bodyText": "Bernie Evans asks a critical question about pupils from underprivileged backgrounds and suggests a more generous route into university (Letters, 29 June). We have been in this situation before, decades ago, in the context of adult education. By focusing on women\u2019s return to learning and then access to higher education, we discovered that their children followed them. The answer seemed to lie in the home as much as school. None of my parents or grandparents went to university. After leaving school, I followed my father into shipbuilding and coal mining. After 15 years of night schools, weekend schools and university extramural classes, I gained scholarships to Ruskin College and Magdalen College, Oxford. My children both went on to university and professional careers. Those systematic pathways for adults have been lost. Alan Tuckett, an adult education specialist, has asked: \u201cWhy has England seemingly set out to destroy adult learning opportunities?\u201d He might have added that for decades the Guardian provided systematic support and coverage of adult education. What happened? David Browning Huddersfield, West Yorkshire \u2022 There may well still be a privately educated bias in admissions to the former men\u2019s Oxbridge colleges, but there are honourable exceptions. As a gauche, just 17-year-old in 1964, I went to Somerville (Oxford) and Girton (Cambridge) for interviews, from a tiny Pembrokeshire grammar school. I didn\u2019t get an offer from Oxford. But two of my interviewers at Girton were scarily glamorous and intellectual Americans with no time for the British class system; another, Dame Gillian Beer, explicitly said that they always discounted for \u201cthe Roedean effect\u201d. And yes, they did offer me a place.

But even these are open to selective representation, depending on political standpoint.

An average of 64,000 tonnes of fishing nets are left in the ocean each year, and these were the first nylon items that Bonazzi\u2019s company collected for recycling, initially from the fish farming industry in Scotland and Norway, from professional divers who spotted ghost nets, and now from \u201call over the world \u2013 Japan, Australia, south-east Asia, north and South America\u201d.</p> <p>Lejeune says that, when she started the Ethical Fashion Forum in 2006, plastic as an issue was not on her radar. \u201cThat has really changed in the past two years.\u201d There is an obvious and pleasing circularity to the idea of swimmers bathing in recycled ocean waste.

As for Hassan, his family moved from Bangladesh to England in 1971; and he lived his teenage years listening to John Lennon\u2019s Imagine and Pink Floyd\u2019s Breathe (\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to care \u2026\u201d).</p> <p>On a sourcing trip for New Look in the early 90s, he drove past the dump near Kamalapur railway station in Bangladesh. The smell was appalling, but worse still he could see \u201cchildren eking out a living there\u201d, and started to think about a sustainable business model. With his partner Para Hamilton, he set up the charity <a href=\"http://www.childrens-hope.org/about\" title=\"\">Children\u2019s Hope</a> (one of Ninety Percent\u2019s beneficiaries). When the pair opened a factory in 2009, they provided a canteen with fresh food cooked daily. Other benefits include health insurance and on-site healthcare (there are now 12,000 employees and the factory has produced clothes for H&amp;M, Debenhams and New Look.)</p> <p>\u201cYounger companies have to lead the way in sustainability,\u201d Hassan says. But while Ninety Percent sounds like a radical idea, it is the result of decades of experience in the Bangladesh garment industry. Some of Hassan\u2019s questions remain. \u201cHow can we be an agent of change? How can we share empathy, compassion, value, purpose and transparency? Power to the people, [that] sort of thing.\u201d</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mpfneedham/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Matthew Needham</a> \u2013 transforming shopping trolleys into raincoats</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51a163086027b8e29325d03607d53d0adfc4fffa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51a163086027b8e29325d03607d53d0adfc4fffa/0_435_4672_3213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sustainable fashion by Matthew Needham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sustainable fashion by Matthew Needham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Matthew Needham was an intern at a major luxury brand in Paris where he saw firsthand the degree to which waste is built into the fashion industry. \u201cIt takes 10 weeks to order leather from the tannery, so the brands tend to order more colours than they need,\u201d he says. They decide only when they arrive which to use and which to dispose of. \u201cFor me, the waste was thoughtless\u201d.

He scours markets, the streets and sometimes his own studio. After a shopping trolley with no apparent owner sat in the street for two weeks, he turned it into a raincoat. Lace-like plastic found on a beach in Norway became a skirt. Often he blends these finds with high-end unused fabric, such as tweed that might have been Chanel, but instead spent years in a warehouse. \u201cI like the idea of considering the value in creativity.

      "bodyText": "Globally, nearly three-fifths of clothing ends up in an incinerator or landfill site within a year of being made. Shopping for clothes is no longer a harmless pastime; it is yet another painful frontier between desire and conscience. No wonder so-called \u201csustainable fashion\u201d is popping up on retail sites from Boohoo to Bloomingdale\u2019s. But Orsola de Castro, co-founder of Fashion Revolution \u2013 a nonprofit movement campaigning for a more socially and environmentally responsible fashion industry \u2013 dislikes that term. \u201cI just call it good design looking for solutions,\u201d she says. But, whatever you call it, this approach is booming: the fashion search site Lyst recorded a 47% increase in shoppers looking for items through terms including \u201corganic cotton\u201d and \u201cvegan leather\u201d last year, while searches for the sustainable shoe brand Veja were up 113%. From upcyclers to zero wasters, activists to fabric inventors, here are six young labels that offer great design for the thoughtfully stylish \u2013 and might just change the way the wider industry thinks about fashion. Econyl \u2013 the brand turning old fishing nets into swimwear that can be endlessly recycled Swimwear brands that use postconsumer recycled fabric are garnering a lot of attention. Auria London has dressed Daisy Lowe and Rihanna. Davy J has swimsuits for wild and sporting swimmers. Ruby Moon offers \u201cactivewear for activists\u201d. Fisch is stocked at Matches. Mara Hoffman\u2019s pieces sell for hundreds of pounds. But follow the stories of all these labels and you will arrive in the same place: at Econyl, a recycled nylon fibre that its Italian manufacturer claims is \u201cinfinitely recyclable\u201d. \u201cAt the beginning, many people were laughing at me,\u201d says Giulio Bonazzi, CEO of Econyl\u2019s parent company, Aquafil. An average of 64,000 tonnes of fishing nets are left in the ocean each year, and these were the first nylon items that Bonazzi\u2019s company collected for recycling, initially from the fish farming industry in Scotland and Norway, from professional divers who spotted ghost nets, and now from \u201call over the world \u2013 Japan, Australia, south-east Asia, north and South America\u201d. Lejeune says that, when she started the Ethical Fashion Forum in 2006, plastic as an issue was not on her radar. \u201cThat has really changed in the past two years.\u201d There is an obvious and pleasing circularity to the idea of swimmers bathing in recycled ocean waste. No wonder small fashion brands are not the only ones to love Econyl. Gucci adopted the fibre in 2017. Stella McCartney has pledged to stop using virgin nylon by 2020, switching to Econyl (she makes bags with it, too.) The company now has more than 750 fashion clients and \u201cdemand is growing strongly day by day\u201d, Bonazzi says. He has his sights set on the plastic industry at large \u2013 \u201cglasses, furniture, chairs\u201d, he rattles off \u2013 and even nets in which to transport and sell supermarket fruit. Ninety Percent \u2013 the brand giving away its profits \u201cWe are trying a crazy idea and seeing if it connects with people,\u201d says Shafiq Hassan, co-founder of Ninety Percent, which sells well-cut organic cotton T-shirts, tie-dye hoodie dresses, asymmetric skirts and leisurewear. The brand gives away 90% of distributed profits, putting philanthropy centre stage. The people who make its clothes, in Bangladesh and Turkey, get 5%, the people who build the brand get 5%, and the rest is split between four charities, which consumers help to choose. Each piece\u2019s care label carries a code that shoppers type into the website to vote for their preferred beneficiary. As Tamsin Lejeune, founder of the Ethical Fashion Forum and CEO of the new enterprise Common Objective, points out, Ninety Percent is interesting because \u201csome of the best and most innovative examples of change in the fashion industry are coming from the supply sector\u201d. As for Hassan, his family moved from Bangladesh to England in 1971; and he lived his teenage years listening to John Lennon\u2019s Imagine and Pink Floyd\u2019s Breathe (\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to care \u2026\u201d). On a sourcing trip for New Look in the early 90s, he drove past the dump near Kamalapur railway station in Bangladesh. The smell was appalling, but worse still he could see \u201cchildren eking out a living there\u201d, and started to think about a sustainable business model. With his partner Para Hamilton, he set up the charity Children\u2019s Hope (one of Ninety Percent\u2019s beneficiaries). When the pair opened a factory in 2009, they provided a canteen with fresh food cooked daily. Other benefits include health insurance and on-site healthcare (there are now 12,000 employees and the factory has produced clothes for H&amp;M, Debenhams and New Look.) \u201cYounger companies have to lead the way in sustainability,\u201d Hassan says. But while Ninety Percent sounds like a radical idea, it is the result of decades of experience in the Bangladesh garment industry. Some of Hassan\u2019s questions remain. \u201cHow can we be an agent of change? How can we share empathy, compassion, value, purpose and transparency? Power to the people, [that] sort of thing.\u201d Matthew Needham \u2013 transforming shopping trolleys into raincoats Matthew Needham was an intern at a major luxury brand in Paris where he saw firsthand the degree to which waste is built into the fashion industry. \u201cIt takes 10 weeks to order leather from the tannery, so the brands tend to order more colours than they need,\u201d he says. They decide only when they arrive which to use and which to dispose of. \u201cFor me, the waste was thoughtless\u201d. He describes himself as an upcycler, an approach shared by fellow designers Bethany Williams, who has worked with materials including book waste, and Helen Kirkum, with her amazing mash-up trainers made from discarded shoes. Needham, like De Castro, believes that sustainability \u201cshould be inherent in the design process for everyone\u201d. He finds luxury deadstock before it goes to incineration (\u201cLike the Burberry thing\u201d \u2013 where the company destroyed \u00a328m of its own products to guard against counterfeiting). He scours markets, the streets and sometimes his own studio. After a shopping trolley with no apparent owner sat in the street for two weeks, he turned it into a raincoat. Lace-like plastic found on a beach in Norway became a skirt. Often he blends these finds with high-end unused fabric, such as tweed that might have been Chanel, but instead spent years in a warehouse. \u201cI like the idea of considering the value in creativity. Not the value in the materialistic thing itself, but the value in the creativity. That\u2019s luxury. The craft, the skill, the mindset, the thought process that goes into making something,\u201d he says. His work has already appeared in i-D and he is often approached by big-name brands wanting to benefit by association. He usually declines. \u201cFor them, I\u2019m a tick box.\u201d Needham creates pieces to order; a deal with a major retailer is only a matter of time away. Being at the start of his career, he says, is a major advantage. \u201cYou have the benefit of not being tied down by marketing and business plans. You really have to decide for yourself what you think sustainable is. For me, it\u2019s about using what we have, because we have too much.\u201d Kayu \u2013 the brand turning straw into sustainable fashion gold Jamie Lim grew up in Malaysia and Hong Kong. She loved the batik prints her parents wore, the beautiful furniture made of straw. At 17 she moved to the US for university, and each time she went home on vacation she looked for artisanal gifts to take back for friends. As time went by, they became harder to find. Plastic straw began to proliferate. \u201cSo that was the impetus of the brand \u2013 it started as a way to preserve indigenous techniques,\u201d Lim says. Now, Kayu\u2019s beautiful bags \u2013 California-style totes handwoven from natural plant fibres by artisans in Terengganu, Malaysia \u2013 are stocked at high-end stores including Liberty, Bloomingdale\u2019s, Saks Fifth Avenue and Net-a-Porter.

They prove that conscientious fashion can compete with, and lead, the mainstream fashion industry in terms of aesthetics and design. \u201cWhat they are producing is absolutely beautiful, and completely separate from what you might think of as sustainable fashion,\u201d says Emma Slade Edmondson, a creative consultant who specialises in sustainability and ethics in fashion retail. Lim is also in the process of steering Kayu towards zero waste. Excess fibre from the bags is being made into alphabet tags or pouches, with the proceeds donated to charity. The straw waste is biodegradable, of course, as are the bags, over time, although some of the hardware is not. \u201cAt the beginning, people weren\u2019t really on board. Now our customers are asking lots of questions. Is the straw plastic or real? Is it vegan? Have the bags been mass-produced?\u201d And retailers are also asking those questions, Lim says. \u201cNet-a-Porter asks the designers, what are your sustainable initiatives? [And] consumers really demand it.\u201d Mud Jeans \u2013 creating a rental revolution in denim \u201cThe idea was to make jeans \u2013 organic cotton, people getting properly paid,\u201d says Bert van Son, who founded Mud in 2012.

The London social enterprise label, which majors on statement tees and classic shifts, puts photographs of the women (they are all women) who cut, sew, embroider or knit the clothes on its labels.

Captain Rafael Acosta died at a military hospital in Venezuela\u2019s capital, Caracas, on Friday night having been seized on 21 June during a roundup of alleged anti-Maduro plotters. Acosta\u2019s lawyer told reporters that in the hours before his client\u2019s death he had appeared in a military court in a wheelchair, semi-conscious and with what he called visible signs of torture. \u201cThey tortured him so much that they killed him,\u201d his widow, Waleswka P\u00e9rez, told one Miami-based broadcaster, according to Reuters. Writing on Twitter, P\u00e9rez added: \u201cI request international support for an independent United Nations forensic examination to determine the cause of death of the father of my children. I demand justice.\u201d UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet on Monday said she was \u201cshocked\u201d Acosta\u2019s death and called for an independent and transparent investigation, including an autopsy meeting international standards. \u201cThis is essential to shed light not only on what happened to him, but in order to facilitate bringing to justice those responsible for his death,\u201d Bachelet said. Maduro\u2019s former spy chief \u2013 who recently fled the country after defecting \u2013 claimed the killing was the work of his former boss\u2019s \u201cbutchers\u201d. \u201cVenezuelan brothers and sisters, this dictatorship is a danger to absolutely all of us \u2013 no one is safe,\u201d Gen Manuel Ricardo Cristopher Figuera wrote in an open letter published on Sunday. Venezuela\u2019s chief prosecutor, Tarek Saab, said on Monday that two national guard officers working for the military intelligence agency DGCIM had been charged with homicide over Acosta\u2019s death, but he offered no explanation as to how he had died. The death \u2013 which Venezuelan authorities have confirmed and vowed to investigate \u2013 sparked outrage among Maduro\u2019s political foes and members of the international coalition that has been battling since January to replace him with the opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3. \u201cIt is up to us to unite to bring an end to this dictatorship that tortures and kills,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 tweeted on Sunday night, denouncing what he branded Acosta\u2019s \u201cabhorrent\u201d murder. The US state department blamed the captain\u2019s \u201csenseless killing\u201d on \u201cMaduro\u2019s thugs and their Cuban advisers\u201d, adding: \u201cThis latest act of Maduro\u2019s barbarism must stir us to action.\u201d Even Mexico\u2019s government \u2013 which under the leftist leadership of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has refused to join efforts to unseat an increasingly isolated Maduro \u2013 voiced concern that Acosta had died with \u201capparent signs of torture\u201d. Venezuela\u2019s information minister, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, said Maduro had ordered \u201ca full and exhaustive investigation to clear up this regrettable event\u201d. The outcry came as representatives of Maduro and Guaid\u00f3 were reportedly preparing to sit down for a fresh round of talks this week designed to quench Venezuela\u2019s smouldering political crisis. Those discussions \u2013 expected to be held on the Caribbean island of Barbados \u2013 were set to follow an earlier three-day negotiation held in Norway\u2019s capital, Oslo, in late May after Guaid\u00f3\u2019s failed 30 April attempt to spark a military uprising against Maduro. But on Monday the Associated Press reported that the opposition had put the talks on hold as a result of Acosta\u2019s death. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s representatives did not immediately respond to requests for confirmation of the suspension. Maduro\u2019s envoys were reported to have dismissed the opposition\u2019s key demands \u2013 for Maduro\u2019s resignation and free and fair presidential elections \u2013 during the first round of exploratory talks in Oslo. But some western diplomats believe Maduro\u2019s political standing was so weakened by the alleged involvement of top officials in the botched attempt to topple him that he may be forced to make concessions.",

Cooper ignored the ban, and was one of the campaign leaders at the head of the illegal march in Derry on 30 January 1972, when members of the 1st Battalion Parachute Regiment opened fire on the crowd, shooting 14 people dead and wounding many others. The catastrophic consequences outraged the Catholic community, increased support for the IRA and destroyed the prospect of any imminent political initiative.</p> <p>There was a surge of murder and violence in all parts of Northern Ireland in subsequent years. In the 2002 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jan/25/culture.peterbradshaw2\" title=\"\">Bloody Sunday</a>, Cooper (played by James Nesbitt) was portrayed as saying: \u201cI want to say this to the British government ... You know what you\u2019ve just done, don\u2019t you? You\u2019ve destroyed the civil rights movement, and you\u2019ve given the IRA the biggest victory it will ever have. All over this city tonight, young men, boys, will be joining the IRA and you will reap a whirlwind.\u201d</p> <p>Bloody Sunday was also a personal watershed for Cooper. Born into a Unionist (and Protestant) family, he had abandoned his youthful allegiance to Unionism to become a leader of the cross-community Northern Ireland civil rights campaign and then a founding member of the nationalist (Catholic) Social Democratic and Labour party (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sdlp\" title=\"\">SDLP</a>) in 1970. As a result, for the rest of his life he was called a \u201ctraitor\u201d by his adversaries, and while he continued to be loyal to the Anglican Church of Ireland, some worshippers refused to share a pew with him.</p> <p>Ivan was born in the village of Claudy, Co Derry, and was brought up for a while in nearby Killaloo, where his parents, Jeannie (nee Moorehead) and Albert Cooper, ran the local post office, until the family moved to Derry in 1956. After school he worked in Derry as a factory line manager in the shirt-making business, the city\u2019s staple industry. Moved by the poverty he saw among the workers, and by the anti-Catholic discrimination manifested by Derry\u2019s Unionist-dominated council, his first move into politics came in 1965, when he briefly joined the Claudy Young Unionist Association.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards he resigned, switching to membership of the Northern Ireland Labour party, which was trying to persuade working-class voters to join together on a non-sectarian basis. Cooper stood for election to the Stormont parliament in 1965, winning some cross-community support but failing to gain a seat.</p> <p>Around that time there were widespread demands for the Unionist government to introduce reforms to benefit the entire working class on a non-sectarian basis. Cooper, by then resident in Derry, was at the centre of the campaign and in 1968 left the Labour party to become founder of the Derry Citizens\u2019 Action Committee. His rallying call was for Catholics and Protestants to fight for their rights as \u201cthe blacks in America were fighting\u201d.</p> <p>Later that year the committee announced it would organise a parade in Derry to demonstrate the great support there was for reform. The Unionist minister for home affairs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/apr/26/william-craig-obituary\" title=\"\">William Craig</a>, slapped a ban on the parade and drafted in hundreds of police with batons and a water cannon.

His fellow civil rights activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/aug/16/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Paddy Devlin</a> admired the way his outdoor oratory could reach to even the largest crowds, but on more than one occasion he was knocked out cold by bricks and stones.</p> <p>He was first elected, as an independent representative, to the Stormont parliament in 1969, the first of many electoral victories.

In 1983, with great disappointment, he withdrew from active politics and became an insolvency practitioner. After a stroke, his health progressively deteriorated and he became a wheelchair user.

In an astonishing turn of events that knocks Diego Maradona\u2019s famous handball at Mexico 1986 into a c0cked hat, the players of a proud and noble England football team once again find themselves the victims of duplicitous malfeasance cooked up by Johnny Foreigner. Demonstrating the kind of chutzpah that would have made Richard Nixon blush, the embodiment of sporting arrogance that is the USA! USA!! USA!!! women\u2019s team stand accused of sending officials to the Lyon hotel where England\u2019s brave Lionesses are currently staying to have what can only be described as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/30/fa-furious-us-officials-caught-england-women-world-cup-hotel\">a good snoop around</a>.</p> <p>Like the disgraced Nixon before her, USA! USA!! USA!!! head coach Jill Ellis has strenuously denied any subterfuge on her camp\u2019s part, offering the pitifully transparent, albeit entirely reasonable explanation that two of her squad\u2019s operations staff were simply scouting Lyon\u2019s Fourvi\u00e8re Hotel in the ludicrously unlikely event they beat England in Tuesday night\u2019s semi-final and will need somewhere to stay before Sunday\u2019s final. Under the flimsy pretext of checking out the hotel\u2019s spa (complete with aromatherapy rain showers, steam bath and ice fountain), heated outdoor pool, sun terrace and hot tub, the two suspected agents of American espionage are also rumoured to have wandered into private meeting rooms reserved by England \u2013 who were out training \u2013 as they were shown around by hotel staff.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/30/fa-furious-us-officials-caught-england-women-world-cup-hotel\">FA furious after US officials are caught in England\u2019s World Cup hotel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou have to plan ahead,\u201d said Ellis, when confronted by accusations of outright skulduggery. \u201cThe only ones who went there were the team administrator and her boss. We don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d Asked to explain why she and her players have got far enough ahead of themselves to even entertain the notion they might beat England, the brass-necked yank was having none of it. \u201cArrogance has nothing to do with us,\u201d she bragged brazenly. \u201cThat\u2019s planning and preparation for staff.

      "bodyText": "GUARANTEED ELLEN WHITE-STYLE CELEBRATIONS AHOY Move over Watergate, there\u2019s a new hotel-based spying scandal in town. In an astonishing turn of events that knocks Diego Maradona\u2019s famous handball at Mexico 1986 into a c0cked hat, the players of a proud and noble England football team once again find themselves the victims of duplicitous malfeasance cooked up by Johnny Foreigner. Demonstrating the kind of chutzpah that would have made Richard Nixon blush, the embodiment of sporting arrogance that is the USA! USA!! USA!!! women\u2019s team stand accused of sending officials to the Lyon hotel where England\u2019s brave Lionesses are currently staying to have what can only be described as a good snoop around. Like the disgraced Nixon before her, USA! USA!! USA!!! head coach Jill Ellis has strenuously denied any subterfuge on her camp\u2019s part, offering the pitifully transparent, albeit entirely reasonable explanation that two of her squad\u2019s operations staff were simply scouting Lyon\u2019s Fourvi\u00e8re Hotel in the ludicrously unlikely event they beat England in Tuesday night\u2019s semi-final and will need somewhere to stay before Sunday\u2019s final. Under the flimsy pretext of checking out the hotel\u2019s spa (complete with aromatherapy rain showers, steam bath and ice fountain), heated outdoor pool, sun terrace and hot tub, the two suspected agents of American espionage are also rumoured to have wandered into private meeting rooms reserved by England \u2013 who were out training \u2013 as they were shown around by hotel staff. \u201cYou have to plan ahead,\u201d said Ellis, when confronted by accusations of outright skulduggery. \u201cThe only ones who went there were the team administrator and her boss. We don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d Asked to explain why she and her players have got far enough ahead of themselves to even entertain the notion they might beat England, the brass-necked yank was having none of it. \u201cArrogance has nothing to do with us,\u201d she bragged brazenly. \u201cThat\u2019s planning and preparation for staff. I had no idea how we were even going to get to Lyon.\u201d With his knuckles still sore from tightly clutching his pearls while sanctimoniously sermonising on the many moral shortcomings of Cameroon\u2019s footballers, there were concerns that news of another opponent\u2019s duplicity might prompt another fit of the vapours from Phil Neville but he took it in his stride.

BITS AND BOBS Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County have excused Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County\u2019s Frank Lampard from reporting back to take training so that he can get a move on and become Chelsea\u2019s Frank Lampard. Marcus Rashford, who scored a whopping 13 goals in all competitions for Manchester United last season, has been rewarded with a new four-year deal worth around \u00a3250,000 a week. \u201cI want to thank Ole and his staff for everything they have done for me,\u201d he trousered.

Companies will often sub-contract the operation of their warehouses to lesser-known outside companies. Oliver then used the example of Verizon, which hired a logistics company to look after many of its warehouses, including one in Memphis where a woman died of a cardiac arrest.</p> <p>Amazon\u2019s dominance has led to \u201cincreased competitive pressure across the industry\u201d but Oliver believes they treat their delivery times with far too much grandiosity.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not delivering diphtheria medication to a remote Alaskan village here. You\u2019re delivering novelty horse-head masks to people who frankly forgot they ordered them until they showed up,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He believes that Amazon isn\u2019t actually the worst offender but that \u201cbeing not the worst is a low, low bar\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBasically, Amazon is the industry trendsetter,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re the Michael Jackson of shipping: they\u2019re the best at what they do, everyone tries to imitate them, and nobody who learns a third thing about them are happy that they did.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver then detailed the \u201cphysically draining\u201d conditions of their fulfilment centres and used a clip of a worker in his early 20s who was having to walk over 15 miles per shift. \u201cNo one should be in their prime in the morning and then dead at the end of the day unless they are a mayfly, and mayflies are not spending their one day on Earth at an Amazon warehouse,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The warehouses operate \u201cat a relentless pace\u201d and it\u2019s led to seven lawsuits filed by pregnant workers who claim that they were refused longer bathroom breaks and fewer continuous hours on their feet. \u201cWhen people shorten their time in the bathroom, they don\u2019t shorten the bathroom part, they shorten the hand-washing part so the next time you order something online, it\u2019s safe to assume that it\u2019s been packed by urine-soaked hands,\u201d he joked.</p> <p>Amazon has also \u201cactively fought\u201d against labour unions getting involved with worker disputes, something Oliver finds concerning.</p> <p>\u201cThe more you look at Amazon, the more you realise its convenience comes with a real cost, because, think about it, we used to have to drive to stores to buy things,\u201d he said. \u201cNow those things are brought directly to us and they\u2019re somehow cheaper. That didn\u2019t just happen with a clever algorithm, it happened by creating a system that squeezes the people lowest on the ladder hard and all the while, the man behind Amazon is now worth $118bn, more than anyone else in the world.\u201d</p> <p>He called his worth a \u201ca computer error in capitalism\u201d before speaking about Bezos\u2019s wish to master space travel with a very phallic-looking rocket.</p> <p>\u201cIf Bezos has enough money to fund his space dicks in perpetuity, it isn\u2019t a question of whether he can improve working conditions for his employees, it\u2019s just a question of if he wants to and if he doesn\u2019t want to, at the very least, Amazon should present a more realistic picture of what their promises cost the workers who make it all happen,\u201d he said.</p>",

He then spoke about the way that our idea of shopping has changed, and what this has meant for retail employees who no longer have brick-and-mortar stores to work at. \u201cIt\u2019s as if warehouses are absorbing America\u2019s lost retail employees, which initially sounds kind of nice doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like hearing that there\u2019s actually a farm upstate where Borders, Circuit City and Tower Records employees can run around and be free.\u201d But there\u2019s a darker side, with the illness and injury rate for employees in the warehousing industry higher than that for mining, construction and logging. Companies will often sub-contract the operation of their warehouses to lesser-known outside companies. Oliver then used the example of Verizon, which hired a logistics company to look after many of its warehouses, including one in Memphis where a woman died of a cardiac arrest. Amazon\u2019s dominance has led to \u201cincreased competitive pressure across the industry\u201d but Oliver believes they treat their delivery times with far too much grandiosity. \u201cYou\u2019re not delivering diphtheria medication to a remote Alaskan village here. You\u2019re delivering novelty horse-head masks to people who frankly forgot they ordered them until they showed up,\u201d he said. He believes that Amazon isn\u2019t actually the worst offender but that \u201cbeing not the worst is a low, low bar\u201d. \u201cBasically, Amazon is the industry trendsetter,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re the Michael Jackson of shipping: they\u2019re the best at what they do, everyone tries to imitate them, and nobody who learns a third thing about them are happy that they did.\u201d Oliver then detailed the \u201cphysically draining\u201d conditions of their fulfilment centres and used a clip of a worker in his early 20s who was having to walk over 15 miles per shift. \u201cNo one should be in their prime in the morning and then dead at the end of the day unless they are a mayfly, and mayflies are not spending their one day on Earth at an Amazon warehouse,\u201d he said. The warehouses operate \u201cat a relentless pace\u201d and it\u2019s led to seven lawsuits filed by pregnant workers who claim that they were refused longer bathroom breaks and fewer continuous hours on their feet. \u201cWhen people shorten their time in the bathroom, they don\u2019t shorten the bathroom part, they shorten the hand-washing part so the next time you order something online, it\u2019s safe to assume that it\u2019s been packed by urine-soaked hands,\u201d he joked. Amazon has also \u201cactively fought\u201d against labour unions getting involved with worker disputes, something Oliver finds concerning. \u201cThe more you look at Amazon, the more you realise its convenience comes with a real cost, because, think about it, we used to have to drive to stores to buy things,\u201d he said. \u201cNow those things are brought directly to us and they\u2019re somehow cheaper. That didn\u2019t just happen with a clever algorithm, it happened by creating a system that squeezes the people lowest on the ladder hard and all the while, the man behind Amazon is now worth $118bn, more than anyone else in the world.\u201d He called his worth a \u201ca computer error in capitalism\u201d before speaking about Bezos\u2019s wish to master space travel with a very phallic-looking rocket. \u201cIf Bezos has enough money to fund his space dicks in perpetuity, it isn\u2019t a question of whether he can improve working conditions for his employees, it\u2019s just a question of if he wants to and if he doesn\u2019t want to, at the very least, Amazon should present a more realistic picture of what their promises cost the workers who make it all happen,\u201d he said.",

Cardinal John Newman will be canonised in a ceremony in St Peter\u2019s Square in Vatican City on 13 October, almost 130 years after he died. He will be the first English person born since the 17th century to be declared a saint by the Catholic church. Newman was ordained as a priest in the Church of England but converted to Catholicism in 1845. He is regarded as one of the most influential figures from his era for both Anglicanism and Roman Catholicism, revered for his hymns and poetry and for his devotion to the people of Birmingham. He was a powerful preacher and founded the Birmingham Oratory religious community. When he died in 1890, more than 15,000 people lined the city\u2019s streets for his funeral procession.

A second miracle attributed to Newman \u2013 the healing in 2013 of a woman with life-threatening complications in her pregnancy - was approved by Pope Francis this year, paving the way to his canonisation. In 2008 a decision to move Newman\u2019s remains to a new tomb in Birmingham Oratory in preparation for his canonisation was criticised by the gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell and others.

It was a solid win.</p> <p>Djokovic\u2019s quest for a fifth singles title at the club he always wanted to be a member of looks in good shape. Already stripped from his side of the draw are the two most obvious threats to his passage into the final weekend: the sixth seed, Alexander Zverev, who lost to the Czech qualifier Jiri Vesely in four sets, and the erratic young German\u2019s rival Stefanos Tsitsipas, the No 7 who went down in five sets to the Italian Thomas Fabbiano.</p> <p>While those are welcome absentees in Djokovic\u2019s fortnight, he could have done without the departure of Jamie Murray, Robin Haase and Dani Vallverd\u00fa from the 10-man player council after an acrimonious meeting that lasted seven hours on the eve of the tournament. While none of them is an unquestioning Djokovic supporter, and more likely sympathetic to the ATP chief executive, Chris Kermode \u2013 who is due to leave his post at the end of a year after a revolt set in train by Djokovic and his American friend, Justin Gimelstob \u2013 the upheaval is an unwelcome distraction.</p> <p>Gimelstob, who had to step down from the player council with the cloud of an assault conviction hanging over him, met Djokovic in London last week, the player confirmed. \u201cI have a friendly relationship with Justin. He did advise me when he was in London. We saw each other [briefly]. We keep in touch [on] the phone.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if he could envisage Gimelstob coming back as an American representative on the council, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure, to be honest. We haven\u2019t really been talking about his potential candidacy for any role. He has a lot on his plate right now. He\u2019s dealing with a lot of things back home, family and everything. It\u2019s not easy for him.\u201d</p> <p>All of this Djokovic is carrying around in his head while trying to win. It cannot be easy, although he was measured in his response to further questions after his win on day one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/01/heather-watson-celebrates-first-top-tier-win-in-nearly-a-year-at-wimbledon-tennis\">Heather Watson celebrates first top-tier win in nearly a year at Wimbledon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad that at least the majority of the players stayed in the council after the meeting,\u201d he said, smiling weakly. \u201cI did say I understand the players that have resigned. It was a very turbulent meeting, if I may call it that way.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe all try to contribute as much as we can for positive change in our sport. Weller Evans [a Gimelstob supporter] has been appointed as an interim player representative role for six months. Then the process will be reopened towards the end of the year. Whoever has an intention to run for the America\u2019s board representative can do so in November.\u201d</p> <p>A lot can happen between now and November, it is true \u2013 including a comeback by Kermode, which sources say is not out of the question.</p> <p>As for the tennis, Djokovic is still nailed on as favourite to win this tournament. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal will begin their charge from the other side of the draw on Tuesday, the Swiss on Centre Court against the South African Lloyd Harris, the Spaniard Federer leapfrogged into the No 2 seeding on No 1 Court against the Japanese Yuichi Sugita.</p> <p>Finding a balance in tennis, on or off the court, is proving seriously hard this summer.</p>",

Already stripped from his side of the draw are the two most obvious threats to his passage into the final weekend: the sixth seed, Alexander Zverev, who lost to the Czech qualifier Jiri Vesely in four sets, and the erratic young German\u2019s rival Stefanos Tsitsipas, the No 7 who went down in five sets to the Italian Thomas Fabbiano. While those are welcome absentees in Djokovic\u2019s fortnight, he could have done without the departure of Jamie Murray, Robin Haase and Dani Vallverd\u00fa from the 10-man player council after an acrimonious meeting that lasted seven hours on the eve of the tournament. While none of them is an unquestioning Djokovic supporter, and more likely sympathetic to the ATP chief executive, Chris Kermode \u2013 who is due to leave his post at the end of a year after a revolt set in train by Djokovic and his American friend, Justin Gimelstob \u2013 the upheaval is an unwelcome distraction. Gimelstob, who had to step down from the player council with the cloud of an assault conviction hanging over him, met Djokovic in London last week, the player confirmed. \u201cI have a friendly relationship with Justin. He did advise me when he was in London. We saw each other [briefly]. We keep in touch [on] the phone.\u201d Asked if he could envisage Gimelstob coming back as an American representative on the council, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure, to be honest. We haven\u2019t really been talking about his potential candidacy for any role. He has a lot on his plate right now. He\u2019s dealing with a lot of things back home, family and everything. It\u2019s not easy for him.\u201d All of this Djokovic is carrying around in his head while trying to win. It cannot be easy, although he was measured in his response to further questions after his win on day one. \u201cI\u2019m glad that at least the majority of the players stayed in the council after the meeting,\u201d he said, smiling weakly. \u201cI did say I understand the players that have resigned. It was a very turbulent meeting, if I may call it that way.\u201d He added: \u201cWe all try to contribute as much as we can for positive change in our sport. Weller Evans [a Gimelstob supporter] has been appointed as an interim player representative role for six months. Then the process will be reopened towards the end of the year. Whoever has an intention to run for the America\u2019s board representative can do so in November.\u201d A lot can happen between now and November, it is true \u2013 including a comeback by Kermode, which sources say is not out of the question. As for the tennis, Djokovic is still nailed on as favourite to win this tournament. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal will begin their charge from the other side of the draw on Tuesday, the Swiss on Centre Court against the South African Lloyd Harris, the Spaniard Federer leapfrogged into the No 2 seeding on No 1 Court against the Japanese Yuichi Sugita. Finding a balance in tennis, on or off the court, is proving seriously hard this summer.",

The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2019:&nbsp;</b>Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>While the recent protests were initially sparked by Lam\u2019s attempts to pass the proposed extradition legislation, the demonstrations have morphed into a wider movement against her administration and Beijing.</p>",

For hours the protesters had been repeatedly striking reinforced glass walls with a metal trolley and poles as hundreds of others watched on. Once inside they threw chairsand tore down and defaced portraits of past lawmakers. Police who earlier in the day had been standing guard armed with pepper spray and guns marked \u201cless lethal\u201d were nowhere to be seen. The direct action unfolded after a peaceful march of half a million people made its way through other parts of the city on the anniversary of Hong Kong\u2019s handover to China. For the past month protesters have been demanding the withdrawal of a bill that would allow extraditions to the Chinese mainland. Before the protesters broke in to the legislative building, at one point about half a dozen pro-democracy and independent lawmakers came between the demonstrators and police and called for calm. They pushed against the trolley, acting as human shields between it and the building. They were roughly handled by dozens of young protesters, some of whom punched and pulled their arms. They were shouted down and the protesters continued pounding the glass. \u201cThey simply wouldn\u2019t listen to me,\u201d said Lam Cheuk-ting, one of the lawmakers. \u201cThe movement at large is peaceful, but some young people are overwhelmed by a strong sense of helplessness and they\u2019re emotionally charged.\u201d The police had called on the march organisers to consider rescheduling or shortening it, but it left just before 3pm when tens of thousands began snaking their way through the city.

Chubb has ruled out selling new insurance policies to companies which build or operate coal power plants, or those which generate more than 30% of their revenue from coal mining or supplying coal-fired electricity. It will also stop investing in these companies because of their contribution to the global climate crisis. Chubb said its existing investments and insurance policies with coal-powered companies and miners would be phased out by 2022. It will begin cutting ties with major coal-using utilities, such as the German energy giant RWE, from the same year. Evan Greenberg, the chairman and chief executive of Chubb, said: \u201cChubb recognises the reality of climate change and the substantial impact of human activity on our planet.\u201d This is expected to deal a blow to global coal kingpins such as Anglo-American, Glencore and RWE. Chubb\u2019s anti-coal pledge is the latest in a rising number of divestments among major financial players as the risks of the climate crisis become clearer. The climate breakdown poses a financial threat to insurers because severe weather, hurricanes and wildfires are all likely to increase in frequency and intensity as global temperatures climb. The Unfriend Coal campaign said in a report last year that global losses had reached $337bn (\u00a3266bn) in 2017, including insured losses of $144bn. Already at least a third of the global reinsurance market has restricted its cover for coal, with the reinsurance firms Swiss Re and Munich Re limiting their underwriting last year. In Europe, Germany\u2019s Allianz and Italy\u2019s Generali limited underwriting for coal companies last year, while the French firm Axa tightened its policy further.

The policy we are implementing today reflects Chubb\u2019s commitment to do our part as a steward of the Earth,\u201d Greenberg said. Chubb\u2019s decision to turn its back on coal follows a string of similar measures from the European insurance giant Zurich Insurance last week. The insurer will become the first major insurance company to sign up to the UN\u2019s global business ambition pledge that is aligned with the goal of capping global heating at 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. As part of the pledge it has also ruled out underwriting or investing in companies that generate more than 30% of their revenues from oil sands or oil shale. Last month Norway gave the go-ahead for its $1tn sovereign wealth fund, the largest in the world, to carry out the largest fossil fuel divestment to date by dropping more than $13bn of investments. The new law means the fund is free to dump investments in eight coal companies and an estimated 150 oil producers. This will include dropping coal investments worth an estimated $6bn.",

      "bodyText": "Six Turkish sailors detained in Libya by Khalifa Haftar\u2019s forces have been released, Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry has said, a day after Turkey warned his Libyan National Army (LNA) militia would become a \u201clegitimate target\u201d unless the men were released immediately. The six men appear to have been captured by the LNA as a reprisal for Haftar losing control of a key town that has set back his efforts to capture Libya\u2019s capital, Tripoli, from the UN-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA). Turkey backs the GNA and has been accused by Haftar of supplying weaponry to the GNA in breach of a UN arms embargo, as well as operating drone strikes on his forces from the GNA military command headquarters. Haftar has also ordered that in his strongholds in the east of the country all Turkish nationals should be arrested and all restaurants and shops with Turkish names or products be closed. The six men were arrested as part of Haftar\u2019s anti-Turkish drive, and it is not clear if their release signalled that Haftar recognised he had overstepped the mark. The Turkish foreign ministry spokesman said the six men wanted to continue working rather than return to Turkey. The state-owned news agency Anadolu said they were sailors but Turkey\u2019s defence ministry had denied reports that the detainees included military personnel. The forces loyal to Haftar also said they destroyed a Turkish drone parked at Tripoli\u2019s only working airport on Sunday and declared a \u201cgeneral mobilisation\u201d as tensions between Ankara and the eastern administration mounted. In a surprise attack last week that caught Haftar\u2019s forces off guard, the GNA captured the town of Gharyan, breaking the military stalemate that has prevailed since Haftar moved to capture Tripoli on 4 April. Haftar expected to enter the city within days but has found himself bogged down in fighting that has begun to lose him much-needed diplomatic support. On Friday, Haftar\u2019s spokesman Ahmed al-Mismari announced a ban on commercial flights from Libya to Turkey and ordered his forces to attack Turkish ships and interests in Libya. Haftar\u2019s air force commander, Mohamed Manfour, stepped up warnings on Sunday by telling Tripoli residents to stay away from any site that may be hit by airstrikes. Manfour said: \u201cAfter exhausting all the traditional means in the battle for liberating the rest of Libya and after the recent deception and treachery, the LNA\u2019s air force started to carry out strong and decisive airstrikes on select locations. \u201cWe call upon all our people in Tripoli to immediately move away from the military sites, the positions of militias and terrorists, for their safety that is our priority as well as our beloved united and free Libya.\u201d Intensified strikes on Sunday night hit the outskirts of Tripoli, including in the area surrounding the city\u2019s non-functioning international airport, Yarmouk camp and Ain Zara district. Haftar himself has been supplied with weapons by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. The extent of Haftar\u2019s dependence on the UAE for weaponry was underlined when UAE-marked weapons left by fleeing LNA fighters were displayed in Gharyan at the weekend.",

With the leaders now forced to meet again in Brussels on Tuesday after being unable to agree on a candidate for the top post, the German chancellor said fears about the bloc splintering left her wary of trying to outvote critics of her compromise plan. The so-called Visegr\u00e1d countries \u2013 Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary \u2013 had used the marathon 20-hour summit to rail against Merkel\u2019s plan to replace Jean-Claude Juncker with his current deputy in the commission, who has been stern critic of governments in eastern Europe who have threatened their country\u2019s judicial independence. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, who leads a coalition government of the far-right League party and the M5S, lent his support in efforts overnight to scupper Timmermans\u2019 candidature, which had been agreed between Merkel and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, at the G20 summit in Osaka before the meeting of the EU\u2019s 28 leaders.

I was pleased to read something experimental but I didn\u2019t feel like my understanding or knowledge of Oman grew as a result of reading it.

A few words painting wonderful pictures of Japan in the 17th century. Calming and serene with beautiful haiku. Even the difficulties and sadness are something Bash\u014d accepts: Through nine hellish days of heat and rain, all my old maladies tormenting me again, feverish and weak, I could not write. Altair meets Vega tomorrow - Tanabata - already the night is changed What an antidote to the world of today. That does indeed sound like a tonic.

In her memoir, Brave, published last year, he is known only as \u201cthe Monster\u201d, his face likened to a melted pineapple. Interviewed by the Irish Times a few months ago, she refused to discuss him at all. Now, perched by the fountains on the Barbican estate in London on a warm spring afternoon, she refers to him at first as \u201cthe bad guy in my life\u201d. When she goes on to mention him by name, it is with a casualness that makes me wonder if I\u2019ve misheard her. \u201cSome days it\u2019s a bullet and other times I can handle it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt depends how much of an onslaught I\u2019ve gotten so far that day.

I was kind of grossed out by how much they enjoyed being lauded.\u201d All this is said plainly and softly; throughout our conversation, McGowan rarely even resorts to hand gestures for emphasis. The impression is of someone composed and contained, a woman who has already done her raging in private, or on the page, or occasionally in public confrontations. A heckler at a bookshop event last year, for instance, demanded to know what McGowan had ever done for trans women in prison; her furious response \u2013 \u201cWhat have you ever done for women?\u201d \u2013 was interpreted in the ensuing controversy as a slight on trans people. \u201cWhenever I say \u2018women\u2019, I\u2019m including trans women,\u201d she tells me now. \u201cI don\u2019t separate the two.

Be aware that it might come across as slightly vague, a bit fluffy, damning evidence of a lack of substance. You would probably be written off as a spoofer attempting to blag your way through life. A bluffer. A charlatan. A fraud. Unless, of course, you happen to be applying for a job as the manager of a football club grasping for a way to connect with discontented fans. Then it makes perfect sense to place a heavy focus on getting it, even if the meaning of \u201cit\u201d is not immediately possible to define, and take your cue from Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, who built his initial success at Manchester United largely on making heavy reference to an important goal in Barcelona 20 years ago. \u201cCan Manchester United score? They always score!\u201d Solskj\u00e6r might as well have said at his unveiling in December, sitting there dressed as Fred the Red, and in the first few post-Jos\u00e9 months the tactic did feel refreshing and innovative. When Solskj\u00e6r spoke about playing attacking football, it meant just one thing: he got it. When he mentioned Sir Alex Ferguson, he got it. When he said his players had to work hard, as though it was a quality unique to Manchester United Football Club, he got it. He just got it. He really did. Yet the ploy oozed desperation after the buzz faded.

That\u2019s why the Women\u2019s Equality party has written an open letter calling on parliament to amend the Recall Act 2015, to give the public the power to recall their representatives in cases where they have been found guilty of violence or harassment by the independent parliamentary commissioner for standards.</p> \n<p>We live in a country where violence against women and girls is endemic yet rarely prosecuted.

      "bodyText": "I have never grabbed someone by the neck. Nor have I ever groped anyone, or looked at porn at work. I\u2019ve never sent a colleague an inappropriate text message or asked someone I manage to buy sex toys for my partner. I have never been accused of rape. You would think that I wouldn\u2019t need to clarify those things but, as a politician, I increasingly feel the need to. After all, there are more than a dozen men sitting in our House of Commons who have been accused of doing at least one of the above. When Mark Field was caught on camera last week shoving a peaceful Greenpeace activist, Janet Barker, seizing her by the neck and roughly escorting her from a black-tie dinner there was public outcry. As a result he has been temporarily suspended from his ministerial position and police are investigating third-party reports of assault against him. I believe he should face recall by his constituents. But under current legislation that is impossible. Nor is it possible to recall Damian Green, who admitted to lying about the thousands of pornographic images on his Commons computer and was accused of sexual harassment by a Tory party activist. Or Jared O\u2019Mara, who made misogynistic and homophobic comments online in his 20s, including inviting the members of Girls Aloud to an orgy. Or any of the 20 other MPs, MSPs and assorted politicians who were accused of misconduct ranging from unwanted sexual advances to rape during the 2017 \u201cPestminster\u201d scandal. Those men continue to sit in our democratic institutions, voting on legislation that affects women\u2019s lives. They work in Westminster, where one in five employees have reportedly experienced harassment. And while a few have been suspended from their parties, the public has no power to recall them from their position as elected representatives. Under the Recall of MPs Act 2015 constituents can recall their MP if they receive a custodial sentence, if they are banned from the House of Commons for 10 sitting days (which only happens if they\u2019ve previously been banned for a shorter period) or if they are convicted of providing a misleading expenses claim. That means that so far this year, the public has been able to recall one MP for lying to avoid a speeding ticket and another for fiddling his expenses claim for two landscape photographs. But even if an MP admits to aggressive or violent behaviour, without a custodial sentence they are untouchable until the next election. That\u2019s why the Women\u2019s Equality party has written an open letter calling on parliament to amend the Recall Act 2015, to give the public the power to recall their representatives in cases where they have been found guilty of violence or harassment by the independent parliamentary commissioner for standards. We live in a country where violence against women and girls is endemic yet rarely prosecuted. An astonishing 98.3% of rapes reported to the police in England and Wales do not lead to a conviction. Nor does assault always result in a prison sentence, with many perpetrators getting off with a fine. These problems urgently need to be addressed, but we should not have to wait for an improvement in conviction rates to ensure that MPs are held accountable for their actions. Violent people do not belong in government. Let\u2019s make that clear. \u2022 Mandu Reid is leader of the Women\u2019s Equality party",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>His remarks provoked criticism but will be seen in a fresh light after the latest manufacturing activity figures.</p> \n<p>The PMI is based on a monthly survey of supply chain managers across 19 industries and is a measure of the prevailing economic trends which analyses whether purchasing managers are expanding, staying the same or contracting.</p> \n<p>The output component showed a drop to 47.2 from 50.3 in the index from May \u2013 pointing to the biggest contraction since October 2012.</p> \n<p>Make UK said businesses were reporting loss or decline in export contracts, with confidence in UK suppliers dropping because of Brexit.</p> \n<p>The British Chambers of Commerce reported the weakest picture for domestic manufacturing orders in seven years, while the Confederation of British Industry said on Sunday that private-sector activity fell by the most since 2012 in the April-June period.</p> \n<p>Official data last week showed the UK\u2019s economy grew 0.5% in the first quarter of 2019, but that growth was boosted by factories stockpiling supplies ahead of expected disruptions when it was expected to leave the European Union on 29 March.</p> \n<p>The stockpiling boost has now gone into reverse, and many economists \u2013 including Bank of England forecasters \u2013 think overall growth slowed to a halt in the second quarter, exacerbated by widespread Brexit-related stoppages in the car industry in April.</p>",

The trade body Make UK spoke out after manufacturers suffered the sharpest fall in activity in six and a half years, adding to signs of economic weakness. Seamus Nevin, the chief economist at the organisation, said: \u201cGiven this outlook, increasing competition to see who can race to the bottom and act tough on \u2018no deal\u2019 is the height of irresponsibility with zero understanding of the consequences.\u201d Make UK represents companies ranging from Jaguar Land Rover, Nissan, BMW, Toyota, Airbus and BAE Systems to Lush Cosmetics, Warburtons and Ikea. The latest purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) data showed that the decline in manufacturing activity in May was not a one-off related to the aftermath of Brexit stockpiling in March and the stoppages of some car manufacturing in April. Nevin said: \u201cBusinesses are cutting back on both day-to-day and capital spending with the contraction in output a reflection of growing Brexit uncertainty and, worsening global trade winds. \u201cLooking ahead the picture shows little sign of improvement with signs of weakness now spreading across the eurozone.\u201d His comments came as the Tory leadership hopeful Jeremy Hunt set 30 September as the deadline to decide whether the UK would get a deal or no deal. At the weekend, Hunt upped the ante on no deal in an effort to make up ground on the favourite, Boris Johnson, who has pledged Brexit come what may, \u201cdo or die\u201d. Hunt, asked by the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr whether he would be willing to look the owners of family businesses \u201cin the eye\u201d when saying they should be prepared to see their companies go bust, said: \u201cI would do so but I\u2019d do it with a heavy heart precisely because of the risks.\u201d His remarks provoked criticism but will be seen in a fresh light after the latest manufacturing activity figures. The PMI is based on a monthly survey of supply chain managers across 19 industries and is a measure of the prevailing economic trends which analyses whether purchasing managers are expanding, staying the same or contracting. The output component showed a drop to 47.2 from 50.3 in the index from May \u2013 pointing to the biggest contraction since October 2012. Make UK said businesses were reporting loss or decline in export contracts, with confidence in UK suppliers dropping because of Brexit. The British Chambers of Commerce reported the weakest picture for domestic manufacturing orders in seven years, while the Confederation of British Industry said on Sunday that private-sector activity fell by the most since 2012 in the April-June period. Official data last week showed the UK\u2019s economy grew 0.5% in the first quarter of 2019, but that growth was boosted by factories stockpiling supplies ahead of expected disruptions when it was expected to leave the European Union on 29 March. The stockpiling boost has now gone into reverse, and many economists \u2013 including Bank of England forecasters \u2013 think overall growth slowed to a halt in the second quarter, exacerbated by widespread Brexit-related stoppages in the car industry in April.",

And, despite some bizarre moments such as Gary inexplicably running into Captain Mainwaring and Sergeant Wilson in a bank in 1941 and recognising them as such, the show did not truly jump the shark until the third episode of series five, when Yvonne and Phoebe met. After that, it had nowhere left to go. That separation was the crux around which the show\u2019s dramatic tension was built, and after they met it was never the same again.</p> <p>From that moment, the show\u2019s precarious premise broke down entirely and descended into cartoonish cliche, with episodes involving evil Gary replicants, time-portal repair engineers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/01/hallie-rubenhold-jack-the-ripper-victims\">Jack the Ripper</a> who, it turns out, was never caught because he was run over by a bus in 1999.

Throughout the series, Gary takes credit for almost every hit written by everyone between George Formby and George Michael. And, despite some bizarre moments such as Gary inexplicably running into Captain Mainwaring and Sergeant Wilson in a bank in 1941 and recognising them as such, the show did not truly jump the shark until the third episode of series five, when Yvonne and Phoebe met. After that, it had nowhere left to go. That separation was the crux around which the show\u2019s dramatic tension was built, and after they met it was never the same again. From that moment, the show\u2019s precarious premise broke down entirely and descended into cartoonish cliche, with episodes involving evil Gary replicants, time-portal repair engineers and Jack the Ripper who, it turns out, was never caught because he was run over by a bus in 1999. But looking back, the most jarring moment came in the form of an unfortunate series five cameo by Rolf Harris, which just goes to show that the past really is a foreign country. They do things differently there.",

It is a McCarthyistic system, drawing university staff into the task of security surveillance. If discovered to be uncooperative, universities can be subject to direction by the secretary of state and, ultimately, face a mandatory court order backed by criminal sanctions for contempt of court. Quite apart from the fact that as tutors our role should be one of supporting rather than spying on students, the Prevent duty has resulted in the victimisation of Muslim students and the institutionalisation of anti-Muslim racism in British universities.</p> <p>Since its inception, <a href=\"https://www.nusconnect.org.uk/campaigns/preventing-prevent-we-are-students-not-suspects\" title=\"\">students</a> and <a href=\"https://educatorsnotinformants.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">staff</a> have warned about the potential for Prevent to have an impact on free speech on campus, in particular that of Muslim students and staff. The latest statistics regarding university events and speakers affected by the Prevent duty not only demonstrate that it must be scrapped, but that politicians and the media must listen to and amplify the voices of students rather than dismiss them as \u201csnowflakes\u201d when they speak.</p> <p>There is no doubt that Prevent is primarily targeted at monitoring the speech and activities of Muslim students on campus. The explanatory notes to the 2015 act state that the principal terrorist threat is \u201cfrom Al Qa\u2019ida-associated groups and from other terrorist organisations in Syria and Iraq\u201d. The strategy is based on the <a href=\"https://cage.ngo/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CAGE-Science-Pre-Crime-Report.pdf\" title=\"\">scientifically debunked</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-017-0009-0\" title=\"\">racist</a> assumption that any Muslim has the potential to become radicalised and violent.</p> <p>Research has shown that this strategy has resulted in the <a href=\"https://www.coventry.ac.uk/research/about-us/research-news/2017/what-the-prevent-duty-means/\" title=\"\">disproportionate and discriminatory victimisation</a> of Muslim students. In a society in which anti-Muslim racism is pervasive and institutionalised, the Prevent duty adds purchase to the idea that Muslims are a threat, and gives power to those with authority over Muslim students to act on their prejudice. Remember the Muslim student accused of being a terrorist for reading a book about terrorism in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/sep/24/student-accused-being-terrorist-reading-book-terrorism\" title=\"\">Staffordshire University library</a>?

Curricula have suffered censorship \u2013 both self- and university-imposed as a culture of fear has taken hold.</p> <p>Meanwhile, students working to ensure campuses are inclusive spaces free from racism, homophobia and transphobia have found themselves branded snowflakes, vocally attacked and threatened with the introduction of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/feb/02/government-tells-universities-to-protect-free-speech-on-campus\" title=\"\">legislative measures</a>. Far from so-called snowflake students being a threat to campus free speech, it is measures such as Prevent that are shutting down free thinking in Britain\u2019s universities. </p> <p>The dismissal of progressive students as snowflakes comes after the success of anti-racist and anti-colonial movements such as Black Lives Matter, Rhodes Must Fall and Why is My Curriculum White?

      "bodyText": "Many staff and students at universities across Britain will have welcomed Liberty\u2019s condemnation of the chilling effect the government\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy is having on free speech on campuses. Recently published figures from the Office for Students showed that more than 2,000 events across Britain\u2019s 300 or so higher education institutions have been affected by Prevent. While some events were allowed to take place with conditions attached, 53 events or speaker requests on campuses were rejected altogether by university authorities. The demonisation of Muslims through the Prevent strategy has led to progressive dissent more broadly being curtailed. The Prevent duty, introduced by the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 places a legal obligation on universities and other public institutions to \u201chave due regard for the need to prevent people being drawn into terrorism\u201d. It is a McCarthyistic system, drawing university staff into the task of security surveillance. If discovered to be uncooperative, universities can be subject to direction by the secretary of state and, ultimately, face a mandatory court order backed by criminal sanctions for contempt of court. Quite apart from the fact that as tutors our role should be one of supporting rather than spying on students, the Prevent duty has resulted in the victimisation of Muslim students and the institutionalisation of anti-Muslim racism in British universities. Since its inception, students and staff have warned about the potential for Prevent to have an impact on free speech on campus, in particular that of Muslim students and staff. The latest statistics regarding university events and speakers affected by the Prevent duty not only demonstrate that it must be scrapped, but that politicians and the media must listen to and amplify the voices of students rather than dismiss them as \u201csnowflakes\u201d when they speak. There is no doubt that Prevent is primarily targeted at monitoring the speech and activities of Muslim students on campus. The explanatory notes to the 2015 act state that the principal terrorist threat is \u201cfrom Al Qa\u2019ida-associated groups and from other terrorist organisations in Syria and Iraq\u201d. The strategy is based on the scientifically debunked and racist assumption that any Muslim has the potential to become radicalised and violent. Research has shown that this strategy has resulted in the disproportionate and discriminatory victimisation of Muslim students. In a society in which anti-Muslim racism is pervasive and institutionalised, the Prevent duty adds purchase to the idea that Muslims are a threat, and gives power to those with authority over Muslim students to act on their prejudice. Remember the Muslim student accused of being a terrorist for reading a book about terrorism in Staffordshire University library? Or the Muslim schoolchild questioned because he said \u201ceco-terrorist\u201d in class? Prevent has meant that Muslims students have even been watched while they pray. Prevent\u2019s broader effect is to suppress a wide range of forms of valid political resistance. Universities have clamped down on campus activism. Events, ranging from a panel on Kurdish political struggles at Cambridge University to pro-Palestine events at the University of Exeter, University College London and the London School of Economics have been policed or cancelled. Curricula have suffered censorship \u2013 both self- and university-imposed as a culture of fear has taken hold. Meanwhile, students working to ensure campuses are inclusive spaces free from racism, homophobia and transphobia have found themselves branded snowflakes, vocally attacked and threatened with the introduction of legislative measures. Far from so-called snowflake students being a threat to campus free speech, it is measures such as Prevent that are shutting down free thinking in Britain\u2019s universities. The dismissal of progressive students as snowflakes comes after the success of anti-racist and anti-colonial movements such as Black Lives Matter, Rhodes Must Fall and Why is My Curriculum White? The refusal of students to tolerate racism and the spread of far-right ideology on campus and their resistance to the systemic exclusion of non-white writers from their curricula has been met with a backlash from the right. Branding students as snowflakes is part of an ideological attack on progress, symptomatic of whiteness closing ranks, of a culture reluctant to cede ground to a more inclusive and progressive politics. In the face of censorship, surveillance, suppression and a climate of fear backed by criminal sanction, it is more important than ever to think carefully about whether and how Muslim students can express themselves and develop modes of resistance. What is clear is that students are wise to what the real risks to free speech on campus are and what to do about them. \u2022 Nadine El-Enany is a senior lecturer in law at Birkbeck College, University of London",

It is temporary support, but it allows them to change their business models \u2013 to adapt.\u201d</p> <p>The necessity of tackling the deficit formed the centrepiece of the Conservatives\u2019 economic pitch in the 2010 and 2015 general elections, and was one of their key attack lines against Labour.</p> <p>Paul Johnson, the director of tax thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said: \u201cThis whole debate seems to be taking place in a complete vacuum.

I then feel guilty for not being so attracted to her, which makes my internal situation worse.</strong></p> <p><strong>I </strong><strong>had this issue </strong><strong>with a previous girlfriend.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>She took it</strong><strong> badly and would bring it up in every subsequent argument or failed sexual encounter, quickly ruining the relationship. My </strong><strong>current girlfriend has an altogether dimmer view of my preferences and is quite old fashioned when it comes to sex due to her strict Christian upbringing.</strong></p> <p>Your particular erotic triggers are not uncommon. But as you are obviously aware, issues regarding weight gain and loss can be acutely sensitive in our culture \u2013 especially for women. There may be a way to subtly help your partner to understand the complexity of your feelings, but careful preparation would be required. Could you very simply and honestly express the duality of your appreciation for her reaching of her health goals versus your focus of attraction? If you decide to attempt this, you must first be very clear in your mind about what exactly you hope to achieve.</p> <p>Being strongly fixated on specific aspects of people (rather than the whole person) can constitute a fetish. And fetishistic interests often mean that \u2013 even if one truly loves and respects a partner in most ways \u2013 elements of her can be objectified and craved in a way that she might find demeaning. You are clearly somewhat ashamed of this, yet it is part of who you are \u2013 something that has developed over a long period of time \u2013 probably since childhood.</p> <p>Learn all you can about the psychological and behavioural mechanism of fetishism and try to relate that learning to your own early experiences. In doing so, you may gain greater self-acceptance \u2013 and vital insights into how to safely introduce your partner to your real self.</p> <p>\u2022 Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don\u2019t send attachments).

I really enjoy my girlfriend\u2019s newfound confidence, but when we have sex now it\u2019s a struggle for me to get aroused and I feel disappointed when reaching for the parts of her body I once enjoyed immensely. I then feel guilty for not being so attracted to her, which makes my internal situation worse. I had this issue with a previous girlfriend. She took it badly and would bring it up in every subsequent argument or failed sexual encounter, quickly ruining the relationship. My current girlfriend has an altogether dimmer view of my preferences and is quite old fashioned when it comes to sex due to her strict Christian upbringing. Your particular erotic triggers are not uncommon. But as you are obviously aware, issues regarding weight gain and loss can be acutely sensitive in our culture \u2013 especially for women. There may be a way to subtly help your partner to understand the complexity of your feelings, but careful preparation would be required. Could you very simply and honestly express the duality of your appreciation for her reaching of her health goals versus your focus of attraction? If you decide to attempt this, you must first be very clear in your mind about what exactly you hope to achieve. Being strongly fixated on specific aspects of people (rather than the whole person) can constitute a fetish. And fetishistic interests often mean that \u2013 even if one truly loves and respects a partner in most ways \u2013 elements of her can be objectified and craved in a way that she might find demeaning. You are clearly somewhat ashamed of this, yet it is part of who you are \u2013 something that has developed over a long period of time \u2013 probably since childhood. Learn all you can about the psychological and behavioural mechanism of fetishism and try to relate that learning to your own early experiences. In doing so, you may gain greater self-acceptance \u2013 and vital insights into how to safely introduce your partner to your real self. \u2022 Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. \u2022 If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don\u2019t send attachments).

Dating, I\u2019d guess, from the poem\u2019s anthology publication in 1763, the later title allows the gentleman a tiny fragment of exculpation: \u201cTo a Gentleman, on his intending to cut down a Grove to enlarge his Prospect.\u201d It\u2019s a subtle piece of editing. An intention is less incriminating than a \u201cdesign\u201d and the general merit of enlarging a prospect should be taken into account by readers before deciding that tree destruction is a capital offence.</p> <p>James Uden tells us all about Elizabeth Carter\u2019s poem in <a href=\"http://www.thehollyfest.org/index.php/james-uden/\">an entertaining, scholarly and wide-ranging essay</a>, beginning with a portrayal of Carter herself. On an outing with \u201cgentlemen\u201d companions, she sets off ecstatically alone to the top of a wooded hill: the boys call her Pegasus, and \u201caerobates\u201d (air-walker) add quips about witches and broomsticks. On another occasion she steals some laurel from Pope\u2019s Twickenham garden. Carter comes across as \u201ca character\u201d \u2013 and these glimpses suggest her letters would be great fun to read.</p> <p>Elizabeth Carter (1717-1806) was the leading female classical scholar of the period. She was educated by her clergyman father, and learned Hebrew and the classical languages at a young age. The educational regimen was strict, and, possibly, the memory of being confined indoors for study is a personal context for the poet\u2019s praise of shade as conducive to ideas.</p> <p>From stanza two onwards, the poem\u2019s speaker is the \u201cweeping Hamadryad\u201d. The <a href=\"https://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NymphaiHamadryades.html\">Hamadryades</a> were the tree nymphs of classical Greek mythology. Such a nymph was \u201cone with\u201d her tree: not so much a spirit inhabiting it, as the tree psyche itself. So \u201cFate-devoted\u201d, Carter\u2019s unexpected compound adjective, seals the identification of tree and nymph: the tree\u2019s fate must be her own. When the tree is cut down, the hamadyrad perishes. Uden cites Ovid and the story of axe-wielding Erysichthon in Metamorphosis. The tree-chopper, Carter implies, could be in for severe retribution.</p> <p>Maybe, in \u201cFate-devoted Trees\u201d, Carter is also enjoying a joke with her friends, brilliant women warned by society to accept their fate as women, and not at all inclined to do so. Then again, the note of fatalism may remind us that Carter translated the complete works of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus\">the Stoic philosopher, Epictetus</a>.</p> <p>Carter\u2019s \u201cgreen\u201d focus is on the intellectual \u201cgrowth\u201d and \u201cfruits\u201d afforded by shade. She references Plato, Aristotle, Cicero and Virgil (stanzas four, five and six) as recipients of their intellectual illumination from that source. As Uden points out, their \u201cshades\u201d inhabit the woodlands and groves for Carter: the \u201cWalk\u201d is \u201cshady\u201d in this way, too. Carter\u2019s light touch may nonetheless conceal the anxiety of a woman about her freedom to explore intellectual ideas, to branch out, to risk being cut down.</p> <p>The \u201cplatane\u201d reference is interesting, not only in connection with Plato. In Handel\u2019s aria, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7XH-58eB8c\">Ombra mai fu</a>, Xerxes praises lovingly the plane-tree that shades him as he rests on his march from Asia to conquer Greece. Xerxes is no \u201cGrecian genius\u201d but I can\u2019t help wondering if Carter might have heard Handel\u2019s opera performed in London, and if that exquisite melody could be threading distantly through the stately quatrains of her shade-enchanted poem.</p> <p>The identity of the gentleman in question is known: it was Dr Walwyn of Canterbury, who wanted to cut down the trees so the fruit he was growing could get more sunlight. Uden warns us against reading the poem as a verse letter directed to Walwyn, arguing that Carter wrote the poem principally for the eyes of her \u201cbluestocking\u201d friends. Walwyn probably didn\u2019t see it, but if he did, it made no difference. Intent on his prospect-enlarging fruit production, he went ahead and cut down the trees.</p>",

Ah! Stop thy sacrilegious Hand, Nor violate the Shade, Where Nature form\u2019d a silent Haunt For Contemplation\u2019s Aid. Canst thou, the Son of Science, train\u2019d Where learned Isis flows, Forget that nurs\u2019d in shelt\u2019ring Groves The Grecian Genius rose. Beneath the Platane\u2019s spreading Branch, Immortal Plato taught: And fair Lyceum form\u2019d the Depth Of Aristotle\u2019s Thought. To Latian Groves reflect thy View, And bless the Tuscan Gloom: Where Eloquence deplor\u2019d the Fate Of Liberty and Rome. Within the Beechen Shade retir\u2019d, From each inspiring Bough, The Muses wove unfading Wreaths, To circle Virgil\u2019s Brow. Reflect, before the fatal Ax My threatened Doom has wrought: Nor sacrifice to sensual Taste The nobler Growth of Thought. Not all the glowing Fruits, that blush On India\u2019s sunny Coast, Can recompense thee for the Worth Of one Idea lost. My Shade a Produce may supply, Unknown to solar Fire: And what excludes Apollo\u2019s Rays, Shall harmonize his Lyre.

Dating, I\u2019d guess, from the poem\u2019s anthology publication in 1763, the later title allows the gentleman a tiny fragment of exculpation: \u201cTo a Gentleman, on his intending to cut down a Grove to enlarge his Prospect.\u201d It\u2019s a subtle piece of editing. An intention is less incriminating than a \u201cdesign\u201d and the general merit of enlarging a prospect should be taken into account by readers before deciding that tree destruction is a capital offence. James Uden tells us all about Elizabeth Carter\u2019s poem in an entertaining, scholarly and wide-ranging essay, beginning with a portrayal of Carter herself. On an outing with \u201cgentlemen\u201d companions, she sets off ecstatically alone to the top of a wooded hill: the boys call her Pegasus, and \u201caerobates\u201d (air-walker) add quips about witches and broomsticks. On another occasion she steals some laurel from Pope\u2019s Twickenham garden. Carter comes across as \u201ca character\u201d \u2013 and these glimpses suggest her letters would be great fun to read. Elizabeth Carter (1717-1806) was the leading female classical scholar of the period. She was educated by her clergyman father, and learned Hebrew and the classical languages at a young age. The educational regimen was strict, and, possibly, the memory of being confined indoors for study is a personal context for the poet\u2019s praise of shade as conducive to ideas. From stanza two onwards, the poem\u2019s speaker is the \u201cweeping Hamadryad\u201d. The Hamadryades were the tree nymphs of classical Greek mythology. Such a nymph was \u201cone with\u201d her tree: not so much a spirit inhabiting it, as the tree psyche itself. So \u201cFate-devoted\u201d, Carter\u2019s unexpected compound adjective, seals the identification of tree and nymph: the tree\u2019s fate must be her own. When the tree is cut down, the hamadyrad perishes. Uden cites Ovid and the story of axe-wielding Erysichthon in Metamorphosis. The tree-chopper, Carter implies, could be in for severe retribution. Maybe, in \u201cFate-devoted Trees\u201d, Carter is also enjoying a joke with her friends, brilliant women warned by society to accept their fate as women, and not at all inclined to do so. Then again, the note of fatalism may remind us that Carter translated the complete works of the Stoic philosopher, Epictetus. Carter\u2019s \u201cgreen\u201d focus is on the intellectual \u201cgrowth\u201d and \u201cfruits\u201d afforded by shade. She references Plato, Aristotle, Cicero and Virgil (stanzas four, five and six) as recipients of their intellectual illumination from that source. As Uden points out, their \u201cshades\u201d inhabit the woodlands and groves for Carter: the \u201cWalk\u201d is \u201cshady\u201d in this way, too. Carter\u2019s light touch may nonetheless conceal the anxiety of a woman about her freedom to explore intellectual ideas, to branch out, to risk being cut down. The \u201cplatane\u201d reference is interesting, not only in connection with Plato. In Handel\u2019s aria, Ombra mai fu, Xerxes praises lovingly the plane-tree that shades him as he rests on his march from Asia to conquer Greece. Xerxes is no \u201cGrecian genius\u201d but I can\u2019t help wondering if Carter might have heard Handel\u2019s opera performed in London, and if that exquisite melody could be threading distantly through the stately quatrains of her shade-enchanted poem. The identity of the gentleman in question is known: it was Dr Walwyn of Canterbury, who wanted to cut down the trees so the fruit he was growing could get more sunlight. Uden warns us against reading the poem as a verse letter directed to Walwyn, arguing that Carter wrote the poem principally for the eyes of her \u201cbluestocking\u201d friends. Walwyn probably didn\u2019t see it, but if he did, it made no difference. Intent on his prospect-enlarging fruit production, he went ahead and cut down the trees.",

      "bodyText": "I like that stewards reports are posted on Twitter these days but some care needs to be taken with the wording, as we learned yesterday when a verdict from Windsor caused understandable outrage. A member of Simon Crisford\u2019s staff was fined \u00a3200 for \u201cattempting to kick MOFAAJI in the groin area when leading the colt out of the Stables\u201d. No further detail was offered in the tweet or the full stewards\u2019 report posted online. But when I called Crisford, it became clear there was a lot more to be said. I should say that Crisford had not been at Windsor but had heard of the episode from his staff. Mofaaji was a previously unraced three-year-old who was known for behaving badly at home. At Windsor, he became very \u2018coltish\u2019, possibly as a result of being stabled near fillies. By the time of the incident, he was threatening to get out of control and was essentially trying to mount the groom leading him up, \u201cclimbing all over him\u201d in Crisford\u2019s words.

      "bodyText": "UK manufacturers have recorded the sharpest drop in factory output for more than six years amid mounting concerns over Brexit, as growth in consumer borrowing eased to the lowest level in more than five years. The monthly snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply showed that activity levels in the UK manufacturing sector dropped to the lowest level since February 2013 in June, as firms scaled back their orders due to existing high stock levels. Firms had previously rushed to stockpile goods and materials ahead of the original Brexit deadline on 29 March before Theresa May agreed to push back the date until the end of October. After providing a boost to economic growth, manufacturers are now either adequately stocked or may run down their supplies, dragging on output. The IHS Markit/Cips manufacturers purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) plunged to 48.0 in June, down from 49.4 a month ago and dropping well below the forecasts made by City economists. Anything above 50.0 separates economic growth from contraction. The survey found that high stock levels, ongoing Brexit uncertainty, a deteriorating economic backdrop and rising competition contributed to the drop in output. Weak export demand amid a faltering global economy also had an impact. Manufacturing output has recently slowed across the eurozone, raising questions over the strength of the European economy amid weaker global trade flows as the US-China trade war serves as a brake on growth. Factory output has slipped into reverse in Ireland, Italy, Spain, Austria and Germany. The gathering signs of a slowdown in the British economy came as separate figures from the Bank of England showed the weakest growth in personal borrowing across the country for more than five years. Annual growth in borrowing on credit cards, overdrafts and personal loans eased to 5.6% in the year to May, down from 5.9% a month ago and marking the smallest rise since April 2014. Figures last month showed that retail sales fell by 0.5% in May, the biggest drop in spending this year. The slowdown could reflect weaker demand among consumers to borrow money to buy goods and services, holding back the economy. Borrowing rose by \u00a3822m in May, below economists\u2019 forecasts for growth of just under \u00a31bn. The weaker expansion could, however, allay concerns at the Bank over an unsustainable consumer credit bubble. Households had driven up their borrowing at growth rates of more than 10% as recently as 2016, racking up a debt mountain bigger than the one seen before the financial crisis. Households have over recent months gradually been able to rebuild their finances, as inflation fades and wage growth accelerates to the fastest pace in more than a decade, enabling them to spend without taking on as much debt.",

This weekend in London records have been falling over themselves with a regularity that probably constituted a record in itself.</p> \n<p>But the one that will resound through Major League Baseball\u2019s executive suite is this: its first two games played in Europe drew the sport\u2019s highest attendances in 16 years. US baseball no longer even has a stadium that can hold 60,000 spectators, never mind fill it, near as dammit, in mid-season. So by coming to London the sport seems to be on to something \u2013 if not big, then at least a regular sideshow.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/30/boston-red-sox-new-york-yankees-match-report-london-stadium\">New York Yankees double up on Boston Red Sox to clinch London series</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>After the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/29/new-york-yankees-boston-red-sox-stage-london-mlb-baseball-run-fest\" title=\"\">wild Saturday night at the London Stadium</a> Sunday afternoon initially followed the traditional pattern of such weekends: a slow, groggy return to normality. Then the bingeing started again. Fifty runs in two games is exhibition stuff.</p> \n<p>Even the regular baseball writers, who have seen it all in every ballpark from the redwood forests to the New York islands, were groping for explanations of the London lunacy. Take the first ever inning of London\u2019s first ever game. Runs are normally precious currency in baseball, like wickets in cricket. In that first inning both teams scored six.</p> \n<p>That last happened in a major league game in 1989. There are 30 baseball teams who fulfil 162 fixtures a season (and up to 20 more if they reach the play-offs). So it is something like 75,000 games since that last happened. No big deal then.</p> \n<p>It was not actually a recipe for a great game. So much time was spent changing the pitchers \u2013 who had the life expectancy of mayflies \u2013 and going round and round the bases, that the clock was starting to threaten midnight. Game 2 was almost as extreme but not quite as enervating. Where\u2019s the tea interval when you need it? Yet very few walked out of either.</p> \n<p>What on earth was happening? Baseball is particularly like cricket in that it is dictated by its surroundings. Denver, the mile-high city, is known as a hitters\u2019 paradise because of low gravity; the moon will be even more so when baseball gets really adventurous. But there are no mountains here. The ESPN commentator Joe Sciambi thought it was just one of those things. An outbreak of home-run hitting and high scoring has been the talk of the circuit all year. \u201cTerrible pitching,\u201d he summed up. \u201cRandom. Could have happened in Kansas City.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df5312f6ddd4239df88718ca70514267bc0cf9af\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df5312f6ddd4239df88718ca70514267bc0cf9af/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans pose for a picture outside London Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans pose for a picture outside London Stadium.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Ireland/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There are also whispers that there is something funny about the balls in use this year. But there were aspects of the London Stadium setup that must raise questions. The fielding, at this level normally as balletic as the Bolshoi, was notably erratic across both teams and both days. One problem may have been the artificial grass, which was much faster than nature\u2019s own. No one was complaining, though. Baseball players these days are far too polite. This was grander than PR: it was an ambassadorial exercise. And they knew how to delight their hosts.</p> \n<p>On Saturday 11-year-old Franklin from Essex was allowed to call the names of the incoming batters for one half-inning. Jeez, the way things were going he might have been called to the pitcher\u2019s mound. There were plenty of other kids too. But the biggest cohort seemed to consist of members of Britain\u2019s hidden subculture of stalwart baseball fans, a small, scattered minority normally, much less so crammed into a single stadium.</p> \n<p>On Saturday I had a session asking people wearing Red Sox gear where they came from. I got to double figures before I found a real, live Bostonian.

      "bodyText": "Baseball makes cricket look like an almost stat-free zone. This weekend in London records have been falling over themselves with a regularity that probably constituted a record in itself. But the one that will resound through Major League Baseball\u2019s executive suite is this: its first two games played in Europe drew the sport\u2019s highest attendances in 16 years. US baseball no longer even has a stadium that can hold 60,000 spectators, never mind fill it, near as dammit, in mid-season. So by coming to London the sport seems to be on to something \u2013 if not big, then at least a regular sideshow. After the wild Saturday night at the London Stadium Sunday afternoon initially followed the traditional pattern of such weekends: a slow, groggy return to normality. Then the bingeing started again. Fifty runs in two games is exhibition stuff. Even the regular baseball writers, who have seen it all in every ballpark from the redwood forests to the New York islands, were groping for explanations of the London lunacy. Take the first ever inning of London\u2019s first ever game. Runs are normally precious currency in baseball, like wickets in cricket. In that first inning both teams scored six. That last happened in a major league game in 1989. There are 30 baseball teams who fulfil 162 fixtures a season (and up to 20 more if they reach the play-offs). So it is something like 75,000 games since that last happened. No big deal then. It was not actually a recipe for a great game. So much time was spent changing the pitchers \u2013 who had the life expectancy of mayflies \u2013 and going round and round the bases, that the clock was starting to threaten midnight. Game 2 was almost as extreme but not quite as enervating. Where\u2019s the tea interval when you need it? Yet very few walked out of either. What on earth was happening? Baseball is particularly like cricket in that it is dictated by its surroundings. Denver, the mile-high city, is known as a hitters\u2019 paradise because of low gravity; the moon will be even more so when baseball gets really adventurous. But there are no mountains here. The ESPN commentator Joe Sciambi thought it was just one of those things. An outbreak of home-run hitting and high scoring has been the talk of the circuit all year. \u201cTerrible pitching,\u201d he summed up. \u201cRandom. Could have happened in Kansas City.\u201d There are also whispers that there is something funny about the balls in use this year. But there were aspects of the London Stadium setup that must raise questions. The fielding, at this level normally as balletic as the Bolshoi, was notably erratic across both teams and both days. One problem may have been the artificial grass, which was much faster than nature\u2019s own. No one was complaining, though. Baseball players these days are far too polite. This was grander than PR: it was an ambassadorial exercise. And they knew how to delight their hosts. On Saturday 11-year-old Franklin from Essex was allowed to call the names of the incoming batters for one half-inning. Jeez, the way things were going he might have been called to the pitcher\u2019s mound. There were plenty of other kids too. But the biggest cohort seemed to consist of members of Britain\u2019s hidden subculture of stalwart baseball fans, a small, scattered minority normally, much less so crammed into a single stadium. On Saturday I had a session asking people wearing Red Sox gear where they came from. I got to double figures before I found a real, live Bostonian. The homegrown Soxers included Jonathan Wall, MCC member and leading light of the UK Red Sox Supporters Club. \u201cHow many members have you got?\u201d I asked. \u201c2,000.\u201d \u201cAnd how many are here? \u201cAbout 2,000.\u201d In spite of the results they still had fun. Being a British baseball fan is like having an obscure secret fetish, frowned on by polite society. But here they were, en masse, in an environment where they could just be themselves. This might be the start of a liberation movement. I am not quite convinced. What London loves is special occasions, of any kind. They queued for hours to pay for overpriced tat.

During the season, it impairs people, but people still try and go about their day and drive to work and so on, but they\u2019re taking a lot of hay fever medication usually.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hay fever is estimated to cost the Japanese economy billions of dollars each year</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Tokyo is also a pollen allergy hotspot. Local government surveys have found that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/84afcf72-46d1-11e8-8ee8-cae73aab7ccb\">half the city\u2019s population</a> suffer from hay fever, a far higher percentage than the 10-30% estimated average sufferers worldwide.</p> <p>Japan as a nation has its fair share of hay fever \u2013 which is said to have<a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2014/03/22/lifestyle/hay-fever-nothing-to-sneeze-at/#.XOaqKBZKiUk\"> started </a>following a cedar-planting drive after the second world war. In Tokyo, however, the hay fever season lasts slightly longer than the rest of the country\u2019s,<strong> </strong>according to the Japan Weather Association. In 2018, hay fever suffering was at its worst on record, and the affliction is estimated to cost the Japanese <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/84afcf72-46d1-11e8-8ee8-cae73aab7ccb\">economy billions of dollars</a> each year.</p> <p>In the UK, tree pollen hay fever season starts in late March, then grass pollen hits in mid-May through to late July. The top three areas most affected by grass pollen counts are the West Midlands (suggesting Birmingham, Coventry and Wolverhampton would be the worst cities for grass pollen allergy sufferers to visit during this time), south-central England and north-west England, according to Beverley Adams-Groom, a leading pollen forecaster at the school of the environment at the University of Worcester.</p> <p>London suffers more than other UK cities in the springtime because of some particularly pollen-heavy tree types surrounding it. \u201cLondon can be badly affected by high tree pollen counts due to the numbers of birch trees to the south and south-west of the city,\u201d says Adams-Groom. \u201cAnd the London plane trees, which line many of the streets, can be a nasty allergen for some hay fever sufferers in mid-April.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"070e4b5c4566010484231a16a3c18a7f9e570ad8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/070e4b5c4566010484231a16a3c18a7f9e570ad8/0_142_4435_2661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cloud of cedar pollen floats behind a pine tree.

Because so many people have for so long been overexposed to this kind of pollen, large numbers of people have become sensitised to it. To trigger allergies in a city you don\u2019t necessarily need huge numbers of these male trees \u2026 One big male tree might well produce as much pollen as several hundred other trees that are not all-male.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Wherever you live, issues such as hay fever are expected to get worse in the coming years, and seasons will last longer due to global heating</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the US, several cities in the deep south rank among the highest for allergies according to the <a href=\"https://www.aafa.org/media/2113/aafa-2018-spring-allergy-capitals-report.pdf\">Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America</a><a href=\"https://www.aafa.org/media/2113/aafa-2018-spring-allergy-capitals-report.pdf\">, </a>which looks at pollen counts, the use of allergy medicine and the number of allergy doctors in each city.</p> <p>In 2018, McAllen in Texas, Louisville in Kentucky and Jackson in Mississippi made the top of three of the organisation\u2019s \u201cmost challenging places to live with spring allergies\u201d list.

In contrast, Canberra, the capital, \u201cis land-locked and surrounded by grassland, and we have a population that is very sensitive to grass pollen in season [October to December]\u201d, he says. He adds: \u201cCanberra is thought to be the worst place in Australia for hay fever. During the season, it impairs people, but people still try and go about their day and drive to work and so on, but they\u2019re taking a lot of hay fever medication usually.\u201d Tokyo is also a pollen allergy hotspot. Local government surveys have found that half the city\u2019s population suffer from hay fever, a far higher percentage than the 10-30% estimated average sufferers worldwide. Japan as a nation has its fair share of hay fever \u2013 which is said to have started following a cedar-planting drive after the second world war. In Tokyo, however, the hay fever season lasts slightly longer than the rest of the country\u2019s, according to the Japan Weather Association. In 2018, hay fever suffering was at its worst on record, and the affliction is estimated to cost the Japanese economy billions of dollars each year. In the UK, tree pollen hay fever season starts in late March, then grass pollen hits in mid-May through to late July. The top three areas most affected by grass pollen counts are the West Midlands (suggesting Birmingham, Coventry and Wolverhampton would be the worst cities for grass pollen allergy sufferers to visit during this time), south-central England and north-west England, according to Beverley Adams-Groom, a leading pollen forecaster at the school of the environment at the University of Worcester. London suffers more than other UK cities in the springtime because of some particularly pollen-heavy tree types surrounding it. \u201cLondon can be badly affected by high tree pollen counts due to the numbers of birch trees to the south and south-west of the city,\u201d says Adams-Groom. \u201cAnd the London plane trees, which line many of the streets, can be a nasty allergen for some hay fever sufferers in mid-April.\u201d It\u2019s not just the number of trees that affect the pollen count, according to Ogren. \u201cA single male dioecious tree may produce many, many millions of more pollen grains than a perfect-flowered tree (which have both male and female parts in the same flower),\u201d he says. \u201cTheir pollen grains are very small, very light and dry. Because so many people have for so long been overexposed to this kind of pollen, large numbers of people have become sensitised to it. To trigger allergies in a city you don\u2019t necessarily need huge numbers of these male trees \u2026 One big male tree might well produce as much pollen as several hundred other trees that are not all-male.\u201d In the US, several cities in the deep south rank among the highest for allergies according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, which looks at pollen counts, the use of allergy medicine and the number of allergy doctors in each city. In 2018, McAllen in Texas, Louisville in Kentucky and Jackson in Mississippi made the top of three of the organisation\u2019s \u201cmost challenging places to live with spring allergies\u201d list. Being inland, hot and surrounded by ragweed are all contributing factors. Last year, pictures circulated on social media showing parts of the whole south-east region of the US covered in yellow dust during pollen season. It\u2019s difficult to precisely pinpoint one place that is significantly worse than others on average (at least within the countries and regions that typically get hay fever). That\u2019s because pollen levels are so dynamic and brought on by changing winds \u2013 as shown in the time-lapse video of the UK below (green indicates low pollen count while red is severe; the video starts at the beginning of hay fever season). \u201cPollen is very complicated to measure and forecast,\u201d says Idit Lowenstein, from the Israeli startup Breezometer, who made the video. The company is attempting to track all the available data on pollen for the US, the UK and Japan. \u201cTraditionally the methods for assessing it have been manual and infrequent, not to mention not location-based and not representative of more far reaching conditions.\u201d Wherever you live issues such as hay fever are expected to get worse in the coming years, and seasons will last longer due to global heating. A study in the Lancet looked at 17 locations across the northern hemisphere that had solid data on pollen counts for at least 20 years and found 12 of the cities they analysed showed \u201csignificant increases in seasonal and annual pollen loads\u201d. An increase in the duration of pollen season, starting earlier or lasting longer, has also occurred in 11 of the 17 places. One of the study\u2019s authors, Lewis H Ziska of the US Department of Agriculture, says: \u201cNorthern locations are warming up faster than other regions, so locations such as Finland, Iceland and Poland are warming up and experiencing, in general, more pollen over longer periods.\u201d However, it\u2019s not all bad news for hay fever sufferers. In the city of San Luis Obispo in central California, an allergy-friendly housing complex is being built. It will include lots of fruit trees, such as apple and plum, that are are low-pollen, allergy-friendly plants. \u201cThis will be the first housing complex of any size that will, from the start, be purposely landscaped to be allergy-friendly,\u201d says Ogren.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it.

Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Fox, the international trade secretary, said that while the UK was \u201cnot entirely in control\u201d of whether no deal happened, he believed it would not.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou have got a new commission coming in, and we will have a new prime minister.

I think that there would be problems, and that\u2019s exactly what Jeremy Hunt is setting out today.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hancock, the health secretary, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that Johnson\u2019s pledge to leave on 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d minimised the risk of no deal.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe reason that I\u2019m [backing] Boris Johnson is because I think he\u2019s best placed to deliver Brexit and then to unite the country,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe best way to deliver Brexit is with a deadline, and Boris is the only candidate with a deadline. No deadline risks no Brexit, and slip-sliding towards a second referendum, which I don\u2019t want to see.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hancock had a very different approach to Brexit when he was still in the race, and was challenged repeatedly on how he could now support Johnson. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to look forward in life,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Hancock indicated he still disliked the idea of proroguing, or suspending, the Commons to stop MPs blocking no deal, but refused to condemn Johnson for not ruling this out as a tactic.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t foresee that happening. The whole point of Brexit \u2013 this where he and I strongly agree \u2013 is to return parliamentary sovereignty to the UK,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t think that that is where this is going to end up.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hancock explained why he was now backing Johnson: \u201cI clearly made my case to win, and I didn\u2019t get the support in order to be able to proceed, and then you deal with the world as it is. And you have to ask the question: who is best placed to deliver Brexit? Answer: Boris Johnson.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cPart of being able to deliver, when you\u2019re in government, when you\u2019re in politics, is about uniting people who have a range of views. And Boris\u2019s ability to bring people behind him from different parts of the party is a great strength, and by God that\u2019s needed.\u201d</p>",

And then we can leave with a deal, which is in everybody\u2019s interests.\u201d However, Fox stressed he would prefer no deal to a second Brexit referendum. \u201cIt\u2019s up to us to be very clear to the European Union that we want a deal, but if we can\u2019t get one that\u2019s satisfactory, we can\u2019t get one that goes through parliament, then the default position within our law is that we leave without a deal, and we have to make the proper preparations so that is a credible position,\u201d he said. Hunt was on Monday due to make a speech setting out a 10-point plan to mitigate the effects of no deal, including \u00a36bn to protect fishing and agriculture. It would also include a new, dedicated committee with special powers to boost no-deal planning and a logistics committee to assist with imports and exports. Fox denied no deal would be disastrous, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not sure it would be catastrophic. I think that there would be problems, and that\u2019s exactly what Jeremy Hunt is setting out today.\u201d Hancock, the health secretary, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that Johnson\u2019s pledge to leave on 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d minimised the risk of no deal. \u201cThe reason that I\u2019m [backing] Boris Johnson is because I think he\u2019s best placed to deliver Brexit and then to unite the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best way to deliver Brexit is with a deadline, and Boris is the only candidate with a deadline. No deadline risks no Brexit, and slip-sliding towards a second referendum, which I don\u2019t want to see.\u201d Hancock had a very different approach to Brexit when he was still in the race, and was challenged repeatedly on how he could now support Johnson. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to look forward in life,\u201d he said. Hancock indicated he still disliked the idea of proroguing, or suspending, the Commons to stop MPs blocking no deal, but refused to condemn Johnson for not ruling this out as a tactic. \u201cI don\u2019t foresee that happening. The whole point of Brexit \u2013 this where he and I strongly agree \u2013 is to return parliamentary sovereignty to the UK,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t think that that is where this is going to end up.\u201d Hancock explained why he was now backing Johnson: \u201cI clearly made my case to win, and I didn\u2019t get the support in order to be able to proceed, and then you deal with the world as it is. And you have to ask the question: who is best placed to deliver Brexit? Answer: Boris Johnson.\u201d He said: \u201cPart of being able to deliver, when you\u2019re in government, when you\u2019re in politics, is about uniting people who have a range of views. And Boris\u2019s ability to bring people behind him from different parts of the party is a great strength, and by God that\u2019s needed.\u201d",

In the year that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/avengers-endgame\">Endgame</a> grossed more than $2.7bn at the box office worldwide, surely not much could go wrong for a game proffering a personalised Marvel superhero fantasy.</p> <p>As it turned out, however, the Avengers game\u2019s big reveal fell rather flat (and was rather eclipsed by Keanu Reeves, who made a surprise appearance to reveal his top-secret cameo in the forthcoming Cyberpunk 2077 the day before). That <em>is </em>Iron Man, right? Why does he look nothing like Robert Downey Jr?</p> <p>The Avengers characters in this online action-adventure game share absolutely no likeness with the ones we know from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In fact, they look a bit like I\u2019ve tried to make them in The Sims 3. Black Widow\u2019s hairstyle, colour and face are in theory in the right ballpark, but altogether just feel a little off. This is a hard barrier for fans when the MCU characters are arguably the best-known pop culture force on the planet.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDBojdBAjXU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LDBojdBAjXU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Scot Amos, head of studio at developer Crystal Dynamics, told the Guardian that even he expects Marvel fans to struggle to adapt to his new-look Avengers. \u201cI think it\u2019ll take some time.

This suffers by comparison with rival blockbuster tie-in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order from EA, which is closely linked to the Star Wars film universe (and was also shown off at E3). Developed together with Lucasfilm, the game\u2019s story is canon, and characters resemble (and are voiced by) actors recognisable from the big screen \u2013 such as Forest Whitaker, who plays Saw Gerrera in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.</p> <p>On the other hand, freedom from the film franchise has its own advantages. Consider the possibilities of playing with a Marvel universe that isn\u2019t hamstrung by messy licensing rules (Fox\u2019s pre-Disney-takeover ownership of the X-Men, for example). Marvel\u2019s Avengers is envisioned as an ongoing, long-term project, a \u201cmulti-game\u201d partnership between Marvel and Square Enix for years to come, so perhaps there\u2019s time to get used to the redesigned characters. New heroes, worlds and missions will be added in continuing updates, at no extra cost to players.</p> <p>With so many characters expected to become part of the game in the future, it\u2019s understandable that it would be too difficult or too expensive to have them all voiced by major Hollywood stars. If the game\u2019s good, fans will forgive. Tom Holland didn\u2019t feature in last year\u2019s Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man, developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony, but it was still loved by Spidey fans and even picked up a few game-of-the-year accolades.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"986c8125d06ac11803dbd71cfa28575e63973e95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/986c8125d06ac11803dbd71cfa28575e63973e95/130_130_2324_1394/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The game is for one to four players\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Power in numbers \u2026 the game is for one to four players.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Square Enix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In developing this original Avengers plot, the Crystal Dynamics team worked with Marvel and with the comicbook authors who know these characters best. \u201cThey\u2019ve been very successful at figuring out how to navigate where these heroes should go,\u201d says Amos.</p> <p>It begins as the Avengers are enjoying their own holiday in San Francisco, Avengers Day, when the Golden Gate bridge is attacked.

These all come too early to have any serious impact so the peloton will be jostling for a bunch sprint as they tackle a finale that includes the towns of Waterloo \u2013 a gift for the headline writers \u2013 and Woluwe-Saint-Pierre, childhood home of Eddy Merckx. Sprint favourites will include Caleb Ewan and Andr\u00e9 Greipel.</p> <h2>Stage two, Sunday 7 July, team time trial, Brussels (Palais Royal) \u2013Brussels (Atomium) 27.6km</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/tdf_stage_2/giv-3902dD2v0lpeCZux\" data-alt=\"Stage 2\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/tdf_stage_2/giv-3902dD2v0lpeCZux\">Stage 2</a> </figure>  <p>Underlining Eddy Merckx\u2019s special status he has two stages coming through his manor in two days, so there is a second flying visit to Woluwe-Saint-Pierre during a team time trial entirely within Brussels and its suburbs. All the favourites will want to lay down a marker; if history is anything to go by, the smart money will be on Adam Yates\u2019s Mitchelton-Scott, winners (as Orica-Greenedge) in 2013; on current form Jumbo-Visma have been strong all year. The big pressure will be on Geraint Thomas\u2019s Ineos, who never landed a Tour team time trial during their years as Team Sky.</p> <h2>Stage three, Monday 8 July, Binche \u2013 \u00c9pernay, 215km</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/tdf_stage_3/giv-3902CPBmuzOgDV8Q/\" data-alt=\"Stage 3\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/tdf_stage_3/giv-3902CPBmuzOgDV8Q/\">Stage 3</a> </figure>  <p>On the map, a long flattish stage heading south, with a routine bunch sprint, but there is a sting in the tail. It will be dead quiet as far as Reims, with an early break establishing itself, but the final 30km include three stiff third category climbs one after the other, with very little respite, before a final 500m at 8% to the finish. All of France will look to Julian Alaphilippe on a finish made for the world No 1 but all the favourites\u2019 nerves will be on edge with an intense battle for position. A classic day when at least one will lose the Tour.</p> <h2>Stage four, Tuesday 9 July, Reims \u2013 Nancy, 213.5km</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/tdf_stage_4/giv-39025Ks7D57GqGYQ/\" data-alt=\"Stage 4\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/tdf_stage_4/giv-39025Ks7D57GqGYQ/\">Stage 4</a> </figure>  <p>A second long day in a row, but this one will end in a bunch sprint unless it rains and there is some action over the final climb, 15km from the finish. It\u2019s a typical first-week stage, largely main roads and the scenario should be classic: early break, late catch, scary sprint. There aren\u2019t that many opportunities for the flat-road sprinters in this Tour, so again it will be Caleb Ewan, and Andr\u00e9 Greipel in the mix, although the hill close to the finish will favour all-rounders such as Elia Viviani.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/30/tour-de-france-2019-full-team-by-team-guide\">Tour de France 2019: full team-by-team guide</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Stage five, Wednesday 10 July, Saint-Di\u00e9-des-Vosges \u2013 Colmar, 175.5km</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/tdf_stage_5/giv-3902a0C0hvFhiwSt/\" data-alt=\"Stage 5\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/tdf_stage_5/giv-3902a0C0hvFhiwSt/\">Stage 5</a> </figure>  <p>Best described as Vosges-lite, skirting three sides of the massif with two second and two third category climbs to shake up the pack. There is a good chance that an early escape will stay away today as keeping a team chasing will be hard in the tough finale \u2013 two climbs in the final 35km \u2013 while behind the move the peloton will be whittled down to 30 or 40. A good day for a strong breakaway rider such as Thomas De Gendt or Matej Mohoric, one where the favourites will want to avoid losing time or expending too much energy, with day six in mind.</p> <h2>Stage six, Thursday July 11, Mulhouse \u2013 La Planche des Belles Filles, 160.5km</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/tdf_stage_6/giv-3902QoIg5lLvVsU5/\" data-alt=\"Stage 6\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/tdf_stage_6/giv-3902QoIg5lLvVsU5/\">Stage 6</a> </figure>  <p>Short and intense over four brutal climbs culminating with the ascent where Chris Froome won in 2012. The main action will come in the final 20km over the very narrow and steep Col des Chevr\u00e8res, which hits 18%, and the finish climb which goes to 20%. It\u2019s a typical first key day at the Tour: the time gaps should be a bit less than in other years as we are still in the opening week but the chances are only 10 or a dozen riders will be in with a shout after this one. Local boy Thibaut Pinot might be the best bet to win the stage and steal an early march.</p> <h2>Stage seven, Friday 12 July, Belfort \u2013 Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne, 230km</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/tdf_stage_7/giv-3902t8J6fNTS0xNW/\" data-alt=\"Stage 7\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/tdf_stage_7/giv-3902t8J6fNTS0xNW/\">Stage 7</a> </figure>  <p>The longest stage of the Tour follows one of the toughest, but will give the flat-road sprinters another chance. It\u2019s a hilly start, but a very flat run over the final 80km, plus there is a good chance that one of the favourites will have taken yellow the previous day which will lend some structure to the race. The pressure will be felt the most by the older sprinters, led by Andr\u00e9 Greipel, who moved to the small French team Ark\u00e9a-Samsic over the winter but hasn\u2019t produced much, and Cofidis\u2019s Nacer Bouhanni, who has never shone in the Tour.</p> <h2>Stage eight, Saturday 13 July, M\u00e2con \u2013 Saint \u00c9tienne, 200km</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/tdf_stage_8/giv-3902mUzFdcGYVxqg/\" data-alt=\"Stage 8\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/tdf_stage_8/giv-3902mUzFdcGYVxqg/\">Stage 8</a> </figure>  <p>Nowhere near as hard as La Planche des Belles Filles, but still one that will set alarm bells ringing. A string of small, technical climbs initially through the Beaujolais vineyards and later through the Monts du Lyonnais. This will be tricky to control, and the run-in to the final climb is technical.

      "bodyText": "Stage one, Saturday 6 July, Brussels \u2013 Brussels 194.5km The Tour starts with a loop southwards through Flanders into Wallonia and back, with two cobbled climbs celebrated as part of the Ronde van Vlaanderen, the Muur van Geraardsbergen and the Bosberg, and one stretch of pav\u00e9 near Charleroi. These all come too early to have any serious impact so the peloton will be jostling for a bunch sprint as they tackle a finale that includes the towns of Waterloo \u2013 a gift for the headline writers \u2013 and Woluwe-Saint-Pierre, childhood home of Eddy Merckx. Sprint favourites will include Caleb Ewan and Andr\u00e9 Greipel. Stage two, Sunday 7 July, team time trial, Brussels (Palais Royal) \u2013Brussels (Atomium) 27.6km Underlining Eddy Merckx\u2019s special status he has two stages coming through his manor in two days, so there is a second flying visit to Woluwe-Saint-Pierre during a team time trial entirely within Brussels and its suburbs. All the favourites will want to lay down a marker; if history is anything to go by, the smart money will be on Adam Yates\u2019s Mitchelton-Scott, winners (as Orica-Greenedge) in 2013; on current form Jumbo-Visma have been strong all year. The big pressure will be on Geraint Thomas\u2019s Ineos, who never landed a Tour team time trial during their years as Team Sky. Stage three, Monday 8 July, Binche \u2013 \u00c9pernay, 215km On the map, a long flattish stage heading south, with a routine bunch sprint, but there is a sting in the tail. It will be dead quiet as far as Reims, with an early break establishing itself, but the final 30km include three stiff third category climbs one after the other, with very little respite, before a final 500m at 8% to the finish. All of France will look to Julian Alaphilippe on a finish made for the world No 1 but all the favourites\u2019 nerves will be on edge with an intense battle for position. A classic day when at least one will lose the Tour. Stage four, Tuesday 9 July, Reims \u2013 Nancy, 213.5km A second long day in a row, but this one will end in a bunch sprint unless it rains and there is some action over the final climb, 15km from the finish. It\u2019s a typical first-week stage, largely main roads and the scenario should be classic: early break, late catch, scary sprint. There aren\u2019t that many opportunities for the flat-road sprinters in this Tour, so again it will be Caleb Ewan, and Andr\u00e9 Greipel in the mix, although the hill close to the finish will favour all-rounders such as Elia Viviani. Stage five, Wednesday 10 July, Saint-Di\u00e9-des-Vosges \u2013 Colmar, 175.5km Best described as Vosges-lite, skirting three sides of the massif with two second and two third category climbs to shake up the pack. There is a good chance that an early escape will stay away today as keeping a team chasing will be hard in the tough finale \u2013 two climbs in the final 35km \u2013 while behind the move the peloton will be whittled down to 30 or 40. A good day for a strong breakaway rider such as Thomas De Gendt or Matej Mohoric, one where the favourites will want to avoid losing time or expending too much energy, with day six in mind. Stage six, Thursday July 11, Mulhouse \u2013 La Planche des Belles Filles, 160.5km Short and intense over four brutal climbs culminating with the ascent where Chris Froome won in 2012. The main action will come in the final 20km over the very narrow and steep Col des Chevr\u00e8res, which hits 18%, and the finish climb which goes to 20%. It\u2019s a typical first key day at the Tour: the time gaps should be a bit less than in other years as we are still in the opening week but the chances are only 10 or a dozen riders will be in with a shout after this one. Local boy Thibaut Pinot might be the best bet to win the stage and steal an early march. Stage seven, Friday 12 July, Belfort \u2013 Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne, 230km The longest stage of the Tour follows one of the toughest, but will give the flat-road sprinters another chance. It\u2019s a hilly start, but a very flat run over the final 80km, plus there is a good chance that one of the favourites will have taken yellow the previous day which will lend some structure to the race. The pressure will be felt the most by the older sprinters, led by Andr\u00e9 Greipel, who moved to the small French team Ark\u00e9a-Samsic over the winter but hasn\u2019t produced much, and Cofidis\u2019s Nacer Bouhanni, who has never shone in the Tour. Stage eight, Saturday 13 July, M\u00e2con \u2013 Saint \u00c9tienne, 200km Nowhere near as hard as La Planche des Belles Filles, but still one that will set alarm bells ringing. A string of small, technical climbs initially through the Beaujolais vineyards and later through the Monts du Lyonnais. This will be tricky to control, and the run-in to the final climb is technical. Again, a stage where the Tour could be lost and a definite chance for an escape to stay away with the win going to a punchy rider such as Tony Gallopin, unless one of the outsiders for the overall win decides to stir up some trouble. Stage nine, Sunday 14 July, Saint-\u00c9tienne \u2013 Brioude, 170.5km A Bastille Day stage ending with a 30km loop through Romain Bardet country: no pressure for France\u2019s favourite then. There\u2019s a tough, steep first category climb early on, where the day\u2019s break should form, but even with a third category ascent during that final circuit around Brioude you should expect a bunch sprint, albeit probably for a group that\u2019s been reduced over the final climb and the windy roads around it. Perfect for a sprinter who can climb, such as the 2017 points winner Michael Matthews or Peter Sagan; the former world champion hasn\u2019t had a memorable year but this looks made for him. Stage 10, Monday 15 July, Saint-Flour \u2013 Albi, 217.5km Long and hot, a scenic beginning before a 30km descent off the Cantal plateau for the 10th day of racing in a row, with the first rest day 24 hours later than usual. The script of early breakaway, late catch, scary sprint should be followed, but most of the riders will be just making sure they drink enough. All eyes will be on whichever sprinter has hit form early on, as Marcel Kittel did in 2017 and Mark Cavendish did the year before. The hilly route of this year\u2019s first half of the Tour favours a lighter rider such as Elia Viviani who has a point to prove after a disappointing Giro. Stage 11, Wednesday 17 July, Albi \u2013 Toulouse, 167km An amuse-bouche before the serious general classification racing begins, this is a short and probably rapid sprint stage across the south of France with only an early third-category climb to trouble the sprinters. There will be a break, but there are only two more sprint stages after this, so the fastmen will want their teams to control the race. Mark Cavendish won here in 2008, but 11 years on his form this season has been dubious, so perhaps one of the new generation such as Sam Bennett or Pascal Ackermann? Stage 12, Thursday 18 July, Toulouse \u2013 Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre, 209.5km A relatively gentle introduction to the Pyrenees: two first category climbs with long run-in to the opener, the Col de Peyresourde. There is 130km for the break to build a lead so expect someone from the early move to win; the overall contenders may well end up watching each other for signs of weakness over the Peyresourde and Hourquette d\u2019Ancizan while saving strength for the coming days.

Stage 13, Friday 19 July, Pau \u2013 Pau individual time trial, 27.2km At least one or two of the favourites who are weaker time triallists should be effectively put out of the reckoning. Stage 14, Saturday 20 July, Tarbes \u2013 Col du Tourmalet, 117.5km Short and very sharp, with the Col du Soulor halfway through to sort the wheat from the chaff, and the finish atop one of the longest and hardest climbs in the Pyrenees. The Tourmalet is not l\u2019Alpe d\u2019Huez, however, being wider, straighter and more reasonably graded. There will be time gaps, but perhaps not as cataclysmic as might be seen at a steeper finish. A favourite should win this, and it suits a climber who can use race skills to win rather than simply burning off the opposition - someone with the profile of Adam Yates, Thibaut Pinot or Geraint Thomas. Stage 15, Sunday 21 July, Limoux \u2013 Foix-Prat d\u2019Albis, 185km A second summit finish in a row, and a different proposition with two first category mountain passes beforehand, both short and brutally steep, as is the ascent to the chequered flag. A pure climber\u2019s stage, a target for a rider who is going for the mountains jersey, with lots of points available on the three first cat climbs in quick succession: Julian Alaphilippe springs to mind. There should be a straightforward selection among the yellow jersey contenders who should be down to a handful by now. It\u2019s the kind of stage that screams Egan Bernal or Nairo Quintana. Stage 16, Tuesday 23 July, N\u00eemes \u2013 N\u00eemes, 177km It\u2019s six days since the last sprint stage and much will depend on how the heavier brethren have survived the Pyrenees, which sprinters are still there and which of their lead-out men. Following the rest day, a second day\u2019s respite for the overall contenders, as long as the weather plays ball and there is no wind or rain. This stage is out and home rather than the usual place to place so the changes of direction could make for an gruesome day if there is a strong northerly, as we saw in this area in 2016.

The finish could go to a rider from the break or a sprinter who can climb such Peter Sagan. Stage 18, Thursday 25 July, Embrun \u2013 Valloire, 208km Northwards through the Alps for six hours over three of the Tour\u2019s greatest climbs, the Cols de Vars, Izoard and Galibier, all over 2,000m high, with the Galibier topping out on a moonscape at 2,675m. The descent to Valloire is short and initially technical, so there is little hope of regaining much time lost on the climb. The race for the overall will be down to three or four at most by now, and for a stage winner you are looking at a climber who can descend. Stage 19, Friday 26 July, Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne \u2013 Tignes, 126.5km Uphill for the first (gulp) 89km, this stage is about one climb, the Col de l\u2019Is\u00e9ran, the \u201croof of the Tour\u201d at 2,770m above sea level. It\u2019s rarely used in the race, and still less frequently at the key point in a stage.

Egan Bernal might be the best candidate depending on Ineos\u2019s tactics. Stage 20, Saturday 27 July, Albertville \u2013 Val Thorens, 130km A third successive day with a substantial portion above 2,000m, with the thin air a likely factor at the final summit finish. Val Thorens is long and evenly graded (5.5% average) so a team that gets there with numbers \u2013 say three or four riders \u2013 can control the race. The only hope for those who want to break things up is to go flat out early on up the Cormet de Roselend. The climbers who have dominated the last few days will fight out this stage win. Stage 21, Sunday 28 July, Rambouillet \u2013 Paris Champs Elys\u00e9es, 128km The demands of television are making it harder and harder for \u201caway fans\u201d to watch the final stage of the Tour in Paris and then get home on the same day. Time was, the Tour finished about 5pm, but this year the race will break ground by closing at 9.30pm, with the start at roughly the time most Parisians are contemplating their dinner. \u201cDemi-nocturne\u201d racing like this is dependent on dry weather: any rain could make the laps of the Champs a dangerous washout. As for a winner, it will be a sprinter, and it\u2019s time a Frenchman won here again.",

But in MLS the manner of travel rather than the travel itself has become a talking point. While NBA, NHL, MLB and NFL players journey cross-country in comfort and luxury on private jets and charter flights, MLS\u2019s stars are more often than not forced to fly commercially, complete with layovers and connecting flights.</p> <p>League rules stipulate that teams can only charter flights for four travel legs, not even four games, per season. Extraordinary circumstances, like cancelled flights, extreme weather or a lack of suitable commercial options, are accounted for, but in effect this means MLS players can only travel like their other major league peers for two games (outgoing and return) in a season that can stretch to 40 games.</p> <p>This has become a discussion point unique to MLS. Fans of other leagues rarely give much thought to how teams travel to games, but in North American soccer it is a topic of much debate, to such an extent that the subject is expected to be raised in future Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) talks with the league. \u201cWith a CBA you\u2019re talking about investment in a wide variety of areas including player compensation,\u201d says MLS president Mark Abbott. \u201cSo the question is what\u2019s the right balance between investment in player compensation and investment in charter travel?</p> <p>Nonetheless, some players have voiced their displeasure at the current arrangement. \u201cShould\u2019ve flown out of Vancouver last night after early kickoff,\u201d Alejandro Bedoya tweeted after a Philadelphia Union game earlier this season. \u201cInstead, we wake up at 4:45 am, spend all day in airports (connect in Toronto) &amp; on airplanes w/ no legroom cross country, and just finally landed back in Philly.\u201d He sarcastically concluded, \u201cwhat a great recovery day,\u201d punctuated with a facepalm emoji for good measure.</p> <p>Bedoya fleshed out his criticism the following day. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s just so frustrating,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThis is not a Philly issue, this is a league-wide issue. I\u2019m speaking on behalf of all the players in the league. I put that out there and I got messages from players on all different teams laughing with me and telling me I\u2019m so right.\u201d</p> <p>Such comments feed into a wider debate that MLS is being held back by its own structure. This is a discussion that covers topics from promotion-relegation to the salary cap and Designated Player rule, but also encompasses the discourse around charter travel and the way the league\u2019s players are treated. Primarily, it\u2019s not about the comfort of travelling teams, but ensuring players can produce their best.</p> <p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single player in MLS who doesn\u2019t think the league should do better when it comes to charter flights and travel,\u201d says Bob Foose, the executive director of the MLS Players Association. \u201cWe view charter flights the same way that we view top-level training facilities, which are not typically a CBA issue. If the league truly aspire to become a league of choice, it must eliminate most, if not all, commercial flights for players.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/05/portland-timbers-jeremy-ebobisse-whats-going-on-in-america-now-is-shocking\">Portland Timbers' Jeremy Ebobisse: 'What's going on in America now is shocking'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that it was only around three decades ago that NBA teams started to fly charter, underlining the argument that MLS is still in its early years. For comparison, the average value of an NBA franchise currently stands at $1.35bn while the average MLS team is worth $240m. That disparity is the main reason why NBA players fly charter and MLS players don\u2019t.</p> <p>Abbott also points out that charter flights are just one way of mitigating travel time. \u201cLook at what we have done with our schedule so that when people travel across the country we try and have them play more than one game so that the travel is minimised as a result of that,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou now play more games against your regional rivals or clubs in your conference which also minimises travel.\u201d</p> <p>Much of the debate is down to perception, but it is something that clearly matters to players. Indeed, the thought of a global star like Zlatan Ibrahimovic sat in a departure lounge on a layover seems a little ridiculous, almost a throwback to the NASL days when Pele was forced to play on substandard fields literally painted green. There is a disconnect between the stature of such superstars being lured to the league and the travel arrangements made for them.</p> <p>In other leagues in other countries, travel is something barely afforded a thought. It is an unsexy logistical concern given as much coverage as the washing of kits or the printing of tickets. Not many leagues cover such a huge area, though. All debate and discussion around a lack of charter travel stems from this.</p> <p>Charter flights are expensive and not always easy to book - American Airlines pulled out of an agreement to provide six NFL teams with charter service for the 2017 season due to shifting trends in the aviation industry. Abbott is right to point out that there are more pressing concerns for MLS to address. And yet there remains turbulence around the issue.</p>",

Nonetheless, some players have voiced their displeasure at the current arrangement. \u201cShould\u2019ve flown out of Vancouver last night after early kickoff,\u201d Alejandro Bedoya tweeted after a Philadelphia Union game earlier this season. \u201cInstead, we wake up at 4:45 am, spend all day in airports (connect in Toronto) &amp; on airplanes w/ no legroom cross country, and just finally landed back in Philly.\u201d He sarcastically concluded, \u201cwhat a great recovery day,\u201d punctuated with a facepalm emoji for good measure. Bedoya fleshed out his criticism the following day. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s just so frustrating,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThis is not a Philly issue, this is a league-wide issue. I\u2019m speaking on behalf of all the players in the league. I put that out there and I got messages from players on all different teams laughing with me and telling me I\u2019m so right.\u201d Such comments feed into a wider debate that MLS is being held back by its own structure. This is a discussion that covers topics from promotion-relegation to the salary cap and Designated Player rule, but also encompasses the discourse around charter travel and the way the league\u2019s players are treated. Primarily, it\u2019s not about the comfort of travelling teams, but ensuring players can produce their best. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a single player in MLS who doesn\u2019t think the league should do better when it comes to charter flights and travel,\u201d says Bob Foose, the executive director of the MLS Players Association. \u201cWe view charter flights the same way that we view top-level training facilities, which are not typically a CBA issue. If the league truly aspire to become a league of choice, it must eliminate most, if not all, commercial flights for players.\u201d It\u2019s worth pointing out that it was only around three decades ago that NBA teams started to fly charter, underlining the argument that MLS is still in its early years. For comparison, the average value of an NBA franchise currently stands at $1.35bn while the average MLS team is worth $240m. That disparity is the main reason why NBA players fly charter and MLS players don\u2019t. Abbott also points out that charter flights are just one way of mitigating travel time. \u201cLook at what we have done with our schedule so that when people travel across the country we try and have them play more than one game so that the travel is minimised as a result of that,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou now play more games against your regional rivals or clubs in your conference which also minimises travel.\u201d Much of the debate is down to perception, but it is something that clearly matters to players. Indeed, the thought of a global star like Zlatan Ibrahimovic sat in a departure lounge on a layover seems a little ridiculous, almost a throwback to the NASL days when Pele was forced to play on substandard fields literally painted green. There is a disconnect between the stature of such superstars being lured to the league and the travel arrangements made for them. In other leagues in other countries, travel is something barely afforded a thought. It is an unsexy logistical concern given as much coverage as the washing of kits or the printing of tickets. Not many leagues cover such a huge area, though. All debate and discussion around a lack of charter travel stems from this. Charter flights are expensive and not always easy to book - American Airlines pulled out of an agreement to provide six NFL teams with charter service for the 2017 season due to shifting trends in the aviation industry. Abbott is right to point out that there are more pressing concerns for MLS to address. And yet there remains turbulence around the issue.",

      "bodyText": "Consumers are now able to switch their mobile phone provider simply by sending a text message \u2013 avoiding the cumbersome process which had been in place previously. The new rules from the regulator Ofcom apply from Monday and are aimed at making it quicker and easier to leave one provider and start with another. The move comes after many consumers find switching difficult, as it requires requesting a PAC code from their provider. According to Ofcom, many people become frustrated when their provider attempts to make them stay. Almost half of those who chose not to switch said the process was too time-consuming, while a slightly lower number were put off by having to contact multiple providers. Under the new \u201ctext-to-switch\u201d process, consumers text PAC to a number, after which the code is sent back. The code is valid for 30 days. The response from the provider will also need to include details of early termination charges or pay-as-you-go credit balances. The consumer can them pass the number on to their new provider. The service is switched within one working day. \u201cThe new process is designed to be quick and easy, so customers could request their code while looking for a new deal \u2013 for example, while on the phone to a new provider, or in store,\u201d says Ofcom. Consumers have also sometimes encountered difficulties in paying both their old and their new provider at the same time when switching. Ofcom has now banned mobile providers from charging for notice periods running after the switch date. Ofcom estimates this will result in savings to the consumer of \u00a310m a year. The move comes as part of a push by the regulator to make life easier for people dealing with their communications. Under the new rules, providers will have to publish clear guidance to help customers follow the new process, as a result making better switching decisions.",

This streak of green in arid northern Chile wiggles inland from the Pacific near the nation\u2019s second-oldest city, La Serena. Historically the domain of agriculturists, it\u2019s now increasingly visited by people with a different profession: astronomy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jun/2019-06-28T13:55:35.html\" data-alt=\"Chile map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jun/2019-06-28T13:55:35.html\">Chile map</a> </figure>  <p>By 2020, this grape-filled valley (along with the greater Atacama desert) will have an estimated <a href=\"https://www.chiletoday.cl/chile-the-worlds-astronomy-capital-what-else-is-out-there/\" title=\"\">70% of the world\u2019s astronomy infrastructure</a>, thanks to its high altitudes, low population density and near non-existent cloud cover. As more scientists move to Elqui\u2019s space-age facilities so do everyday astro-tourists in the hope of gazing at the heavens.</p> <p>The International Dark-Sky Association declared Elqui valley the <a href=\"https://www.darksky.org/chilean-astronomical-site-becomes-worlds-first-international-dark-sky-sanctuary/\" title=\"\">world\u2019s first International Dark Sky Sanctuary in 2015</a> due to the unrivalled purity of its skies.

In La Serena, the city\u2019s pastel-coloured centre hints of earlier, colonial times, when this was one of the most important ports on South America\u2019s Pacific coast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b00f47a719578c7b0cf0709c097abb11546c53d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b00f47a719578c7b0cf0709c097abb11546c53d4/0_296_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vineyards in the Elqui valley, Vicuna, Region de Coquimbo, Chile.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vineyards in the Elqui valley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course this area\u2019s history predates the arrival of Spaniards in the 1540s. On the way out of town, my guide, Crist\u00f3bal Vergara of Turismo Tembeta, pointed to the ruins of a small Inca citadel sitting atop a peanut-coloured hill.</p> <p>Just after the town of El Molle, we passed the teal blue Puclaro reservoir, an artificial lake created in 2000 by damming the Elqui river. Soon after we spotted a series of alien-looking objects on the hilltops of the pre-Andes range. These shiny metallic orbs \u2013 observatories for visiting scientists \u2013 glistened like 21st-century remakes of that earlier Inca relic.</p> <p>We saw the Gemini South and Cerro Tololo Inter-American observatories, both operated in partnership with American organisations. Crist\u00f3bal pointed to another, the Large Synoptic Survey telescope, and told me the future of astronomy is on the horizon: \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re moving from the bronze age into the iron age.\u201d </p> <p>This wide-field survey reflecting telescope has an 8.40-metre primary mirror (the world\u2019s largest digital camera) and will photograph all the available area of sky every few nights when it opens in 2022.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94df921cfef22c8907d8a13404f04876ada0c2ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94df921cfef22c8907d8a13404f04876ada0c2ac/0_360_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cerro Tololo Inter-American observatory, Chile.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cerro Tololo Inter-American observatory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Bramich/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Elqui valley opens up near its largest city, Vicu\u00f1a, where we stopped for lunch at <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://www.turismovicuna.cl/item/delicias-del-sol-de-villaseca/&amp;prev=search\" title=\"\">Delicias del Sol Villaseca</a>. This restaurant, run by an association of 25 local women, specialises in cooking in what are described as solar ovens (glass-topped boxes with reflecting flaps). I ordered the house speciality: stewed goat, slow-cooked under the morning sun.</p> <p>We moved on to the nearby adobe village of Diaguitas to cap off the meal with a beer at <a href=\"https://guayacan.cl/\" title=\"\">Cervecer\u00eda Guayac\u00e1n</a>, a craft brewery that derives 70% of its electricity from solar panels. Of the nine beers on tap, I opted for the strong ale brewed with <em>cha\u00f1ar</em>, a shrub with edible berries, that Crist\u00f3bal described as \u201cthe <em>dulce de leche</em> of the desert\u201d, thanks to its caramel taste and creamy texture.</p> <p>Over beers on the shady terrace, Crist\u00f3bal told me how this valley became famous for the valour of its soldiers during the War of the Pacific in the late 19th century, in which Chile gained much of the Atacama desert (and its vast mineral wealth) from Peru and Bolivia. These men had one big advantage over their compatriots: an endless supply of the locally brewed grape brandy, pisco. Crist\u00f3bal suggested we head deeper into the valley to taste test the drink that fuelled these legendary soldiers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2f674a6032dbb1f0b189a20feea28565732b6b24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f674a6032dbb1f0b189a20feea28565732b6b24/0_344_5117_3071/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The night sky at Pisco Elqui, Chile.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The night sky at Pisco Elqui.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We saw sun-bleached hills and a startlingly green valley floor lined with the vineyards of Chile\u2019s top pisco distillers as we moved inland towards the town of Pisco Elqui. Just off its main plaza is <a href=\"http://www.destileriapiscomistral.cl/\" title=\"\">Destiler\u00eda Pisco Mistral</a>, which takes its name from the valley\u2019s most famous resident, Gabriela Mistral, who was raised in the nearby village of Montegrande and in 1945 was the first Latin American author to receive a Nobel Prize in Literature.</p> <p>Pisco is most often used to make the frothy national cocktail, pisco sour, a mix of lime juice, sugar, egg white and ice. I had my first sour of the day in the distillery\u2019s succulent-filled gardens and downed my second nearby at <a href=\"http://milodge.com/elqui-domos/hotel-y-servicios/\" title=\"\">Elqui Domos</a>, a glamping retreat whose geodesic domes (from \u00a375) have retractable roofs for stargazing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"360b65cfef492bc582cb3def5e02de112bb47ac2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/360b65cfef492bc582cb3def5e02de112bb47ac2/0_25_800_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"Elqui Domos, Chile, at night.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elqui Domos</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elqui Domos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After a long night in search of globular clusters and planetary nebulae \u2013 both with a guide at the onsite observatory and on my own from the comfort of my desert dome \u2013 I met up with Crist\u00f3bal the next morning to continue our journey. The valley forks near Pisco Elqui and we had two options: continue straight toward the high-Andean community of Alcohuaz or turn east toward for the new-age draw of Cochiguaz.</p> <p>Crist\u00f3bal said the latter was a place associated with cults and UFO sightings. I opted for Alcohuaz, though it seems both places share an affinity for mysticism \u2013 there were dusty gem shops, meditation centres and self-proclaimed healers hawking dubious bee-venom therapies. But the star attraction at the end of the Elqui valley has to be the avant-garde wine project <a href=\"http://www.vdalcohuaz.cl/en/home-eng/\" title=\"\">Vi\u00f1edos de Alcohuaz</a>.</p> <p>Wine-maker Marcelo Retamal\u2019s experimental vineyard, which opened to tourists this year, plants rare-in-Chile varietals, such as garnacha and petite sirah, at 1,650 to 2,200 metres above sea level, making these some of the highest-grown grapes in the world. The initial pressing of the fruit is done by the ancient grape-treading technique, before the wine is aged in oval casks, mostly for high-end blends.</p> <p>The soil in Alcohuaz is riddled with so much quartz that it shimmers by day and shines under the moonlight. Project manager Juan Luis Huerta, a former pisco producer, told me the quartz has mystical powers.</p> <p>\u201cDo you believe in the energy of the Earth?\u201d he asked, leading me to a large circular symbol made of quartz in the middle of the vines. He found it here before planting began in 2005, and said strange things happen in its presence. His phone loses signal, his skin tingles, the closest vines don\u2019t change colour in autumn \u2026</p> <p>It was yet another reminder that there\u2019s something incomprehensible about this otherworldly valley.</p> <p>We capped off our trip back in Vicu\u00f1a with a drive up the barren valley to the tourist-friendly <a href=\"https://observatoriodelpangue.blogspot.com/\" title=\"\">Observatorio del Pangue</a>, whose telescope with 25 inches of aperture is the best a layman can lay their eyes on. The observatory (tours from \u00a330) is in a Martian-like landscape at an altitude of 1,500 metres. Up here, halfway to the heavens, the stars feel incredibly close.</p> <p>Two hours went by as we twisted the massive instrument across the sky in search of foreign objects, including the red-glowing Betelgeuse star and wispy Tarantula Nebula. Each pinhole view was more kaleidoscopic than the previous one.</p> <p>Maybe it\u2019s the unfathomable mysteries of Elqui\u2019s night sky that make energy vortexes and UFOs seem more fact than fiction here. Perhaps it\u2019s the blinding sunshine and ample libations that cause people to dream big and fight hard. There\u2019s certainly a tangible connection between earth and sky, which is why an event such as this week\u2019s eclipse has the Elqui valley pulsating.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The trip was provided by <a href=\"http://www.tembeta.cl/\" title=\"\">Tembeta</a>.

      "bodyText": "The Atacama desert may be the driest non-polar place on Earth but on its southern fringe is a stretch of vineyard-lined hills \u2013 the Elqui valley. This streak of green in arid northern Chile wiggles inland from the Pacific near the nation\u2019s second-oldest city, La Serena. Historically the domain of agriculturists, it\u2019s now increasingly visited by people with a different profession: astronomy. By 2020, this grape-filled valley (along with the greater Atacama desert) will have an estimated 70% of the world\u2019s astronomy infrastructure, thanks to its high altitudes, low population density and near non-existent cloud cover. As more scientists move to Elqui\u2019s space-age facilities so do everyday astro-tourists in the hope of gazing at the heavens. The International Dark-Sky Association declared Elqui valley the world\u2019s first International Dark Sky Sanctuary in 2015 due to the unrivalled purity of its skies. On 2 July 2019, the same cloudless sky that makes Elqui ideal for stargazing will be all but guaranteed when the moon blocks out the sun to create a total solar eclipse. To tour the Elqui valley ahead of its moment in a dark spotlight I travelled from the Chilean capital Santiago to La Serena (it\u2019s possible to take a bus, fly or drive). In La Serena, the city\u2019s pastel-coloured centre hints of earlier, colonial times, when this was one of the most important ports on South America\u2019s Pacific coast. Of course this area\u2019s history predates the arrival of Spaniards in the 1540s. On the way out of town, my guide, Crist\u00f3bal Vergara of Turismo Tembeta, pointed to the ruins of a small Inca citadel sitting atop a peanut-coloured hill. Just after the town of El Molle, we passed the teal blue Puclaro reservoir, an artificial lake created in 2000 by damming the Elqui river. Soon after we spotted a series of alien-looking objects on the hilltops of the pre-Andes range. These shiny metallic orbs \u2013 observatories for visiting scientists \u2013 glistened like 21st-century remakes of that earlier Inca relic. We saw the Gemini South and Cerro Tololo Inter-American observatories, both operated in partnership with American organisations. Crist\u00f3bal pointed to another, the Large Synoptic Survey telescope, and told me the future of astronomy is on the horizon: \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re moving from the bronze age into the iron age.\u201d This wide-field survey reflecting telescope has an 8.40-metre primary mirror (the world\u2019s largest digital camera) and will photograph all the available area of sky every few nights when it opens in 2022. The Elqui valley opens up near its largest city, Vicu\u00f1a, where we stopped for lunch at Delicias del Sol Villaseca. This restaurant, run by an association of 25 local women, specialises in cooking in what are described as solar ovens (glass-topped boxes with reflecting flaps). I ordered the house speciality: stewed goat, slow-cooked under the morning sun. We moved on to the nearby adobe village of Diaguitas to cap off the meal with a beer at Cervecer\u00eda Guayac\u00e1n, a craft brewery that derives 70% of its electricity from solar panels. Of the nine beers on tap, I opted for the strong ale brewed with cha\u00f1ar, a shrub with edible berries, that Crist\u00f3bal described as \u201cthe dulce de leche of the desert\u201d, thanks to its caramel taste and creamy texture. Over beers on the shady terrace, Crist\u00f3bal told me how this valley became famous for the valour of its soldiers during the War of the Pacific in the late 19th century, in which Chile gained much of the Atacama desert (and its vast mineral wealth) from Peru and Bolivia. These men had one big advantage over their compatriots: an endless supply of the locally brewed grape brandy, pisco. Crist\u00f3bal suggested we head deeper into the valley to taste test the drink that fuelled these legendary soldiers. We saw sun-bleached hills and a startlingly green valley floor lined with the vineyards of Chile\u2019s top pisco distillers as we moved inland towards the town of Pisco Elqui. Just off its main plaza is Destiler\u00eda Pisco Mistral, which takes its name from the valley\u2019s most famous resident, Gabriela Mistral, who was raised in the nearby village of Montegrande and in 1945 was the first Latin American author to receive a Nobel Prize in Literature. Pisco is most often used to make the frothy national cocktail, pisco sour, a mix of lime juice, sugar, egg white and ice. I had my first sour of the day in the distillery\u2019s succulent-filled gardens and downed my second nearby at Elqui Domos, a glamping retreat whose geodesic domes (from \u00a375) have retractable roofs for stargazing. After a long night in search of globular clusters and planetary nebulae \u2013 both with a guide at the onsite observatory and on my own from the comfort of my desert dome \u2013 I met up with Crist\u00f3bal the next morning to continue our journey. The valley forks near Pisco Elqui and we had two options: continue straight toward the high-Andean community of Alcohuaz or turn east toward for the new-age draw of Cochiguaz. Crist\u00f3bal said the latter was a place associated with cults and UFO sightings. I opted for Alcohuaz, though it seems both places share an affinity for mysticism \u2013 there were dusty gem shops, meditation centres and self-proclaimed healers hawking dubious bee-venom therapies. But the star attraction at the end of the Elqui valley has to be the avant-garde wine project Vi\u00f1edos de Alcohuaz. Wine-maker Marcelo Retamal\u2019s experimental vineyard, which opened to tourists this year, plants rare-in-Chile varietals, such as garnacha and petite sirah, at 1,650 to 2,200 metres above sea level, making these some of the highest-grown grapes in the world. The initial pressing of the fruit is done by the ancient grape-treading technique, before the wine is aged in oval casks, mostly for high-end blends. The soil in Alcohuaz is riddled with so much quartz that it shimmers by day and shines under the moonlight. Project manager Juan Luis Huerta, a former pisco producer, told me the quartz has mystical powers. \u201cDo you believe in the energy of the Earth?\u201d he asked, leading me to a large circular symbol made of quartz in the middle of the vines. He found it here before planting began in 2005, and said strange things happen in its presence. His phone loses signal, his skin tingles, the closest vines don\u2019t change colour in autumn \u2026 It was yet another reminder that there\u2019s something incomprehensible about this otherworldly valley. We capped off our trip back in Vicu\u00f1a with a drive up the barren valley to the tourist-friendly Observatorio del Pangue, whose telescope with 25 inches of aperture is the best a layman can lay their eyes on. The observatory (tours from \u00a330) is in a Martian-like landscape at an altitude of 1,500 metres. Up here, halfway to the heavens, the stars feel incredibly close. Two hours went by as we twisted the massive instrument across the sky in search of foreign objects, including the red-glowing Betelgeuse star and wispy Tarantula Nebula. Each pinhole view was more kaleidoscopic than the previous one. Maybe it\u2019s the unfathomable mysteries of Elqui\u2019s night sky that make energy vortexes and UFOs seem more fact than fiction here. Perhaps it\u2019s the blinding sunshine and ample libations that cause people to dream big and fight hard. There\u2019s certainly a tangible connection between earth and sky, which is why an event such as this week\u2019s eclipse has the Elqui valley pulsating. \u2022 The trip was provided by Tembeta. Its two-day tours of La Serena and the Elqui valley cost from \u00a3190, including accommodation and stargazing. Flights from Santiago to La Serena were provided by LATAM. A roundtrip from Heathrow to La Serena (via Santiago) starts from \u00a3800 \u2022 This article was amended on 1 July. You can not take the train between Santiago and La Serena as originally stated.

Yet society seems to have grown comfortable with there being no cure. Perhaps this is because we have been searching for the wrong type of answer, in the wrong place.</p> <p>I should begin by briefly explaining my own experience of chronic pain and what, seemingly against the odds, has helped me find relief.</p> <p>After graduating from university last summer, I suffered a repetitive strain injury in both hands while doing a temporary office job. I stopped being able to work and had to put on hold my pursuit of a career in writing. I couldn\u2019t use a computer, write with a pen or even eat with a knife and fork without severe pain.

Acute pain is a helpful process that occurs when there is an injury or illness. It gradually decreases and dissipates once healing is complete.

What this tells us is that the driving force behind it is the brain.</p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s \u201call in the mind\u201d. Far from it. Chronic pain is associated with physical changes in the brain at the cortical level. These changes can produce something called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.painscience.com/articles/central-sensitization.php\" title=\"\">central sensitisation</a>\u201d \u2013 where the nervous system goes into overdrive and previously normal sensations generate intense pain. A whole vocabulary goes along with this: allodynia is the term for when non-harmful stimuli, such as a light touch, results in pain. In hyperalgesia, harmful stimuli produce heightened or prolonged pain.</p> <p>Why do some people experience chronic pain? We don\u2019t know for sure, but studies <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4924545/\" title=\"\">show</a> that particular psychological and personality traits are risk factors for chronic pain conditions. Some vulnerable individuals, they suggest, learn to filter emotions and actions \u201cthrough the lens of pain\u201d. An interplay between early lifetime and environmental and epigenetic factors appears to be at work. </p> <p>So our emotional lives can have a real-world effect, in terms of changes to the brain and increased pain.

      "bodyText": "Chronic pain is an ongoing epidemic. It debilitates around 28 million adults in the UK alone. Yet society seems to have grown comfortable with there being no cure. Perhaps this is because we have been searching for the wrong type of answer, in the wrong place. I should begin by briefly explaining my own experience of chronic pain and what, seemingly against the odds, has helped me find relief. After graduating from university last summer, I suffered a repetitive strain injury in both hands while doing a temporary office job. I stopped being able to work and had to put on hold my pursuit of a career in writing. I couldn\u2019t use a computer, write with a pen or even eat with a knife and fork without severe pain. I underwent months of physiotherapy. This helped build my confidence slightly, but the pain continued. I was repeatedly told that I needed to change my posture including how I sat, stood, walked and slept. As a result, I became hyperaware of my body. The pain began to spread to my neck and arm. Diagnoses including scoliosis, carpal tunnel syndrome, thoracic outlet syndrome and pinched nerves were proffered and I was given exercise after exercise while receiving conflicting medical advice. The problem was affecting every part of my life and I needed to find answers. Strange as it might sound, I wanted there to be something wrong so that the pain I was experiencing would be recognised and, hopefully, treated. I had tests done for various diseases, and to detect muscle or nerve damage, but nothing was found. Confused looks on the faces of the medical professionals I saw only increased my own emerging self-doubt. Eventually, I was told that I had chronic pain, that there wasn\u2019t a cure and I would have to learn to manage and not aggravate it. This was deeply depressing, not only because I wanted to be able to write. As anyone who suffers from ongoing pain anywhere in the body knows, it can make even the most basic daily tasks a huge challenge.

We live in a consumer culture. But there\u2019s plenty of information in books and YouTube videos to learn how to make all these things yourself.

It\u2019s not surprising that ideas are proliferating at a time when people\u2019s lives are really uncertain. We are living in an increasingly fragmented and individualised world, which means we are more responsible for our own wellbeing.\u201d Of course, she says, \u201cwe have a free market that recognises that there\u2019s financial value in it, too.

The danger is when there\u2019s no awareness by these brands that they are still taking natural resources, like minerals from the earth, and they shouldn\u2019t just be blindly consumed. We need to start asking ourselves: is this really what I need \u2013 or am I just consuming because I need to consume this thing?\u201d Kindred agrees but is keen to stress that healing doesn\u2019t have to cost much at all, nor do remedies from such UK native herbs as lemonbalm take much toll on the Earth. \u201cLook, if you\u2019ve got the money, you spend the money on that level. We live in a consumer culture. But there\u2019s plenty of information in books and YouTube videos to learn how to make all these things yourself. At the absolute simplest level, it\u2019s about making a tea with herbs or dabbing them on your skin.\u201d None of this is new, of course. In fact, most of it is very old. \u201cThe British festival scene is deeply rooted in paganism,\u201d says Prof Lucy Robinson, a historian at the University of Sussex. \u201cEngland has a long history of spirituality and engaging with alternative folklore practices, particularly in times of crisis. After the first and second world wars, these alternative, mind and body spirit practices became really important.\u201d She says moments of upheaval \u2013 the climate emergency, Trump, Brexit \u2013 \u201c lead to people criticising the existing structures, challenging their ability to provide. It\u2019s not surprising that ideas are proliferating at a time when people\u2019s lives are really uncertain. We are living in an increasingly fragmented and individualised world, which means we are more responsible for our own wellbeing.\u201d Of course, she says, \u201cwe have a free market that recognises that there\u2019s financial value in it, too. Try avoiding mindfulness at the moment \u2013 it\u2019s impossible!\u201d There is a lot of talk in the field about an \u201cawakening\u201d \u2013 a growing awareness that things need to change. \u201cThe world is all going tits up,\u201d says the spiritual healer Jen McCarty \u201cand people are waking up.\u201d McCarty first came to this field 20 years ago and never really left. \u201cI was living in London and I had this awakening behind a tipi. I left my life behind and moved to Glastonbury village.\u201d Paltrow and the wellness industry may well have penetrated the mainstream, but here, making small differences is still seen as key. \u201cWe are working within a capitalist system,\u201d says Bruzzone. \u201cIt\u2019s about doing what you do because you believe it makes a difference, to take only what you need, and not do it just for the sake of profit.\u201d As I walk out of the field, past the massage tents, head rubbers and singing groups, I think how much potential there still is in people helping each other \u2013 without even a sniff of Paltrow\u2019s \u00a367 calming crystal drinking straws.",

      "body": "<p>Friday afternoon at Worthy Farm and the sun is beating down with a ferocity that suggests it is trying to overcompensate for all the preceding years of sodden misery. Sheryl Crow \u2013 precisely the kind of slightly-past-their-sell-by-date artist who has led to suggestions that this year\u2019s Glastonbury bill is a little underwhelming \u2013 is rousing the wilting crowd at the Pyramid Stage in time-honoured style: by front-loading her set with big hits and making wink-wink, between-song references to unbridled hedonism. It appears to be working: the line in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=a-SaoaXfz6E\" title=\"\">All I Wanna Do</a> about liking a beer early in the morning is met with knowing cheers.</p> <p>You could also apply the past-her-sell-by label to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/28/lauryn-hill-at-glastonbury-2019-review-pyramid-stage\" title=\"\">Lauryn Hill</a>. This is, after all, a woman who has recently been celebrating the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of a debut solo album she never really bothered to follow up. But that doesn\u2019t seem to be reflected in the size of the crowd she draws, nor the curious air of prickly anticipation that attends her performance. She has what you might charitably describe as an erratic live reputation, and accordingly keeps the audience waiting: turning up onstage late, if at all, is very much her thing.</p> <p>Once there, Hill seems to spend the vast majority of her performance doing battle with the onstage sound. There is a lot of frantic gesticulating in the direction of her microphone, her earpiece and the monitor speakers. It lends everything she does a harassed air: her vocals are weirdly breathless and staccato, her backing singers required to do a lot of the heavy-lifting. The sense that you are watching someone who doesn\u2019t really want to be here only dissipates at the set\u2019s end when she performs The Fugees\u2019 chart-topping cover of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKOtzIo-uYw\" title=\"\">Killing Me Softly</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"756adafad104c397623fa40585bb26b6dc8a657f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/756adafad104c397623fa40585bb26b6dc8a657f/0_47_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lauryn Hill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lauryn Hill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, on The Park stage, Bristolian punks Idles are so overjoyed to be here that several members end their set in tears, following a series of impassioned speeches about the importance of Glastonbury in their lives. It is hard not to be swept along. Their sound is determinedly grimy and atonal, the lyrics bleak \u2013 \u201cMichael has got cancer in his nuts and in his brain\u201d \u2013 but it is also incredibly potent. The reason they have gone from being, as singer Joe Turner puts it, \u201ctold we\u2019re too fat, too old, too ugly and too stupid\u201d to a band with a passionate following.</p> <p>The notion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/29/stormzy-glastonbury-review-pyramid-stage\" title=\"\">Stormzy headlining the Pyramid Stage</a> is an intriguing one. It is not only that he is the first black British male performer to appear in that slot. An artist who has released only one album being elevated to such a rarefied status \u2013 up there with Jay-Z, Paul McCartney, U2 and the Rolling Stones \u2013 is unprecedented. Meanwhile, a persistent rumour on the site suggests his show has cost more to stage than any other in the festival\u2019s history. That may or may not be one of the myths that annually circulate Worthy Farm (festivalgoers old enough to remember Glastonbury before the internet and its fact-checking powers may recall the bizarre story in the early 90s that Cliff Richard had unexpectedly died). But within seconds of Stormzy\u2019s arrival, it seems pretty plausible: his set opens with the kind of pyrotechnics most artists use to conclude a performance, and it never really lets up.</p> <p>The sense of all the stops being pulled out is hard to miss. He might begin the set alone, with only his DJ, a Banksy-designed stab-proof vest with a Union Jack on it and an intense light show \u2013 complete with a ticker-tape flashing up the names of south London boroughs \u2013 for company, but it doesn\u2019t stay that way. There is a ballet interlude, designed to highlight the fact that BAME dancers now have shoes made in colours to match their skin tone. There is a vast gospel choir; there are dancers, complete with a small child busting moves; and there are kids on bikes popping wheelies around him as he performs Vossi Bop. Not for the first or last time over the weekend, there\u2019s an enthusiastic chant of \u201cFuck Boris\u201d, a cri de coeur that seems to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2017/jun/24/corbyn-receives-heros-welcome-at-glastonbury-2017-in-pictures\" title=\"\">this year\u2019s equivalent to 2017\u2019s singing \u201cWoah Jeremy Corbyn\u201d</a> to the tune of Seven Nation Army.</p> <p>There are also special guests. If Ed Sheeran can\u2019t be here in person, Chris Martin of Coldplay can, playing keyboards and harmonising on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxsjQ967kV8\" title=\"\">Blinded By Your Grace Part One</a>. A cynic might suggest that the extravagant presentation represents an attempt to bedazzle anyone who doesn\u2019t think the 25-year-old rapper has yet amassed enough material to fill a headlining set, but his performance doesn\u2019t feature the lulls you might expect from an artist without years of hits to draw on. Bulking his repertoire out with a cover of Shanks and Bigfoot\u2019s old UK garage hit Sweet Like Chocolate, and his remix of Ed Sheeran\u2019s Shape Of You, is an inspired move, but his own hits get the biggest response. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9e439a62bc76c802530151d667b08e1c6772a291\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e439a62bc76c802530151d667b08e1c6772a291/0_41_2974_1785/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stormzy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stormzy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Hall/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For all the eye-popping, larger-than-life visuals, there is something very human and moving at its centre. Stormzy seems genuinely overwhelmed by the sheer size of the crowd he has drawn \u2013 he says it is \u201cthe greatest night of my life\u201d. When another guest, fellow rapper Dave, congratulates him at length on his achievements, it doesn\u2019t feel like hyperbole. His performance seems not merely a personal triumph but a victory lap for British hip-hop. After decades as US rap\u2019s poor relation, here it is, topping the bill at the world\u2019s biggest music festival, and doing it in considerable style.</p> <p>Saturday morning arrives bearing the news that everyone from Adele to Jeremy Corbyn is raving about Stormzy on social media. It also brings The Proclaimers, belting out I\u2019m Gonna Be (500 Miles) from the Pyramid Stage to general delirium. Anyone in search of a less rousing start to the day could do worse than head up to The Park stage, where the Love Unlimited Synth Orchestra are working their way through Barry White\u2019s back catalogue with the aid of a succession of guest vocalists that range from Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys to deep house pioneer Larry Heard. It is a genuinely delightful performance that obliterates the aura of loverman naffness that still clings to White\u2019s name in some quarters, lovingly exploring the more recherch\u00e9 corners of his oeuvre alongside the big hits, reminding you what an extraordinary writer and producer White was: tense blaxploitation soundtrack material rubbing shoulders with the glorious euphoria of Under the Influence of Love and Love\u2019s Theme.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a65c0ef2763a24e27fbd04f32e436cfc7560b23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a65c0ef2763a24e27fbd04f32e436cfc7560b23/0_391_5966_3579/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Slowthai.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Slowthai.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a demonstration of UK hip-hop\u2019s breadth, you could do worse than compare Stormzy\u2019s set with Slowthai\u2019s arrival on the West Holts stage, wearing only his underpants and a pair of socks and once more offering the crowd the opportunity to shout \u201cFuck Boris\u201d. It\u2019s a gripping, gleefully chaotic performance that switches from raw-throated menace \u2013 his voice goes from Johnny Rotten-esque sneer to a frankly terrifying howl \u2013 to hilarious bedlam. The latter reaches a demented peak when he tries to arrange a circle pit in the middle of the audience. The crowd duly oblige, his hypeman climbs down from the stage and stands in its centre, goading fans into moshing: \u201cThis is not for the faint-hearted! Do or die! Melee! Melee!\u201d When one duly ensues, his hypeman suddenly changes his tune: \u201cI\u2019ve lost my shoe,\u201d he weakly protests, somewhere beneath a sea of flailing arms.</p> <p>By contrast, Janet Jackson offers super-slick professionalism. It feels as if she has parachuted in the show she has been performing in Vegas: no one loses a shoe and we are clearly in a \u201cFuck Boris\u201d-free zone. There\u2019s something so suspiciously perfect about her vocals to suggest they may be emanating from a tape somewhere offstage rather than her mouth \u2013 indeed, were she miming any more obviously, she would be dressed as Marcel Marceau and pretending to be trapped in a box. But it is hard to argue with such a bombardment of hits, the frequency of which leaves you reeling: Nasty, What Have You Done For Me Lately, The Best Things in Life Are Free.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5a0706defa1d7c3c884f8f3ecbb53c5fc5783407\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a0706defa1d7c3c884f8f3ecbb53c5fc5783407/0_86_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lizzo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lizzo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James McCauley/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is an imperious performance, but one that faces strong competition from Lizzo back at West Holts. Last time she performed at Glastonbury, she notes, about 20 people turned up to see her. Today, she estimates the vast crowd before her to number \u201c16 million thousand\u201d. Her rise from leftfield hip-hop cult figure to mainstream star has been accompanied by a lot of discussion about the serious issues her music raises: body positivity, self-love. You can understand why \u2013 you certainly don\u2019t want for motivational speeches between songs \u2013 but the earnest, eat-your-greens tone of the coverage obscures how much fun her music is. Her level of success comes down to tracks such as Juice being irresistible party music. Today, she chugs tequila from the bottle, plays the flute, twerks and leaves the stage to one of the most rapturous receptions of the weekend.</p> <p>The last time Liam Gallagher played Glastonbury, he was tentatively attempting to kickstart a post-Oasis career that had stalled. It was anything but a foregone conclusion that it would work, but two years and a platinum-selling solo album later, he has clearly succeeded, although he appears more concerned with the change in the weather at Worthy Farm than his fortunes: \u201cI\u2019m up here freezing my bollocks off,\u201d he protests, the sun having finally gone in. People are clearly drawn to him because they know what they\u2019re going to get \u2013 his sound and approach remains defiantly unchanged 26 years on from Oasis\u2019s debut single. But it is hard not to spot a certain disparity in the crowd\u2019s response: if he plays an Oasis track, there is singalong rapture; when he delves into his solo oeuvre, things get noticeably more muted. He is good at picking the former, sticking to tracks from Oasis\u2019s first two albums, and a finale of Champagne Supernova, dedicated to the late Keith Flint, is simultaneously euphoric and moving. But it is not quite the triumphant return he might have expected.</p> <p>Up next are the Killers who, like Stormzy, are subject to the Glastonbury rumour mill. This time, the gossip suggests they were the third choice for the Saturday night headline slot, two big heritage acts having turned it down. Certainly, they play like a band with something to prove. \u201cAt the end of this show, I don\u2019t want anyone to say: \u2018They got away with it,\u2019\u201d frontman Brandon Flowers offers early on. \u201cI want people to look up at this stage and say: \u2018Those are the sons of bitches that did it.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f206aa308f8ba3c1fd8dfaa6c5d95f2e54ee614\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f206aa308f8ba3c1fd8dfaa6c5d95f2e54ee614/0_135_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brandon Flowers and Johnny Marr.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brandon Flowers and Johnny Marr.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Loud</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed, if Flowers worked any harder to win over the crowd, he would have been down among them applying after-sun lotion and offering to pop to a stall to get Rizlas. Everything becomes an act of audience participation, up to and including counting in a song. He asks anxiously: \u201cAre we on the same page?\u201d He pretends to be overcome with emotion during a pause in Glamorous Indie Rock &amp; Roll, then slyly raises his eyebrows and beckons for more applause.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/01/tell-us-what-was-your-favourite-moment-from-glastonbury-2019\">Tell us: what was your favourite moment from Glastonbury 2019?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It works, aided by the fact that, for a band whose career has theoretically tailed off slightly since their multi-platinum-selling noughties, they have an impressive store of anthemic songs: Spaceman, Somebody Told Me, All These Things That I Have Done. The audience start singing along with the opening Jenny Was a Friend of Mine and forget to stop. By the time they bring out the Pet Shop Boys to perform Always on My Mind, and Johnny Marr to race through a version of the Smiths\u2019 This Charming Man, the deal is sealed. Their performance feels genuinely victorious.</p> <p>But the sight of Flowers, a noted Pet Shop Boys and Smiths obsessive, living out his dreams on stage provides something else: one of those elusive Glastonbury moments festivalgoers talk about so much, where the atmosphere and what is happening onstage collide to create something it is impossible to imagine happening anywhere else in the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b9411dce3d83c8475c136026057cb83c1fe8522d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9411dce3d83c8475c136026057cb83c1fe8522d/0_0_4500_2804/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miley Cyus performing on the Pyramid Stage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"623\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miley Cyus performing on the Pyramid Stage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Harvey/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sunday afternoon on Glastonbury\u2019s two main stages skews distinctly towards pop. The traditional Sunday \u201clegends\u201d slot is occupied by Kylie Minogue, who cries as she talks about having to pull out of the festival 14 years ago, after being diagnosed with breast cancer, but otherwise concerns herself with a Blitzkrieg of hits so unrelenting it makes Janet Jackson\u2019s performance the previous day look like an artist self-indulgently exploring the dustiest corners of their back catalogue. Nick Cave comes on stage for Where the Wild Roses Grow and they slow-dance together as they sing. She overhauls Slow, interpolating it with a distorted take on David Bowie\u2019s Fashion. Less successful is the appearance of Chris Martin, reducing her most famous song, Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head, to a slow-paced acoustic ballad. Perhaps the most striking thing about her set is the way she fires out one track after another from her Stock Aitken Waterman days \u2013 Shocked, Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi, I Should Be So Lucky \u2013 which acts as a reminder both how good the singles the reviled trio manufactured for her were and of how improbable Kylie Minogue drawing a potentially record-breaking crowd at Glastonbury would have seemed when they were riding high in the charts. Today it seems like a given, which is testimony to her ability to evolve and transcend the flimsy pop role originally sketched out for her.</p> <p>Miley Cyrus, meanwhile, brings out her dad, Billy Ray, and Lil Nas X to perform Old Town Road, a highlight of a thrillingly chaotic set, at odds with Kylie\u2019s glittery polish. She crawls around the stage, underlines her Nashville roots by covering godmother Dolly Parton, admits she was scared to perform after seeing the Killers and plays a track sung by the character she played in a recent episode of Black Mirror: it gradually degenerates into a punishing industrial noise cover of Nine Inch Nails. On one level, her performance is all over the place, but that\u2019s its appeal \u2013 there is something really gripping about the randomness of her approach to being a pop star. She has sufficient ballsy charisma to ensure it all just about hangs together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"83a4d166228b4d3f4ec8f4898b42ec238ec9a763\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83a4d166228b4d3f4ec8f4898b42ec238ec9a763/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Astonishingly commanding ..

Billie Eilish.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, over on the Other stage, the size of the crowd assembled to see Billie Eilish offers evidence of how her appeal has spread beyond her core audience of teenage girls. You can see why: coming on stage to a clattering din that sounds more like one of Throbbing Gristle\u2019s more recherche moments than anything to do with pop, clad in a smog mask and an oversized outfit decorated with Blue Meanies from the Beatles film, she is an idiosyncratic figure in a world that tends towards the cookie-cutter \u2013 and exceptionally good at what she does.</p> <p>Eilish, a teenager herself, makes music that obviously speaks to the kids who love her in a completely unmediated way: it sounds the way she looks in photos, glowering and sulky, as if about to start an argument \u2013 \u201cduh!\u201d huffs the hook-line of Bad Guy, while even a lambent piano ballad arrives prefaced with the words: \u201cIf you absolutely despise yourself, this one\u2019s for you.\u201d But it\u2019s also incredibly well-turned: the glammy stomp of Bury a Friend, the hip-hop by way of industrial grind of You Should See Me in a Crown. And, at 17, she\u2019s already an astonishingly commanding performer: she tells the audience to crouch down in the dust and they just do it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/01/the-cure-at-glastonbury-2019-review-still-the-worlds-most-reluctant-pop-stars\">Click here for Alexis\u2019s review of the Cure\u2019s Sunday headlining set. </a><br></p>",

Sheryl Crow \u2013 precisely the kind of slightly-past-their-sell-by-date artist who has led to suggestions that this year\u2019s Glastonbury bill is a little underwhelming \u2013 is rousing the wilting crowd at the Pyramid Stage in time-honoured style: by front-loading her set with big hits and making wink-wink, between-song references to unbridled hedonism. It appears to be working: the line in All I Wanna Do about liking a beer early in the morning is met with knowing cheers. You could also apply the past-her-sell-by label to Lauryn Hill. This is, after all, a woman who has recently been celebrating the 20th anniversary of a debut solo album she never really bothered to follow up. But that doesn\u2019t seem to be reflected in the size of the crowd she draws, nor the curious air of prickly anticipation that attends her performance. She has what you might charitably describe as an erratic live reputation, and accordingly keeps the audience waiting: turning up onstage late, if at all, is very much her thing. Once there, Hill seems to spend the vast majority of her performance doing battle with the onstage sound. There is a lot of frantic gesticulating in the direction of her microphone, her earpiece and the monitor speakers. It lends everything she does a harassed air: her vocals are weirdly breathless and staccato, her backing singers required to do a lot of the heavy-lifting. The sense that you are watching someone who doesn\u2019t really want to be here only dissipates at the set\u2019s end when she performs The Fugees\u2019 chart-topping cover of Killing Me Softly. Meanwhile, on The Park stage, Bristolian punks Idles are so overjoyed to be here that several members end their set in tears, following a series of impassioned speeches about the importance of Glastonbury in their lives. It is hard not to be swept along. Their sound is determinedly grimy and atonal, the lyrics bleak \u2013 \u201cMichael has got cancer in his nuts and in his brain\u201d \u2013 but it is also incredibly potent. The reason they have gone from being, as singer Joe Turner puts it, \u201ctold we\u2019re too fat, too old, too ugly and too stupid\u201d to a band with a passionate following. The notion of Stormzy headlining the Pyramid Stage is an intriguing one. It is not only that he is the first black British male performer to appear in that slot. An artist who has released only one album being elevated to such a rarefied status \u2013 up there with Jay-Z, Paul McCartney, U2 and the Rolling Stones \u2013 is unprecedented. Meanwhile, a persistent rumour on the site suggests his show has cost more to stage than any other in the festival\u2019s history. That may or may not be one of the myths that annually circulate Worthy Farm (festivalgoers old enough to remember Glastonbury before the internet and its fact-checking powers may recall the bizarre story in the early 90s that Cliff Richard had unexpectedly died). But within seconds of Stormzy\u2019s arrival, it seems pretty plausible: his set opens with the kind of pyrotechnics most artists use to conclude a performance, and it never really lets up. The sense of all the stops being pulled out is hard to miss. He might begin the set alone, with only his DJ, a Banksy-designed stab-proof vest with a Union Jack on it and an intense light show \u2013 complete with a ticker-tape flashing up the names of south London boroughs \u2013 for company, but it doesn\u2019t stay that way. There is a ballet interlude, designed to highlight the fact that BAME dancers now have shoes made in colours to match their skin tone. There is a vast gospel choir; there are dancers, complete with a small child busting moves; and there are kids on bikes popping wheelies around him as he performs Vossi Bop. Not for the first or last time over the weekend, there\u2019s an enthusiastic chant of \u201cFuck Boris\u201d, a cri de coeur that seems to be this year\u2019s equivalent to 2017\u2019s singing \u201cWoah Jeremy Corbyn\u201d to the tune of Seven Nation Army. There are also special guests. If Ed Sheeran can\u2019t be here in person, Chris Martin of Coldplay can, playing keyboards and harmonising on Blinded By Your Grace Part One. A cynic might suggest that the extravagant presentation represents an attempt to bedazzle anyone who doesn\u2019t think the 25-year-old rapper has yet amassed enough material to fill a headlining set, but his performance doesn\u2019t feature the lulls you might expect from an artist without years of hits to draw on. Bulking his repertoire out with a cover of Shanks and Bigfoot\u2019s old UK garage hit Sweet Like Chocolate, and his remix of Ed Sheeran\u2019s Shape Of You, is an inspired move, but his own hits get the biggest response. For all the eye-popping, larger-than-life visuals, there is something very human and moving at its centre. Stormzy seems genuinely overwhelmed by the sheer size of the crowd he has drawn \u2013 he says it is \u201cthe greatest night of my life\u201d. When another guest, fellow rapper Dave, congratulates him at length on his achievements, it doesn\u2019t feel like hyperbole. His performance seems not merely a personal triumph but a victory lap for British hip-hop. After decades as US rap\u2019s poor relation, here it is, topping the bill at the world\u2019s biggest music festival, and doing it in considerable style. Saturday morning arrives bearing the news that everyone from Adele to Jeremy Corbyn is raving about Stormzy on social media. It also brings The Proclaimers, belting out I\u2019m Gonna Be (500 Miles) from the Pyramid Stage to general delirium. Anyone in search of a less rousing start to the day could do worse than head up to The Park stage, where the Love Unlimited Synth Orchestra are working their way through Barry White\u2019s back catalogue with the aid of a succession of guest vocalists that range from Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys to deep house pioneer Larry Heard. It is a genuinely delightful performance that obliterates the aura of loverman naffness that still clings to White\u2019s name in some quarters, lovingly exploring the more recherch\u00e9 corners of his oeuvre alongside the big hits, reminding you what an extraordinary writer and producer White was: tense blaxploitation soundtrack material rubbing shoulders with the glorious euphoria of Under the Influence of Love and Love\u2019s Theme. For a demonstration of UK hip-hop\u2019s breadth, you could do worse than compare Stormzy\u2019s set with Slowthai\u2019s arrival on the West Holts stage, wearing only his underpants and a pair of socks and once more offering the crowd the opportunity to shout \u201cFuck Boris\u201d. It\u2019s a gripping, gleefully chaotic performance that switches from raw-throated menace \u2013 his voice goes from Johnny Rotten-esque sneer to a frankly terrifying howl \u2013 to hilarious bedlam. The latter reaches a demented peak when he tries to arrange a circle pit in the middle of the audience. The crowd duly oblige, his hypeman climbs down from the stage and stands in its centre, goading fans into moshing: \u201cThis is not for the faint-hearted! Do or die! Melee! Melee!\u201d When one duly ensues, his hypeman suddenly changes his tune: \u201cI\u2019ve lost my shoe,\u201d he weakly protests, somewhere beneath a sea of flailing arms. By contrast, Janet Jackson offers super-slick professionalism. It feels as if she has parachuted in the show she has been performing in Vegas: no one loses a shoe and we are clearly in a \u201cFuck Boris\u201d-free zone. There\u2019s something so suspiciously perfect about her vocals to suggest they may be emanating from a tape somewhere offstage rather than her mouth \u2013 indeed, were she miming any more obviously, she would be dressed as Marcel Marceau and pretending to be trapped in a box. But it is hard to argue with such a bombardment of hits, the frequency of which leaves you reeling: Nasty, What Have You Done For Me Lately, The Best Things in Life Are Free. It is an imperious performance, but one that faces strong competition from Lizzo back at West Holts. Last time she performed at Glastonbury, she notes, about 20 people turned up to see her. Today, she estimates the vast crowd before her to number \u201c16 million thousand\u201d. Her rise from leftfield hip-hop cult figure to mainstream star has been accompanied by a lot of discussion about the serious issues her music raises: body positivity, self-love. You can understand why \u2013 you certainly don\u2019t want for motivational speeches between songs \u2013 but the earnest, eat-your-greens tone of the coverage obscures how much fun her music is. Her level of success comes down to tracks such as Juice being irresistible party music. Today, she chugs tequila from the bottle, plays the flute, twerks and leaves the stage to one of the most rapturous receptions of the weekend. The last time Liam Gallagher played Glastonbury, he was tentatively attempting to kickstart a post-Oasis career that had stalled. It was anything but a foregone conclusion that it would work, but two years and a platinum-selling solo album later, he has clearly succeeded, although he appears more concerned with the change in the weather at Worthy Farm than his fortunes: \u201cI\u2019m up here freezing my bollocks off,\u201d he protests, the sun having finally gone in. People are clearly drawn to him because they know what they\u2019re going to get \u2013 his sound and approach remains defiantly unchanged 26 years on from Oasis\u2019s debut single. But it is hard not to spot a certain disparity in the crowd\u2019s response: if he plays an Oasis track, there is singalong rapture; when he delves into his solo oeuvre, things get noticeably more muted. He is good at picking the former, sticking to tracks from Oasis\u2019s first two albums, and a finale of Champagne Supernova, dedicated to the late Keith Flint, is simultaneously euphoric and moving. But it is not quite the triumphant return he might have expected. Up next are the Killers who, like Stormzy, are subject to the Glastonbury rumour mill. This time, the gossip suggests they were the third choice for the Saturday night headline slot, two big heritage acts having turned it down. Certainly, they play like a band with something to prove. \u201cAt the end of this show, I don\u2019t want anyone to say: \u2018They got away with it,\u2019\u201d frontman Brandon Flowers offers early on. \u201cI want people to look up at this stage and say: \u2018Those are the sons of bitches that did it.\u2019\u201d Indeed, if Flowers worked any harder to win over the crowd, he would have been down among them applying after-sun lotion and offering to pop to a stall to get Rizlas. Everything becomes an act of audience participation, up to and including counting in a song. He asks anxiously: \u201cAre we on the same page?\u201d He pretends to be overcome with emotion during a pause in Glamorous Indie Rock &amp; Roll, then slyly raises his eyebrows and beckons for more applause. It works, aided by the fact that, for a band whose career has theoretically tailed off slightly since their multi-platinum-selling noughties, they have an impressive store of anthemic songs: Spaceman, Somebody Told Me, All These Things That I Have Done. The audience start singing along with the opening Jenny Was a Friend of Mine and forget to stop. By the time they bring out the Pet Shop Boys to perform Always on My Mind, and Johnny Marr to race through a version of the Smiths\u2019 This Charming Man, the deal is sealed. Their performance feels genuinely victorious. But the sight of Flowers, a noted Pet Shop Boys and Smiths obsessive, living out his dreams on stage provides something else: one of those elusive Glastonbury moments festivalgoers talk about so much, where the atmosphere and what is happening onstage collide to create something it is impossible to imagine happening anywhere else in the world. Sunday afternoon on Glastonbury\u2019s two main stages skews distinctly towards pop. The traditional Sunday \u201clegends\u201d slot is occupied by Kylie Minogue, who cries as she talks about having to pull out of the festival 14 years ago, after being diagnosed with breast cancer, but otherwise concerns herself with a Blitzkrieg of hits so unrelenting it makes Janet Jackson\u2019s performance the previous day look like an artist self-indulgently exploring the dustiest corners of their back catalogue. Nick Cave comes on stage for Where the Wild Roses Grow and they slow-dance together as they sing. She overhauls Slow, interpolating it with a distorted take on David Bowie\u2019s Fashion. Less successful is the appearance of Chris Martin, reducing her most famous song, Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head, to a slow-paced acoustic ballad. Perhaps the most striking thing about her set is the way she fires out one track after another from her Stock Aitken Waterman days \u2013 Shocked, Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi, I Should Be So Lucky \u2013 which acts as a reminder both how good the singles the reviled trio manufactured for her were and of how improbable Kylie Minogue drawing a potentially record-breaking crowd at Glastonbury would have seemed when they were riding high in the charts. Today it seems like a given, which is testimony to her ability to evolve and transcend the flimsy pop role originally sketched out for her. Miley Cyrus, meanwhile, brings out her dad, Billy Ray, and Lil Nas X to perform Old Town Road, a highlight of a thrillingly chaotic set, at odds with Kylie\u2019s glittery polish. She crawls around the stage, underlines her Nashville roots by covering godmother Dolly Parton, admits she was scared to perform after seeing the Killers and plays a track sung by the character she played in a recent episode of Black Mirror: it gradually degenerates into a punishing industrial noise cover of Nine Inch Nails. On one level, her performance is all over the place, but that\u2019s its appeal \u2013 there is something really gripping about the randomness of her approach to being a pop star. She has sufficient ballsy charisma to ensure it all just about hangs together. Meanwhile, over on the Other stage, the size of the crowd assembled to see Billie Eilish offers evidence of how her appeal has spread beyond her core audience of teenage girls. You can see why: coming on stage to a clattering din that sounds more like one of Throbbing Gristle\u2019s more recherche moments than anything to do with pop, clad in a smog mask and an oversized outfit decorated with Blue Meanies from the Beatles film, she is an idiosyncratic figure in a world that tends towards the cookie-cutter \u2013 and exceptionally good at what she does. Eilish, a teenager herself, makes music that obviously speaks to the kids who love her in a completely unmediated way: it sounds the way she looks in photos, glowering and sulky, as if about to start an argument \u2013 \u201cduh!\u201d huffs the hook-line of Bad Guy, while even a lambent piano ballad arrives prefaced with the words: \u201cIf you absolutely despise yourself, this one\u2019s for you.\u201d But it\u2019s also incredibly well-turned: the glammy stomp of Bury a Friend, the hip-hop by way of industrial grind of You Should See Me in a Crown. And, at 17, she\u2019s already an astonishingly commanding performer: she tells the audience to crouch down in the dust and they just do it.

Private medical consultations are remunerated on a fee-for-service basis \u2013 they receive a fee for every operation or consultation.

It should be stressed that this is a very small proportion of the total number of NHS consultants. However, the ownership of shares and equipment in the private hospitals and clinics is most prevalent among cancer consultants (oncologists). This is a special concern since the patients who are most likely to try, and be willing to pay for any treatment that could save or prolong their lives are at greatest risk of being exploited, with an estimated one in 16 oncologists now having a financial interest in a private hospital where they treat patients.</p> <p>To comprehend why this is happening, it is necessary to understand the fundamentals of the private hospital business model. The only way for a private hospital to make money is by having patients referred to it for private treatment by a consultant. As a result, private hospitals, particularly in London and Manchester, are in <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5584293840f0b615b3000009/HCA_response_to_ITC.pdf\">\u201cfierce competition\u201d</a> with one another to win the loyalty of consultants, to the point where in 2014 the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found a widespread culture of what could be termed <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5329dc0c40f0b60a730000c3/provisional_findings_.pdf\">\u201ckick back\u201d payments</a> whereby consultants were rewarded financially according to how many patients they referred to a hospital. The higher the number of patient referrals in any one year the bigger the reward. This practice was prohibited, though not to protect patient safety, but because it distorted competition. But the CMA still permitted share ownership in private hospitals so long as it did not exceed a <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/453465/Private_Healthcare_Market_Investigation_Order_2014.pdf\">5% equity stake</a> and was fully declared.</p> <p>There are two reasons why cancer consultants are being specially targeted in this way. First, private cancer care in London is now the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/befcda6c-2b91-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7\">single biggest earner for the private hospital sector</a>, outstripping orthopaedics and cosmetic surgery for the first time. Millions of pounds of investment have been poured into this market by international investors who see the declining <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/08/nhs-cancer-treatment-wait-statistics-2018-standards\">NHS performance in cancer treatment</a> as an opportunity to meet a demand from middle-class patients who are not prepared to wait and are willing to pay. The second reason why hospitals are targeting cancer consultants is that there is a finite number of them in the UK. They need to pull them towards private practice. One of the ways of gaining the commitment of an NHS cancer consultant to undertake private work is for a private hospital to offer them a share of the profits made out of their services, on top of fees they will receive for treating patients.</p> <p>This approach has been adopted most successfully in the UK by the US healthcare giant HCA Healthcare, which now has profit-sharing arrangements with NHS cancer consultants, especially in London and Manchester. In an astute business move HCA has locked its for-profit fee-for-service model into the heart of the UK\u2019s leading cancer hospitals at <a href=\"https://www.hcahealthcare.co.uk/facilities/hca-uk-at-university-college-hospital\">University College London Hospitals</a>, <a href=\"http://www.londonbridgehospital.com/LBH/about-us/private-care-at-guys/\">Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hcahealthcare.co.uk/facilities/the-christie-private-care/\">the Christie in Manchester</a>. The private cancer units HCA has set up in these hospital trusts are jointly owned with NHS consultants, some of whom are employed by the trusts. The <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/555de2e4ed915d7ae2000037/HCA.pdf\">trusts</a> receive <a href=\"https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/aboutus/wwd/Annual%20reviews%20plans%20and%20reports%20archive/Annual%20Report%20and%20Accounts%202017-18.pdf\">rental income from HCA</a> for using their facilities, or in the case of the Christie, a share in the profits generated.</p> <p>The NHS consultants at the Christie with shares in their trust\u2019s private patient unit will have shared a dividend pot between them of <a href=\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/OC342754/filing-history\">over \u00a32m between 2013 and 2017</a>. A bonus which is on top of their NHS salary and the fees they will have received for treating patients at the private patient unit. The profits available to HCA Healthcare over the <a href=\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/OC355132/filing-history\">same period were \u00a325m</a>. Outpatient visits to the private patient unit increased by 30% during this period, suggesting that more patients were going private either due to increased demand or difficulties in accessing NHS services.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/05/nhs-america-brexit-trump\">The NHS cannot become a bargaining chip in our desperate deal-making with the US | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This represents a new form of privatisation of the NHS, from the inside. The extent of the collaboration between HCA Healthcare and NHS trusts is almost impossible for members of the public to find out about. And, not only do the consultants involved have a financial incentive to provide unnecessary treatment, they could also have an incentive to encourage patients to go private rather than remain in the NHS.</p> <p>Of course, for a doctor to behave in this way would be a significant breach of <a href=\"https://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-guidance-for-doctors/good-medical-practice\">professional ethics</a> and there is no suggestion that this is occurring in these cases. However, in order to remove the risk of such financial incentives operating against the best interests of patients, a much tougher regulatory regime needs to be introduced.

The only way for a private hospital to make money is by having patients referred to it for private treatment by a consultant. As a result, private hospitals, particularly in London and Manchester, are in \u201cfierce competition\u201d with one another to win the loyalty of consultants, to the point where in 2014 the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found a widespread culture of what could be termed \u201ckick back\u201d payments whereby consultants were rewarded financially according to how many patients they referred to a hospital. The higher the number of patient referrals in any one year the bigger the reward. This practice was prohibited, though not to protect patient safety, but because it distorted competition. But the CMA still permitted share ownership in private hospitals so long as it did not exceed a 5% equity stake and was fully declared. There are two reasons why cancer consultants are being specially targeted in this way. First, private cancer care in London is now the single biggest earner for the private hospital sector, outstripping orthopaedics and cosmetic surgery for the first time. Millions of pounds of investment have been poured into this market by international investors who see the declining NHS performance in cancer treatment as an opportunity to meet a demand from middle-class patients who are not prepared to wait and are willing to pay. The second reason why hospitals are targeting cancer consultants is that there is a finite number of them in the UK. They need to pull them towards private practice. One of the ways of gaining the commitment of an NHS cancer consultant to undertake private work is for a private hospital to offer them a share of the profits made out of their services, on top of fees they will receive for treating patients. This approach has been adopted most successfully in the UK by the US healthcare giant HCA Healthcare, which now has profit-sharing arrangements with NHS cancer consultants, especially in London and Manchester. In an astute business move HCA has locked its for-profit fee-for-service model into the heart of the UK\u2019s leading cancer hospitals at University College London Hospitals, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 and the Christie in Manchester. The private cancer units HCA has set up in these hospital trusts are jointly owned with NHS consultants, some of whom are employed by the trusts. The trusts receive rental income from HCA for using their facilities, or in the case of the Christie, a share in the profits generated. The NHS consultants at the Christie with shares in their trust\u2019s private patient unit will have shared a dividend pot between them of over \u00a32m between 2013 and 2017. A bonus which is on top of their NHS salary and the fees they will have received for treating patients at the private patient unit. The profits available to HCA Healthcare over the same period were \u00a325m. Outpatient visits to the private patient unit increased by 30% during this period, suggesting that more patients were going private either due to increased demand or difficulties in accessing NHS services. This represents a new form of privatisation of the NHS, from the inside. The extent of the collaboration between HCA Healthcare and NHS trusts is almost impossible for members of the public to find out about. And, not only do the consultants involved have a financial incentive to provide unnecessary treatment, they could also have an incentive to encourage patients to go private rather than remain in the NHS. Of course, for a doctor to behave in this way would be a significant breach of professional ethics and there is no suggestion that this is occurring in these cases. However, in order to remove the risk of such financial incentives operating against the best interests of patients, a much tougher regulatory regime needs to be introduced. Clinicians should be barred outright from owning shares and equipment in the private hospitals where they treat patients not only to protect the integrity of the health service but also to protect patient safety. With the NHS clearly in the sights of the US healthcare lobby, there is an urgent need to put in place a regulatory regime to protect patients from the worst aspects of the profit-driven model of healthcare, which wastes huge amounts of public money and harms patients. \u2022 David Rowland is the director of the Centre for Health and the Public Interest (CHPI)",

Meanwhile, the city saw a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/16/san-francisco-homeless-increase-tech-ipo\">17% increase in its homeless population</a> between 2017 and 2019, and residents complain of <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jimdalrympleii/public-drug-use-san-francisco\">visible drug usage</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/With-workers-on-edge-SF-tech-companies-are-13563235.php\">fear of crime</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/18/san-francisco-poop-problem-inequality-homelessness\">dirty streets</a>. Even Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce and a San Francisco native who has long urged comity between the techies and the city, has taken to calling his hometown a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/22/san-francisco-inequality-because-of-silicon-valley-salesforce-ceo.html\">train wreck</a>\u201d.</p> <p>For Zoe, the newfound financial security from working in tech does not counterbalance a constant sense of being unsafe in the city. She now earns three to four times more than when she was a \u201cstarving artist\u201d, but she says she is terrified to walk at night. She no longer rides scooters and says she feels \u201ctriggered\u201d when she sees them around the city.

Such inflection points (which also include a controversial <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Twitter-will-get-payroll-tax-break-to-stay-in-S-F-2375948.php\">2011 tax break for Twitter</a> and a failed attempt at a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/01/tech-tax-san-francisco-homelessness-inequality\">tech tax</a>\u201d in 2016) highlight the complicated relationship between the city government and an industry that has brought untold wealth and jobs, but has arguably failed to pay its fair share \u2013 while treating the city as a petri dish for disruptive innovations (think Uber, Airbnb and self-driving cars) by ignoring regulations.</p> <p>The nominal issue in 2014 was the use of public bus stops by private charter shuttles (AKA \u201cGoogle buses\u201d) hired by tech companies to ferry employees the 45 miles south to their Silicon Valley headquarters. Activists wanted the double-decker buses banned from the streets and the companies fined for the illegal use of bus stops; the city chose to legalize the buses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0445429b3789d678891c13e2d73be9c028ea3f66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0445429b3789d678891c13e2d73be9c028ea3f66/0_0_3000_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers near Google\u2019s San Francisco offices catch a bus headed to Mountain View, home of the company\u2019s main campus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers near Google\u2019s San Francisco offices catch a bus headed to Mountain View, home of the company\u2019s main campus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Henry/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Google Bus controversy was particularly charged because it tapped into local residents\u2019 deep concern that San Francisco \u2013 a city with the population of Jacksonville, Florida, and the self-importance of New York \u2013 would be reduced to a bedroom community for Silicon Valley. But while the buses continue to ply their routes north and south, that particular nightmare scenario hasn\u2019t come to pass. Instead, San Francisco has become more of a satellite campus, with South Bay stalwarts including <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-offices-san-francisco-insight-idUSKCN0W50F1\">Apple</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-office-in-san-francisco-181-fremont-2017-9\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Google-signs-massive-SF-office-lease-at-former-13378857.php\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/LinkedIn-s-new-SF-home-a-26-story-skyscraper-6889635.php\">LinkedIn</a> competing for office space in the city proper.

The tale of how tech destroyed the city that gave us the Summer of Love has been told so many times that in 2014, the <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/living/article/What-out-of-town-writers-need-to-know-about-SF-5307139.phpt=b0efab851d8768aa8f\">San Francisco Chronicle</a> produced a satirical cheat sheet for out-of-town reporters parachuting in for taste of avocado toast and class warfare.

A frequent refrain among the more than a dozen tech workers who spoke to the Guardian for this article was that it is not so much the presence of have-nots that is ruining their experience of San Francisco, but an overabundance of haves. </p> <p>\u201cThe housing crisis has a huge negative impact on quality of life because of who it excludes from living near you,\u201d said Simon Willison, a software developer who moved to San Francisco from London five years ago. \u201cWhen I visit other cities I\u2019m always jealous of their income diversity: that people who have jobs that don\u2019t provide a six-digit salary can afford to live and work and be happy.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s no future for anyone under 40 in this city who\u2019s not rich</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cEven though people think there is diversity in the city, there isn\u2019t really,\u201d said Adrianna Tan, a senior product manager at a tech startup who moved to San Francisco from Singapore. \u201cSure, you get people from all over the world, but the only ones who can move here now come from the same socio-economic class.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel like San Francisco is between Seattle and New York, but rather than the best of both, it\u2019s the worst of both,\u201d said Beth, a 24-year-old product manager who asked not to be identified by her real name.

      "bodyText": "It was a beautiful winter day in San Francisco, and Zoe was grooving to the soundtrack of the roller-skating musical Xanadu as she rode an e-scooter to work. The 29-year-old tech worker had just passed the Uber building when, without warning, a homeless man jumped into the bike lane with his dog, blocking her path. She slammed on the brakes, flew four feet into the air and landed on the pavement, bleeding. \u201cIt was one of those hardening moments where I was like, \u2018Even I am being affected,\u2019\u201d she recalled. It should be noted that Zoe, who asked not to be identified by her real name because she was not authorized by her employer to speak to the press, is not the stereotypical tech bro who moves to San Francisco for a job and immediately starts complaining about the city\u2019s dire homelessness crisis. She arrived in 2007 to study at San Francisco State University and had a career in the arts before attending a coding bootcamp and landing a job at a major tech company. But the fall and other incidents, including getting mugged and having her phone stolen, have all contributed to her growing sense of insecurity in the area. She told the Guardian the tale of her scoot, interrupted, because she said it was a perfect example of her own \u2013 and perhaps the broader community of tech workers\u2019 \u2013 increasingly hate-hate relationship with San Francisco. \u201cThis guy needed services to help him,\u201d she said of the man who caused her to fall, \u201cand we all suffer because of the issues that are not being addressed.\u201d A quarter of a century after the first dot-com boom, the battle for San Francisco\u2019s soul is over and the tech industry has won. But what happens when the victors realize they don\u2019t particularly like the spoils? Tech workers are increasingly vocal about their discontent with the city they fought so hard to conquer. In May, the median market rent for a one-bedroom apartment reached an all-time high of $3,700 a month, according to the rental site Zumper. Meanwhile, the city saw a 17% increase in its homeless population between 2017 and 2019, and residents complain of visible drug usage, fear of crime and dirty streets. Even Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce and a San Francisco native who has long urged comity between the techies and the city, has taken to calling his hometown a \u201ctrain wreck\u201d. For Zoe, the newfound financial security from working in tech does not counterbalance a constant sense of being unsafe in the city. She now earns three to four times more than when she was a \u201cstarving artist\u201d, but she says she is terrified to walk at night. She no longer rides scooters and says she feels \u201ctriggered\u201d when she sees them around the city. She takes Ubers everywhere after dark and asks drivers to watch to make sure she gets inside her apartment building. \u201cMark Zuckerberg lives nearby, but our corner is the main prostitution corner in the city,\u201d she said of the Mission District apartment she shares with her boyfriend. \u201cThere\u2019s condoms and syringes. It\u2019s absolutely crazy with how much we pay for rent \u2026 It\u2019s tough, because we work in tech, but we ask ourselves every day if we should move.\u201d It\u2019s a striking contrast from just five years ago, when tech workers showed up in force at San Francisco City Hall to declare their love and respect for a city that was not exactly loving them back. \u201cI am so proud to live in San Francisco and be a part of this community,\u201d Google employees were instructed to say, as a preface to their remarks at a January 2014 hearing before the local transportation authority, according to a leaked company memo. That hearing was one of several pivotal moments in recent San Francisco history when public officials could have used the city\u2019s legislative or regulatory powers to force the tech industry to contribute more to public services, but chose not to. Such inflection points (which also include a controversial 2011 tax break for Twitter and a failed attempt at a \u201ctech tax\u201d in 2016) highlight the complicated relationship between the city government and an industry that has brought untold wealth and jobs, but has arguably failed to pay its fair share \u2013 while treating the city as a petri dish for disruptive innovations (think Uber, Airbnb and self-driving cars) by ignoring regulations. The nominal issue in 2014 was the use of public bus stops by private charter shuttles (AKA \u201cGoogle buses\u201d) hired by tech companies to ferry employees the 45 miles south to their Silicon Valley headquarters. Activists wanted the double-decker buses banned from the streets and the companies fined for the illegal use of bus stops; the city chose to legalize the buses. The Google Bus controversy was particularly charged because it tapped into local residents\u2019 deep concern that San Francisco \u2013 a city with the population of Jacksonville, Florida, and the self-importance of New York \u2013 would be reduced to a bedroom community for Silicon Valley. But while the buses continue to ply their routes north and south, that particular nightmare scenario hasn\u2019t come to pass. Instead, San Francisco has become more of a satellite campus, with South Bay stalwarts including Apple, Facebook, Google and LinkedIn competing for office space in the city proper. They\u2019ve joined the San Francisco-native companies Twitter, Uber, and Airbnb in the cramped confines of a city of just 49 square miles, surrounded by water on three sides. The consequences of that squeeze are well documented: the outrageous housing costs, the displacement of black and Latino families, evictions, homelessness, the loss of beloved businesses and cultural institutions. The tale of how tech destroyed the city that gave us the Summer of Love has been told so many times that in 2014, the San Francisco Chronicle produced a satirical cheat sheet for out-of-town reporters parachuting in for taste of avocado toast and class warfare. (Amid a bumper crop of new elegies to San Francisco in recent months, web publication HmmDaily updated the form with an \u201cAI Algorithm-generated\u201d version.) But what\u2019s striking about the current winter of our discontent (yes, it\u2019s July; consider this your obligatory Mark Twain reference) is that it\u2019s not just the archetypal \u201cevicted Mission District visual artist\u201d complaining that techies ruined San Francisco: it\u2019s the techies themselves, too. The arguments against San Francisco are manifold: it\u2019s too expensive even for people making six-figure salaries, it\u2019s dangerous and depressingly unequal, and, increasingly, it\u2019s kind of boring. A frequent refrain among the more than a dozen tech workers who spoke to the Guardian for this article was that it is not so much the presence of have-nots that is ruining their experience of San Francisco, but an overabundance of haves. \u201cThe housing crisis has a huge negative impact on quality of life because of who it excludes from living near you,\u201d said Simon Willison, a software developer who moved to San Francisco from London five years ago. \u201cWhen I visit other cities I\u2019m always jealous of their income diversity: that people who have jobs that don\u2019t provide a six-digit salary can afford to live and work and be happy.\u201d \u201cEven though people think there is diversity in the city, there isn\u2019t really,\u201d said Adrianna Tan, a senior product manager at a tech startup who moved to San Francisco from Singapore. \u201cSure, you get people from all over the world, but the only ones who can move here now come from the same socio-economic class.\u201d \u201cI feel like San Francisco is between Seattle and New York, but rather than the best of both, it\u2019s the worst of both,\u201d said Beth, a 24-year-old product manager who asked not to be identified by her real name. Beth moved to the city directly after graduating from Stanford to work at a major tech company, but recently transferred to Seattle. \u201cEveryone I met was only interested in their jobs, and their jobs weren\u2019t very interesting,\u201d she said of her time in San Francisco. \u201cI get it, you\u2019re a developer for Uber, I\u2019ve met a million of you.\u201d One aspect of that homogeneity is that when everyone around you is either rich or destitute, being rich doesn\u2019t feel that rich. \u201cUnless you\u2019re here to hit the IPO jackpot, you\u2019ll always be middle-class,\u201d said Chris, a former Apple manager who recently decided to leave San Francisco for Texas and spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cTech salaries allow you to get by for now, but there\u2019s no future for anyone under 40 in this city who\u2019s not rich.\u201d Chris and his partner\u2019s combined annual income places them comfortably in the top 1% of earners in the US \u2013 but not in San Francisco, which recently achieved the dubious distinction of having the most billionaires per capita in the world. He said that the \u201ccost/benefit perspective\u201d on San Francisco was no longer working for him. \u201cIt\u2019s just not sustainable for a couple to live here,\u201d he said. \u201cA million-plus for a home with $300,000 down? Then when we have kids, $30,000 a year for private school? Who can afford that even making $300,000 a year? \u2026 There\u2019s hundreds of other places in the country with the same restaurant culture or at least on par that cost half as much.\u201d Chris also complained about the \u201cproperty crime, unchecked homeless and drug issues\u201d plaguing the city, noting that he had recently witnessed a man smoking crack cocaine in broad daylight in the middle of the famously twisty Lombard street. \u201cYou don\u2019t see people smoking crack brazenly in public on Melrose in LA or in Times Square, NYC, but here the cops just shrug.\u201d Figuring out how to exist in a city with so much human misery clearly on display is another challenge for affluent tech workers, many of whom express compassion for the poor and homeless, as well as frustration with the city\u2019s decades of failure in providing adequate shelter and services to the homeless and mentally ill. \u201cIt was really hard to stomach the indifference that I witnessed from folks who\u2019d been living in San Francisco for a while, simply stepping over the slumped bodies of people who lived outside or just cold ignoring people asking for money,\u201d said Jessica Jin, who moved to San Francisco from Austin, Texas, to work for a tech startup, of her first impressions of the city. \u201cI wondered how long it would take me to also become numb to it all.\u201d Badrul Farooqi, a startup worker, said that he had been surprised to experience echoes of the constant fear of crime and violence he was exposed to growing up in Detroit while living in San Francisco. \u201cThe entire purpose of going to school and working hard was to escape this kind of environment,\u201d he said. And while Farooqi acknowledged that San Francisco was much better off than the Detroit of his childhood, he argued that in some ways it was worse because the misery seems so unnecessary. \u201cSan Francisco is not Detroit,\u201d he said. \u201cDetroit was always poor \u2026 San Francisco has money! There\u2019s so much money in this city.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

He even has the support of <strong>Cory Bernardi.</strong></p> <p><strong>SB: </strong>I don\u2019t know whose support Rex has. Christopher doesn\u2019t believe in any way he is breaching those [rules]. He is not engaging in lobbying activities or engagement with government at all in relation to defence matters, that he is not going to be providing or revealing information that was gleaned in secret or in confidence in his activities as a minister, that he will simply be undertaking advisory work that is based off all the range of things in the public domain. That\u2019s what Christopher has said. He has also indicated that EY understand that and that the limits of the code of conduct and they have strict probity positions in place. All those questions Rex has been raising have been answered by those clarifications.</p> <p><strong>PK: </strong>Wouldn\u2019t making ministerial codes enforcement fix this?<br></p> <p><strong>SB: </strong><strong>Christopher Pyne</strong> is no longer a member of the government.

What I\u2019m saying, what is wise for us is to reflect the views of the people we represent and, indeed, the people who we don\u2019t necessarily represent, who would look at stage three and ask \u2026 whether it\u2019s economically responsible at a time when, on this government\u2019s watch, the economy is in trouble. They\u2019re asking themselves whether it\u2019s fair and [has] distribution-able impacts \u2013 in other words, are they concerned about too much of the money going to higher-income earners and whether, indeed, there are going to be cuts in other areas or the government is going to give up on its efforts to bring the budget back to surplus. Very reasonable questions.</p> <p>PK: You just said, though, you haven\u2019t made a decision on whether you will vote stage three down. Do you think it is wise to vote stage three down?</p> <p>JF: I stand by what I said earlier in the interview and what I\u2019ve said in earlier interviews as well. I think it\u2019s unwise for political parties to get between a taxpayer and a tax cut but that\u2019s exactly what the government is doing by knocking back what is a very reasonable and responsible position on our part.</p> <p>PK: Do you think personally think stage three is unfair?</p> <p>JF: I will deal with stage three as a member of the shadow cabinet. I think the government is under a lot of pressure here. The crossbench in the Senate is wavering, the government is getting very nervous. This presents us with a good opportunity to make the tax cut proposition better.</p> <p>PK: Do you think personally stage three is unfair?<br></p> <p>JF: I\u2019m not going to talk about stage three until we know whether we will have that debate. I\u2019m a member of the shadow cabinet and the shadow cabinet will take a position on that and I will, of course, support and abide by the shadow cabinet\u2019s position.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-01T06:30:37.248Z\">at 7.30am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d19a4f28f082364d7cf3df5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-01T06:18:21.625Z\">7.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Joel Fitzgibbon</strong> was talking to <strong>Patricia Karvelas</strong> when news of the caucus discussions started filtering out. Asked about leaking, Fitzgibbon had this to say:</p> <p>\u201cHe [Albanese] reminded people we have a quality team, and if we can maintain strong unity, we will be a strong force at the next election.\u201d</p> <p>PK: Did he make a point about the leak?<br></p> <p>JF: He emphasised the fact that it is important, when the party makes a decision we stick together on that decision and unity is a path to an election win in three years\u2019 time.</p> <p>PK: Do you worry there has been some leaking?<br></p> <p>JF: Of course, there has been some leaking. That\u2019s a matter of fact. When you get leaks from the senior ranks of the party, that is unhelpful to the party and its prospects. Like Anthony, I discourage people from leaking. I encourage people to back the collective decision. That\u2019s the best way forward. Of course, unity also gives us the best prospects of success at the next election.</p> <p>PK: Why are we seeing this? You can say, \u2018Don\u2019t do it\u2019 but you have to get to the heart of why it\u2019s happening. Why are we seeing this leaking?</p> <p>JF: I can\u2019t provide for you what\u2019s going on in the minds of people who have chosen to share information but we have gone through a very difficult period. Maybe for some people, this is a way of dealing with that pain, but look, I\u2019m confident that we will remain a united team, we\u2019ve been a united team for six years, we\u2019ll continue to be a united team and I believe we\u2019ll be a very powerful force at the next election.</p> <p>PK: It\u2019s interesting you say that because some Labor MPs have told me unity got them nowhere.

One is that you\u2019re not supposed to work in an 18-month period as a lobbyist or advocate or have business meetings with members of the government. But the second is you are not allowed to use knowledge that you have gained as a minister for that period of time in your work where that knowledge is not available to the general public.</p> <p> Now I think it is pretty difficult to understand how it is that Mr Pyne could have a job advising on Defence when he\u2019s only utilising knowledge that\u2019s available to members of the general public.

Some might say there is some \u2013 I\u2019ll leave it up to others to add some colour but the fact that he was tied up in dealing with the matters that were before the courts last week, he says that he hasn\u2019t had enough time to prepare his submission to the ALP National Executive. I don\u2019t want to get tied up in any technicalities with regard to this. So the National Executive committee have agreed to give Mr Setka extra time in terms of preparing his case and argument before the National Executive. </p> <p>So National Executive will now meet. Again, we\u2019ll have an ordinary meeting this Friday July the 5th. We will give Mr Setka an extra ten days to prepare his submission so we\u2019ll have a separate meeting by teleconference as provided for under the ALP rules on July the 15th. </p> <p>It is a fact that Mr Setka of course pleaded guilty to very serious charges of harassment. It\u2019s also a fact that his wife<strong> Emma Walters</strong> identified herself as the victim of that harassment that included 45 text messages which were of a nature that clearly, clearly put, I think, Mr Setka outside what the principles and values that Labor holds with regard to issues of domestic violence. With regard to his own assistant secretary, Shaun Reardon has resigned from the position of assistant secretary of the Victorian branch because his values, he has said, would be breached were he to stay in that position while Mr Setka remains as secretary. </p> <p>I<strong>f Mr Setka was a rugby league player he would have been kicked out of his club over the revelations that have been made. He will be kicked out of the Australian Labor party because, quite frankly, his ongoing activities, statements and behaviour are not consistent with the membership values of the Australian Labor party.</strong></p> <p><strong>So that will occur on July the 15th </strong>but he\u2019ll be given every opportunity to put his argument before the party, as is appropriate. But I\u2019m very confident that the National Executive will agree with me that these values aren\u2019t consistent with his remaining membership of the Australian Labor party.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-01T02:23:08.837Z\">at 3.23am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1967458f080e8285152206\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-01T01:54:12.045Z\">2.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For those asking about an Indigenous governor general, I think that so far the only Indigenous governor Australia has had was Sir <strong>Douglas Nicholls</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.au/sir-doug-nicholls/\">who was appointed the governor of South Australia in 1976.</a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-01T01:55:12.529Z\">at 2.55am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1964758f081e8727351610\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-01T01:42:10.488Z\">2.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the question of <strong>Joe Hockey\u2019s </strong>attendance at the G20 \u2013 it is not uncommon for ambassadors to attend bilateral meetings, particularly if they are the ones who have the relationship.</p> <p>As for the travel, all of that is done through the departmental and embassy rules. <a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/breaking-news/helloworld-shares-lift-on-new-fed-contract/news-story/f375aa88ca283f026ff4e6a77c0dd490\">Helloworld\u2019s contract was recently extended by the federal government for another two years. </a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-01T01:52:36.765Z\">at 2.52am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1963278f081e8727351608\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-01T01:35:56.174Z\">2.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>David Hurley then thanked those for their welcome:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When I was sworn in as governor of New South Wales, the then premier,<strong> Mike Baird</strong>, made a comment in his speech that governors go to places that very few people in the country go to.

Well-intentioned. Difficult issues to be faced, but I think with a good heart. </p> <p>So I look forward to being part of that. I look forward to being with Linda being able to make a contribution that I hope builds people, builds communities and points to a bright future. </p> <p>We have with us today the youngsters from the Conservatorium high school who will sing for us in a moment. Linda was their patron over the last 4.5 years. A fine example of just look at the faces. </p> <p>This country and the many eyes that look down on us there, and we\u2019re in good hands. </p> <p>One of the important jobs, of course, most important, is to ensure that the strength of our democracy is maintained. </p> <p>This is a position, this appointment, is critical to that. Of course it\u2019s apolitical. Of course you must be diligent in our performance of your duties. But at all times to stress to people that the strength of this country is our democracy which brings stability, peace and certainty to all of us. </p> <p>That is worth protecting. That shapes us. So to make our democracy work, to serve the people, to act as they expect us to act, and put their interests and those of the nation first, that\u2019s what we\u2019re called to do in service. </p> <p>That\u2019s what I\u2019m called to do with this appointment. That\u2019s what Linda and I will give our utmost to do. Thank you for coming here today. This is obviously - how would you describe a day like today?! Very nervous this morning. </p> <p>Settling down a bit now. But to be surrounded by family, friends and faces here I have known here for many, many years, we do thank you for coming. We do thank you for celebrating what this day means to our country, not about the person, but about the position and what the position offers. An important day in our history for that reason alone and thank you for sharing it with us.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-01T01:52:04.675Z\">at 2.52am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1962998f080e82851521fe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-01T01:33:21.355Z\">2.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>was next:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a great honour which has been bestowed upon a great Australian and can say \u2013 you have begun extremely well. A very brave decision to begin in the Ngunnawal language which Tina indicated was done extremely well. So congratulations to you and on your first speech as governor general in accepting this great honour. </p> <p>You have, of course, served this nation with distinction for a long period of time. In particular, as head of the defence force and over four decades of service. </p> <p>You have served the great state of New South Wales with distinction as its governor. And we have absolute confidence that you\u2019ll serve this nation with distinction as our governor general. </p> <p>Can I congratulate the government on the choice of governor general \u2013 one that was accepted very much across the political spectrum. It must be said that you do have big shoes to fill.</p> <p>Sir <strong>Peter Cosgrove</strong> is one of the most outstanding Australians of recent decades. Time after time when this nation called upon Sir Peter to serve, he responded \u2013 on battlefields, when rebuilding after natural disasters or when exercising the important roles and responsibilities of the office that you now assume. </p> <p>So we wish Sir Peter and Lady Cosgrove well into the future and we thank him and Lady Cosgrove for their service. </p> <p>The Office of Governor General plays a critical role in our system of government. It is not just about the formal constitutional role important as that is, it\u2019s also about the role that the governor general plays in providing leadership, support and, indeed, inspiration to our community. </p> <p>We have faith that you will occupy this office for all Australians and exercise its powers in a way that unites and strengthens our nation. Sir Peter also delivered on these with good grace, good judgement and warmth. We know you\u2019ll be more than worthy of his example. </p> <p>When you took the first RAR into Badowa in 1993, the defence force hasn\u2019t deployed a battalion overseas since the Vietnam War. </p> <p>Operation Solace achieved is mission and you and the Australians under your command won international renown. </p> <p>And as chief of army and then chief of defence force, your leadership was authentic and ethical in a period with a complex a cultural challenge and as intense an operational environment as any since Vietnam.

The answer is central to the stability of our system of democratic government. </p> <p>The Office of Governor General has provided the stability in spite of politics for more than a century. </p> <p>But the role goes beyond constitutional as his excellency indicated today in his own remarks. </p> <p>Years later, Sir <strong>Zelman Cowen</strong> answered that question when he said \u2013 the governor general interprets it is nation to itself and his excellency I think has started in such excellent fashion today in putting that very much at the forefront of his term.</p> <p>The governor general finds the good in this country and shines a light on it. In a global age of fragmentation and tribalism, we have in our system a constitutional office beyond politics that enables us all to come together. </p> <p>The joy of this role is who you meet every single day. Farmers getting on with their lives providing for their families and their communities despite crippling drought. Veterans recovering from their wounds that are seen and unseen. Teachers who work back late to give kids the best possible start in life. </p> <p>Those who care for our local environment and their communities, planting trees, picking up rubbish, keeping faith with our stewardship of the land. Researchers making the breakthroughs that not only we need as Australians, but the world needs. </p> <p>Brave heroes who will tell you they are not heroes. Selfless community workers who can\u2019t see their selflessness and to all those people enduring the moments and tragedy and triumph, they embody all of us. </p> <p>Our governor general \u2013 not just on tarmacs or daises such as this or platforms, but in classrooms, hospital wards and on drought-stricken farms, more than any role in public life the job of governor general is to bring Australians together, to remind us all of our social fabric and to uplift the discouraged and to give hope. </p> <p>To do that, you need to be a person of extraordinary character and in our retiring governor general and Lady Cosgrove, we had two such people, and with his excellency today and also with Mrs Hurley, we have been able to find two such people.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-01T01:48:44.073Z\">at 2.48am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1961678f080e82851521fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-01T01:28:48.561Z\">2.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Tina Brown </strong>has delivered the official welcome to country:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In 1998, there were very many Indigenous people and our supporters from around Australia protesting at the opening of Parliament House. </p> <p>Back then, even Her Majesty, the Queen, encountered both cheers and jeers during the opening.

Our people have been able to maintain our long connection to the area because the country provided fresh air to breathe, clean water to drink, nourishing food to eat, and clothing and shelter, to keep us warm for our bitterly cold winters. </p> <p>It is on this once exacting land as extreme cold of the last ice age was easing that my ancestors fought their resilience and grew their knowledge of country and handed it off to those of us who followed the legacy of our ancestral beings and our creation stories and our responsibility for future of our people and country. </p> <p>They form pathways across this land to guide us, these pathways developed as our ancestors followed the river and creek corridors and ridges and spurs on the hills and mountains, linking our major spiritual and gathering places. </p> <p>Canberra itself \u2013 some of its modern roads and tracks \u2013 evolved from these ancient paths. </p> <p>The responsibility for the future of our people and our country now rests with all of us, which is why I\u2019m here today conducting this Welcome To Country.

The costing of that is less than $3.7bn. </p> <p>That\u2019s based upon the government\u2019s own indications of what that would cost come 2022, when that change is due to come in under the already-legislated tax cuts. So obviously the figure would be \u2013 would be less than that figure. </p> <p>The third thing that we\u2019re saying is the infrastructure investment should be brought forward. </p> <p>This has been proposed by the Reserve Bank of Australia. We know that there are a range of road and rail packages that could be brought forward because they\u2019re ready to go right now. </p> <p>Projects including here in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Projects in the northern suburbs of Melbourne.</p> <p>The government could, of course, put money into a project like the Melbourne Metro, which is what we proposed during the election campaign, in order to speed up the delivery of that project. </p> <p>But we\u2019re prepared to sit down with the government and identify projects, some of which were committed to by both sides of politics during the election campaign, but in the case of projects like Link Field Road in Brisbane\u2019s northern suburbs, due to commence around about 2027 in terms of actual shovels in the ground \u2013 we know that projects like that are necessary now and we think that a bring-forward of the government\u2019s proposed infrastructure investment would assist the economy, create jobs right now, help to boost productivity into the future.</p> <p>If the government is prepared to do that, in terms of stages one and stages two, while deferring stage three\u2019s consideration to the following sitting of parliament or whenever they deemed fit to debate it \u2013 some time between now and 2024-25 when it\u2019s due to commence, then we would facilitate the passage of those stages through the parliament next week. </p> <p>We would facilitate the passage through the House of Representatives before question time next Thursday, given that Tuesday will be largely ceremonial and Wednesday\u2019s sitting will be devoted to the commemoration of Bob Hawke. </p> <p>So we think that these issues should be considered separately. We think that stage three at a cost of some $95bn down the track for an economy which is very soft at the moment, which no one can say what the economy looks like in 2024-25, is really a triumph of hope over economic reality. </p> <p>What we know right now is that the economy needs stimulus. And what we\u2019re looking for here is solutions rather than arguments. I have said as I have gone around the country that the country has conflict fatigue.</p> <p>They want to see us getting on with delivering real outcomes. This is a genuine approach by Labor, a constructive approach, and I hope that the government receives it as such. We have already had some discussions with the crossbench about supporting a proposal such as this and I believe it would be a good thing for the country if we had unanimity across the parliament about a package such as the one that we\u2019re putting forward here today.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T23:04:27.339Z\">at 12.04am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d193b6c8f082364d7cf3d36\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T22:48:20.720Z\">11.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>has been talking tax:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today, 700,000 workers lose their penalty rates.

We\u2019ll see you tomorrow morning. In the meantime - take care of you. Josh Frydenberg has called a presser for 5.15. I do not need to call on my ancestors to guess it is about tax. This whole week, despite there only being one real sitting day, is about tax. After that? I don\u2019t know. Stuff. LOTS AND LOTS OF STUFF. Back to Afternoon Briefing, Simon Birmingham was asked about the inquiry Rex Patrick wants to establish, looking at former ministers who have gone on to lobby on behalf of the industry they were formerly a minister for. PK: Senator Rex Patrick says there are the numbers for a parliamentary inquiry into Senator Christopher Pyne\u2019s consultancy with EY. He even has the support of Cory Bernardi. SB: I don\u2019t know whose support Rex has. Christopher doesn\u2019t believe in any way he is breaching those [rules]. He is not engaging in lobbying activities or engagement with government at all in relation to defence matters, that he is not going to be providing or revealing information that was gleaned in secret or in confidence in his activities as a minister, that he will simply be undertaking advisory work that is based off all the range of things in the public domain. That\u2019s what Christopher has said. He has also indicated that EY understand that and that the limits of the code of conduct and they have strict probity positions in place. All those questions Rex has been raising have been answered by those clarifications. PK: Wouldn\u2019t making ministerial codes enforcement fix this? SB: Christopher Pyne is no longer a member of the government. We have clear standards there. He is indicating he is working within those standards under the terms of the employment. PK: Would you have taken this job? SB: Would I have taken the job? PK: Yes. SB: I don\u2019t \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t know all the terms of the job. It is a very hypothetical question. Happily for me I am still in the parliament and member of the leadership team. PK: It is a question about ethics. Do you think it\u2019s an ethical decision? SB: I think if the job Christopher has taken is as he has described it to be, I have no reason to doubt his word. EY and he have discussed the boundaries of the work he can do, the probity requirements, it sounds like he has undertaken all the necessary precautions to ensure he continues to work within the code, notwithstanding the fact he is no longer a member of the government or the parliament. On the religious freedom inquiry, Anthony Albanese told the caucus that it was \u201cimportant to respect different views\u201d and the party would consult widely on the matter. On press freedom, Labor will support a joint select committee, if the government doesn\u2019t act. On John Setka, Albanese said \u201cno individual is more important than the movement\u201d. And on leaks, Albanese told the room that they were not helpful, that discussion was fine ahead of a party decision, but once made the party should speak with a single voice. Those caucus updates, by the way, are not leaks. I\u2019ve mentioned this a few times before, but for those who have missed it \u2013 in one of the weirder Canberra traditions, following both a party room meeting and a caucus meeting, an official briefing is held. But it is all on background. It\u2019s a very basic rundown of the minutes. Names are not mentioned (outside of the leaders) and the occasional quote the party wants out is jotted down and delivered. It\u2019s weird, given that it is off the record, but on the record and very, very Canberra. Also spoken about in the caucus meeting: On tax, Anthony Albanese told the caucus: \u201cThe government is trying to change the country, what they are trying to do with stage 3 is an attempt to permanently reduce the amount of help the government is able to give to people.\u201d One MP said the tax debate was overshadowing debate on other issues like penalty rates. Labor has reaffirmed its support for medevac. It has also reaffirmed its opposition to the Ensuring Integrity bill. Back on the tax cuts, Joel Fitzgibbon maintained his earlier position that he did not believe it fair for Labor to stand in the way of needed tax cuts \u2013 but he was holding fire on stage three: JF: Well, we haven\u2019t made a decision about whether we\u2019ll vote it down. What I\u2019m saying, what is wise for us is to reflect the views of the people we represent and, indeed, the people who we don\u2019t necessarily represent, who would look at stage three and ask \u2026 whether it\u2019s economically responsible at a time when, on this government\u2019s watch, the economy is in trouble. They\u2019re asking themselves whether it\u2019s fair and [has] distribution-able impacts \u2013 in other words, are they concerned about too much of the money going to higher-income earners and whether, indeed, there are going to be cuts in other areas or the government is going to give up on its efforts to bring the budget back to surplus. Very reasonable questions. PK: You just said, though, you haven\u2019t made a decision on whether you will vote stage three down. Do you think it is wise to vote stage three down? JF: I stand by what I said earlier in the interview and what I\u2019ve said in earlier interviews as well. I think it\u2019s unwise for political parties to get between a taxpayer and a tax cut but that\u2019s exactly what the government is doing by knocking back what is a very reasonable and responsible position on our part. PK: Do you think personally think stage three is unfair? JF: I will deal with stage three as a member of the shadow cabinet. I think the government is under a lot of pressure here. The crossbench in the Senate is wavering, the government is getting very nervous. This presents us with a good opportunity to make the tax cut proposition better. PK: Do you think personally stage three is unfair? JF: I\u2019m not going to talk about stage three until we know whether we will have that debate. I\u2019m a member of the shadow cabinet and the shadow cabinet will take a position on that and I will, of course, support and abide by the shadow cabinet\u2019s position. Joel Fitzgibbon was talking to Patricia Karvelas when news of the caucus discussions started filtering out. Asked about leaking, Fitzgibbon had this to say: \u201cHe [Albanese] reminded people we have a quality team, and if we can maintain strong unity, we will be a strong force at the next election.\u201d PK: Did he make a point about the leak? JF: He emphasised the fact that it is important, when the party makes a decision we stick together on that decision and unity is a path to an election win in three years\u2019 time. PK: Do you worry there has been some leaking? JF: Of course, there has been some leaking. That\u2019s a matter of fact. When you get leaks from the senior ranks of the party, that is unhelpful to the party and its prospects. Like Anthony, I discourage people from leaking. I encourage people to back the collective decision. That\u2019s the best way forward. Of course, unity also gives us the best prospects of success at the next election. PK: Why are we seeing this? You can say, \u2018Don\u2019t do it\u2019 but you have to get to the heart of why it\u2019s happening. Why are we seeing this leaking? JF: I can\u2019t provide for you what\u2019s going on in the minds of people who have chosen to share information but we have gone through a very difficult period. Maybe for some people, this is a way of dealing with that pain, but look, I\u2019m confident that we will remain a united team, we\u2019ve been a united team for six years, we\u2019ll continue to be a united team and I believe we\u2019ll be a very powerful force at the next election. PK: It\u2019s interesting you say that because some Labor MPs have told me unity got them nowhere. They were unified under Bill Shorten and look at the result. What do you say to those MPs? JF: If any Labor MP is telling you that, you can count them on one hand. I suggest to you they lack experience because disunity is death, unity is strength and it\u2019s unity or a path of unity which will take us to success at the next election. PK: I\u2019m not saying you are a leaker but you did say people should be free to speak more freely \u2013 how does that fit into the unity message? JF: There are certain phases along the conversation to an eventual party decision and the point I was making is that people shouldn\u2019t be locked into positions earlier and, indeed, before a formal position is taken, people should feel freer to express their view, particularly in their electorates. I\u2019m a firm believer that once the party has taken a united position, a collective decision, people should be out there arguing for that position. Over in the caucus meeting, Anthony Albanese has spoken to his colleagues about leaks to the media. He\u2019s not impressed with those leaks, and has told the party to pull together. Labor is also looking at supporting an inquiry into religious freedoms. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese will be standing together for the first time since the election, at the traditional Last Post ceremony at the war memorial, ahead of the parliamentary year. Linda Reynolds, as defence minister, will also be there. Joel Fitzgibbon is on Afternoon Briefing. He\u2019s talking about Labor\u2019s position on the tax package and whether or not it will support the whole package if the parliament votes down its amendments. They are the government. They have a proposition before the parliament, a package of tax cuts. Are they prepared to deal with the tax cuts that come into effect immediately or through the course of the next three years or do they want to hold the parliament hostage and say we can\u2019t get all of our tax propositions through \u2013 people are pretty quick to come to the Labor party. The only reason our position matters so much is that the government has been unable to persuade the Senate crossbench of the merits of its tax proposal, particularly stage three. I think the onus is on the government. I think the pressure is on the government. They\u2019ve already missed their deadline on their promise to deliver tax cuts on 1 July. This coming Sunday, something like 700,000 Australians will be earning less for their Sunday work than they did last Sunday. They are under enormous pressure. We are giving them an opportunity to deliver on the tax cuts that are in the near term and it is absolutely reasonable for us to ask for more time to assess/research the impact of these largest tax cuts, which are effectively on the never-never, at a time when, of course, the economy is in trouble. And we want to know, if the economy continues to deteriorate and they are going to proceed with stage three, how will they be paid for and what other government services, what other government infrastructure, will have to be cut to pay for them? Looks like Screentime\u2019s TV pitch with Julie Bishop is done and dusted - Garrick is one of the producers with Screentime For anyone who is yet to read Niki Savva\u2019s book, Katharine Murphy has condensed down the five big reveals: And if the government says all or nothing, and the amendments fail? Look, we\u2019re going to put all of our effort into our amendments. If those amendments are unsuccessful, then we will consider our options at that point. So, if the amendments fail, Labor may consider passing the whole package. Jim Chalmers continues: If the government votes against our amendments tomorrow night, they will be voting against every Australian worker getting a tax cut this term. If the government votes against our amendments, they will be saying that tax cuts in five years\u2019 time are more important than tax cuts which could start this week. The government should stop holding tax cuts this week hostage to tax cuts which wouldn\u2019t come in until 2024-25. It\u2019s long past time for the government to take responsibility for this floundering economy, stop trying to shift the blame and point the finger and obsess over Labor, to take responsibility, to do something about this floundering economy \u2013 a good place to start would be supporting amendments which would give every Australian taxpayer, every Australian worker, a tax cut this term. The only proposal which is on the table right now, from any of the parties, which would give every Australian worker a tax cut this term, is Labor\u2019s. The Liberals are proposing tax cuts on the never-never. If we want to get serious about boosting this floundering economy, we need to do something about it, and Labor is proposing a constructive way forward. Jim Chalmers has emerged from the Labor caucus meeting - on stage three of the tax plan, Labor says no. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s responsible to sign up to Stage 3 of the tax cuts which cost $95 billion and don\u2019t come in for another five years. The economy is stalling on this government\u2019s watch. This is a third-term government in its sixth year. Economic growth has slowed substantially. Wages are stagnant. Consumption is weak. Consumer confidence is weak. The economy is floundering. And Middle Australia is struggling. And this government just wants to pretend that there\u2019s nothing wrong. This government just wants to pretend there\u2019s nothing wrong and to promise more of the same. More of the same cuts to penalty rates. More of the same tax cuts and infrastructure spending on the never-never. Well, Labor wants to give a boost to the economy right now. The economy desperately needs a shot in the arm. And Labor is proposing a way to get more tax cuts into the hands of more workers, and flowing into the economy sooner than what the government is proposing. So what the shadow cabinet and then the caucus have agreed today is to support Stages 1 and 2 of the government\u2019s tax package, but also to move amendments in the House, and then in the Senate, to bring forward part of Stage 2, and also to take Stage 3 out of the bills that are before the parliament. So the decision taken by shadow cabinet and by the caucus today is to move those amendments which give effect to our priorities, which are to give the economy a boost now - and it desperately needs it - to give every Australian worker a tax cut this term, and to hold off on committing $95 billion five years down the track. The Indigenous Advancement Strategy has a new name \u2013 but that\u2019s about all that has changed. From Ken Wyatt\u2019s office: The National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) was officially established today as an Executive Agency under the Prime Minister\u2019s portfolio, marking a new era of co-design and partnership. Minister for Indigenous Australians, the Hon Ken Wyatt AM, MP said the new agency represented a fundamental change in the way of doing business with Indigenous Australians by forming partnerships with Indigenous Australians at all levels, from children in remote communities to peak national organisations. \u201cEstablishing this agency solely dedicated to the advancement of Australia\u2019s First Nations is a significant opportunity for the Government to work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on the ground to provide opportunities for growth and advancement, in education, employment, suicide prevention, community safety, health and constitutional recognition.\u201d Minister Wyatt said. \u201cOver my life I have seen progress made but there is still more to do to find solutions and make a difference at the community level. \u201cThe NIAA will play a critical role in supporting me, as the first Indigenous Cabinet Minister and Minister for Indigenous Australians, to meet the changing needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, their leaders and communities\u201d Minister Wyatt said. \u201cAll of us must work together with State and Territory Governments to bring about change and close the gap in Indigenous communities.\u201d Minister Wyatt also announced that the inaugural Chief Executive Officer will be Mr Ray Griggs AO, CSC whose entire career has been in service to Australia and its peoples. *ends* For those wondering, Griggs is not indigenous. Meanwhile I know you all enjoy 2GB news. So you might enjoy learning that this petition not only exists, but Chris Smith is sending it out to people to sign, himself. It\u2019s the small things, really. The Labor caucus meeting is just about over \u2013 Jim Chalmers will be holding a press conference at 3.40. Expect this to be a recurring theme throughout this parliament And for those who missed it yesterday: Looks like that probe into Christopher Pyne\u2019s new appointment is happening: Not Australian politics, but a welcome lol anyway - if you haven\u2019t seen the #unwantedIvanka stream on Twitter as yet, you should check it out. That of course follows the *awkward* interaction the First Daughter had with world leaders at the G20. The start of the new financial year brings in a whole heap of changes \u2013 including for those forced on to the cashless debit card. From Rachel Siewart\u2019s office: \u201cUnfortunately, the concerns I raised regarding the exemption process back in April have come to pass and there are a lot of people who are very frustrated right now,\u201d Australian Greens spokesperson on Family and Community Services Senator Rachel Siewert said. \u201cNot only did the ALP collude with the Government to gag debate and rush the punitive Cashless Debit Card extension through the Senate in April, they gave false hopes to communities that they would make it easier to exit the program. \u201cAs feared, the Government has not provided a clear process or criteria for exiting the Cashless Debit Card if you can demonstrate \u2018reasonable and responsible management of financial affairs\u2019. \u201cThere are no timelines, no criteria, no transparency, apparently no appointments or forms to fill in, it sounds like the Government is operating on a wing and a prayer. \u201cPeople from around the country have been expressing hope that July 1 would be the date that they have the opportunity to get off this punitive card that is causing people on low incomes such hardship and once again they have been let down. \u201cPeople on low incomes are some of the best managers of money in the community, because every single dollar counts and this card just makes their life harder. \u201cIncome management is a failed measure \u2013 it failed to address disadvantage in the NT and it\u2019s failing now. \u201cThis is bad policy which is why the ALP ganged up with the Government to gag debate and the Senate didn\u2019t get a chance to debate this bill and scrutinise the exemption process.\u201d ICYMI the Australian has reported on Julie Bishop\u2019s (possible) next move \u2013 a walking conversation show, with global celebrities. The Conversation with Julie Bishop would see the former foreign affairs minister walking the streets of the guest\u2019s choice, having a chat. Here is what the Oz had to say about it: The ambitious and expensive format of Bishop\u2019s proposed show has been a source of amusement among penny-pinching network executives. Bishop\u2019s proposal for \u2018a dozen mobile cameras\u2019 to film walking and talking interviews between \u2018two great minds\u2019 in exotic locations around the world would certainly not come cheap. \u2018Host Julie Bishop, accustomed to disarming the most tricky of personalities, invites guests on lengthy ambling interviews filmed on the streets of a city of the guest\u2019s choice, in full view of passers-by,\u2019 the pitch documents say. \u2018This is pure conversation. Two great minds. No tricks. The strength of the show comes from the universal truth that we talk more deeply and naturally on the move \u2026 we take the powerful players out to the street where it all began. \u2018Where ideas can be shared in the cold light of day. The hustle and bustle of the world are invited into the conversation \u2013 what happens when a member of the public interrupts the interview to share their admiration for the guest? Kerryn Phelps is in the building (at least it looked like the former Wentworth MP) and my spies tell me Penny Wong has popped in to see Jacqui Lambie. The 46th parliament may not have officially begun, but it is absolutely under way. Japan will re-start commercial whaling after three decades. Peter Whish-Wilson wants Australia to push back: Having just hosted the G20 to discuss leadership on the big issues, Japan is flagrantly flouting international laws and conventions by walking away from the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and resuming commercial whaling, despite significant opposition and outrage. There is no need to hunt, kill and eat whales in this day and age. It is a cruel and barbaric process that is not supported by a commercially viable or sustainable industry. Whales are critical to the health of our oceans, and we need to continue to protect them from the many pressures they face such as pollution and overfishing. Many whale species have been brought back from the brink of extinction thanks to the IWC and a moratorium on commercial whaling. Australia showed leadership in the establishment and ongoing global movement to protect cetaceans, and must continue to do so. The Greens call on the Morrison government to condemn this development in the strongest possible terms. Now Japan has joined Norway, Iceland and other rogue nations in breaking away from the IWC, the international community must be vigilant in upholding the legitimacy of the IWC and its noble traditions and intentions. There is a real risk that a new federation of whaling nations, led by a wealthy and influential country like Japan, might undermine the legitimacy of the IWC by establishing a parallel pro-whaling commission. This would set back marine conservation a century, and set a terrible precedent in a time of extinction crisis. For those who missed it On medevac, Tony Burke had this to say: \u201cWhat Kristina [Keneally] has said, and I certainly hold to, which is the government has made no case at all as to why these laws should be scrapped. Not only that, the example of Peter Dutton as the boy who cried wolf, the exaggerations that we\u2019ve seen, the reopening of Christmas Island, being told that this was going to open the floodgates \u2013 all their tales of woe have not materialised. We\u2019ve got a law in place that says if someone in our care isn\u2019t well they need to get medical attention.\u201d Jacqui Lambie is the swing vote here. Expect a lot of lobbying from both sides. To the person who just asked me in the DMs how many coffees I actually drink a day (I guess it really is ask us anything), the answer is \u2013 depends on the day. Usually three. Sometimes six. I worked in hospitality for years and years and it doesn\u2019t keep me awake at night. I also drink about 10 cups of tea. OK. Back to politics. Labor is backing Rex Patrick\u2019s call for an inquiry into the compliance of former ministers who move into the private sector, with the code of conduct. Penny Wong had this to say about it this morning: I\u2019m not doing the prime minister\u2019s job for him. He has said to the Australian people, as the prime minister of the country, these are the standards of behaviour that I expect of ministers. All ministers agree to accept those standards and there are two aspects to these standards which are relevant. One is that you\u2019re not supposed to work in an 18-month period as a lobbyist or advocate or have business meetings with members of the government. But the second is you are not allowed to use knowledge that you have gained as a minister for that period of time in your work where that knowledge is not available to the general public. Now I think it is pretty difficult to understand how it is that Mr Pyne could have a job advising on Defence when he\u2019s only utilising knowledge that\u2019s available to members of the general public. Members of the general public haven\u2019t got this position. Caucus is meeting in about 45 minutes, so it will be one of the issues to be discussed there. For the record, Mathias Cormann was also asked about it this morning, also on ABC radio, and he had this to say about whether or not his former colleague was following the standards set down for former ministers: I am advised that is precisely what Christopher Pyne is doing,\u201d he said. Wong has asked him to release the advice. Don\u2019t hold your breath on that one. Tony Burke had a bit to say about how much the government has to say about Labor: Can I say the fact that the government spend more time talking about the Labor party than they spend talking about the Australian people reflects on them. It reflects on the government. We\u2019ve got the treasurer today who\u2019s got an article in one of the newspapers where there are, almost every paragraph, like the majority of paragraphs, refer to the Labor party. Now at some point they need to recognise the fact that they\u2019re meant to be governing for the Australian people. The partisan battle is part of what politics involves. It\u2019s part of what this building will always involve. But it shouldn\u2019t be the only thing that a government does. So I\u2019m not in control of what Scott Morrison will do. I know he\u2019s spent five weeks during the election campaign being happy so I suspect now he\u2019ll revert back to his comfortable place of anger, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll see once we get into the rhythm of question time again. But yes, they\u2019ll talk about the Labor party. That\u2019s what they\u2019ll do. We\u2019ll defend the Australian people and we\u2019ll be an opposition that\u2019s committed to that. From AAP: PRIORITIES FOR NEW GOVERNOR-GENERAL DAVID HURLEY * Engagement with communities \u201cHighlight to Australians their inherent strengths, their concern for the common good, their humanity and decency and the desire for a fair go.\u201d * Supporting organisations which help veterans, rural communities and asylum seekers. \u201cThere are countless organisations and people demonstrating how rich this country is every day.\u201d * Support for indigenous Australians, making Aurukun in Queensland his first official trip. \u201cHelping young indigenous men and women develop skills in their community, to go on to broader commitments to our country, is such an important thing.\u201d * Protecting democracy \u201cThe strength of this country is our democracy which brings stability, peace and certainty to all of us. That is worth protecting.\u201d And yes, John Setka has been given another 10 days\u2019 reprieve regarding his Labor party membership. Anthony Albanese had this to say about it a little earlier: He wrote to the national secretary of the party on Friday asking for additional time to consider his case. Some might say there is some \u2013 I\u2019ll leave it up to others to add some colour but the fact that he was tied up in dealing with the matters that were before the courts last week, he says that he hasn\u2019t had enough time to prepare his submission to the ALP National Executive. I don\u2019t want to get tied up in any technicalities with regard to this. So the National Executive committee have agreed to give Mr Setka extra time in terms of preparing his case and argument before the National Executive. So National Executive will now meet. Again, we\u2019ll have an ordinary meeting this Friday July the 5th. We will give Mr Setka an extra ten days to prepare his submission so we\u2019ll have a separate meeting by teleconference as provided for under the ALP rules on July the 15th. It is a fact that Mr Setka of course pleaded guilty to very serious charges of harassment. It\u2019s also a fact that his wife Emma Walters identified herself as the victim of that harassment that included 45 text messages which were of a nature that clearly, clearly put, I think, Mr Setka outside what the principles and values that Labor holds with regard to issues of domestic violence. With regard to his own assistant secretary, Shaun Reardon has resigned from the position of assistant secretary of the Victorian branch because his values, he has said, would be breached were he to stay in that position while Mr Setka remains as secretary. If Mr Setka was a rugby league player he would have been kicked out of his club over the revelations that have been made. He will be kicked out of the Australian Labor party because, quite frankly, his ongoing activities, statements and behaviour are not consistent with the membership values of the Australian Labor party. So that will occur on July the 15th but he\u2019ll be given every opportunity to put his argument before the party, as is appropriate. But I\u2019m very confident that the National Executive will agree with me that these values aren\u2019t consistent with his remaining membership of the Australian Labor party. For those asking about an Indigenous governor general, I think that so far the only Indigenous governor Australia has had was Sir Douglas Nicholls, who was appointed the governor of South Australia in 1976. On the question of Joe Hockey\u2019s attendance at the G20 \u2013 it is not uncommon for ambassadors to attend bilateral meetings, particularly if they are the ones who have the relationship. As for the travel, all of that is done through the departmental and embassy rules. Helloworld\u2019s contract was recently extended by the federal government for another two years. David Hurley then thanked those for their welcome: When I was sworn in as governor of New South Wales, the then premier, Mike Baird, made a comment in his speech that governors go to places that very few people in the country go to. I didn\u2019t quite comprehend that at the time. But after the last 4.5 years, we have been invited into so many lives across our country, across the state. It\u2019s just astounding. And I know we\u2019ll have exactly the same experience across Australia. I\u2019m in a difficult situation because over the last 4.5 years I said New South Wales is the best state in Australia and I would not tolerate any pushback on that. This is going to test me and my integrity, particularly with State of Origin coming up. But, again, I know what I saw and experienced that both of us saw and experienced in New South Wales, we will see writ large across our country. We are good people. Well-intentioned. Difficult issues to be faced, but I think with a good heart. So I look forward to being part of that. I look forward to being with Linda being able to make a contribution that I hope builds people, builds communities and points to a bright future. We have with us today the youngsters from the Conservatorium high school who will sing for us in a moment. Linda was their patron over the last 4.5 years. A fine example of just look at the faces. This country and the many eyes that look down on us there, and we\u2019re in good hands. One of the important jobs, of course, most important, is to ensure that the strength of our democracy is maintained. This is a position, this appointment, is critical to that. Of course it\u2019s apolitical. Of course you must be diligent in our performance of your duties. But at all times to stress to people that the strength of this country is our democracy which brings stability, peace and certainty to all of us. That is worth protecting. That shapes us. So to make our democracy work, to serve the people, to act as they expect us to act, and put their interests and those of the nation first, that\u2019s what we\u2019re called to do in service. That\u2019s what I\u2019m called to do with this appointment. That\u2019s what Linda and I will give our utmost to do. Thank you for coming here today. This is obviously - how would you describe a day like today?! Very nervous this morning. Settling down a bit now. But to be surrounded by family, friends and faces here I have known here for many, many years, we do thank you for coming. We do thank you for celebrating what this day means to our country, not about the person, but about the position and what the position offers. An important day in our history for that reason alone and thank you for sharing it with us. Anthony Albanese was next: This is a great honour which has been bestowed upon a great Australian and can say \u2013 you have begun extremely well. A very brave decision to begin in the Ngunnawal language which Tina indicated was done extremely well. So congratulations to you and on your first speech as governor general in accepting this great honour. You have, of course, served this nation with distinction for a long period of time. In particular, as head of the defence force and over four decades of service. You have served the great state of New South Wales with distinction as its governor. And we have absolute confidence that you\u2019ll serve this nation with distinction as our governor general. Can I congratulate the government on the choice of governor general \u2013 one that was accepted very much across the political spectrum. It must be said that you do have big shoes to fill. Sir Peter Cosgrove is one of the most outstanding Australians of recent decades. Time after time when this nation called upon Sir Peter to serve, he responded \u2013 on battlefields, when rebuilding after natural disasters or when exercising the important roles and responsibilities of the office that you now assume. So we wish Sir Peter and Lady Cosgrove well into the future and we thank him and Lady Cosgrove for their service. The Office of Governor General plays a critical role in our system of government. It is not just about the formal constitutional role important as that is, it\u2019s also about the role that the governor general plays in providing leadership, support and, indeed, inspiration to our community. We have faith that you will occupy this office for all Australians and exercise its powers in a way that unites and strengthens our nation. Sir Peter also delivered on these with good grace, good judgement and warmth. We know you\u2019ll be more than worthy of his example. When you took the first RAR into Badowa in 1993, the defence force hasn\u2019t deployed a battalion overseas since the Vietnam War. Operation Solace achieved is mission and you and the Australians under your command won international renown. And as chief of army and then chief of defence force, your leadership was authentic and ethical in a period with a complex a cultural challenge and as intense an operational environment as any since Vietnam. And Mrs Hurley, your profession of education and passion for music is already legendary and it will grace the office with distinction too. Scott Morrison has officially welcomed David Hurley: When Sir Paul Hasluck became governor general 50 years ago, he noticed the school children who came to visit Government House and wrote him letters asked him a very consistent question and they would say, \u201cWhat does the governor general do?\u201d It\u2019s something we know as parliamentarians that school children ask similar questions when we meet them here in the building. And it\u2019s an important question. There\u2019s an important answer. The answer is central to the stability of our system of democratic government. The Office of Governor General has provided the stability in spite of politics for more than a century. But the role goes beyond constitutional as his excellency indicated today in his own remarks. Years later, Sir Zelman Cowen answered that question when he said \u2013 the governor general interprets it is nation to itself and his excellency I think has started in such excellent fashion today in putting that very much at the forefront of his term. The governor general finds the good in this country and shines a light on it. In a global age of fragmentation and tribalism, we have in our system a constitutional office beyond politics that enables us all to come together. The joy of this role is who you meet every single day. Farmers getting on with their lives providing for their families and their communities despite crippling drought. Veterans recovering from their wounds that are seen and unseen. Teachers who work back late to give kids the best possible start in life. Those who care for our local environment and their communities, planting trees, picking up rubbish, keeping faith with our stewardship of the land. Researchers making the breakthroughs that not only we need as Australians, but the world needs. Brave heroes who will tell you they are not heroes. Selfless community workers who can\u2019t see their selflessness and to all those people enduring the moments and tragedy and triumph, they embody all of us. Our governor general \u2013 not just on tarmacs or daises such as this or platforms, but in classrooms, hospital wards and on drought-stricken farms, more than any role in public life the job of governor general is to bring Australians together, to remind us all of our social fabric and to uplift the discouraged and to give hope. To do that, you need to be a person of extraordinary character and in our retiring governor general and Lady Cosgrove, we had two such people, and with his excellency today and also with Mrs Hurley, we have been able to find two such people. Tina Brown has delivered the official welcome to country: In 1998, there were very many Indigenous people and our supporters from around Australia protesting at the opening of Parliament House. Back then, even Her Majesty, the Queen, encountered both cheers and jeers during the opening. To those today the celebration is a different matter. We celebrate this anniversary together. In contrast to the reception Her Majesty received, I, on behalf of the Ngunnawal, have been asked to conduct a traditional welcome and it is I who have the pleasure of acknowledging and welcome the Queen\u2019s representative and our very own governor general, his excellency David Hurley. And also the honourable Scott Morrison, prime minister of Australia. I also acknowledge our other distinguished guests that are here with us today. Many of you will know that Canberra is a local word meaning meeting place. Our oral stories and signs tell us we have been meeting on this land for 25,000 years, or more than 1,000 generations of my family. What a contrast to a such a modern democracy evolving on this ancient land. Our people have been able to maintain our long connection to the area because the country provided fresh air to breathe, clean water to drink, nourishing food to eat, and clothing and shelter, to keep us warm for our bitterly cold winters. It is on this once exacting land as extreme cold of the last ice age was easing that my ancestors fought their resilience and grew their knowledge of country and handed it off to those of us who followed the legacy of our ancestral beings and our creation stories and our responsibility for future of our people and country. They form pathways across this land to guide us, these pathways developed as our ancestors followed the river and creek corridors and ridges and spurs on the hills and mountains, linking our major spiritual and gathering places. Canberra itself \u2013 some of its modern roads and tracks \u2013 evolved from these ancient paths. The responsibility for the future of our people and our country now rests with all of us, which is why I\u2019m here today conducting this Welcome To Country. I am, too, playing a role in forging our modern Australia based on the best our ancestors and ancient continuous connection can bring to this evolving democratic nation. So on behalf of my extended family, and the elders of my people, and in recognition of all who have gone before me, I welcome you to the ancestral lands of the Ngunnawal. I welcome my Indigenous sisters and brothers, and all of our legacy tens of thousands of years in the making, I welcome our fellow Australians and the mingling of the dust of the bones of my ancestors and the dust of the bones of your ancestors for this now shape it is land uniting us all as custodians of the future for Australia. Welcome to the beautiful lands of the Ngunnawal, thank you. And this what was said in Hamburg in 2017 We will work with the private sector, in particular communication service providers and administrators of relevant applications, to fight exploitation of the internet and social media for terrorist purposes such as propaganda, funding and planning of terrorist acts, inciting terrorism, radicalizing and recruiting to commit acts of terrorism, while fully respecting human rights. Appropriate filtering, detecting and removing of content that incites terrorist acts is crucial in this respect. We encourage industry to continue investing in technology and human capital to aid in the detection as well as swift and permanent removal of terrorist content. In line with the expectations of our peoples we also encourage collaboration with industry to provide lawful and non-arbitrary access to available information where access is necessary for the protection of national security against terrorist threats. We affirm that the rule of law applies online as well as it does offline. We also stress the important role of the media, civil society, religious groups, the business community and educational institutions in fostering an environment which is conducive to the prevention of radicalisation and terrorism. And again in Turkey, in 2015: Our counter terrorism actions must continue to be part of a comprehensive approach based on addressing the conditions conducive to terrorism as stipulated in UN Security Council Resolution 2178, countering violent extremism, combatting radicalization and recruitment, hampering terrorist movements, countering terrorist propaganda and to prevent terrorists from exploiting technology, communications and resources to incite terrorist acts, including through the internet. The direct or indirect encouragement of terrorism, the incitement of terrorist acts and glorification of violence must be prevented. We recognize the need at all levels to work proactively to prevent violent extremism and support civil society in engaging youth and promoting inclusion of all members of society. The big win for Australia out of the G20 was the crackdown on social media companies. But let\u2019s watch that space. Because this is what the G20 said following Japan: The internet must not be a safe haven for terrorists to recruit, incite or prepare terrorist acts. We urge online platforms to meet our citizens\u2019 expectations that they must not allow use of their platforms to facilitate terrorism and [violent extremism conducive to terrorism]. Platforms have an important responsibility to protect their users. The complexity of the challenge \u2013 and increasing sophistication of the criminals who would misuse the internet \u2013 does not lessen the importance of platforms mitigating the proliferation of terrorist and VECT content, which harms society, via their platforms. Where terrorist content is uploaded or livestreamed, we underline the importance of online platforms addressing it, in a timely manner, to prevent proliferation, while ensuring that documentary evidence is preserved. We welcome online platforms\u2019 commitment to provide regular and transparent public reporting, as set out in their policies and procedures. But we went back to see what else they have said on this issue, previously ... There was a lot of news which came out of the Group of 20 meeting in Japan (and then after it, with Donald Trump\u2019s trip over the border to North Korea). But among the proclamations at the G20 was a statement to do better to protect whistleblowers: The effective protection of whistleblowers and handling of protected disclosures are central to promoting integrity and preventing corruption. Whistleblowers can play a significant role in revealing information that would otherwise go undetected, leading to improvements in the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of corruption. The risk of corruption is heightened in environments where reporting is not facilitated and protected. The need for effective protection of whistleblowers is already recognised in international and regional instruments. However, implementation of these standards varies significantly across jurisdictions. In addition, some jurisdictions have legislated to protect whistleblowers but many have little or no form of protection. The resulting fragmented approach leads to a lack of predictability and a general misunderstanding about the scope and purpose underlying protection regimes, ultimately discouraging disclosures by whistleblowers and impairing the effective enforcement of anti-corruption laws in G20 countries. Protecting whistleblowers is a priority issue for Japan\u2019s 2019 G20 Presidency, which aims to respond to the 2019-2021 Action Plan of the G20 Anti-Corruption Working Group\u2019s (ACWG) call to \u201cassess and identify best practices, implementation gaps and possible further protection measures as appropriate.\u201d You can read more, here Given that medevac is back on the agenda, and David Hurley\u2019s line about asylum seekers in his speech, I recommend you read this piece from yesterday, if you haven\u2019t already. For those asking, there is no question time until Thursday. Tomorrow is the opening of the parliament. There are a lot of speeches. And swearing-ins. Then, Wednesday will be taken up with condolence motions, including for Bob Hawke. Then it is question time. And then parliament breaks for two weeks. If you have a question for us, maybe put \u201cask us anything\u201d in bold, so I can find it in the comments, or send through the tweets. The 21 gun salute has finished (and now I know what parliament sounds like if it was ever under attack) and we are done with the official bits. Now it is the official welcome and the mingling and the photos and the hand shaking. All 227 MPs are in attendance \u2013 151 MPs, 76 Senators \u2013 and the newbies will be officially sworn in over the coming days. Hurley\u2019s first job, tomorrow, will be opening parliament. He\u2019ll deliver the agenda speech, which is written by the government, laying out the plans for the term. It\u2019s on behalf of the Queen, and it is all a bit weird, but hey \u2013 that\u2019s Westminster traditions for you. David Hurley finishes with: \u201cAlong the shores of Circular Quay in Sydney, there are a number of large brass plaques honouring famous authors who have either written in or written about Australia. To me, one in particular sends a profound message to us today. David Malouf, an Australian author, is the son of a Lebanese father and British-born mother of Portuguese descent. A proudly diverse background that is representative of so many Australian families. His plaque reads in part: Australia is still revealing itself to us. We ought not close off possibilities by declaring too early what we have already become. Australia is not a finished product. I look forward, with Linda, and in working with you and exploring our nation\u2019s future possibilities. I am extremely proud of my country and greatly honoured to become its governor general today. David Hurley: We can be informed by many sources of the ills of our society, it is important that we are reminded of its goodness. In my closing speeches as governor, I highlighted the richness of our society, not richness in a material sense, but a richness of spirit. I have seen this richness of spirit at work in the people and the organisations assisting our veterans, our rural communities under stress, asylum seekers who we have welcomed into our country and our indigenous brothers and sisters. There are countless organisations and people demonstrating how rich this country is every day. As governor general, I am committed absolutely to supporting these people in their work. I know that I will be doing so, I will follow on and build on the work of Sir Peter Cosgrove and Lady Cosgrove. Driven by the timeless notions of public service and working for the common good, they undertook a daunting program of engagement over the last five years. I thank them on behalf of all Australians for their dedication, their commitment and contribution to the nation and wish them well in the next phase of their lives. My emphasis on community engagement will sit alongside the critical constitutional role performed by the governor general. Australia has an enviable record as a parliamentary democracy. David Hurley\u2019s first words as GG are in the Ngunnawal dialect, which he spoke with permission. I acknowledge the traditional owners of this land on which we meet, the Ngunnawal people, and pay my respects to the elders, past and present, emerging leaders and all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders gathered here today. Prime minister, the honourable Tony Smith, speaker of the house, senator the honourable Scott Ryan, president of the Senate, the honourable Susan Kiefel of the high court of Australia. The honourable Anthony Albanese, leader of the opposition, members of the ministry, members of the Australian parliament, members of the diplomatic corps, chief of the defence force and senior defence leaders, department of secretaries, distinguished guests and my fellow Australians, the 20th governor general of Australia once described the role of governor general of depicting a nation to its people. During the last four and a half years as governor of New South Wales, I tried to build a significant theme to explain in part the important role that governors and the governor general play. Through their engagement with communities, Australians can be provided with the reflection of themselves and of their country. Through speeches, supportive visits and the conduct of events, of encouragement and recognition, the governor general can highlight to Australians their inherent strengths, their concern for the common good, their humanity and decency and the desire for a fair go. So after five years, three months and, I think, three days as her majesty\u2019s surrogate in Australia, Peter Cosgrove has finished up as governor general. And with an oath of alliance and an oath of office, administered by chief justice Susan Kiefel, David John Hurley is the 27th governor general of Australia. Tony Burke has pushed back his press conference to 11.45, because of the swearing-in. I missed this last week, but speaking of medevac, Peter Dutton has taken back control of the decisions from David Coleman. Here is what he told David Speers on Sky on the 20th: Mr Coleman\u2019s obviously had this area of responsibility for a period of time and I\u2019ve take it back since the machinery of government changes since the election. So in some of those cases, I think, you could question whether or not people needed medical attention, that\u2019s the reality of it, and there has historically, from my firsthand knowledge of looking at some of these cases, that has been the case. Where people have come seeking medical attention, when they\u2019ve arrived it\u2019s not been sought or they\u2019ve dispensed with the niceties pretty quickly and now that they\u2019re here in Australia, they know they can\u2019t be sent back. So of the 1,000 here \u2026 there are many people who have come to support a family member. There\u2019s not a thousand people who have come seeking medical attention or seeking medical attention. There are some people suffering psychological issues where it is advised that there should be loved ones or support, friends or family that come with them. That has reduced dramatically but that as it was over the last couple of years at different points in time \u2026 David Speers: But they\u2019re all now living in the community, right? Dutton: Many of them are, unless they\u2019ve committed an offence since they\u2019ve been here, in which case they would have gone back into detention, but it\u2019s part of the way in which we\u2019ve been able to get all the children out of detention and off Nauru, that\u2019s been very important \u2026 Speers: Through medical transfers? Dutton: Yeah, that\u2019s been part of it. The Labor caucus is meeting later today (probably early afternoon) ahead of parliament getting under way tomorrow. This morning Penny Wong told Fran Kelly that Labor\u2019s position on the tax cuts was not shifting: Well, our position is clear: we want to deliver a tax cut to all Australians by the end of the week and the only party that\u2019s putting forward a position that delivers that is the Labor party. What is occurring is that the government isn\u2019t just content with breaking its promise to deliver tax cuts by the first of July \u2013 something that Scott Morrison failed to do, despite promising it \u2013 but they want to hold tax cuts for this term hostage to tax cuts after the next election. So we are absolutely up for, by Thursday night, delivering a tax cut to all Australians. It\u2019s the government that is holding those hostage to a political agenda about what they want to do in the next term. David Hurley, with a lot of medals, has been welcomed into Parliament House. He\u2019s walking in with Scott Morrison. They\u2019ll head into the Senate for the formal swearing-in. Tony Burke is up at 11.30 to talk penalty rates. And yes, I have seen what you are saying in the comments about Labor being pushed on the tax cuts, and what about the government? The reason Labor has a box seat in this is because the government doesn\u2019t have the numbers in the Senate. So it is either Labor or the crossbench. The government is claiming a mandate, because the tax plan was probably one of the only policies it had at the election. Labor is saying the government only has a mandate for this term, not the one after that (the stage three doesn\u2019t come in until 2024), hence the debate. But it looks like the crossbench is coming close to a decision, so it\u2019ll all most likely be over soon anyway. The Labor national executive is meeting at the end of the week, which is when John Setka\u2019s membership was meant to be discussed \u2013 and by discussed we mean cancelled. But it looks like there will be a stay of execution on that: This is honestly the most reliable way to travel from Sydney to Canberra - the airport is usually an absolute cluster because of fog, and you end up delayed for up to three hours anyway at this time of year. David Hurley will be sworn in at 10.25. The front of parliament is currently closed while they do the official welcome \u2013 it is all the pomp and ceremony. Then Hurley will be sworn in, in the Senate \u2013 because that is where the Queen\u2019s chair is (she is not allowed in the House of Reps). I guess it depends on the context - it didn\u2019t matter at the election, but having said that, the election result is basically a return to the status quo of 2016. The pendulum didn\u2019t shift all that much, it was just the expectations on Labor were much higher. But I think it is important to understand the history of events, and in that context, I do think the book matters. It hasn\u2019t been the greatest start to the week, or parliament, for Mathias Cormann. Niki Savva\u2019s new book, Plots and Prayers, which details Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s downfall as prime minister and Scott Morrison\u2019s rise, doesn\u2019t exactly paint Cormann in the greatest light. Cormann declined to be interviewed for the book. Which makes his complaints this morning to ABC radio that it was \u201cmostly inaccurate or one sided\u201d sort of moot. The book paints him as instrumental in the leadership spill last year, and that his decision to withdrew support from Turnbull was \u201cdeliberately staged and timed\u201d to force the spill. Asked if he was a \u201cpolitical Judas\u201d on ABC radio this morning, Cormann said: \u201cIt was a difficult week. \u201cI made decisions based on what I felt was right, on the basis of what I thought was necessary, and in the best interests of the country and the government and the Liberal party.\u201d He went on: We have determined the following position: Stage one \u2013 of course, we will continue to support that stage and express disappointment that the government has breached its clear commitment to bring in stage one by July 1. That was one of the very clear statements that they made during the federal election campaign. For stage two \u2013 we\u2019re calling for the government to increase the \u2013 for the increase of the 37% threshold from $90,000 to $120,000 that is already legislated but is down the track, to bring that forward to 2019-20. This would provide up to $1,350 for all those above $90,000. The costing of that is less than $3.7bn. That\u2019s based upon the government\u2019s own indications of what that would cost come 2022, when that change is due to come in under the already-legislated tax cuts. So obviously the figure would be \u2013 would be less than that figure. The third thing that we\u2019re saying is the infrastructure investment should be brought forward. This has been proposed by the Reserve Bank of Australia. We know that there are a range of road and rail packages that could be brought forward because they\u2019re ready to go right now. Projects including here in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Projects in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. The government could, of course, put money into a project like the Melbourne Metro, which is what we proposed during the election campaign, in order to speed up the delivery of that project. But we\u2019re prepared to sit down with the government and identify projects, some of which were committed to by both sides of politics during the election campaign, but in the case of projects like Link Field Road in Brisbane\u2019s northern suburbs, due to commence around about 2027 in terms of actual shovels in the ground \u2013 we know that projects like that are necessary now and we think that a bring-forward of the government\u2019s proposed infrastructure investment would assist the economy, create jobs right now, help to boost productivity into the future. If the government is prepared to do that, in terms of stages one and stages two, while deferring stage three\u2019s consideration to the following sitting of parliament or whenever they deemed fit to debate it \u2013 some time between now and 2024-25 when it\u2019s due to commence, then we would facilitate the passage of those stages through the parliament next week. We would facilitate the passage through the House of Representatives before question time next Thursday, given that Tuesday will be largely ceremonial and Wednesday\u2019s sitting will be devoted to the commemoration of Bob Hawke. So we think that these issues should be considered separately. We think that stage three at a cost of some $95bn down the track for an economy which is very soft at the moment, which no one can say what the economy looks like in 2024-25, is really a triumph of hope over economic reality. What we know right now is that the economy needs stimulus. And what we\u2019re looking for here is solutions rather than arguments. I have said as I have gone around the country that the country has conflict fatigue. They want to see us getting on with delivering real outcomes. This is a genuine approach by Labor, a constructive approach, and I hope that the government receives it as such. We have already had some discussions with the crossbench about supporting a proposal such as this and I believe it would be a good thing for the country if we had unanimity across the parliament about a package such as the one that we\u2019re putting forward here today. Anthony Albanese has been talking tax: Today, 700,000 workers lose their penalty rates. They are rates they rely upon to put food on the table, to put petrol in their car, to pay the school fees for their kids. The fact is that at a time where wages are not keeping up with the costs of living for so many Australian families, this is a blow to them \u2013 but it is also a blow to the national economy. The Reserve Bank have indicated that the economy is softening. They recently cut interest rates and tomorrow they will meet again. It will be interesting to see whether they cut interest rates again. What this economy needs is stimulus. The Reserve Bank, of course, when they cut interest rates, spoke about how monetary policy couldn\u2019t do all of the job. And that\u2019s the context \u2013 we need action now and some of the government\u2019s proposals, of course, are off in the never-never. What we have determined this morning to do is to propose a negotiating position to the government which would bring forward tax cuts faster for those who will spend it, to stimulate demand in the economy. Welcome to the first (semi) official day of the 46th parliament. The MPs are back in town and so are we, and it will no doubt be a bumpy ride. Today is mostly formalities \u2013 finishing to set up offices, swearing in David Hurley as the new governor general, finding where to get coffee \u2013 you know, the important things. Tax is once again the big agenda item, because in Australian politics, everything old is new again. Labor is still holding out on passing the total package \u2013 it wants the third tranche reviewed, but the government is holding firm on the \u201call or nothing\u2019\u201d deal it wants, which means all eyes are on Jacqui Lambie. And not just for the tax bill. Lambie will also be the decider on the future of the medevac bill. So far the Tasmanian senator is not saying which way she intends to vote on anything. So stay tuned. But given the slightly mishmash nature of the day as everyone gets ready for parliament\u2019s official opening tomorrow, we thought we would take the opportunity to offer an \u201cask us anything\u201d day. We\u2019ll bring you the news but, if there is anything else you\u2019ve ever wanted to know about the parliament, the Guardian brains trust, Mike Bowers and his ill-advised musk stick love, whatever \u2013 drop us a question in the comments, or tweet me at @amyremeikis. You\u2019ll find behind-the-scenes updates @pyjamapolitics as Bowers and I troll each other throughout the day. I am going to find my second coffee for the morning, so have a think and get back to us. In the meantime \u2013 let\u2019s get into it.",

      "bodyText": "The peculiarities of tennis throw up some nice problems. When better to ponder them than on the opening day of Wimbledon? 1) Ashleigh Barty and Naomi Osaka are playing a set of tennis. In the last eight points, Barty has served seven aces and Osaka has served one. What\u2019s the score? 2) Let\u2019s say Wimbledon abolishes seeds, and each of the 128 players in the men\u2019s singles is assigned a position in the first round grid at random. And let\u2019s assume that the best player will beat everyone, and that the second-best player will beat everyone except the best player. What are the chances that the second-best player is the championship\u2019s runner-up? 3) Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer are playing in the Wimbledon final. Djokovic wins the first set 6-3. If there were 5 service breaks in the set, who served the first game? (A service break is a game won by the non-server. Service changes with each game.) I\u2019ll be back at 5pm with the solutions.

Like Germaine Greer before her, she regards HRT as an instrument of the patriarchy, which requires women neither to fall prey to the mood swings that can accompany the menopause nor to allow their vaginas to become too insufficiently pliable for sex. Personally, I think this is a depressingly retrograde argument, and a pretty stupid one, too. You might as well describe the pill, which also fiddles helpfully with a woman\u2019s hormones, as an instrument of the patriarchy. Even if HRT carries with it certain risks, it isn\u2019t remotely on a par with the unnecessary, rip-off vaginal rejuvenation laser treatments about which Steinke hears, to her disgust, at a conference in Amsterdam.

      "body": "<p><strong>Q</strong> My daughter-in-law has been approached by her neighbour who would like to purchase her garage which is in a small compound. She asked her mortgage lender whether she could have the garage removed from the deed so she could sell it privately. They refused saying that the mortgage was granted on the whole property which includes the garage. The value of her home far exceeds what she owes. Is there anything she can do?<br><strong>JL</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Unfortunately, if you have a mortgage on a property, you can\u2019t sell part of it \u2013 whether that\u2019s a garage or outhouse or part of the garden \u2013 without the consent of your lender. That\u2019s because a lender has a charge over the whole of the property and if you were to sell off part of it, the lender would have to agree to release that part of the title to the property (what you call the deed) from the charge which is what they have as security for the mortgage loan. </p> <p>A lender is unlikely to give consent to a part sale if the value of the property minus the part being sold off is less than the mortgage loan. A lender is also unlikely to give consent if \u2013 assuming there was no longer a garage - the mortgage would represent a higher percentage of the value of the property than the percentage of the property\u2019s value when the original mortgage was granted. </p> <p>However, if, as you say, the value of your daughter-in-law\u2019s home far exceeds the amount remaining on the mortgage, it might be worth her while getting a valuation of her property done assuming no garage and going back to her lender to see if it was willing to reconsider.</p> <p>But if the reason the lender won\u2019t give consent is that there is a \u201crestrictive covenant\u201d included in the title which prohibits the separation or sale of the garage from the main part of the property, there\u2019s nothing your daughter-in-law can do. But given that having a garage typically adds around 5% to the value of a property, selling the garage to her neighbour might not be the best thing to do anyway. If she is interested in the cash injection that selling her garage would give her, she could instead increase her mortgage \u2013 either with her current or a new lender \u2013 but hold on to the garage.</p> <p><br><strong>Muddled about mortgages?

      "bodyText": "Q My daughter-in-law has been approached by her neighbour who would like to purchase her garage which is in a small compound. She asked her mortgage lender whether she could have the garage removed from the deed so she could sell it privately. They refused saying that the mortgage was granted on the whole property which includes the garage. The value of her home far exceeds what she owes. Is there anything she can do? JL A Unfortunately, if you have a mortgage on a property, you can\u2019t sell part of it \u2013 whether that\u2019s a garage or outhouse or part of the garden \u2013 without the consent of your lender. That\u2019s because a lender has a charge over the whole of the property and if you were to sell off part of it, the lender would have to agree to release that part of the title to the property (what you call the deed) from the charge which is what they have as security for the mortgage loan. A lender is unlikely to give consent to a part sale if the value of the property minus the part being sold off is less than the mortgage loan. A lender is also unlikely to give consent if \u2013 assuming there was no longer a garage - the mortgage would represent a higher percentage of the value of the property than the percentage of the property\u2019s value when the original mortgage was granted. However, if, as you say, the value of your daughter-in-law\u2019s home far exceeds the amount remaining on the mortgage, it might be worth her while getting a valuation of her property done assuming no garage and going back to her lender to see if it was willing to reconsider. But if the reason the lender won\u2019t give consent is that there is a \u201crestrictive covenant\u201d included in the title which prohibits the separation or sale of the garage from the main part of the property, there\u2019s nothing your daughter-in-law can do. But given that having a garage typically adds around 5% to the value of a property, selling the garage to her neighbour might not be the best thing to do anyway. If she is interested in the cash injection that selling her garage would give her, she could instead increase her mortgage \u2013 either with her current or a new lender \u2013 but hold on to the garage.

      "bodyText": "7am: take an aerated, plastic-free shower Britons use 840bn litres of water a year showering, with some power showers using up to 15 litres a minute. Aerator shower heads, such as Lowenergie\u2019s (\u00a312.99), save water by acting as a sieve, reducing space for the water to flow through while maintaining water pressure. Microbeads were banned in the UK last year, but most soaps are still wrapped in plastic. Seek out alternatives. Aerende\u2019s bergamot and mint wool soap (\u00a312) is handmade by young people in Hertfordshire with disabilities, wrapped in wool from Herdwick sheep, packaged in recycled paper and contains no parabens. 7.20am: clean your teeth with a bamboo toothbrush The average person uses 300 toothbrushes in their lifetime, with an estimated 80% ending up in the sea. Zero Waste\u2019s bamboo, replaceable-head toothbrushes are 100% biodegradable and made from sustainable bamboo (\u00a36.99). Use with a zero-waste toothpaste such as Georganics\u2019 natural toothpowder (\u00a36.90), which is free from peroxides and comes in a recyclable glass jar. 7.25am: borrow your wardrobe The UK sends an estimated 300,000 tonnes of clothing to landfill each year. If you are not going to wear an item at least 30 times, don\u2019t buy it. Instead, consider renting (try hirestreetuk.com or frontrow.uk.com). If you do buy new, use the app Good on You to check clothing brands\u2019 sustainability rating. The charity Traid will collect old clothes free of charge for its shops in London, Hertfordshire, Surrey and Brighton. The global footwear industry emits 700m tonnes of CO2 a year. AllBirds is a favourite of actors Ashton Kutcher and Amy Adams, and uses sugarcane, sheep\u2019s wool and recycled bottles to make its carbon-neutral trainers. You can recycle old trainers at Runners Need. 7.35am: eat local, eat wonky Help eliminate food waste by purchasing a \u201cwonky\u201d veg box from Odd Box (from \u00a39.95) or one of Lidl\u2019s Too Good to Waste boxes (\u00a31.50). Alternatively, search Social Farms &amp; Gardens to see how you can get involved at your local community farm. 8am: feed your dog insects Pets are estimated to consume about 20% of the world\u2019s meat and fish. Reduce your dog\u2019s environmental impact with Yora (\u00a313.99), a protein-packed food made from insects, oats and potato. 8.10am: cycle to work According to Sam Jones of Cycling UK, only 2% of all journeys in England are taken by bike. Happily, the government has just refreshed its Cycle to Work scheme, extending the tax-free savings to ebikes over \u00a31,000. These have integrated motors, making the scheme more accessible for those with a lower level of fitness or a longer commute. 10am: have an eco-friendly tea break Make the office a cuppa with an eco-friendly kettle. Vektra\u2019s vacuum eco kettle (\u00a359.95) keeps water hot for four hours, so you don\u2019t have to waste power and water by repeat-boiling. 11am: go green with office supplies Dr Neil Jennings of the Grantham Institute for climate change and the environment at Imperial College London recommends setting your office printers to double-sided, and automating systems to power down over the weekend and evenings. 12.45pm: switch to an eco-friendly bank Since the Paris agreement was adopted, the world\u2019s biggest banks have poured $1.9tn into financing the fossil fuel industry. Make the switch on your lunch break \u2013 Triodos Bank invests in social and environmental initiatives and publishes details of where it invests. 1pm: enjoy a sustainable lunch Cook once, eat twice and bring leftovers for lunch. A vegan\u2019s carbon footprint is half that of a meat-eater\u2019s, but if you can\u2019t face forgoing animal products then cut down. Researchers have found that eating just one vegetarian meal a week for a year saves the greenhouse-gas equivalent of driving 1,160 miles. Ditch the tupperware: transport sarnies in black+blum\u2019s stainless steel sandwich box with bamboo lid (\u00a329.95). 3pm: have a guilt-free loo break Don\u2019t flush anything that isn\u2019t biodegradable, to avoid feeding fatbergs, which block sewers and cost the UK about \u00a3100m annually. Flushable wipes and chemical-free sanitary products can be found at Natracare. 4pm: save some trees with your search engine Only about 30% of the Earth\u2019s forests remain. Change your homepage to Ecosia, which has servers that run on 100% renewable energy and uses its profits to plant trees \u2013 almost 60 million of them, so far. 6pm: go green with your housework Many household cleaning products are filled with toxins, so get creative and make your own. A combination of baking soda, vinegar and essential oils is perfect for scrubbing floors, bathrooms and kitchens. Avoid air fresheners \u2013 most emit more than 100 chemicals, some of which may be pollutants. Lola Grogan, founder of the Eco Laundry, recommends Sonnet, which offers ecologically conscious bleaches and laundry products. A typical 6kg wash load of acrylic fabric releases more than 700,000 plastic fibres into the sea, where they are eaten by fish and, eventually, us. \u201cOnly wash clothes when you have a full load, and at low temperatures \u2013 higher temperatures can mean more fibres are released,\u201d says Grogan. Most washing machines don\u2019t have filters, so invest in a microfibre-trapping laundry device, such as the Cora Ball (\u00a329). 7pm: tuck into a waste\u2011free dinner Opt for a fridge with an A+++ energy label, which shaves about 5% off an average household\u2019s electricity bill when replacing an A+ fridge. Freezers cut food waste by almost 50% and are more efficient when fully stocked. Use a lid to cover pots on the stove, reducing energy use by two-thirds and heating food faster. And don\u2019t be a microwave snob \u2013 it is a more eco-friendly way to reheat food. 8pm: streamline your streaming Stream films through a smart TV rather than a less energy-efficient games console. The US nonprofit the National Resources Defense Council found that the PS4 and Xbox One required 30 to 45 times more power to stream a film than players such as Apple TV, Google Chromecast and Amazon Fire TV. Depending on your music habits, listening to CDs may be more environmentally friendly than doing it digitally. Research by Bach Technology in 2012 showed that streaming an album 27 times can use more energy than creating and posting a CD to a consumer. 10pm: makeover your makeup routine Reusable face pads (try cheekywipes.com) can be used to remove makeup and then machine washed. When it is time to reapply, go for Ecotools\u2019 makeup brushes, made from recycled bamboo, plastic and aluminum and packaged in recycled paper. 11pm: sleep in bamboo-fibre bed sheets Get some shut-eye in cotton/bamboo bedding from Urban Collective (from \u00a3116.99). Bamboo is fast-growing and self-replenishing, consuming one-third the amount of water during the growing process than cotton. It also has antibacterial properties.

About three-quarters of the state\u2019s 30 million-strong population is involved in agriculture, with wheat the number one commodity.

Over the past two years, more than 900 Punjabi farmers have killed themselves, and the state has the highest rates of cancer in India. A government survey estimates that more than two-thirds of households have <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-38824478\">at least one drug addict in the family</a>. Added to this is the burden of paying off loans that many farmers take out from unofficial lenders at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/world/asia/after-farmers-commit-suicide-debts-fall-on-families-in-india.html\">exorbitant interest rates</a>.</p> <p>Locals blame it all on \u201czeher\u201d \u2013 poison.</p> <p>\u201cOur lives are being destroyed because of the contamination of the land and people,\u201d says Surinder Kumar, the \u201csarpanch\u201d or village head of Langroya. \u201cThere are so many problems facing us that I don\u2019t even know where to begin.

Our film makes a direct connection between the overuse of chemicals, which has damaged agriculture and pushed many farmers into debt, and drug addiction. Not only is farming becoming poisoned in Punjab, so is society.\u201d</p> <p>The film traces the roots of Punjab\u2019s demise to the state\u2019s green revolution of the 1970s, when new farming practices were introduced to increase production and profits.

      "bodyText": "The road to Langroya village weaves its way through fields rich with crops that offer a vivid snapshot of India\u2019s kitchens. There is wheat, rice, sugarcane, maize, mustard seed and a rich variety of vegetables that have made this corner of the country India\u2019s most important agricultural region. Like the majority of their compatriots in Punjab, Langroya\u2019s residents rely on farming for their existence. About three-quarters of the state\u2019s 30 million-strong population is involved in agriculture, with wheat the number one commodity. But while Punjab is known as \u201cIndia\u2019s bread basket\u201d, there are challenges amid the abundance. The list of concerns includes withering land, chronic illnesses, water shortages and an opioid drug epidemic that has wreaked havoc on village life. Over the past two years, more than 900 Punjabi farmers have killed themselves, and the state has the highest rates of cancer in India. A government survey estimates that more than two-thirds of households have at least one drug addict in the family. Added to this is the burden of paying off loans that many farmers take out from unofficial lenders at exorbitant interest rates. Locals blame it all on \u201czeher\u201d \u2013 poison. \u201cOur lives are being destroyed because of the contamination of the land and people,\u201d says Surinder Kumar, the \u201csarpanch\u201d or village head of Langroya. \u201cThere are so many problems facing us that I don\u2019t even know where to begin. The politicians make a lot of promises, but the reality is that little is being done to help us. The very fabric of our existence is under threat.\u201d In an attempt to address Punjab\u2019s plight, a new film explores the roots of its problems. Directed by Rehmat Rayatt and Leva Kwestany, Toxification tells the moving stories of farmers at the sharp end of the chemical epidemic engulfing the state. Rayatt, a British-born film-maker of Punjabi origin, said: \u201cThe farmers are poisoning their bodies and their land. Our film makes a direct connection between the overuse of chemicals, which has damaged agriculture and pushed many farmers into debt, and drug addiction. Not only is farming becoming poisoned in Punjab, so is society.\u201d The film traces the roots of Punjab\u2019s demise to the state\u2019s green revolution of the 1970s, when new farming practices were introduced to increase production and profits. This involved the sustained use of chemical pesticides, insecticides and fertilisers, which has continued unchecked and without adequate guidance from experts. Punjab utilises the highest amount of chemical fertilisers in India. Many of the pesticides sprayed on the state\u2019s crops are classified as class I by the World Health Organization because of their acute toxicity and are banned in places around the world, including Europe. A range of studies have shown that the overuse of chemicals has found its way into Punjab\u2019s food, water and soil and had a devastating impact on public health. There are at least 90 cancer patients for every 100,000 people in Punjab compared with the national average of 80. \u2019 Balbir Singh, a farmer, admits in the film to using illegal pesticides. \u201cSome people use pesticides without understanding why, hoping that their crops won\u2019t die,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know we are killing our land and our people, but what can we do without them?\u201d The film examines the role that more organic-based farming techniques, which were widely used in the state prior to the green revolution, can play in restoring Punjab\u2019s agricultural fortunes. Some of the most moving testimonies featured in Toxification are made by farmers talking about their descent into drug addiction. Many take opium husk, known as \u201cbhuki\u201d, which helps to kill the appetite, enabling them to work for longer in the fields. Heroin is also widely used in villages. In 2017, a government study suggested that more than 860,000 men in the state aged between 15 and 35 take some form of drug. Punjab is not the only state in India affected by the excessive use of chemicals in agriculture. Nationally, the government\u2019s response has been to establish pest management research centres, which provide guidance to farmers on how to minimise the use of pesticides. The centres have drawn criticism, however, for being underfunded and poorly staffed. Earlier this year, Punjab\u2019s state government banned 20 pesticides deemed harmful to human health but did not provide details on how the edict would be enforced. The substances remain available across the rest of India. Toxification was shown at the Ottawa film festival and screenings are planned in Britain. Rayatt also hopes to show the film in India in the hope that it will prompt politicians to take action to alleviate the suffering of Punjabi farmers and their counterparts across the rest of the country.",

      "body": "<p>President Trump is at it again. He promised to extricate the United States from endless war in the Middle East and still says that\u2019s the goal. Yet he is taking almost every action, short of launching new invasions, to bring war upon us. In addition to defying Congress\u2019s demand to cease support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, he is holding the Iranian people hostage through draconian sanctions, demanding extreme and ill-defined concessions to make the suffering stop.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s schizophrenic foreign policy is almost too easy to criticize. It confounds Democrats much as Trump\u2019s domestic policy did in 2016: the target seems so exposed that it\u2019s actually difficult to land on a line of attack. In the first Democratic debates, candidates alternately accused Trump of accommodating adversaries (Russia and North Korea) and trying to crush them (Iran). Is the greater problem that Trump is alienating allies or that he\u2019s indulging those like Saudi Arabia? The American people <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_trump_job_approval_foreign_policy-6183.html\">strongly disapprove</a> of Trump\u2019s handling of foreign policy, but they cannot hear every message at once.</p> <p>Democrats have a unique opportunity to close the traditional national-security gap with Republicans, but only if they choose a clear direction for foreign policy and not just against Trump. They should listen to the American people and offer them a genuinely pro-peace message \u2014 standing firmly against Trump\u2019s bellicosity as well as decades of bipartisan military intervention. This was the message some voters heard from Trump last time. Now Trump has failed to deliver, and Democrats can capitalize on that.</p> <p>Case in point: the American public overwhelmingly supports Trump\u2019s decision to call off airstrikes designed to retaliate against Iran after it shot down an American drone. A mere 36% favored a strike even in the heat of the moment, when <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/25/trump-iran-poll-1378852\">Politico conducted a poll.</a> The number was even smaller \u2014 23% \u2014 among Democrats. Although the national-security commentariat casts Iran as a grave enemy, carrying on a grudge match that dates to the 1979 revolution that ousted the brutal, <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/20/64-years-later-cia-finally-releases-details-of-iranian-coup-iran-tehran-oil/\">CIA-backed shah</a>, ordinary Americans don\u2019t nurse the same resentments. As a <a href=\"https://egfound.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/EGF-WorldsApart-2019.pdf\">recent study found</a>, a tiny minority, 8%, would opt for military action if Iran were to resume its nuclear weapons program. Six times as many would either tolerate a nuclear Iran while negotiations resumed or actually believe that Iran has the right to develop a nuclear deterrent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92679368f8dd132ff6bda01ca9426f5de7c98a10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92679368f8dd132ff6bda01ca9426f5de7c98a10/0_19_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"bolton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Who will be bold enough to argue that Iranian actions are a predictable response to Trump\u2019s provocations?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Young/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Might the public have a point? The establishment assumes that Iran can never possess nuclear weapons, yet the United States lives with nuclear-armed adversaries like Russia and China and aligns with the nuclear-armed military dictatorship in Pakistan. In the first debates, however, the Democratic candidates gave indecisive messages. Although most supported returning to the nuclear agreement that Trump breached, <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/cory-booker-answer-iran-nuclear-deal-democratic-debate-989b5689bb64/\">several candidates harped on</a> the agreement\u2019s imperfections, repeating a neoconservative talking point. Senator Cory Booker even parroted Trump\u2019s empty vow to negotiate a \u201cbetter deal.\u201d</p> <p>Who will be bold enough to argue that Iranian actions are a predictable response to Trump\u2019s provocations? That the real drawback of the nuclear deal was that it didn\u2019t go far enough toward establishing normal relations with Iran \u2014 the one measure that could end America\u2019s endless embroilment in Middle East wars?</p> <p>Iran provides just one example of the divide between hawkish elites and the more open-minded public. Two new studies reveal how poorly Washington represents Americans\u2019 foreign policy priorities: one by the <a href=\"https://egfound.org/stories/independent-america/worlds-apart\">Eurasia Group Foundation</a> (EGF) and another by the <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2019/05/05/469218/america-adrift/\">Center for American Progress</a><strong> </strong>(CAP). Both reports emphasize Americans\u2019 frustration with military overextension and their preference for diplomatic engagement.</p> <p>CAP asked respondents to react to 20 different statements about foreign policy. The statement that received the most support proposed investing money at home rather than abroad. Which received the least? \u201cThe United States must prioritize spending for the military and defense, even if it means making cuts in other areas.\u201d Likewise, EGF found American voters more than twice as likely to support cutting over raising military spending. By <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/07/18/americas-indefensible-defense-budget/\">lavishing near-record funding</a> on the Pentagon, the Trump administration has handed Democrats a gift. Democrats need to be willing to use it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/16/john-bolton-trump-iran-nuclear-deal-danger\">Is John Bolton the most dangerous man in the world? | Ben Armbruster</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, if voters wanted to cut military spending yet insisted on maintaining America\u2019s globe-policing grand strategy, responsible leaders would have to choose which preference to follow. But voters are pretty coherent: they are willing to rethink America\u2019s place in the world in order to avoid policing it. In the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton ran on the consensus of the national-security establishment: that America was the \u201cindispensable nation\u201d and \u201calready great.\u201d To voters, however, flying the flag of American exceptionalism isn\u2019t the same as flying the American flag itself.</p> <p>One-third of Americans told EGF flatly that the United States is \u201cnot an exceptional nation.\u201d This was the plurality view among Democrats and people under 30 years old. The rest described America as exceptional, but attributed exceptionalism far more to what the country represents than to the actions it takes for the world. Exceptionalism, in other words, hardly implies a predisposition for military intervention and might well mean the opposite. Increasingly Americans are open to reimagining their country as one nation in the world, not above it.</p> <p>The rising generation is particularly allergic to bromides about virtuous and limitless military deployments. Only 44% of millennials deem it \u201cvery important\u201d for the United States to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/millennials-are-so-over-us-domination-of-world-affairs-99167\">maintain a superior military</a>, according to a Chicago Council on Global Affairs study. Similarly, EGF found Americans under 30 to be more willing than other age groups to favor abstaining from the use of force to stop human-rights abuses. As CAP concluded, \u201cYounger voters are much less committed to traditional international and military engagement than are their elder cohorts.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, young voters are eager to engage the world in ways that cooperate rather than coerce and kill. Their generation is the most enthusiastic of all on the issues of climate change, human rights, and global living standards. \u201cIsolationists\u201d they are not. But Democrats need to articulate a positive vision that combines peaceful engagement with military restraint \u2014 an American internationalism fit for the 21st century. Otherwise Trump\u2019s nativist pitch will stand alone as the alternative to establishment platitudes.</p> <p>The last two presidents, Obama and Trump, were unlikely aspirants to the office partly because they bucked national-security orthodoxy, blasting Middle East wars and the political class that started them. Obama and Trump won their elections partly for the same reason. Once in office, however, they struggled to deliver. Endless war continues; diplomacy is in tatters; Americans suffer from underinvestment where they live and work; and the greatest threats, like climate change, loom larger across the globe. In 2020, the candidate who not only identifies these problems, but offers real solutions, will benefit.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Mark Hannah is a senior fellow at the Eurasia Group Foundation and teaches at New York University.

A mere 36% favored a strike even in the heat of the moment, when Politico conducted a poll. The number was even smaller \u2014 23% \u2014 among Democrats. Although the national-security commentariat casts Iran as a grave enemy, carrying on a grudge match that dates to the 1979 revolution that ousted the brutal, CIA-backed shah, ordinary Americans don\u2019t nurse the same resentments. As a recent study found, a tiny minority, 8%, would opt for military action if Iran were to resume its nuclear weapons program. Six times as many would either tolerate a nuclear Iran while negotiations resumed or actually believe that Iran has the right to develop a nuclear deterrent. Might the public have a point? The establishment assumes that Iran can never possess nuclear weapons, yet the United States lives with nuclear-armed adversaries like Russia and China and aligns with the nuclear-armed military dictatorship in Pakistan. In the first debates, however, the Democratic candidates gave indecisive messages. Although most supported returning to the nuclear agreement that Trump breached, several candidates harped on the agreement\u2019s imperfections, repeating a neoconservative talking point. Senator Cory Booker even parroted Trump\u2019s empty vow to negotiate a \u201cbetter deal.\u201d Who will be bold enough to argue that Iranian actions are a predictable response to Trump\u2019s provocations? That the real drawback of the nuclear deal was that it didn\u2019t go far enough toward establishing normal relations with Iran \u2014 the one measure that could end America\u2019s endless embroilment in Middle East wars? Iran provides just one example of the divide between hawkish elites and the more open-minded public. Two new studies reveal how poorly Washington represents Americans\u2019 foreign policy priorities: one by the Eurasia Group Foundation (EGF) and another by the Center for American Progress (CAP). Both reports emphasize Americans\u2019 frustration with military overextension and their preference for diplomatic engagement. CAP asked respondents to react to 20 different statements about foreign policy. The statement that received the most support proposed investing money at home rather than abroad. Which received the least? \u201cThe United States must prioritize spending for the military and defense, even if it means making cuts in other areas.\u201d Likewise, EGF found American voters more than twice as likely to support cutting over raising military spending. By lavishing near-record funding on the Pentagon, the Trump administration has handed Democrats a gift. Democrats need to be willing to use it. Of course, if voters wanted to cut military spending yet insisted on maintaining America\u2019s globe-policing grand strategy, responsible leaders would have to choose which preference to follow. But voters are pretty coherent: they are willing to rethink America\u2019s place in the world in order to avoid policing it. In the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton ran on the consensus of the national-security establishment: that America was the \u201cindispensable nation\u201d and \u201calready great.\u201d To voters, however, flying the flag of American exceptionalism isn\u2019t the same as flying the American flag itself. One-third of Americans told EGF flatly that the United States is \u201cnot an exceptional nation.\u201d This was the plurality view among Democrats and people under 30 years old. The rest described America as exceptional, but attributed exceptionalism far more to what the country represents than to the actions it takes for the world. Exceptionalism, in other words, hardly implies a predisposition for military intervention and might well mean the opposite. Increasingly Americans are open to reimagining their country as one nation in the world, not above it. The rising generation is particularly allergic to bromides about virtuous and limitless military deployments. Only 44% of millennials deem it \u201cvery important\u201d for the United States to maintain a superior military, according to a Chicago Council on Global Affairs study. Similarly, EGF found Americans under 30 to be more willing than other age groups to favor abstaining from the use of force to stop human-rights abuses. As CAP concluded, \u201cYounger voters are much less committed to traditional international and military engagement than are their elder cohorts.\u201d At the same time, young voters are eager to engage the world in ways that cooperate rather than coerce and kill. Their generation is the most enthusiastic of all on the issues of climate change, human rights, and global living standards. \u201cIsolationists\u201d they are not. But Democrats need to articulate a positive vision that combines peaceful engagement with military restraint \u2014 an American internationalism fit for the 21st century. Otherwise Trump\u2019s nativist pitch will stand alone as the alternative to establishment platitudes. The last two presidents, Obama and Trump, were unlikely aspirants to the office partly because they bucked national-security orthodoxy, blasting Middle East wars and the political class that started them. Obama and Trump won their elections partly for the same reason. Once in office, however, they struggled to deliver. Endless war continues; diplomacy is in tatters; Americans suffer from underinvestment where they live and work; and the greatest threats, like climate change, loom larger across the globe. In 2020, the candidate who not only identifies these problems, but offers real solutions, will benefit.

Lapsley, who is on the national executive committee of Open Labour and has lived in Derby for 30 years, said there was a distinct change in Williamson\u2019s behaviour after he lost his seat to Amanda Solloway of the Conservative party by 41 votes. Following his defeat Corbyn described Williamson as a \u201cvery great friend\u201d saying his defeat was \u201cthe worst result of the night\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI had some interaction with him on social media and I was worried with the people he was supporting and some of the things he was saying.

He was pretty loyal to Tony Blair but his politics changed. He is now very much a do-or-die Jeremy Corbyn loyalist and he sees any criticism of Jeremy Corbyn as an attack on him which isn\u2019t necessarily the case.\u201d</p> <p>At Jewish Labour Movement meetings Williamson is the main topic of conversation due to \u201cdeliberately seeking notoriety\u201d but Lapsley fears it will eventually lose Labour the Derby North constituency.</p> <p>\u201cHe has had to invent this new Chris Williamson to keep his seat.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThere is no place for Chris Williamson in my Labour party. I think out of all the issues around antisemitism in the party he has been the biggest surprise and has caused me the most heartache,\u201d says Steve Lapsley, a lifelong Labour supporter, who adds that he will never be able to forgive the Derby North MP for the alleged damage he has done to the party. As pressure mounted on Jeremy Corbyn to cut loose one of his closest allies, party supporters in Williamson\u2019s constituency described a man who was previously \u201ca very good friend to the Jewish community\u201d, but who had deliberately become embroiled in the antisemitism controversy in a bid to reinvent himself as a Corbyn loyalist. Lapsley, a Jewish Labour Movement member, said Williamson had been a good friend and was not someone who was \u201cparticularly interested in the Middle East\u201d or someone that had previously commented on issues of antisemitism. In fact while he was leader of Derby city council Williamson was instrumental in setting up Holocaust Memorial Day events in the city, and he also rescinded the medieval proscription of Jews living in Derby. However in 2015 things began to shift. Lapsley, who is on the national executive committee of Open Labour and has lived in Derby for 30 years, said there was a distinct change in Williamson\u2019s behaviour after he lost his seat to Amanda Solloway of the Conservative party by 41 votes. Following his defeat Corbyn described Williamson as a \u201cvery great friend\u201d saying his defeat was \u201cthe worst result of the night\u201d. \u201cI had some interaction with him on social media and I was worried with the people he was supporting and some of the things he was saying. He agreed to see me but he completely shut me down and refused to listen to anything I had to say. I wanted to show him some examples I had got of antisemitism I had seen in Labour party forums and he refused to look at. Didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with it,\u201d he said. Lapsley said Williamson, a former bricklayer and social worker who won the seat back from the Tories in 2017 with a majority of 2,000, was no longer the \u201cfairly pragmatic guy\u201d he remembered, accusing him of \u201cappalling Jew-baiting\u201d. In February Williamson faced complaints about having booked a room in parliament to screen a controversial film about Jackie Walker, an activist suspended from the party. Lapsley said: \u201cHe is someone who is a loyalist. He was pretty loyal to Tony Blair but his politics changed. He is now very much a do-or-die Jeremy Corbyn loyalist and he sees any criticism of Jeremy Corbyn as an attack on him which isn\u2019t necessarily the case.\u201d At Jewish Labour Movement meetings Williamson is the main topic of conversation due to \u201cdeliberately seeking notoriety\u201d but Lapsley fears it will eventually lose Labour the Derby North constituency. \u201cHe has had to invent this new Chris Williamson to keep his seat. Reinvent himself as this ultra Corbyn loyalist but he doesn\u2019t do Corbyn any favours and I don\u2019t think he can win in Derby again because of the damage he has done,\u201d he adds. Meanwhile, Eve Sacker, a former teacher, said she was forced to leave the Labour party due to Williamson\u2019s reluctance to acknowledge and tackle the issue of antisemitism. Sacker revealed that she contributed to a dossier presented to the Labour party containing evidence of Williamson\u2019s alleged denial of antisemitism. The dossier was handed to the party shortly after Williamson\u2019s suspension. Sacker, who is now the deputy manager at the multicultural education charity Open Centre in the city, said she was blocked by Williamson after she raised concerns about an article he shared after the Pittsburgh synagogue shootings in October last year. She said: \u201cWhen I told him on Twitter how upset I was at his response in the wake of such a tragedy, he just blocked me.\u201d The 2011 census recorded just 110 Jews in Derby city, while in the county of Derbyshire there were approximately 370 Jewish people. Sacker believes with them being such a tiny minority they are all the more vulnerable and said she and her children had repeatedly been subject to antisemitic abuse. She said: \u201cI have written to [Williamson] many times asking him to support our community but he just ignores me. I have had people make Nazi salutes at me, I\u2019ve had children who have said to me the Holocaust happened because Jews owned everything. One of my daughters had to move school because another child told her she belonged in a concentration camp. This is the kind of abuse we suffer but he does not want to listen to us, which is alarming for a politician.\u201d Sacker said she voted for Williamson when she first moved to Derby, but would never do so again, as she believes he is baiting the Jewish community. \u201cHe knows that appearing with [Jackie] Walker will upset us.

The handling of the case has been described as a \u201cflagrant waste of taxpayers\u2019 money\u201d and \u201cpointless\u201d, and prompted calls for a departmental secretary to personally foot the legal bill. The Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick is investigating the circumstances behind the awarding of Australia\u2019s $4bn patrol boat contract to the German shipbuilder Luerssen, over a local company that promised to do the job for less, Austal. Patrick made a freedom of information request for the diaries of the former navy chief and defence\u2019s head of capability acquisition and sustainment. The defence department initially blocked Patrick\u2019s request because the diaries contained the dates of cabinet meetings, which it argued were exempt on cabinet-in-confidence grounds. That decision was overturned by the information watchdog, prompting an intervention from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, which took the case to the administrative appeals tribunal (AAT) to prevent the documents\u2019 release. At the time, Patrick slammed the intervention as an example of \u201csecrecy creep\u201d and warned it could cost taxpayers up to $150,000. On Friday, roughly two weeks after it launched the case, the prime minister\u2019s department abandoned its AAT appeal.

      "body": "<p>As MPs gather in Canberra for the opening of the 46th parliament, there\u2019s been a reopening of wounds within the Coalition about last year\u2019s leadership coup against Malcolm Turnbull. Journalist and former political staffer Niki Savva has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/01/malcolm-turnbull-pulled-back-from-neg-legislation-after-dutton-and-pyne-went-nuts\">written Plots and Prayers</a>, which is in bookstores from Monday. It\u2019s a very fine history of the chaotic events of last August, with many of the main protagonists recounting their actions in on-the-record interviews. Here are five of the more memorable insights and moments from the book.</p> <h2>The Dutton machine: keystone cops</h2> <p>The week the government broke last August <a href=\"https://meanjin.com.au/essays/prime-minister-disrupted/\">felt completely insane</a>. What wasn\u2019t so clear at the time, largely because of how fast things were moving, was Peter Dutton\u2019s coup was a complete shambles. Turnbull forced Dutton out of the shadows by calling a spill early in the week. Various protagonists recount stories indicating what a mess things were behind the scenes, including departing ministers Steve Ciobo and Michael Keenan, but two young rightwingers involved in the offensive certainly don\u2019t hold back in their accounts of events to Savva. Andrew Hastie says Dutton lacked a strong lieutenant, at least until Mathias Cormann joined the frontline mid-week. \u201cThe chief protagonists are completely separated from the backbench. It all added to the confusion and chaos. There\u2019s only so much you can do with Whatsapp,\u201d Hastie says. Victorian senator James Paterson agrees, describing Dutton\u2019s campaign as \u201ccompletely half-arsed\u201d. There was no one in charge, no campaign manager, no alternative policy. \u201cIt was shambolic.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/29/election-scott-morrison-authority-colleagues-could-take-it-away\">The election gave Scott Morrison authority \u2013 but colleagues could take it away | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Morrison\u2019s advice to Turnbull over the week</h2> <p>While the Dutton offensive flailed, the core group of Morrison supporters rallied with great precision to enhance the interests of their candidate. More of that shortly but, first, the book provides insight into the advice Scott Morrison gave Turnbull as the leadership crisis spiralled. The first thing he said to him, according to Savva\u2019s account, was don\u2019t bring on a leadership spill. (\u201cHow many times did you ever see John Howard call a spill? Never.\u201d) The second was to try and persuade Cormann not to defect. Then, on Thursday, after the parliament was adjourned, Morrison told Turnbull and Christopher Pyne to not have the final party room vote on the Friday, and send everyone home to their electorates instead. Morrison is quoted recounting a conversation he had with Pyne and Julie Bishop. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just go home? We\u2019re back in a fortnight, and we\u2019ll fight this, slug this thing out over the next two weeks. Yes, it\u2019ll be ugly and messy and horrible, and all the rest of it, but, you know, we can.\u201d Morrison said MPs would have been punished by their constituents if they\u2019d left at that point, and that wouldn\u2019t have disrupted the Dutton advance. But Turnbull thought it was impossible to pull back. Savva then has Craig Laundy narrate what happened next. Having put his point of view, Morrison then said: \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d Laundy notes the speed with which Morrison left the room.</p> <h2>The activity of the Morrison crew</h2> <p>Morrison has prided himself on gaining the Liberal leadership with clean hands. But Plots and Prayers documents the work of his supporters in maximising opportunity for their candidate. There are intricate accounts of Morrison\u2019s numbers men doing numbers, and voting tactically in the ballots to ensure their bloke was best positioned to prevail. Laundy witnessed some of this activity with growing trepidation and fed it back to Turnbull\u2019s senior advisers. Turnbull\u2019s principal private secretary, Sally Cray, told Laundy: \u201cWe can\u2019t tell Malcolm. It will completely kill him.\u201d All pretty interesting, but perhaps the most important perspective on this is Dutton\u2019s, given both Morrison and Dutton both remain in the parliament, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/29/election-scott-morrison-authority-colleagues-could-take-it-away\">and need to find their level</a>.

      "bodyText": "As MPs gather in Canberra for the opening of the 46th parliament, there\u2019s been a reopening of wounds within the Coalition about last year\u2019s leadership coup against Malcolm Turnbull. Journalist and former political staffer Niki Savva has written Plots and Prayers, which is in bookstores from Monday. It\u2019s a very fine history of the chaotic events of last August, with many of the main protagonists recounting their actions in on-the-record interviews. Here are five of the more memorable insights and moments from the book. The Dutton machine: keystone cops The week the government broke last August felt completely insane. What wasn\u2019t so clear at the time, largely because of how fast things were moving, was Peter Dutton\u2019s coup was a complete shambles. Turnbull forced Dutton out of the shadows by calling a spill early in the week. Various protagonists recount stories indicating what a mess things were behind the scenes, including departing ministers Steve Ciobo and Michael Keenan, but two young rightwingers involved in the offensive certainly don\u2019t hold back in their accounts of events to Savva. Andrew Hastie says Dutton lacked a strong lieutenant, at least until Mathias Cormann joined the frontline mid-week. \u201cThe chief protagonists are completely separated from the backbench. It all added to the confusion and chaos. There\u2019s only so much you can do with Whatsapp,\u201d Hastie says. Victorian senator James Paterson agrees, describing Dutton\u2019s campaign as \u201ccompletely half-arsed\u201d. There was no one in charge, no campaign manager, no alternative policy. \u201cIt was shambolic.\u201d Morrison\u2019s advice to Turnbull over the week While the Dutton offensive flailed, the core group of Morrison supporters rallied with great precision to enhance the interests of their candidate. More of that shortly but, first, the book provides insight into the advice Scott Morrison gave Turnbull as the leadership crisis spiralled. The first thing he said to him, according to Savva\u2019s account, was don\u2019t bring on a leadership spill. (\u201cHow many times did you ever see John Howard call a spill? Never.\u201d) The second was to try and persuade Cormann not to defect. Then, on Thursday, after the parliament was adjourned, Morrison told Turnbull and Christopher Pyne to not have the final party room vote on the Friday, and send everyone home to their electorates instead. Morrison is quoted recounting a conversation he had with Pyne and Julie Bishop. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just go home? We\u2019re back in a fortnight, and we\u2019ll fight this, slug this thing out over the next two weeks. Yes, it\u2019ll be ugly and messy and horrible, and all the rest of it, but, you know, we can.\u201d Morrison said MPs would have been punished by their constituents if they\u2019d left at that point, and that wouldn\u2019t have disrupted the Dutton advance. But Turnbull thought it was impossible to pull back. Savva then has Craig Laundy narrate what happened next. Having put his point of view, Morrison then said: \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d Laundy notes the speed with which Morrison left the room. The activity of the Morrison crew Morrison has prided himself on gaining the Liberal leadership with clean hands. But Plots and Prayers documents the work of his supporters in maximising opportunity for their candidate. There are intricate accounts of Morrison\u2019s numbers men doing numbers, and voting tactically in the ballots to ensure their bloke was best positioned to prevail. Laundy witnessed some of this activity with growing trepidation and fed it back to Turnbull\u2019s senior advisers. Turnbull\u2019s principal private secretary, Sally Cray, told Laundy: \u201cWe can\u2019t tell Malcolm. It will completely kill him.\u201d All pretty interesting, but perhaps the most important perspective on this is Dutton\u2019s, given both Morrison and Dutton both remain in the parliament, and need to find their level. Savva says Dutton was suspicious of the Morrison clique\u2019s positioning, particularly ahead of the fist spill on the Tuesday which caught him by surprise. Dutton is quoted pointing out that the whip, Nola Marino, was given a heads up about what Turnbull was planning. One of Marino\u2019s deputies was Bert van Manen, part of the Morrison Bible group. Dutton said Van Manen could have telegraphed Turnbull\u2019s plans to the Morrison camp: Stuart Robert, Alex Hawke, Steve Irons. Dutton tells Savva he has no proof of the way they voted in the first ballot, but he has \u201cno doubt\u201d they did not vote for Turnbull, and in fact voted for him in that first ballot, which undermined Turnbull and intensified the crisis. Robert told Savva after the first spill he told colleagues that Turnbull was finished, as the author puts it, in \u201cconversations that were very damaging to Turnbull and conversely helpful to Morrison\u201d. Fog of war becomes a fog of grief One of the standout chapters in the book, just at a human level, is the journey of Victorian Mitch Fifield. Political tragics will remember that Fifield joined with fellow senators Cormann and Michaelia Cash in publicly defecting from Turnbull in a funereal press conference. Fifield entered the Dutton column on the Tuesday after Turnbull spilled the leadership, believing Turnbull was done. But this news fractured his inner friendship circle \u2013 the Speaker, Tony Smith, was horrified, as was fellow frontbencher Kelly O\u2019Dwyer. According to the account in the book, Smith told Fifield that giving in to those determined to destroy Turnbull was both morally wrong and politically stupid \u2013 the voters would be appalled, and Dutton would be an electoral disaster, particularly in Victoria. There\u2019s a slightly surreal moment where Fifield walks into the Dutton situation room and sees the coterie of dissidents who had worked to destroy Turnbull\u2019s prime ministership. \u201cHis brain began to throb. Did he really want to be aligned with them?\u201d Savva says in her recount. After agonising, Fifield switched his vote to Morrison. \u2018We prayed that righteousness would exalt the nation\u2019 On the Friday Morrison became prime minister, he told his receptionist, Mel, to text his family and ask them to pray for him. Before he left the office, he prayed with his colleague and friend Stuart Robert. Savva asked Robert to tell her how they passed that time alone. \u201cWe prayed that righteousness would exalt the nation,\u201d Robert said.

An Agence France-Presse correspondent in Damascus reported hearing loud explosions on Sunday night. The Syrian news agency said the missiles struck near Damascus and in Homs province. The Syrian military said air defences had confronted the attack, which was launched from Lebanese airspace. \u201cOur air defences confronted enemy missiles launched by Israeli warplanes (...) towards some of our positions in Homs and in the vicinity of Damascus,\u201d Sana said, quoting a Syrian military source. Syrian state-run broadcaster al-Ikhbariya said the four civilians including a baby had been killed in Sahnaya, south of Damascus, as \u201ca result of the Zionist aggression\u201d. An Israeli military spokeswoman declined to comment on the report. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitor, said the strikes hit several Iranian positions near Damascus and targeted a research centre and a military airport west of the city of Homs where the Hezbollah Shiite movement and Iranians are deployed. On 12 June, Israeli warplanes struck a Syrian army position in the country\u2019s south. Rami Abdel Rahman, the observatory chief, said the strikes injured some of these forces. Israel has carried out hundreds of air strikes in Syria since the beginning of the conflict in 2011, targeting forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and the regime\u2019s allies Iran and Hezbollah. Iran and Hezbollah are fighting on the side of President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian war, and Israel says they are trying to turn Syria into a new front against Israelis.",

      "bodyText": "Top story: Bankruptcies a price worth paying for Brexit, says Hunt Good morning briefers. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and it\u2019s my pleasure to bring you the best of news, sport and features to help you start the week. Jeremy Hunt has alarmed moderate Tories by hardening his rhetoric about a possible no-deal Brexit as he attempts to close the gap with Boris Johnson in the race for the Conservative leadership. Speaking on the Andrew Marr show, Hunt said he would be willing to tell business owners that they should be prepared to see their companies go bust in a no-deal Brexit as a price worth paying to fulfil a \u201cdemocratic\u201d promise to voters. He will also use a speech on Monday to play down concerns about the potential impact of no deal with policies including \u00a36bn to protect fishing and agriculture. Matt Hancock weighed in for Johnson saying public sector staff could expect a fair pay rise if his man reaches No 10. But outgoing prime minister Theresa May has issued a veiled attack on the no-deal approach championed by Johnson. She said her successor should make sure Britian negotiated in an \u201corderly way\u201d. As May departs the world stage, our political editor, Heather Stewart, analyses her humbling journey from the apex of political power to the backbenches. It\u2019s been an uncomfortable ride as, at summit after summit, \u201cMay was sentenced to be the lonely human face of British exceptionalism, dispatched to dine with her aides at the British residence, while the EU27 carried on their discussions without her\u201d. You can watch highlights of those excruciating summit moments here. * * * Unhappy anniversary \u2013 Protesters are gathering on the streets of central Hong Kong today ahead of a planned demonstration to mark the anniversary of the handover of the city to China on 1 July 1997. Activists clashed with police earlier today as they tried to occupy key thoroughfares ahead of another march which also aims to keep up the pressure on the city\u2019s government over its attempts to introduce draconian new extradition laws with China. Follow our live blog for all the developments and you can also catch up on the large-scale demonstrations yesterday by groups in favour of the new law that will make it easier to send residents to China for trial. * * * \u2018Spygate\u2019 \u2013 A spying row has erupted less than 48 hours before England\u2019s women footballers take on the United States in the World Cup semi-final. The Football Association reacted with anger when US team officials were found entering private rooms in the England team hotel in Lyon on Sunday morning while Phil Neville\u2019s players were out training. The US said the officials, who were being shown around the luxury Fourvi\u00e8re hotel by staff on Sunday morning, were merely scouting venues for a team base if they reach Sunday\u2019s final. But Neville said England would never do such a thing when opponents were still staying at a hotel. * * * Tarnished crown \u2013 More than 100 complaints have been made to the crown estate in the face of rising rents, evictions and delays to repairs to properties. An investigation by the Guardian has unearthed growing anger about how the Queen\u2019s \u00a314bn property portfolio is managed. The organisation, which gives 25% of its profits to the monarch, has sought to evict 113 tenants in the past five years so they can sell their homes for profit. One evicted tenant, a retired policeman, said the estate had a public service duty. \u201cThe crown estate are custodians, they are not a bloody commercial estate agent,\u201d he said. * * * Whaling reboot \u2013 Ships have set out from several ports in Japan today as the country\u2019s fishermen resumed commercial whale hunting for the first time in 30 years. Japan defied international opinion and celebrity campaigns by withdrawing from the International Whaling Commission after failing to convince the world body to allow the practice, which it says is a longstanding tradition. But it has prompted celebrations in northern and western fishing communities as ships set sail. \u201cWe are very excited\u201d said Yoshifumi Kai, head of the Japan Small-Type Whaling Association. \u201cMy heart is full of hope.\u201d * * * \u2018Incredible\u2019 \u2013 Astonished residents of the city of Guadalajara woke on Sunday to find cars buried under a coating of hailstones up to two metres deep. The freak storm came despite temeperatures reaching 31C in recent days. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such scenes in Guadalajara,\u201d said the state governor, Enrique Alfaro. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: Why Fiji is awash with cocaine Last year, 120 bricks of cocaine, each worth thousands of dollars, washed up on the beaches of remote islands in Fiji. Kate Lyons explains how traffickers are increasingly using the islands as a staging post in the supply of drugs from central America to Australia and New Zealand. She has also reported on how Fijian police have found themselves on the frontline of an illicit multibillion-dollar industry and how the Pacific islands are the victims of growing appetite for the drugs in large cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. Lunchtime read: The rise and rise of tourism As the summer holidays approach, we\u2019ve crunched the numbers on the rise and rise of international tourism and what it means for the planet. There were 1.4bn tourist visits last year, according to the UN, a threefold rise since 1990, with the industry accounting for 2% of world GDP. Cheap flights and ease of internet booking are factors, along with growing number of Chinese tourists whose 143m trips made them the world\u2019s most numerous travellers. France is the world\u2019s most popular destination at 90m visits, ahead of Spain on 82m, although the latter still has more European visitors. The UK is in seventh place on 39m, just ahead of Germany on 37m. Sport England kept their Cricket World Cup hopes alive with a crucial win over India at Edgbaston helped by a redemptive hundred from Jonny Bairstow. Taylor Swift has emerged as the unexpected expression for home fans, with stadium music urging them to Shake it Off and highlighting the potential of the team: young, reckless, capable of leaving you breathless. Kyle Edmund says it is \u201ca great honour\u201d to return to Centre Court for the fourth time when Wimbledon starts today. In F1, Ferrari said they will not appeal against the stewards\u2019 decision on the incident between Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen and their driver Charles Leclerc at the Canadian grand prix. Taking time out from the spying row, Phil Neville tried another diplomatic move by claiming that his England women will be backed by French supporters in tomorrow\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup semi-final. As England prepares to welcome Australia for the Women\u2019s Ashes of 2019, there\u2019s a powerful sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2013 these teams have played each other a lot. Business The number of people using mobile banking services will outnumber those visiting branches by 2021. The rise in smartphone ownership, especially by better-off older people and those nearing retirement, are identified as the key trends behind the figures compiled by data firm Caci. Manufacturing in Asia remains in the doldrums, according to surveys in China, Japan and South Korea released overnight, depressing markets and increasing pressure on policymakers to keep rates low. The FTSE100 is nevertheless on course to jump 0.5% at the opening while the pound is at \u00a31.270 and \u20ac1.118.

      "bodyText": "Anti-government protesters in Hong Kong took over key roads early on Monday amid rising tensions ahead of what expected to be a huge pro-democracy rally on the anniversary of the city\u2019s handover to China. The semi-autonomous city has been shaken by historic demonstrations in the past month, when protesters have demanded the withdrawal of a bill that would allow extraditions to the Chinese mainland. While an official ceremony took place at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre to mark the 22nd anniversary of the return of sovereignty from Britain to China, tensions spiked once more in the financial hub after hundreds of mainly young, masked protesters mostly in black wearing hard hats and goggles seized three key thoroughfares, some deploying metal and plastic barriers to block the way. Rows of riot police with helmets and shields faced protesters on Harcourt Road, the main thoroughfare, and a couple of the side streets in the area. Hundreds of protesters shouted \u201cretract the evil law\u201d in the torrential rain at one point. One protester told the Guardian he was pepper-sprayed by riot police in the early morning when he was among dozens of protesters advancing towards the police line. His friends were dabbing water on his skin, which was still red and hurting. \u201cWe were lucky we didn\u2019t get seriously hurt as police were using batons to hit people -- we shielded ourselves with umbrellas,\u201d he said. On Lung Wo Road, some protesters dug up bricks and built make-shift barricades from roadside metal railings. The ongoing rallies are the latest manifestation of growing fears that China is stamping down on the city\u2019s freedoms and culture with the help of the finance hub\u2019s pro-Beijing leaders. Although Hong Kong was returned from British to Chinese rule on 1 July, 1997, it is still administered separately under an arrangement known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. The city enjoys rights and liberties unseen on the autocratic mainland, but many residents fear Beijing is already reneging on that deal. While top officials attend a ceremony on 1 July every year to mark the anniversary of Hong Kong\u2019s handover of sovereignty from the UK to China, a large anti-government protest also takes place on the same day, with protesters calling for greater democratic freedoms \u2013 such as the right to elect the city\u2019s leader. There have been large-scale protests in Hong Kong in recent years, including a two-month occupation in 2014 \u2013 but have failed to win any concessions from Beijing. If huge crowds gather today, as expected, this will be Hong Kong\u2019s fourth mass protest in a month against a controversial extradition law. This year\u2019s rally comes against the backdrop of unprecedented anti-government protests over the past three weeks that have drawn millions and anger over police using tear gas and rubber bullets to clear crowds. Millions have taken to the streets to protest against the proposed law allowing for the extradition of individuals for trial in mainland China, where the opaque court system is controlled by the Communist party. The protests throughout June have been largely peaceful, but on 12 June, the scene turned violent when police used rubber bullets, teargas, pepper spray and batons to disperse crowds and some protesters threw objects back at the police. Protesters have also surrounded the police headquarters twice in past weeks in noisy and emotionally charged protests in which young people spray-painted obscenities on its front wall and barricaded its entrances. On Sunday, police set up giant water-filled barricades in anticipation of overnight rallies by anti-extradition protesters to lock down the area where the handover anniversary ceremony was to take place. While the spark for the current wave of protests was an attempt by chief executive Carrie Lam to pass the Beijing-backed extradition law, the demonstrations have morphed into a wider movement against Lam\u2019s administration and Beijing. Lam \u2013 who has kept out of the public eye since her climbdown and has record low approval ratings \u2013 struck a conciliatory note Monday at the ceremony marking the handover, saying a series of protests that have rocked her city have taught her that she needs to listen better to the youth and people in general. Before toasting with Hong Kong and Chinese officials, including military figures, Lam also said Hong Kong benefited from China\u2019s economic strength and wished for the \u201caffluence of the motherland and the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.\u201d On Monday, the government announced that the flag-raising ceremony would be moved inside, rather than on the city\u2019s harbour front, ostensibly due to inclement weather, but probably to avoid the loud protests outside the venue. Eddy Chu Hoi-dick, a pro-democracy lawmaker, said while he worries about violence breaking out, he believes the young protesters in the leaderless protests have \u201cconsensus about when they should back down\u201d and avoid arrest. On Sunday, thousands of pro-government protesters rallied outside the government headquarters in support of the city\u2019s police. Many waved Chinese flags and hurled insults at anti-government demonstrators camped nearby, highlighting the deep ideological fissures now dividing the finance hub.",

Delage may have been a fabrication, but the fact that the campaign was so successful (it won 17 Lions at Cannes in 2017) had much to do with just how closely she resembled the real influencers whose cocktail-filled lives many follow and covet.</p> <p>Most trends turn over quickly, but drinking \u2013 from mimosas at brunch to post-work beers \u2013 has always been portrayed as the ultimate way to have a good time . Conversely, <em>not</em> drinking seems somewhat suspect; abstaining is often interpreted as a tacit indication that you struggle with alcoholism, itself historically stigmatized and kept private, or that you\u2019re just a virtue-signaling teetotaler who doesn\u2019t know how to have fun.</p> <p>Yet recently, a shift has begun. Enter the \u201csober curious\u201d: those who drink less or not at all,and broadcast their abstinence with pride as a part of their social media personas.</p> <p>Ruby Warrington, 43, is a British writer and founder of alcohol-free event series Club S\u00f6da NYC. She is also the leading voice of the sober curious movement, whose rationale is that most everyone could benefit from stepping back to honestly appraise their relationship with booze.</p> <p>Warrington suggests bringing a \u201cquestioning mindset to every drinking situation, rather than go along with the dominant drinking culture\u201d. She wants to nudge people to critically evaluate the subconscious ways in which drinking is socially expected of us, regardless of whether our behavior seems overtly \u201cproblematic\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s this idea that you\u2019re either a problem drinker or an alcoholic, or a normal drinker who has no issues with alcohol. More and more we\u2019re seeing there are shades of grey when it comes to dependence on alcohol,\u201d says Warrington.</p> <p>The idea that problematic drinking can be assessed on a curve is more than an observation, it\u2019s medical science. Alcohol use disorder encompasses a spectrum ranging from mild to severe, explains Dr George Koob, director of the US National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.</p> <p>\u201cAbstaining from alcohol is a good way of assessing whether you have a problem with alcohol in the first place,\u201d adds Koob. \u201cIf you feel better when you\u2019re not drinking, the Oracle of Delphi is telling you something.\u201d</p> <p>In her recent book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sober-Curious-Blissful-Limitless-Connection-ebook/dp/B0796V2RPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8\">Sober Curious</a>, Warrington says reduced alcohol intake\u201cis the next logical step in the wellness revolution\u201d, underscoring the absurdity of a day filled with yoga and greens being followed by a night of pummeling one\u2019s liver at the bar. The sober events Club S\u00f6da NYC hosts, such as a \u201cKundalini Disco\u201d or panel discussion on \u201cpsychedelics and sobriety\u201d, are also firmly aligned with new age and wellness trends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt9Lol2n-8s/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Here&#39;s to heading home with my memory and dignity still intact! Here&#39;s to wonderful (supertalented-magical) pals who affirm my entire existence! - Here&#39;s to the excitement I can feel rising as I anticipate sitting naked in my cosy bed with a cup of tea, Luther, and a moisturized face - ALL on a Saturday NIGHT. Here&#39;s to the prospect of never experiencing another hangover for the rest of my human life. - I&#39;ll never not be grateful, THANK YOU SOBRIETY for these 831 days of continuous self-discovery, mundane goodness, and the ability to FEEL again! - Thank you for getting me out and into a space where I&#39;m excitedly shouting over bar music and not having to explain (even once) WHY I don&#39;t drink! I love you @aorists @elizabethwhibley\ud83d\ude19 - Dear person who needs encouragement today: If I can do this, you fucking can!

Abstaining from drinking may be trendy for some, but for the one in eight Americans who have alcoholism, it can mean life or death.</p> <p>Warrington agrees. \u201cTalking about sobriety as a trend is not OK. The point of sober curious is to differentiate between those of us who have the privilege to be sober curious and perhaps dabble [in alcohol] here and there, and those for whom drinking and alcohol is a mortal danger.\u201d</p> <p>So how do the sober <em>serious</em> feel about the sober <em>curious</em>? And is the recasting of abstinence as aspirational at all helpful to those in recovery?</p> <p>Laura McKowen, 41, a blogger who began sharing her experiences of recovering from alcohol abuse on Instagram in 2014, says: \u201cIt is a beautiful thing that this conversation about sobriety has become big and that people are talking about it on social media.\u201d</p> <p>Yet given the intensity of her own struggle to get sober, McKowen can\u2019t help but feel skeptical of influencer accounts that make quitting alcohol \u201cseem like an Instagram filter\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, sobriety was the most difficult thing I have ever gone through and still is,\u201d adds McKowen. She worries that sobriety influencers, if they\u2019re not careful, can give people \u201cthis perception, especially if they\u2019re early on and they\u2019re struggling, that they should feel better and they should look better. And that\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p> <p>Sophie, 33, who prefers to withhold her last name for privacy as a member of Alcoholics Anonymous, is one of several people behind sobriety Instagram meme account @fucking_sober, known for its dark humor centered on alcohol abuse recovery.</p> <p>Aside from a \u201cfevered couple months\u201d when she first stopped drinking, Sophie never took comfort in overtly positive, wellness-oriented messaging around sobriety. Rather, it was being able to acknowledge and laugh at \u201cthe fears some of us have about being sober, that our life\u2019s going to be boring, that we\u2019ve joined a cult\u201d, that she gravitated towards, \u201cbecause it\u2019s just such a relief to be able to laugh about the darkest times in our lives\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BzI4iX5i4Uc/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "Louise Delage was briefly Instagram famous in 2016 \u2013 forever ago in internet years, so you may need a quick refresher on who she was. Delage was a young, beautiful, Parisian Instagram it-girl with more than 100,000 followers at her peak, continually posting photos of herself at rooftop parties or aboard yachts in late summer, hair tousled, and always, always, with a drink in hand. She was also not real \u2013 at least, not exactly. \u201cDelage\u201d, played by an actor, was a fictionalized social media star created by the French addiction support agency Addict\u2019Aide in a campaign to raise awareness of alcohol addiction and how deceptively glamorous it can look, especially when filtered through social media. Delage may have been a fabrication, but the fact that the campaign was so successful (it won 17 Lions at Cannes in 2017) had much to do with just how closely she resembled the real influencers whose cocktail-filled lives many follow and covet. Most trends turn over quickly, but drinking \u2013 from mimosas at brunch to post-work beers \u2013 has always been portrayed as the ultimate way to have a good time . Conversely, not drinking seems somewhat suspect; abstaining is often interpreted as a tacit indication that you struggle with alcoholism, itself historically stigmatized and kept private, or that you\u2019re just a virtue-signaling teetotaler who doesn\u2019t know how to have fun. Yet recently, a shift has begun. Enter the \u201csober curious\u201d: those who drink less or not at all,and broadcast their abstinence with pride as a part of their social media personas. Ruby Warrington, 43, is a British writer and founder of alcohol-free event series Club S\u00f6da NYC. She is also the leading voice of the sober curious movement, whose rationale is that most everyone could benefit from stepping back to honestly appraise their relationship with booze. Warrington suggests bringing a \u201cquestioning mindset to every drinking situation, rather than go along with the dominant drinking culture\u201d. She wants to nudge people to critically evaluate the subconscious ways in which drinking is socially expected of us, regardless of whether our behavior seems overtly \u201cproblematic\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea that you\u2019re either a problem drinker or an alcoholic, or a normal drinker who has no issues with alcohol. More and more we\u2019re seeing there are shades of grey when it comes to dependence on alcohol,\u201d says Warrington. The idea that problematic drinking can be assessed on a curve is more than an observation, it\u2019s medical science. Alcohol use disorder encompasses a spectrum ranging from mild to severe, explains Dr George Koob, director of the US National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. \u201cAbstaining from alcohol is a good way of assessing whether you have a problem with alcohol in the first place,\u201d adds Koob. \u201cIf you feel better when you\u2019re not drinking, the Oracle of Delphi is telling you something.\u201d In her recent book, Sober Curious, Warrington says reduced alcohol intake\u201cis the next logical step in the wellness revolution\u201d, underscoring the absurdity of a day filled with yoga and greens being followed by a night of pummeling one\u2019s liver at the bar. The sober events Club S\u00f6da NYC hosts, such as a \u201cKundalini Disco\u201d or panel discussion on \u201cpsychedelics and sobriety\u201d, are also firmly aligned with new age and wellness trends. And people on Instagram, such as the London-based \u201cmindset coach\u201d Africa Brooke and \u201cstylishly sober\u201d fashion blogger Katie Brunsdon, increasingly champion alcohol-free living, their feeds conveying the message that it\u2019s hip not to drink. While having a cool life may once have meant getting in at 5am and sleeping with your makeup on, today\u2019s luxury looks more like having a chic \u201cspirit-free\u201d beverage, leaving the party at its peak, completing your nighttime skincare routine in full, and getting a good sleep so you\u2019re ready for a productive morning. And yet, to consider sobriety a trend akin to the paleo diet is reductive, glossing over the underlying reasons many develop unhealthy relationships with alcohol in the first place \u2013 such as trauma, issues with anxiety and depression, or simply because alcohol is highly addictive and a go-to social lubricant. Abstaining from drinking may be trendy for some, but for the one in eight Americans who have alcoholism, it can mean life or death. Warrington agrees. \u201cTalking about sobriety as a trend is not OK. The point of sober curious is to differentiate between those of us who have the privilege to be sober curious and perhaps dabble [in alcohol] here and there, and those for whom drinking and alcohol is a mortal danger.\u201d So how do the sober serious feel about the sober curious? And is the recasting of abstinence as aspirational at all helpful to those in recovery? Laura McKowen, 41, a blogger who began sharing her experiences of recovering from alcohol abuse on Instagram in 2014, says: \u201cIt is a beautiful thing that this conversation about sobriety has become big and that people are talking about it on social media.\u201d Yet given the intensity of her own struggle to get sober, McKowen can\u2019t help but feel skeptical of influencer accounts that make quitting alcohol \u201cseem like an Instagram filter\u201d. \u201cFor me, sobriety was the most difficult thing I have ever gone through and still is,\u201d adds McKowen. She worries that sobriety influencers, if they\u2019re not careful, can give people \u201cthis perception, especially if they\u2019re early on and they\u2019re struggling, that they should feel better and they should look better. And that\u2019s a problem.\u201d Sophie, 33, who prefers to withhold her last name for privacy as a member of Alcoholics Anonymous, is one of several people behind sobriety Instagram meme account @fucking_sober, known for its dark humor centered on alcohol abuse recovery. Aside from a \u201cfevered couple months\u201d when she first stopped drinking, Sophie never took comfort in overtly positive, wellness-oriented messaging around sobriety. Rather, it was being able to acknowledge and laugh at \u201cthe fears some of us have about being sober, that our life\u2019s going to be boring, that we\u2019ve joined a cult\u201d, that she gravitated towards, \u201cbecause it\u2019s just such a relief to be able to laugh about the darkest times in our lives\u201d. People on social media who focus on the sunniness of sobriety may not resonate with those recovering from alcohol abuse, but their message that life is enjoyable without drinking could be contributing to younger generations\u2019 disinclination to begin drinking at all. \u201cWe have data showing a straight line decline of underage drinking in the United States over the last 10 years, and if the sober curious movement is contributing to that, that\u2019s fantastic,\u201d says Dr Koob. \u201cBut you don\u2019t want to be treating serious alcohol use disorder with that.\u201d Dr Carrie Wilkens, co-founder and director of the Center for Motivation and Change in New York, which specializes in motivational and cognitive-behavioral treatments for alcohol use disorders, agrees. \u201cI think anything that makes it easier for people to talk about changing their relationship with alcohol is great,\u201d she says. \u201cThe CMC started 15 years ago saying that people didn\u2019t need to use labels, didn\u2019t need to call themselves an alcoholic just to decide to change, that they didn\u2019t need to go to AA, that there\u2019s lots of ways to be sober, so the fact that\u2019s now in social media that you can make behavioral changes for all sorts of reasons and ways, I think that\u2019s fantastic,\u201d she says. \u201cIf [sobriety] turns into a trend where people are more sober than not, our health costs in this country will also go down dramatically, so that will be a good thing,\u201d she adds.

But they can encourage critical thinking from the casual drinker, asking us to consider, and maybe even dismantle, the societal expectations and calcified habits that lead us to reach for a drink whenever the opportunity presents itself.

      "body": "<p>Netflix and the Duffer Brothers are up against it. In Stranger Things, they have managed to create a juggernaut that satisfies critics and fans in equal measure. But, at the same time, the show comes with its own form of inbuilt obsolescence. This isn\u2019t a series designed to run for ever because, short of forcing them into a nightmarish round of age-denying cosmetic surgery, the cast will reach adulthood before long. The current prediction is that Stranger Things will check out after four <a href=\"https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a27070651/stranger-things-ending-david-harbour/\" title=\"\">or </a><a href=\"https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a27070651/stranger-things-ending-david-harbour/\" title=\"\">five</a> seasons.</p> <p>The third season becomes available this week.

      "bodyText": "Netflix and the Duffer Brothers are up against it. In Stranger Things, they have managed to create a juggernaut that satisfies critics and fans in equal measure. But, at the same time, the show comes with its own form of inbuilt obsolescence. This isn\u2019t a series designed to run for ever because, short of forcing them into a nightmarish round of age-denying cosmetic surgery, the cast will reach adulthood before long. The current prediction is that Stranger Things will check out after four or five seasons. The third season becomes available this week.

When Adebajo first launched Eko Kitchen last summer, she still worked full-time as a financial analyst and spent her weekends hustling orders of suya chicken and fried plantains to customers via Postmates and Uber Eats.

West African cuisine has probably never had more mainstream visibility in America than it does at this very moment. Millions of viewers have watched Eric Adjepong, a Ghanaian American chef, cook Ghanaian plantain-and-cassava fufu and other west African dishes during the most recent season of Top Chef. Meanwhile, Kwame Onwuachi, another former Top Chef<em> </em>contestant who is of part-Nigerian descent, recently won a James Beard Award as the country\u2019s Rising Star Chef of the Year. The menu at Kith and Kin, Onwuachi\u2019s Afro-Caribbean restaurant in Washington DC, includes riffs on classic Nigerian dishes like egusi stew, suya, and jollof rice.</p> <p>But Korsha Wilson, a New York City-based food writer who has covered the foods of the African diaspora for national publications such as <a href=\"https://www.foodandwine.com/travel/restaurants/pierre-thiam-teranga-harlem-restaurant\">Food &amp; Wine</a>, cautions against framing a culture\u2019s traditional cuisine as the latest hot food trend. In that sense, it\u2019s besides the point \u2013 if not downright unhelpful \u2013 to assert, in the parlance of glossy food magazines, that West African cuisine is \u201chaving a moment\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like Nigerian food isn\u2019t being eaten anywhere. There are thousands of Nigerian people here eating it every day,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cWhen I\u2019m talking about these chefs or about these cuisines, I try to not say, \u2018it\u2019s gaining steam\u2019 or \u2018it\u2019s hot right now\u2019. Because that implies that people who have been eating it for a long time [don\u2019t] matter, that it only matters when white people eat it.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s not to discount the trickle-down effect that the success of high-profile chefs such as Adjepong and Onwuachi might have on smaller businesses like Eko Kitchen \u2013 the extent to which someone might see egusi stew on television or read a list of 10 essential Nigerian recipes in the New York Times and then decide to seek it out at a local restaurant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"865160f18cc2baffe2c923deca80aa3e09865e14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/865160f18cc2baffe2c923deca80aa3e09865e14/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eko Kitchen runs Fridays through Sundays in a stylish restaurant space in San Francisco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eko Kitchen runs Fridays through Sundays in a stylish restaurant space in San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabriela Hasbun/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s also not to dismiss the very real challenges that newly opened west African restaurants such as Eko Kitchen face \u2013 especially, Adebajo says, in a city like San Francisco that, quite frankly, \u201cis just not as culturally diverse as you would think it is\u201d.</p> <p>That\u2019s reflected in the fact that when she first moved to the city in 2016, as a 20-year-old graduate student, she could only find a single store, in the Fillmore district, that sold black hair products. And it\u2019s reflected, of course, in the city\u2019s dearth of west African and Afro-Caribbean restaurants. Little Baobab, which specializes in Senegalese peanut stew, is San Francisco\u2019s only other west African dining establishment. In May, Isla Vida, one of the city\u2019s only Afro-Caribbean restaurants, had to launch a crowdfunding campaign in a last-ditch effort to stay in business.</p> <p>When Adebajo first announced her plans for Eko Kitchen on Twitter, the broader Nigerian and Nigerian American community were so excited about the news, the tweet quickly accumulated upwards of 55,000 likes. But social media virality doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into a steady customer base, Adebajo says. For now, she says the restaurant is busy enough that it\u2019s difficult for customers to just drop in for dinner on a Friday or Saturday night without a reservation \u2013 though not quite so busy that she\u2019s ready to open on weeknights, too. (Right now, she spends weekdays doing corporate catering gigs.)</p> <p>The reasons Adebajo has to try to overcome these obstacles are deeply personal. \u201cI think we romanticize the places that we grow up in,\u201d she says. A Bronx native, she moved back to Lagos with her Nigerian-born parents when she was seven. The fiery, intricately spiced local cuisine was at first too hot for her American palate to handle, but she grew to love it. And when she returned to the US to attend grad school in San Francisco, the food was what she missed the most about Nigeria: the weekend jaunts she and her father would make to Ghana High, a boka, or quick-service restaurant, that was legendary for its jollof rice, and her family\u2019s occasional trips to nearby Ikenne Remo to eat a local specialty called ayamase \u2013 a green-pepper stew they all loved so much they\u2019d buy 30 orders of it at a time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"61e0c5cc244909862267e82d2669d8232e6a65e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61e0c5cc244909862267e82d2669d8232e6a65e5/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"Simileoluwa Adebajo has recreated in her restaurant her experiences growing up in Nigeria.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simileoluwa Adebajo has recreated in her restaurant her experiences growing up in Nigeria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabriela Hasbun/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eko Kitchen prominently features versions of both dishes. Each night, the restaurant has a different theme, with its own distinct menu. On Fridays, Adebajo wanted to recreate the feeling of going out on the town in Lagos on a Friday night, so she cranks up Burna Boy on the speakers and serves bowls of fiery goat meat pepper soup and big platters of grilled meats rubbed with a suya spice mix. Saturdays are reserved for foods your mom might cook for you on a lazy weekend afternoon, with homey dishes like her mother\u2019s recipe for fish stew. And on Sundays, the main attraction is what Adebajo calls her \u201crice spectacular\u201d: three different rice dishes on a combo plate, highlighted by a version of Nigerian native rice that\u2019s infused with a deep umami kick reminiscent of a dried-porcini risotto \u2013 a flavor the chef attributes to the use of fermented locust beans and unrefined palm oil.</p> <p>These are staple ingredients in any Nigerian kitchen, and they\u2019re part of what makes it difficult to describe the cuisine, with its bold seasoning and distinctive textures, to someone who doesn\u2019t have the reference points. Sure, you can liken the custardy, leaf-wrapped blackeyed-pea cake known as moin moin to a tamale, or you can say that the pounded yams, made with extra-starchy Nigerian tubers, are like sticky mashed potatoes you pick up with your hands. But ultimately, these kinds of comparisons don\u2019t do justice to the cuisine. Moin moin is moin moin. Pounded yam is pounded yam.</p> <p>Whatever else you might want to say about Eko Kitchen, the food is wildly delicious. There\u2019s the intense spicy-savory quality of the efo riro, a thick spinach stew that you scoop up with hunks of pounded yam. There\u2019s the smoky, tomatoey tinge of the jollof rice; the in-your-face heat blast of the pepper soup. There\u2019s the ayamase, in which beef skin and tripe are slow-cooked to obscene tenderness in a rich, creamy, palm-oil-based sauce.</p> <p>Foluso Alofe, a civil engineer by trade who makes the trek out from Union City on the weekends to moonlight as Eko Kitchen\u2019s sous chef, says the ayamase is his favorite item on the menu \u2013 a dish he associates with parties back in Nigeria: \u201cEvery time I taste it, it\u2019s new to me as well.\u201d</p> <p>In the end, Eko Kitchen\u2019s launch, and its bid to achieve long-term success in San Francisco, is part of a larger conversation about which cuisines get a seat at the table when it comes to mainstream recognition and critical acclaim.</p> <p>As Wilson puts it, \u201cHistorically, a lot of restaurants owned by people of color have gotten shortchanged with food media because [they cover] non-European food and dining with a lens of \u2018this is so different and weird\u2019 \u2013 that sort of tone, which is really disrespectful.\u201d</p> <p>But there is a sense that perhaps now, finally, the American dining public is ready to pay proper respect to jollof rice and goat-meat pepper soup. And why shouldn\u2019t it be? Adebajo argues that Ghana High, her old favorite back in Lagos, is a restaurant that ought to have Michelin stars because of the way it has perfected the two dishes that it serves: \u201cSo why is Africa left out of that conversation?\u201d</p> <p>Adebajo says she doesn\u2019t have any desire to chase after Michelin stars herself. Instead, she says, \u201cMy ultimate aspiration is that I want to take Nigerian food everywhere in the world.\u201d Someday she\u2019d like to host a Nigerian-centric food travel show. In each episode, she would visit a different country and cook a Nigerian meal using the local produce. \u201cWhat I want to help people to understand, Anthony Bourdain style, is that we\u2019re all the same.\u201d<br></p>",

And it\u2019s reflected, of course, in the city\u2019s dearth of west African and Afro-Caribbean restaurants. Little Baobab, which specializes in Senegalese peanut stew, is San Francisco\u2019s only other west African dining establishment. In May, Isla Vida, one of the city\u2019s only Afro-Caribbean restaurants, had to launch a crowdfunding campaign in a last-ditch effort to stay in business. When Adebajo first announced her plans for Eko Kitchen on Twitter, the broader Nigerian and Nigerian American community were so excited about the news, the tweet quickly accumulated upwards of 55,000 likes. But social media virality doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into a steady customer base, Adebajo says. For now, she says the restaurant is busy enough that it\u2019s difficult for customers to just drop in for dinner on a Friday or Saturday night without a reservation \u2013 though not quite so busy that she\u2019s ready to open on weeknights, too. (Right now, she spends weekdays doing corporate catering gigs.) The reasons Adebajo has to try to overcome these obstacles are deeply personal. \u201cI think we romanticize the places that we grow up in,\u201d she says. A Bronx native, she moved back to Lagos with her Nigerian-born parents when she was seven. The fiery, intricately spiced local cuisine was at first too hot for her American palate to handle, but she grew to love it. And when she returned to the US to attend grad school in San Francisco, the food was what she missed the most about Nigeria: the weekend jaunts she and her father would make to Ghana High, a boka, or quick-service restaurant, that was legendary for its jollof rice, and her family\u2019s occasional trips to nearby Ikenne Remo to eat a local specialty called ayamase \u2013 a green-pepper stew they all loved so much they\u2019d buy 30 orders of it at a time. Eko Kitchen prominently features versions of both dishes. Each night, the restaurant has a different theme, with its own distinct menu. On Fridays, Adebajo wanted to recreate the feeling of going out on the town in Lagos on a Friday night, so she cranks up Burna Boy on the speakers and serves bowls of fiery goat meat pepper soup and big platters of grilled meats rubbed with a suya spice mix. Saturdays are reserved for foods your mom might cook for you on a lazy weekend afternoon, with homey dishes like her mother\u2019s recipe for fish stew. And on Sundays, the main attraction is what Adebajo calls her \u201crice spectacular\u201d: three different rice dishes on a combo plate, highlighted by a version of Nigerian native rice that\u2019s infused with a deep umami kick reminiscent of a dried-porcini risotto \u2013 a flavor the chef attributes to the use of fermented locust beans and unrefined palm oil. These are staple ingredients in any Nigerian kitchen, and they\u2019re part of what makes it difficult to describe the cuisine, with its bold seasoning and distinctive textures, to someone who doesn\u2019t have the reference points. Sure, you can liken the custardy, leaf-wrapped blackeyed-pea cake known as moin moin to a tamale, or you can say that the pounded yams, made with extra-starchy Nigerian tubers, are like sticky mashed potatoes you pick up with your hands. But ultimately, these kinds of comparisons don\u2019t do justice to the cuisine. Moin moin is moin moin. Pounded yam is pounded yam. Whatever else you might want to say about Eko Kitchen, the food is wildly delicious. There\u2019s the intense spicy-savory quality of the efo riro, a thick spinach stew that you scoop up with hunks of pounded yam. There\u2019s the smoky, tomatoey tinge of the jollof rice; the in-your-face heat blast of the pepper soup. There\u2019s the ayamase, in which beef skin and tripe are slow-cooked to obscene tenderness in a rich, creamy, palm-oil-based sauce. Foluso Alofe, a civil engineer by trade who makes the trek out from Union City on the weekends to moonlight as Eko Kitchen\u2019s sous chef, says the ayamase is his favorite item on the menu \u2013 a dish he associates with parties back in Nigeria: \u201cEvery time I taste it, it\u2019s new to me as well.\u201d In the end, Eko Kitchen\u2019s launch, and its bid to achieve long-term success in San Francisco, is part of a larger conversation about which cuisines get a seat at the table when it comes to mainstream recognition and critical acclaim. As Wilson puts it, \u201cHistorically, a lot of restaurants owned by people of color have gotten shortchanged with food media because [they cover] non-European food and dining with a lens of \u2018this is so different and weird\u2019 \u2013 that sort of tone, which is really disrespectful.\u201d But there is a sense that perhaps now, finally, the American dining public is ready to pay proper respect to jollof rice and goat-meat pepper soup. And why shouldn\u2019t it be? Adebajo argues that Ghana High, her old favorite back in Lagos, is a restaurant that ought to have Michelin stars because of the way it has perfected the two dishes that it serves: \u201cSo why is Africa left out of that conversation?\u201d Adebajo says she doesn\u2019t have any desire to chase after Michelin stars herself. Instead, she says, \u201cMy ultimate aspiration is that I want to take Nigerian food everywhere in the world.\u201d Someday she\u2019d like to host a Nigerian-centric food travel show. In each episode, she would visit a different country and cook a Nigerian meal using the local produce. \u201cWhat I want to help people to understand, Anthony Bourdain style, is that we\u2019re all the same.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When Amanda Little was on tour to promote her 2010 book Power Trip: The Story of America\u2019s Love Affair with Energy, she discovered something unusual. Despite the book\u2019s focus on fossil fuels, her audience was overwhelmingly interested in one specific chapter \u2013 the one about food production.</p> <p>The people she spoke with were eager to learn about and even potentially reform their diets \u2013 they wanted to be more virtuous eaters. These conversations eventually led her to write her second book, The Fate of Food: What We\u2019ll Eat in a Bigger, Hotter, Smarter World, released earlier this month.</p> <p>In her meticulously researched 352-page book, Little explores what it will take to continue feeding 7.5 billion people in a world where farming practices are becoming dangerously compromised due to the effects of a climate crisis \u2013 catastrophic droughts, record-breaking heatwaves, and wildly swinging weather systems. What began as an 18-month project ballooned into a five-year mission to understand an enormously complex, intricate and surprisingly emotional issue.</p> <p>I spoke to Little about her book, food systems on the brink of collapse, and what our meals might look like in 2050.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Divider\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Divider</a> </figure>  <p><strong>At first glance, the topics of food and climate change may seem unrelated. What\u2019s the connection?</strong></p> <p>The single biggest threat of climate change is the threat to food systems.</p> <p>As an environmental reporter, that really surprised and intrigued me. I thought it was going to be flooding, I thought it was going to be drought, displaced populations, rising sea levels \u2013 that seemed to be how humanity was going to experience climate change, but I began to realize that the single biggest disruption across the board for everyone on this planet is going to be the changes, both subtle and radical, to food production.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a894465f378c2e7ab9f13c556334aa4ea3f8547\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a894465f378c2e7ab9f13c556334aa4ea3f8547/0_0_2600_1200/1000.png\" alt=\"image2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"462\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Are some of these changes already happening?</strong></p> <p>Climate change is becoming something we can taste.</p> <p>I would be at a maize farm in Kenya, a cattle farm in Tennessee, an apple farm in Wisconsin, a coffee farm in Guatemala, a peach farm in Georgia \u2013 I mean I talked to so many farmers who were saying to me some variation of, \u201cClimate change is something we can <em>taste</em>. This is affecting the way my fruits grow, this is affecting the way my vegetables grow, this is affecting the way my cows grow.\u201d</p> <p>We think about climate change as something that is so diffuse and so remote, but this story is evident in the impact on these food systems. I felt like I had to tell the story and put a name to it as a real phenomenon in our midst.</p> <p><strong>Many of us have deeply emotional connections to food. How does that manifest in terms of how we view this problem?</strong></p> <p>Some of [these solutions] make people very uncomfortable, like \u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to live in a world where the only way we feed humanity meat is if we grow it in a bioreactor.\u201d But let\u2019s be realistic. I mean, it would be great if we could all subsist on $6 heirloom tomatoes, wouldn\u2019t that be wonderful? But we have 7.5 billion people, so how are going to do that? That\u2019s not something that makes people smile.</p> <p>If you can do your backyard farm and you have your chicken coop and that saves you time then power to you and you can totally continue to eat like that, and in no way are some of these other solutions going to threaten that, but we also have to have practical solutions that can scale for everyone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81f4d60a71a9126d9fc2e5ae8a8fd6ed470eb164\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81f4d60a71a9126d9fc2e5ae8a8fd6ed470eb164/0_0_2600_1200/1000.png\" alt=\"image3\" width=\"1000\" height=\"462\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>So, what </strong><em><strong>is</strong></em><strong> the solution then?</strong></p> <p>I was really struggling with that question \u2013 how are we going to fix a failing food system if we can\u2019t necessarily rely on a critical mass of backyard-farming vegetarians to do it from the ground up? I began to feel confused about what the realistic solutions really were and that some of the sustainable food movement and its rejection of large-scale food production and affordable food was unrealistic.</p> <p>People would like to hear that there\u2019s one solution, but unfortunately it\u2019s going to take many, many different approaches and require lots of technology, a shift in consciousness, self-control, respect for tradition, a deep understanding of how we\u2019ve misapplied technology \u2013 it\u2019s going to require a lot of different facets to this solution.</p> <p>It\u2019s not a silver bullet, it\u2019s a silver buckshot. But can we do it? Can we feed humanity sustainably and equitably by mid-century? Yes. But it\u2019s going to look a lot different.</p> <p><strong>So, let\u2019s say we do course-correct and innovate and use this third-way agriculture to create a more sustainable, scalable way to feed the world. What would it look like? Can you walk us through what a typical American meal might look like in 2050?</strong></p> <p>My hope is that it\u2019s very similar to what we\u2019re eating today. It\u2019s the <em>way</em> that the food is grown and <em>where</em> it\u2019s grown that has the potential to radically change.</p> <p>It may be that the meat we\u2019re eating tastes as delicious as the meat we\u2019ve eaten for many generations, except it didn\u2019t come from a live animal, it came from either a plant-based protein or from cultured meat grown in a bioreactor.

      "bodyText": "When Amanda Little was on tour to promote her 2010 book Power Trip: The Story of America\u2019s Love Affair with Energy, she discovered something unusual. Despite the book\u2019s focus on fossil fuels, her audience was overwhelmingly interested in one specific chapter \u2013 the one about food production. The people she spoke with were eager to learn about and even potentially reform their diets \u2013 they wanted to be more virtuous eaters. These conversations eventually led her to write her second book, The Fate of Food: What We\u2019ll Eat in a Bigger, Hotter, Smarter World, released earlier this month. In her meticulously researched 352-page book, Little explores what it will take to continue feeding 7.5 billion people in a world where farming practices are becoming dangerously compromised due to the effects of a climate crisis \u2013 catastrophic droughts, record-breaking heatwaves, and wildly swinging weather systems. What began as an 18-month project ballooned into a five-year mission to understand an enormously complex, intricate and surprisingly emotional issue. I spoke to Little about her book, food systems on the brink of collapse, and what our meals might look like in 2050. At first glance, the topics of food and climate change may seem unrelated. What\u2019s the connection? The single biggest threat of climate change is the threat to food systems. As an environmental reporter, that really surprised and intrigued me. I thought it was going to be flooding, I thought it was going to be drought, displaced populations, rising sea levels \u2013 that seemed to be how humanity was going to experience climate change, but I began to realize that the single biggest disruption across the board for everyone on this planet is going to be the changes, both subtle and radical, to food production. Are some of these changes already happening? Climate change is becoming something we can taste. I would be at a maize farm in Kenya, a cattle farm in Tennessee, an apple farm in Wisconsin, a coffee farm in Guatemala, a peach farm in Georgia \u2013 I mean I talked to so many farmers who were saying to me some variation of, \u201cClimate change is something we can taste. This is affecting the way my fruits grow, this is affecting the way my vegetables grow, this is affecting the way my cows grow.\u201d We think about climate change as something that is so diffuse and so remote, but this story is evident in the impact on these food systems. I felt like I had to tell the story and put a name to it as a real phenomenon in our midst. Many of us have deeply emotional connections to food. How does that manifest in terms of how we view this problem? Some of [these solutions] make people very uncomfortable, like \u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to live in a world where the only way we feed humanity meat is if we grow it in a bioreactor.\u201d But let\u2019s be realistic. I mean, it would be great if we could all subsist on $6 heirloom tomatoes, wouldn\u2019t that be wonderful? But we have 7.5 billion people, so how are going to do that? That\u2019s not something that makes people smile. If you can do your backyard farm and you have your chicken coop and that saves you time then power to you and you can totally continue to eat like that, and in no way are some of these other solutions going to threaten that, but we also have to have practical solutions that can scale for everyone. So, what is the solution then? I was really struggling with that question \u2013 how are we going to fix a failing food system if we can\u2019t necessarily rely on a critical mass of backyard-farming vegetarians to do it from the ground up? I began to feel confused about what the realistic solutions really were and that some of the sustainable food movement and its rejection of large-scale food production and affordable food was unrealistic. People would like to hear that there\u2019s one solution, but unfortunately it\u2019s going to take many, many different approaches and require lots of technology, a shift in consciousness, self-control, respect for tradition, a deep understanding of how we\u2019ve misapplied technology \u2013 it\u2019s going to require a lot of different facets to this solution. It\u2019s not a silver bullet, it\u2019s a silver buckshot. But can we do it? Can we feed humanity sustainably and equitably by mid-century? Yes. But it\u2019s going to look a lot different. So, let\u2019s say we do course-correct and innovate and use this third-way agriculture to create a more sustainable, scalable way to feed the world. What would it look like? Can you walk us through what a typical American meal might look like in 2050? My hope is that it\u2019s very similar to what we\u2019re eating today. It\u2019s the way that the food is grown and where it\u2019s grown that has the potential to radically change. It may be that the meat we\u2019re eating tastes as delicious as the meat we\u2019ve eaten for many generations, except it didn\u2019t come from a live animal, it came from either a plant-based protein or from cultured meat grown in a bioreactor. That\u2019s very hard for people to relate to and accept, but right now we\u2019re already seeing some versions of this. The burger that we\u2019ve been eating from Burger King, the patty comes from this plant-based protein with synthetic blood - the Impossible Burger. It tastes just like a meat patty but its provenance has shifted. It\u2019s very possible that we\u2019ll continue to find a way to produce the foods we love most, it\u2019ll just require very different growing methods. It is meat, the cells came from the animal, but they grew not attached to that animal, and without the sentience and without the bones and organs and without the potential suffering along the way.\u201d Will we continue to eat Spanish tomatoes? Well, yes. That strain of heirloom tomatoes that came from Spain will continue to be in our diet, but instead of being grown in Spain they may have been grown in a vertical farm in Newark, the plant roots dangling in a mist of nutrients, and the sun not coming from the sun but from artificial lights. We may continue to grow corn in regions like western Kenya that depend on that as a staple crop, but they may have to be engineered or genetically edited to tolerate more heat, more drought, seasonal shift, new invasive insects. It is very possible that some of us will choose to tap into this hi-tech, very sci-fi style of nourishing yourself, like food pellets and food bars that are highly-specialized, personalized all-in-one meals that meet our specific nutritional needs. How about coffee? What does the future look like for caffeine addicts? The coffee plant is a very particular plant that likes its conditions just so. I visited some science labs in Ethiopia and there\u2019s all this research going into these species of arabica coffee that have over many millennia, adapted to different environmental strains. For example, here is a gene which is native to one kind of coffee plant. Could we splice that gene into what is now a very dire strain of arabica coffee and give those plants the ability to withstand higher levels of heat, more drought, more sun exposure? How do we build resilience into the plant and help them adapt to these new pressures? From what I\u2019ve seen, the scientists and the farmers and the consumers are so deeply committed to finding ways to continue producing this beloved crop, that they will find a way to do it. It\u2019s just going to require much greater resilience, among the farmers themselves and the plants. On a final note, your book has a distinctly optimistic tone. Was that deliberate?

Er \u2026 overcrowding, rising property prices, planeloads of stag parties marauding through Euro capitals with penis-tiaras on their heads: there is a dark side to tourism. Hotspots around the world are struggling under the weight of \u201cover-tourism\u201d, which threatens massive destruction of local environments and communities. Tourists are responsible for large quantities of single-use plastics that pollute beaches and threaten wildlife, and souvenir hunters have been known to break off pieces of endangered coral to keep as memorabilia. While traffic and overcrowding are well documented side effects of tourism, Szumilo says intense pressure on hospitals and public transport from tourists can also strain resources, leaving public services unable to cater for locals. Szumilo highlights the impact of holiday homes on local communities. Often empty for most of the year, second homes can reduce supply for locals, limit economic growth and raise house prices. \u201cWhen we talk about travel and tourism, we think about beaches, holiday resorts, and iconic sceneries,\u201d says Marina Novelli, professor of tourism and international development at the University of Brighton. \u201cWe tend not to think about space politics, social justice, gender equality, poverty alleviation, environmental management or the impact that epidemics or conflicts may inflict on destinations.\u201d What\u2019s to blame? According to Milano, the phenomenon of over-tourism comes partially from the rise in global mobility. Increased transnational travel has led to rising numbers of international students, migrant workers, second home residents, and even journalists working overseas. He also emphasises the role of neoliberalism, which he says is turning cities from \u201clocations to destinations\u201d. The rise of short-term letting apps has also been blamed. Last month, 10 European cities issued a joint letter to the EU demanding help in their battle against Airbnb. The company has long been criticised for its role in housing shortages, raising house prices and displacing local residents. What are countries doing about it? Last month, the picturesque city of Bruges announced it would stop advertising day trips, limit the number of cruise ships docking nearby and shift docking times to ease the weekend rush. The Unesco world heritage site has experienced a 28% rise in tourism in the past two years, with the mayor, Dirk De Fauw, doubting the city\u2019s ability to cope with mounting numbers of tourists. \u201cWe have to control the influx more if we don\u2019t want Bruges to become a complete Disneyland here,\u201d he says.

Following in the footsteps of popular Majorca, Rome \u2013 which hosts 15.2 million tourists annually \u2013 recently announced restrictions on antisocial tourist behaviour. The measures include a crackdown on drunk and disorderly conduct and a ban on shirtless sightseeing. After causing structural damage to picturesque bridges around the world, love padlocks \u2013 attached by romantic partners \u2013 are also coming under new regulation. Bridges in Paris have already begun their removal, with the deputy mayor saying \u201cthey spoil the aesthetics of the bridge, are structurally bad for it and can cause accidents\u201d.

Seven of the top 10 unhealthiest places to live in Britain are in central London, while the healthiest is a small market town in Devon, a study has concluded. Inner London had the greatest access to takeaways, pubs and off-licences, combined with high levels of air pollution and low levels of parks and green spaces, the research found. In contrast, Great Torrington in north Devon had low levels of pollution, good access to parks, green space and health services, along with few retail outlets. All of the remaining top 10 healthy places were in Scotland. These included Lochwinnoch and Foxbar in Renfrewshire, Fauldhouse in West Lothian, and Marnoch in North Lanarkshire. The University of Liverpool found that the Spitalfields area of Tower Hamlets was the unhealthiest place in Britain, followed by five other districts of central London, including Shoreditch and the other half of the Spitalfields area in the City of London. Also in the top ranks were Soho in Westminster, Shotley near Ipswich, and areas north west of Immingham in Humberside. Researchers analysed a range of lifestyle and environmental measures including levels of air pollution, access to amenities such as fast-food outlets or pubs, and proximity to health services including GPs, in addition to parks and recreational spaces. Dr Mark Green, a senior lecturer in health geography who undertook the study, said: \u201cOur research, in conjunction with the Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) and Public Health England, has allowed us to pull together freely available information from sources such as GP surgeries, health centres, fast-food outlets, air pollution statistics published by the Environment Agency. \u201cThe statistics reveal important insights about the concentration of certain amenities that may be damaging or promote health. For example, on average, individuals in Great Britain are just as close to a pub or bar as they are to their nearest GP, 1.1 km [0.68 miles]. \u201cWe also found that 42% of people are within 1km (or a few minutes\u2019 drive time) of their nearest gambling outlet. These statistics reveal troubling issues with the neighbourhoods we live in and how they may be damaging to our health.\u201d The findings will be presented at the International Medical Geography Symposium on Monday. The data resource used is part of the CDRC, which aims to analyse information collected by business, local and national government organisations. Green added: \u201cWe anticipate that this resource will be an important tool for citizens and policymakers alike interested in how their neighbourhoods may be associated to their health.\u201d Prof Alex Singleton, deputy director of the CDRC, said: \u201cOur study found that access was not evenly spread across Great Britain \u2013 rural areas have poorer access to many health services, and those services which are seen as damaging to health are often concentrated in poorer areas. \u201cFor example, 62% of people who live in the 10% most deprived areas are within 1km of a fast-food outlet compared [with] 24% in the 10% least deprived areas.\u201d UK\u2019s unhealthiest places to live 1.

      "bodyText": "Hangovers, fatigue and accumulated sweat were put aside for one more day in the sun, with the Cure delivering an epic final headlining set. Miley Cyrus proved her rockstar worth, with a set that featured everything from Old Town Road to Nine Inch Nails, via a lot of swearing. Opening the day were the Langa Methodist Church Choir, a Cape Town choir whose grace and beauty soothed many a sore head first thing in the morning. It was a moving performance for Kylie Minogue, who was forced to cancel in 2005 due to a breast cancer diagnosis, and had never returned until now. \u201cNever mind the legends slot; next stop, headliner,\u201d said the Guardian\u2019s deputy music editor Laura Snapes. Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Billie Eilish tore up the West Holts and Other stages respectively. Looking down over the Shangri-La area: Glastonbury\u2019s far eastern corner where activists, ravers and the very, very lost congregate for mind-spinning happenings. Cutesy-slash-terrifying Japanese band Babymetal astonished on the Other stage, with their high-intensity, high-glucose take on metal. Dave, who made one audience member\u2019s dreams come true with a chance to guest on the mic; and Years &amp; Years, who brought pure pop and queer energy to the Pyramid stage. In the early hours of Sunday morning, Mark Ronson brought his Club Heartbreak concept to the Stonebridge Bar: melancholy yet uplifting dancefloor bangers to \u2013 paradoxically? \u2013 cure you of a broken heart. Come the morning, Glastonbury was back to its usual self: sitting thoroughly outside of mainstream life, and always for the better. As everyone was contemplating their first cider of the day, the Guardian\u2019s very own Kate Hutchinson played an early set at the Beat Hotel. As you read this, the tent city is being dismantled for another year \u2013 but ready to rise again for Glastonbury\u2019s 50th anniversary. See you down the front for \u2013 we hope \u2013 Madonna, Elton John and Fleetwood Mac?",

But hyperleadership represents something new, in so much as it is rooted online and based around a set of clearly identifiable and often very modern things: to quote Gerbaudo again, \u201can immaculate history of political engagement which gives the leader an impression of authenticity, ingenuity and honesty\u201d, and \u201ca down to earth attitude\u201d, whereby the leader avoids complex language and presents themselves \u201cas a common individual living like ordinary people do\u201d.

Not that long ago, the mass membership party was said to be dead. Now, thanks to the internet, huge numbers of people swarm around the most successful political leaders. These people need not be massively active: a few clicked \u201clikes\u201d a day and regular social media posts often suffice. Crucially, whereas anyone with a formal political affiliation was once left in a world of near silence, given only the occasional newsletter and leaflet, such people now form large and self-contained informational systems, built around both the online output of individual leaders and party machines, and an abundance of partisan media outlets. If you want your politics vivid, highly charged and straightforward enough to be expressed in 280 characters, being part of a superbase built around a hyperleader will be just the job. Now, some of this may well be for the good. As evidenced by Corbynism and the US\u2019s new democratic socialists, it can definitely make politics insurgent and exciting, and rip things away from the control of vested interests \u2013 particularly when it comes to the media. The combination of hyperleaders and superbases also makes sizeable advances possible in super-quick time (something potentially suited to the climate emergency, among other issues). Those two things powered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/19/podemos-spanish-politics\" title=\"\">rapid rise of the Spanish party Podemos</a>, whose thinkers originated the concept of hyperleadership and put it into practice in the charismatic, media-savvy form of Pablo Iglesias. A comparable formula also explains why Corbyn performed so well at the 2017 election, and why Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s branding as \u201cAOC\u201d and the righteous, modern, green politics she represents have so jangled the nerves of the Democratic establishment.</p> <p>But starting with the fact that all the current hyperleaders in national leadership positions are men \u2013 clearly, old-school alpha males are a big part of this story \u2013 there are also reasons to worry. A superbase exists outside the usual forums of representative democracy, and to some extent defines itself against them. It is usually sustained by passionate support for a hyperleader and collective loathing of traditional politics and the media. As a result, anything perceived as an attack on a hyperleader will be maligned as being entirely motivated by base politics, and therefore instantly dismissed.</p> <p>Thus every new verbal and behavioural outrage perpetrated by Trump is picked apart in the press and on TV while his supporters go into defiant raptures. The Labour party is accused, with plenty of justification, of having a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jun/02/labour-antisemitism-probe-ehrc-evidence-from-100-witnesses\" title=\"\">deep antisemitism problem</a>, but the issue has not, and will not be, taken terribly seriously by many Corbyn supporters. Few political stories in fact now seem to have any lasting traction, partly because our online discourse ensures that politics and the media exist in a constant state of distraction, but also thanks to the way in which hyperleaders and superbases ensure that far too many things are reduced to a narrative of one noble individual versus their adversaries.</p> <p>Though Johnson is presumably no more familiar with the term than he is with the realities of building models of buses, he clearly wants to be a hyperleader. In retrospect, his decades-long cultivation of an affectedly bumbling personal style, his self-consciously outrageous pronouncements and his ubiquity on television were part of the preparation, something confirmed by his opportunistic leadership of the great hurricane of reaction and fury that was the leave campaign. Over the past few weeks the spectacle of a would-be prime minister refusing to engage with the most basic kinds of scrutiny and accountability has looked like hyperleadership in its most cynical and abject form.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/12/five-star-failed-italy-needs-real-change\">The Five Star experiment has failed us. Now Italy needs real political change | Francesco Grillo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Johnson fails all the important tests. There is no Tory superbase. He cannot claim to be from outside the political establishment, nor to have doggedly stuck to the same beliefs for the whole of his career. He hardly speaks like an ordinary person, or lives in any way like one. In response to the controversy about what happened at his girlfriend\u2019s flat, Johnson did not act like the \u201cBritish Trump\u201d of media legend and belligerently use the internet to try to change the conversation but responded to his mauling by the traditional media by sitting for a run of fairly disastrous traditional media interviews. In other words, he is hopeless even at the games he thinks he is playing. Rather than embodying the cutting-edge of politics, everything about him signifies the possibly terminal crisis of the Conservative party: a hidebound, utterly orthodox political institution that is foundering in the face of modernity.</p> <p>This may sound like good news. But if Toryism sooner or later goes under, something else will replace it. Though the form a remodelled British right will take will obviously depend on how \u2013 or whether \u2013 Britain\u2019s exit from the EU happens, it seems to me that this is exactly where the Brexit party might be heading, thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/21/brexit-party-nigel-farage-italy-digital-populists-five-star-movement\" title=\"\">digital expertise</a> it has copied from the Five Star movement. Note its burgeoning superbase, the hyperleadership provided by that charismatic chancer Nigel Farage \u2013 and the fact that it has been out-polling the party Johnson wants to lead. Such is another sign of a new political order, here and across the world, and things that the dwindling defenders of the old political mainstream still barely understand.</p> <p>\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Though Johnson is presumably no more familiar with the term than he is with the realities of building models of buses, he clearly wants to be a hyperleader. In retrospect, his decades-long cultivation of an affectedly bumbling personal style, his self-consciously outrageous pronouncements and his ubiquity on television were part of the preparation, something confirmed by his opportunistic leadership of the great hurricane of reaction and fury that was the leave campaign. Over the past few weeks the spectacle of a would-be prime minister refusing to engage with the most basic kinds of scrutiny and accountability has looked like hyperleadership in its most cynical and abject form. But Johnson fails all the important tests. There is no Tory superbase. He cannot claim to be from outside the political establishment, nor to have doggedly stuck to the same beliefs for the whole of his career. He hardly speaks like an ordinary person, or lives in any way like one. In response to the controversy about what happened at his girlfriend\u2019s flat, Johnson did not act like the \u201cBritish Trump\u201d of media legend and belligerently use the internet to try to change the conversation but responded to his mauling by the traditional media by sitting for a run of fairly disastrous traditional media interviews. In other words, he is hopeless even at the games he thinks he is playing. Rather than embodying the cutting-edge of politics, everything about him signifies the possibly terminal crisis of the Conservative party: a hidebound, utterly orthodox political institution that is foundering in the face of modernity. This may sound like good news. But if Toryism sooner or later goes under, something else will replace it. Though the form a remodelled British right will take will obviously depend on how \u2013 or whether \u2013 Britain\u2019s exit from the EU happens, it seems to me that this is exactly where the Brexit party might be heading, thanks to the digital expertise it has copied from the Five Star movement. Note its burgeoning superbase, the hyperleadership provided by that charismatic chancer Nigel Farage \u2013 and the fact that it has been out-polling the party Johnson wants to lead. Such is another sign of a new political order, here and across the world, and things that the dwindling defenders of the old political mainstream still barely understand. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "The G20 leaders have urged Facebook and other social media companies to step up their efforts to prevent the wide distribution of terror attacks on their platforms in the wake of the Christchurch massacre. At the summit in Osaka, Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, succeeded in getting the leaders to put out the statement, despite reported hesitation from the Trump administration over free speech concerns. What does it mean for Facebook? In the statement, the leaders urge social media giants like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to \u201cnot allow use of their platforms to facilitate terrorism and VECT [violent extremism conducive to terrorism]\u201d. The statement is symbolic, and not a binding statement that forces the tech giants to do anything, or the countries involved to make new laws in this area. Australia already legislated in this area, passing \u201cworld first\u201d laws in April creating new offences for service providers that fail to remove videos depicting \u201cabhorrent violent conduct\u201d including terrorist acts, murders, torture, rape or kidnapping. The countries party to the statement could begin pressuring Facebook and Twitter by passing Australian-style legislation in their own countries, but there\u2019s nothing in the statement to force them to do so. Morrison said the statement was \u201ca clear warning from global leaders to internet companies that they must step up\u201d. A report released by the Australian government to coincide with the G20 statement is likely to have a much bigger impact on what Facebook and other social media companies do in this area. A taskforce set up by the Australian government with the tech companies and the telecommunications companies in March put together the report based on an agreed set of responses to the livestreaming of the Christchurch attack. What have the social media companies agreed to do? A new user for a social media site will not be able to livestream for a predetermined period (such as the first 24 hours after they create their account). The sites have also agreed to strengthen the hash-sharing database and URL-sharing consortium. This means that when a video like the Christchurch massacre is identified by a URL or the unique code for the video, the social media sites can immediately detect when a user is trying to upload or share it and block it from being shared. They\u2019ll also inform users about how they can report such material and the processes for getting it taken down, and provide clear, efficient appeal processes if something has been taken down by mistake. They will also fund research into how to prevent and counter terrorist material online. What have the telecommunications companies agreed to do? The companies have been blocking sites hosting the Christchurch video since shortly after the attack, and have agreed to keep blocking the sites, and to direct people to a page explaining why the site they\u2019ve tried to visit is blocked. The esafety commissioner is also going to develop a protocol with the telecommunications companies to set out the processes for blocking sites quickly in the event of another terrorist attack being streamed online. How can we be sure it will work next time? Australia and New Zealand have agreed to run a \u201ctesting\u201d event in the next 12 months that will simulate a Christchurch-like event. The test will make sure that the new tools the social media companies have put in place and the government processes work as intended. The test-run could, if successful, then be repeated regularly to ensure it is all working properly. Will it be enough? The government has left the door open to legislating even more if the scheme isn\u2019t working as intended. \u201cSocial media companies are on notice.

      "bodyText": "The United States were outplayed during the second-half by 79th-ranked Curacao but managed to advance to the Gold Cup semi-finals with a 1-0 win on Sunday night behind Weston McKennie\u2019s 25th-minute goal. The defending champions extended their Gold Cup winning streak to nine and will play Jamaica in Wednesday\u2019s semi-final in Nashville. The US reached the semi-finals for the 10th straight Gold Cup. Mexico and Haiti play in the other semi-final. Christian Pulisic captained the US for the second time and provided an exquisite pass for McKennie\u2019s goal. The 20-year-old cut in from the flank and delivered a perfect cross for McKennie, who headed in the ball from close range for his second goal in 12 international appearances. Playing near his hometown of Hershey, Pulisic shot just wide in the second minute and was denied in the fourth when goalkeeper Eloy Room tipped the Chelsea midfielder\u2019s shot over the crossbar. Curacao had 60% of the possession in the second half, and USA goalkeeper Zack Steffen had to be at his best to deny Leandro Bacuna in the 84th minute. The Americans have outscored opponents 12-0 in the tournament, the championship of North and Central America and the Caribbean, and have held opponents scoreless for 405 minutes overall. This will be the third straight Gold Cup in which the US and Jamaica have met in the knockout stage. The Reggae Boyz upset the US in the 2015 semi-finals, and the Americans defeated Jamaica in the 2017 final. Pulisic\u2019s only previous game as captain was in a 1-0 friendly defeat to Italy last November under interim coach Dave Sarachan. New coach Gregg Berhalter has had nine different captains in 10 games. Berhalter returned to the same starting line-up he used for the initial group stage matches against Guyana and then Trinidad &amp; Tobago. With the US assured of advancing, Berhalter changed all 11 starters for the group stage finale against Panama.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s biggest and most expensive jail is being built near the New South Wales north coast town of Grafton, and locals are increasingly worried about the impact it will have on their region. The $798m Clarence correctional centre (CCC) will house 1, 700 inmates on more than 90,000 square metres of rural land at Lavadia, south of Grafton. It is the largest prison contract ever awarded, to a consortium called Northern Pathways, which includes Macquarie bank, the NSW government and the security contractor service Serco. Serco, which will operate the jail when it opens next year, has said the contract is worth $2.6bn over 20 years. It is recruiting 600 workers for the facility. Serco runs Acacia prison in Western Australia as well as the onshore immigration detention centres Yongah Hill and Villawood. The new jail will house 1,000 maximum security male inmates and 300 maximum security female inmates, with minimum security for another 400 male inmates. Local resident Colin Clague \u2013 the husband of revered local Yaegl elder and long-time Aboriginal rights activist Joyce Clague \u2013 told Guardian Australia that \u201csimple arithmetic\u201d underpinned community concerns about the jail. \u201cThe 600 [staff] will bring with them, on a conservative estimate, 400 partners and 800 children,\u201d Clague said. \u201cAnd on a conservative estimate, 500 partners and 1,000 children of prisoners will relocate for the long term to be able to regularly visit their incarcerated partner.\u201d The pressure will be greatest during school holidays, with hundreds of family groups looking for accommodation, he said.

Don\u2019t read on unless you have watched the most recent episode.</em></p> \n<h2>\u2018This is all beginning to feel a little perverse\u2019</h2> \n<p>I had thought that, in the aftermath of Perry\u2019s death, this follow-up might turn into an investigation of what happened that night, with the police pursuing the women. But it has become less obvious than that. After last week\u2019s wickedly funny episode \u2013 Renata\u2019s face during Madeline\u2019s school-meeting meltdown might be the highlight of the season for me \u2013 this saw the rot of guilt truly setting in, and the police slowly coming closer. As usual, it\u2019s an occasionally dizzying jumble of tones, but I enjoy its ability to swing between farce and trauma, from scene to scene, with such casual grace.</p> \n<p>Perhaps it\u2019s time to rename BLL \u201cMommies Dearest\u201d. Mary Louise has a vampiric ability to appear wherever she isn\u2019t wanted, and she employed it to full effect this week. She turned up at the pre-Halloween pumpkin-carving party \u2013 something about the way Meryl Streep said \u201cJack O\u2019Lantern\u201d managed to give it an extra-haunting quality \u2013 and then, of course, she upped the ante by moving into the same condo as Jane and Ziggy. Personal space is not her forte. When she talked to Celeste about Jane, she managed to both express doubt that Jane was a rape victim and simultaneously blame Celeste for it, an impressive double whammy of awful. It was all leading, of course, to her applying for custody of the twins, to the horror of Celeste.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9fc562b6c4d11d92033230d0853e3e43bc24d1c1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fc562b6c4d11d92033230d0853e3e43bc24d1c1/0_54_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Big Little Lies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Overstepping ... Meryl Streep as Mary Louise Wright.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Clearly Mary Louise is a villain, but is there an argument to be made that Celeste really is not holding it together? It\u2019s tough to see how she\u2019s capable of looking after the twins when she keeps having Ambien-induced blackouts for significant chunks of time. I\u2019m not sure them moving in with their grandmother, who is either simply ignoring the violence of her son or refusing to hear it, is necessarily the answer, but Big Little Lies is very good at making grey areas seem very grey indeed.</p> \n<p>Laura Dern continues to steal this season with a bankruptcy hearing that was a masterclass in how not to deal with authority figures. Her gesturing to her expensive forehead while saying \u201cfrom dealing with men like you all my life, OK?\u201d to the judge, may not have endeared her to him, but it did to me. Her brash fury has been a wonderfully entertaining foil to the careful rebuilding being done by Jane, and the lavish disco party thrown just before bankruptcy kicked in gave us Ed and Nathan bickering in grotesque shirts. Bonnie\u2019s mother continued to make an entrance with a dramatic exit, as she had a stroke, as well as a watery vision of her daughter\u2019s demise. \u201cEverything feels like it\u2019s unravelling,\u201d Renata told Madeline. It\u2019s hard to argue with that.</p> \n<h2>Notes and observations</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a760af56c796c9e38a77fadf34857a5d789ad6c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a760af56c796c9e38a77fadf34857a5d789ad6c/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Big Little Lies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Staying calm ...

Foreplay?\u201d</p> \n<p>Madeline\u2019s daughter Chloe really has some Drag Race levels of shade in her: painting her mother as the opposite of a door (\u201chinged\u201d) was quite the putdown.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/mar/14/studio-54-ultimate-den-of-vice-photographs-hasse-persson\">Studio 54</a> seems like a perfectly suitable theme for a child\u2019s birthday party.</p> \n<p>Madeline having nightmares about Perry\u2019s death is a neat throwback to one of Celeste\u2019s earlier therapy sessions, in which she had to imagine her friend in her place.</p> \n<p>Speaking of Dr Reisman, I noticed some commenters are less than convinced by the professionalism of her tactics.

      "bodyText": "Spoiler alert: this blog is for people watching season two of Big Little Lies, which airs on HBO in the US, Sky Atlantic in the UK and on Foxtel\u2019s Showcase in Australia. Don\u2019t read on unless you have watched the most recent episode. \u2018This is all beginning to feel a little perverse\u2019 I had thought that, in the aftermath of Perry\u2019s death, this follow-up might turn into an investigation of what happened that night, with the police pursuing the women. But it has become less obvious than that. After last week\u2019s wickedly funny episode \u2013 Renata\u2019s face during Madeline\u2019s school-meeting meltdown might be the highlight of the season for me \u2013 this saw the rot of guilt truly setting in, and the police slowly coming closer. As usual, it\u2019s an occasionally dizzying jumble of tones, but I enjoy its ability to swing between farce and trauma, from scene to scene, with such casual grace. Perhaps it\u2019s time to rename BLL \u201cMommies Dearest\u201d. Mary Louise has a vampiric ability to appear wherever she isn\u2019t wanted, and she employed it to full effect this week. She turned up at the pre-Halloween pumpkin-carving party \u2013 something about the way Meryl Streep said \u201cJack O\u2019Lantern\u201d managed to give it an extra-haunting quality \u2013 and then, of course, she upped the ante by moving into the same condo as Jane and Ziggy. Personal space is not her forte. When she talked to Celeste about Jane, she managed to both express doubt that Jane was a rape victim and simultaneously blame Celeste for it, an impressive double whammy of awful. It was all leading, of course, to her applying for custody of the twins, to the horror of Celeste. Clearly Mary Louise is a villain, but is there an argument to be made that Celeste really is not holding it together? It\u2019s tough to see how she\u2019s capable of looking after the twins when she keeps having Ambien-induced blackouts for significant chunks of time. I\u2019m not sure them moving in with their grandmother, who is either simply ignoring the violence of her son or refusing to hear it, is necessarily the answer, but Big Little Lies is very good at making grey areas seem very grey indeed. Laura Dern continues to steal this season with a bankruptcy hearing that was a masterclass in how not to deal with authority figures. Her gesturing to her expensive forehead while saying \u201cfrom dealing with men like you all my life, OK?\u201d to the judge, may not have endeared her to him, but it did to me. Her brash fury has been a wonderfully entertaining foil to the careful rebuilding being done by Jane, and the lavish disco party thrown just before bankruptcy kicked in gave us Ed and Nathan bickering in grotesque shirts. Bonnie\u2019s mother continued to make an entrance with a dramatic exit, as she had a stroke, as well as a watery vision of her daughter\u2019s demise. \u201cEverything feels like it\u2019s unravelling,\u201d Renata told Madeline. It\u2019s hard to argue with that. Notes and observations This week\u2019s rival to The Scream was The Slap, and Mary Louise\u2019s cut-throat response: \u201cWhat shall we call that? Foreplay?\u201d Madeline\u2019s daughter Chloe really has some Drag Race levels of shade in her: painting her mother as the opposite of a door (\u201chinged\u201d) was quite the putdown. Studio 54 seems like a perfectly suitable theme for a child\u2019s birthday party. Madeline having nightmares about Perry\u2019s death is a neat throwback to one of Celeste\u2019s earlier therapy sessions, in which she had to imagine her friend in her place. Speaking of Dr Reisman, I noticed some commenters are less than convinced by the professionalism of her tactics. I did wonder, this week, why the friends might not choose to see different therapists. I can\u2019t imagine there\u2019s a shortage of options in the area. Jane\u2019s date seems to be considerate and understanding. What exactly is he going to turn out to be? Ambien, Xanax, Vicodin, \u201cTrama-something\u201d \u2013 Celeste\u2019s medicine cabinet really is a good reason for her to step back from driving for a while. Playlist As always, the BLL Spotify playlist is the port of call for the soundtrack, though the episode seemed a little music-light this week. Amabella\u2019s birthday disco featured all the classics, including the Bee Gees\u2019 How Deep Is Your Love, Donna Summer\u2019s Lucky, and the pre-bankruptcy blowout of the actual Trammps doing Disco Inferno. Quote of the week \u201cIt\u2019s better that we don\u2019t have to sit with all those penniless losers, like it\u2019s not us.\u201d I\u2019m thinking of renaming this section \u201cRenata-ism of the week\u201d. \u201cThere will come a day that you will pay for all this, Gordon,\u201d also deserves an honorary commendation.",

Article 20(2) also provides that </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence must be prohibited by law.</p> </blockquote> <p>The right to manifest religion is subject to the rights of others and may not incite others to discrimination, hostility or violence. In short, the right of religious expression is not absolute and depends upon respect for the freedoms of others.</p> <p>The next question becomes: what is the relevant law in Australia? Australia is the only western democracy that does not have some form of federal Charter of Human Rights, so we have to rely on the constitution, federal and state legislation and the common law to understand our freedoms.</p> <p>The right to religious expression is explicitly protected by section 116 of the Constitution that prohibits the Commonwealth from making any law \u201cfor prohibiting the free exercise of any religion\u201d. The right to freedom of religious expression is also protected by the Charters of Human Rights in Victoria, the ACT and, next year, Queensland.</p> <p>By contrast with religious expression, our founding fathers chose not to protect a right to freedom of speech in the constitution, leaving it to parliament and the courts to do so. The High Court has nonetheless implied a right to political communication as a necessary characteristic of representative democracy.</p> <p>The courts have also upheld common law freedoms. The Federal Court, for example, decided that NSW\u2019s World Youth Day Act, prohibiting \u201cannoying behaviour\u201d during the Pope\u2019s visit, \u201cshould not be interpreted as conferring powers that are repugnant to fundamental rights and freedoms at common law in the absence of clear authority from Parliament\u201d.</p> <p>The High Court has provided guidance on the limits to religious freedom in only a few cases, interpreting the right both generously and narrowly. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Religion includes a wide range of beliefs, including agnosticism and atheism. The court has also decided that parliament can impose burdens on religious freedom if to do so is necessary and proportionate to achieve a legitimate aim. For example, in 1912 the High Court accepted that compulsory peacetime military training was valid despite religious objections. Similarly, a tax on a charity can be a valid burden on religious expression.

      "bodyText": "Are you for Israel Folau or against? What a pity that Folau\u2019s dismissal by Rugby Australia should be reduced to an ideological and binary debate. Of course, we love a simple answer. Twitter views are various: the Folau case is exclusively a matter of contract law; Folau has the rights to freedom of speech and religious expression; the law should protect against harmful homophobic abuse. I suggest the Folau case is about all of these ideas. It is ironic the Folau case has exposed the gaps in Australia\u2019s protections for fundamental freedoms just as the government is about to introduce a new bill to increase protections for religious freedoms. When considering the need for additional religious protections, it might help if we review the existing legal principles that underpin our freedoms to inform an increasingly complex and divisive national discussion. Let us begin with Australia\u2019s international legal obligations. Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1975 guarantees the freedom to manifest religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching. The freedom to manifest one\u2019s religion or belief may be limited only by laws that are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals or the fundamental rights or freedoms of others. Article 20(2) also provides that any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence must be prohibited by law. The right to manifest religion is subject to the rights of others and may not incite others to discrimination, hostility or violence. In short, the right of religious expression is not absolute and depends upon respect for the freedoms of others. The next question becomes: what is the relevant law in Australia? Australia is the only western democracy that does not have some form of federal Charter of Human Rights, so we have to rely on the constitution, federal and state legislation and the common law to understand our freedoms. The right to religious expression is explicitly protected by section 116 of the Constitution that prohibits the Commonwealth from making any law \u201cfor prohibiting the free exercise of any religion\u201d. The right to freedom of religious expression is also protected by the Charters of Human Rights in Victoria, the ACT and, next year, Queensland. By contrast with religious expression, our founding fathers chose not to protect a right to freedom of speech in the constitution, leaving it to parliament and the courts to do so. The High Court has nonetheless implied a right to political communication as a necessary characteristic of representative democracy. The courts have also upheld common law freedoms. The Federal Court, for example, decided that NSW\u2019s World Youth Day Act, prohibiting \u201cannoying behaviour\u201d during the Pope\u2019s visit, \u201cshould not be interpreted as conferring powers that are repugnant to fundamental rights and freedoms at common law in the absence of clear authority from Parliament\u201d. The High Court has provided guidance on the limits to religious freedom in only a few cases, interpreting the right both generously and narrowly. Religion includes a wide range of beliefs, including agnosticism and atheism. The court has also decided that parliament can impose burdens on religious freedom if to do so is necessary and proportionate to achieve a legitimate aim. For example, in 1912 the High Court accepted that compulsory peacetime military training was valid despite religious objections. Similarly, a tax on a charity can be a valid burden on religious expression. It is clear then that the manifestation of religious belief may be validly restricted by proportionate laws in the national or social interest. It is against these constitutional and judicial foundations that the validity of laws passed by federal parliament will be assessed. Freedom of speech is both protected and limited in numerous ways: defamation laws, secrecy laws to protect national security, prohibitions on public servants or those providing services to offshore detention centres and limited protection for whistle-blowers. Racial abuse is expressly prohibited under section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. A person may not \u201coffend, insult, humiliate or intimidate\u201d another person in public because of their race, colour or national or ethnic origin. S18D provides a powerful protection for freedom of speech with a defence to s18 C if the speech is an artistic work or for a genuine purpose in the public interest and is a fair and accurate report or is an expression of a genuine belief. Two prime ministers and one attorney-general have ignominiously failed over recent years to repeal or amend the prohibition on racial vilification, primarily because the multicultural community sees it as an essential line in the sand to protect community harmony. There is no similar legislation to protect against homophobic speech. The Sex Discrimination Act 1984 protects those of a different sexual orientation from discrimination in employment and the delivery of goods and services. Equality before the law for same sex couples has been achieved with recent amendments to the Marriage Act. But we have no federal law prohibiting homophobic speech. It is arguably time for federal parliament to enact such a provision for we know that words have consequences and they hurt. There is a genuine community interest in ensuring that the gay community, and young people in particular, should not be exposed to verbal vilification. How do these legal principles apply to the Folau case?

Indeed, such codes can be an effective way of building an ethical business culture. Any serious breach of the code could properly lead to dismissal. But what if an employer prohibits homophobic speech despite that speech not being prohibited by law and where the speech reflects a genuine religious belief? A question posed by the Folau case is whether we should allow employers to enforce their values through contract law, or whether those values are better left to be legislated by a representative parliament. What approach is a court likely to take? One analysis is that Folau can reasonably and proportionately be sacked for homophobic speech because it causes significant harm to those of a different sexual orientation. Another view is that to sack a person for expressing a religious belief genuinely held is disproportionate to the harm done, especially as there is no law to prohibit that speech.
