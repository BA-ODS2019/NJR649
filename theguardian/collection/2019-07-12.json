      "bodyText": "Peter Dutton approved a plan to bring a refugee child to Australia after lobbying from Nauru, despite warnings from his department that it would be seen as a contradiction of the policy not to resettle people in Australia who came by boat. Dutton made the intervention on behalf of a stateless Rohingyan unaccompanied minor whose parents were murdered in front of him in Myanmar before he arrived at Christmas Island by boat in October 2013. The exception to Australia\u2019s harsh refugee policies is detailed in a July 2015 departmental submission, seen by Guardian Australia, asking Dutton to note the risks associated with the proposal, after he had agreed to bring the refugee to Australia during a meeting with Nauruan justice minister David Adeang in March 2015. Despite allowing an \u201cillegal maritime arrival\u201d to transfer to Australia months into his role as immigration minister, Dutton has persisted with hardline rhetoric since, warning as recently as 30 May that Australia \u201ccan never allow people to come here by boat\u201d. Habiburahman, a spokesman of the Australian Burmese Rohingya Organisation who goes by one name, told Guardian Australia the process took two and a half years but the young refugee was settled in Australia in late 2016 or early 2017, and lived with two relatives. The home affairs department submission asked Dutton to consider that the \u201cexceptional [transfer] will likely be characterised by refugees in Nauru, and others as a direct contradiction [of] your strong messaging that refugees determined under regional processing arrangements will not be resettled in Australia\u201d. The department warned that allowing a Nauru-determined refugee to settle in Australia \u201cmay undermine this strong policy stance and create a loophole through which the policy can be circumvented\u201d through new illegal maritime arrivals to Australia. It promised to maintain \u201cstrong messaging that Australia is not a settlement destination for illegal maritime arrivals\u201d. The department also warned that allowing \u201cselect refugees access to Australia could trigger risky and undesirable behaviour\u201d, be seen as \u201cinequitable\u201d and result in protests or \u201cincreased self-harm attempts among the refugee cohort (including minors) in an attempt to orchestrate passage to Australia\u201d. The submission sets out a proposal to bring the refugee to Australia as a \u201ctransitory person\u201d, place him in community detention in the care of a relative, and then grant him a temporary protection visa. Dutton noted the arrangements and risks set out in the submission, signing and dating the document on 19 July 2015. The case of the refugee \u2013 who turned 18 in September 2015 \u2013 was first raised by the Australian Human Rights Commission in 2014 with the then immigration minister Scott Morrison. Morrison referred the request to Adeang, the child\u2019s legal guardian, who then wrote to Dutton, the new immigration minister, in February 2015 asking him to transfer the refugee to Australia \u201con a very exceptional basis\u201d. Adeang said the boy was \u201chighly vulnerable and experiences ongoing emotional and psychological distress\u201d. He noted that after the boy\u2019s parents were murdered, the child\u2019s only surviving family members were an elderly grandmother in Myanmar, and two relatives in Australia. The justice minister concluded that \u201cit would be in the boy\u2019s best interest to be reunited with his family members in Australia\u201d. \u201cWhile I am aware of Australian policy, I am also aware that occasionally individual exceptions need to be made.\u201d The refugee arrived at Christmas Island in October 2013, after the July 2013 cutoff when the Rudd government decided that all asylum seekers who arrived by boat would be transferred to offshore detention. He was transferred to Nauru in April 2014 after an immigration department assessment found \u201cthere were no particular vulnerabilities or issues identified\u201d with his case. The submission states that Nauru asked for \u201cpermanent resettlement\u201d of the refugee in Australia and that Dutton agreed that he be \u201cbrought to Australia to settle with his [relative]\u201d. The Coalition was elected in September 2013 promising \u201cmaximum deterrence\u201d against people smuggling, including through reintroduction of temporary protection visas. Since then the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments have argued that any deviation from a zero tolerance approach by Labor would lead to a resumption of people-smuggling boats. The home affairs department said: \u201cThe government has consistently stated that people in regional processing countries will not permanently settle in Australia.\u201d Dutton was contacted for comment.",

And, as you would expect, the real winner was Andrew Neil. It is a joy to watch an exceptionally well-briefed interviewer and the most memorable things that were said tonight were probably those said by him. Interviewers are often accused of not having the facts available to contest dodgy claims made by politicians, and it was worth watching the programmes alone just to hear Neil take on Jeremy Hunt\u2019s claims about the merits of cutting corporation tax, or deflate the \u2018I cut crime by 20%\u2019 boasts we\u2019ve been hearing about the Boris Johnson mayoralty ad nauseam. And then there was the farcical exchange about paragraph 5C of Gatt article 24. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/12/andrew-neil-boris-johnson-tory-leadership-boris-johnson-uses-andrew-neil-interview-to-deny-failing-to-support-ambassador-live-news?page=with:block-5d28d73b8f0845f89e30c26a#block-5d28d73b8f0845f89e30c26a\">7.56pm).</a> Johnson tried briefly to bluff his way through, but even he know when he was beaten, and he was wise enough to end up answering the question honestly; no, he did not know what was in paragraph 5C.</p> \n  <p>Faced with this sort of ordeal, the best that candidates can do is play for a draw and both Hunt and Johnson got through their interviews humbled, but without major disaster. Hunt\u2019s worst moment probably came when he refused to rule out delaying Brexit beyond Christmas. Johnson\u2019s came when he was asked about refusing to back Sir Kim Darroch in the ITV debate on Tuesday. To anyone who watched the debate, it was obvious that Johnson was cutting Darroch loose; he refused a very direct invitation to match Hunt\u2019s promise to keep Darroch in post until the end of the year, when he was due to retire, and he refused to offer even the slightest criticism of President Trump. Tonight Johnson claimed that his words had been misrepresented to Darroch, who he said had not watched the debate live, and he insisted that in fact he had been backing the ambassador. Not for the first time, his self-justification sounded dishonest. Is that any longer a surprise? Perhaps what is more telling is the way this suggests Johnson has been rattled by the strong criticism he has received in recent days for his willingness to let such a senior diplomat go at the behest of Trump.</p> \n  <p>The Johnson camp were probably also relieved that Neil chose not to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2013/mar/24/boris-johnson-accused-nasty-video\"> do an Eddie Mair </a>and focus heavily on character. Johnson came out of the interview looking shallow and evasive, but not especially more than usual. And it\u2019s a Friday night, and most of the votes are probably already in. It is very hard to imagine that he won\u2019t be prime minister in a fortnight. If so, remembering the old saying about how countries get the leaders they deserve, what on earth will this say about Britain?</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-13T06:58:20.625Z\">at 7.58am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d28d9a88f08d0b6ca52f9fd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-12T19:06:50.076Z\">8.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Neil ends with another character question.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Someone who\u2019s worked for you, who knows you well, says you\u2019re all flaws and no character.

I want to fire up businesses, to get young people starting their own businesses justas I started my own business and I accept that a cut incorporation tax isn\u2019t the most popular tax cut, but what it does, if you look at what President Trump did in America, he cut business taxes and it increased the American growth rate. It\u2019s now growing at about twice our rate, about 3% compared to our 1\u00bd%.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has finally conceded that he should have been more supportive towards Sir Kim Darroch, the British ambassador to Washington, in an ITV Tory leadership debate on Tuesday. In the debate Johnson refused to say as PM he would keep Darroch in post despite President Trump refusing to deal with him and this lack of support contributed to Darroch\u2019s decision to resign the following day. At a Tory hustings tonight Johnson for the first time admitted he should have answered the question about this on Tuesday differently. (See 9.25pm.) Earlier, in an interview with Andrew Neil, he defended his role in the affair, claiming his remarks in a televised debate had been \u201cmisrepresented\u201d to the former ambassador to Washington. Jeremy Hunt, Johnson\u2019s rival in the Tory leadership contest, has refused to rule out delaying Brexit beyond Christmas. (See 6.42pm.) Police have opened an investigation into the alleged leaking of diplomatic cables involving the outgoing UK ambassador to Washington, Sir Kim Darroch, and demanded that those responsible hand themselves in. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Andrew Neil is, of course, a brilliant interviewer, but he seems to have been outdone by an (as yet unnamed) heckler at the Conservative party hustings in Cheltenham tonight. The hustings started at the same time as the interviews. Most of us were watching the BBC, but at the hustings Boris Johnson was heckled when he tried to dodge a question about whether he should have been more supportive towards Sir Kim Darroch in the ITV debate on Tuesday, and that forced him to admit for the first time that he should have been. The Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom has the full story. And here is the key quote from Johnson: Well, I don\u2019t think that anything I said was actually decisive in Kim\u2019s decision to resign. Had I my time again, to answer your question directly, yes - I probably should have been more emphatic that Kim personally had my full support. But I was surprised that his tenure as ambassador in Washington should be raised by the foreign secretary as a fitting subject for debate in a Conservative party leadership campaign. This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about the Andrew Neil interview. Or, rather, what they are saying about how Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt performed. The main theme on Twitter seems to be how good Andrew Neil was. From the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush And here is an extract from Bush\u2019s article. Jeremy Hunt did very well explaining away his many inconsistencies and his helter-skelter Brexit positioning but ultimately his performance here felt like watching a team come from four nil down to grab a point: it\u2019s impressive, yes, but you have to ask yourself what he had done wrong to end up in that position in the first place. As for Boris Johnson, he did very badly. He had no grip of the detail, struggled to tackle any of the questions about the mistakes he had made or to defend any of his controversial positions. From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From Sky\u2019s Rob Powell From the Economist\u2019s Adrian Wooldridge From MLex\u2019s Matthew Holehouse From the Specatator\u2019s Katy Balls From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston The BBC\u2019s Reality Check team have been fact-checking some of the claims made in the debate. And this is from the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard. My colleague Patrick Wintour, the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor, also thinks Boris Johnson was not being honest in his interview tonight in what he said about the Kim Darroch affair. The Independent\u2019s John Rentoul has got transcripts of both interviews here. Andrew Neil interviews - Snap verdict: Great for TV viewers, but rather less good for news editors. And, as you would expect, the real winner was Andrew Neil. It is a joy to watch an exceptionally well-briefed interviewer and the most memorable things that were said tonight were probably those said by him. Interviewers are often accused of not having the facts available to contest dodgy claims made by politicians, and it was worth watching the programmes alone just to hear Neil take on Jeremy Hunt\u2019s claims about the merits of cutting corporation tax, or deflate the \u2018I cut crime by 20%\u2019 boasts we\u2019ve been hearing about the Boris Johnson mayoralty ad nauseam. And then there was the farcical exchange about paragraph 5C of Gatt article 24. (See 7.56pm). Johnson tried briefly to bluff his way through, but even he know when he was beaten, and he was wise enough to end up answering the question honestly; no, he did not know what was in paragraph 5C. Faced with this sort of ordeal, the best that candidates can do is play for a draw and both Hunt and Johnson got through their interviews humbled, but without major disaster. Hunt\u2019s worst moment probably came when he refused to rule out delaying Brexit beyond Christmas. Johnson\u2019s came when he was asked about refusing to back Sir Kim Darroch in the ITV debate on Tuesday. To anyone who watched the debate, it was obvious that Johnson was cutting Darroch loose; he refused a very direct invitation to match Hunt\u2019s promise to keep Darroch in post until the end of the year, when he was due to retire, and he refused to offer even the slightest criticism of President Trump. Tonight Johnson claimed that his words had been misrepresented to Darroch, who he said had not watched the debate live, and he insisted that in fact he had been backing the ambassador. Not for the first time, his self-justification sounded dishonest. Is that any longer a surprise? Perhaps what is more telling is the way this suggests Johnson has been rattled by the strong criticism he has received in recent days for his willingness to let such a senior diplomat go at the behest of Trump. The Johnson camp were probably also relieved that Neil chose not to do an Eddie Mair and focus heavily on character. Johnson came out of the interview looking shallow and evasive, but not especially more than usual. And it\u2019s a Friday night, and most of the votes are probably already in. It is very hard to imagine that he won\u2019t be prime minister in a fortnight. If so, remembering the old saying about how countries get the leaders they deserve, what on earth will this say about Britain? Neil ends with another character question. Someone who\u2019s worked for you, who knows you well, says you\u2019re all flaws and no character. The British people will face huge and unprecedented risk with Boris Johnson as prime minister, won\u2019t they? Johnson rejects the claim, and ends with a rant about Jeremy Corbyn. No. I think that the British people face one serious risk and that is that we failed to get Brexit done, we failed to unite our country and we thereby are so remiss as to allow the government of this country to pass into the hands of an avowed Marxist or semi-Marxist who would put up taxes, who would put up taxes on inheritance, on pensions, on incomes, on corporation tax and he would be an economic disaster. And that\u2019s it. I will post reaction and a summary soon. Q: Would you continue with the government\u2019s current fiscal rules? Johnson says he would continue to reduce debt. Asked what the national debt currently is, he says it is about 80% of GDP. Neil tells him it\u2019s 83% Q: Would you accept limits on borrowing? Johnson says there is scope for more borrowing. Neil asks him if he would stick to the government\u2019s second fiscal rule. Johnson says he will be setting out his plans in due course. Neil tells him what the second rule is; not borrowing more than 2% of GDP. He says Johnson seems to be offering a more \u201claxical\u201d fiscal policy. Johnson says \u201claxical\u201d is not a proper word. Q: Who will come first with your tax cuts? The rich or the poor. Johnson replies: The poorest come first. The poorest come first. Johnson says the poorest will take priority when he cuts taxes. There is then what passes for a moment of comedy in these things. BJ: Paragraph 5B. Article 24. Get the detail right. Get the detail right, Andrew. It\u2019s article 24 paragraph 5B. AN: And how would you handle paragraph 5C? BJ: I would confide entirely in paragraph 5B, because that is AN: How would you get round what\u2019s in 5C? BJ: I would confide entirely in paragraph 5B which is enough forour purposes. AN: Do you know what\u2019s in 5C? BJ: No. AN: I thought you were a man of detail. BJ: Well,you didn\u2019t even know whether it was an article or a paragraph, but \u2013 AN: But that\u2019s not the details you told those Tory hustings ... BJ: There\u2019s enough in paragraph 5B to get us the agreement that we want. AN: No. 5C says you don\u2019t just need the EU\u2019s approval; you need to agree with the EU the shape of a future trade agreement ... Neil is now asking about Gatt article 24. Johnson does not challenge Neil when Neil says Johnson wrongly claimed that the UK could use it unilaterally. But Johnson claims it would still be a route to tariff-free trade in the event of no deal. It might be possible and I accept that this has to be done by mutual agreement but it might be possible, for instance, as we come out to agree under Gatt 24 paragraph 5B that both sides agree to a standstill, a protraction of their existing zero tariff-zero quota arrangements until such time as we do a free trade deal. And that will be one way forward. And that would be very attractive and of course it will be up to our friends and partners to decide whether they want to go along with that. Johnson again refuses to rule out proroguing parliament to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit. Neil puts it to Johnson that the EU will not agree a change the backstop. What has changed now, what has changed now is that there is a different approach to the negotiations, a new optimism about what we can do, a new spirit of determination to come properly out of the EU and to get a fantastic deal. And we do that by remitting the solutions to frictionless trade across the Irish border, the Northern Irish border and indeed all other borders to the work that needs to be done to do a free-trade agreement. That is the way to do it. And that\u2019s the way forward. Johnson claims \u201ca new spirit of determination\u201d in the EU means a Brexit deal is now possible. Johnson reasserts his determination to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October. I think it would be absolutely insane now to say that yet again we have a a phoney deadline, it all can be kicked off until - kick the can down the road \u2018till the Greek calends. Johnson defends what he said about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. If you look at what I said, I said - the limit of what she was doing was teaching journalism. What I meant to say was that that was the most they could possibly accuse her of. As it happened \u2013 even that was not true ... I reject entirely the assertion that anything I said made things worse. Neil is summing up this part of the interview. This has been the theme of your campaign. I want to comeback to when our ambassador was on the frontline, in the crosshairs, you did not stand up for him. That\u2019s what worries people. Johnson replies: Because I thought it was totally wrong to drag into the public domain the career prospects of a senior official and to turn that into a political football. Johnson claims he was standing up for Darroch in the Tuesday debate. Neil challenges this. The president called him wacky, pompous, a fool, stupid. You didn\u2019t have a word of criticism of the president. Johnson does not challenge this, but says he has said critical things about Trump in the past. Johnson denies failing to support Sir Kim Darroch, the ambassador to the US, in the TV debate on Tuesday. (See 6.36pm.) Neil gets Johnson to confirm that crime went down by 20% in London when he was mayor. He asks if Johnson knew how much it went down in the country as a whole at the same time. Johnson does not seem to know. \u201cBy 26%,\u201d says Neil. Neil goes on: \u201cSo you didn\u2019t outpace the country. You were part of a national trend.\u201d Johnson repeats figures about his record in London, but he does not challenge Neil\u2019s argument. Another hardball intro from Andrew Neil. He starts: Boris Johnson, we\u2019re going to talk a lot about policy, but I first want to talk about you, because for many people \u2013 including many Tories \u2013 your character, your reputation, trust in you is as big an issue as the policies you stand for. Do you accept that that\u2019s a problem for you? Boris Johnson replies: No, I don\u2019t at all. I think what people want to see is what my plans are to come out of the EU on October 31st, to get that deal done, take us beyond Brexit and unite the country. And I\u2019ve got a lot of things that I think will be fantastic Conservative policies. I think they want to hear about that, they want to hear about what we can do to fight crime, and I think they\u2019ll be interested to know what \u2013 the last time I was asked to fight crime here in this city, what we did in getting it down by, I think, about 20% overall. The murder rate down by about 50%. If people are interested in my character and my political credo or whatever, look at what I deliver. Johnson dismisses suggestions that his character should be an issue in the campaign. Hunt ends on health, saying he secured extra funding for the NHS. Neil says the rate of increase is still lower than the postwar average. And that\u2019s it. Neil asks Hunt to name any big business that has asked for this corporation tax cut. \u201cBusinesses welcome business tax cuts,\u201d Hunt replies. But, when challenged, he cannot name any specific business asking for the corporation tax cut he is proposing. Hunt cannot name any major business calling for the tax cut he proposes. Neil challenges Hunt\u2019s analysis. Mr Trump\u2019s corporation tax cuts were only a small part of an overall fiscal package which has increased the deficit by $2tn in America and has given them a deficit of 5% of GDP. The corporation tax cuts were small in that huge stimulus. Is that your plan in Britain? To get a bigger and bigger deficit, as in America? Hunt replies: Well, our context, of course, is different, but it\u2019s different in two ways. First of all, my corporation tax cuts are much more radical than anything President Trump did. To bring those corporation tax rates down to 12\u00bd%, one of the very lowest in the world, as low as the levels in Ireland. And incidentally, when Ireland did those cuts, they had a GDP per head that was lower than ours. Now it\u2019s nearly 50% higher. Neil says there has been an even bigger cut in corporation tax over the last decade, but, he says: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t turbocharged the economy; we\u2019ve had the slowest recovery in history.\u201d Q: You have made a lot of spending and tax cut pledges. Do those promises stand in the event of a no-deal Brexit? Hunt says the corporation tax cuts would stay. Q: So you would use half the Treasury\u2019s fiscal headroom for tax cuts for businesses? Yes, says Hunt. He explains why. And let me tell you why. First of all, because in a no-deal situation you will have a shock to the economy with the imposition of tariffs and this is a good way to give businesses more headroom to deal with those changes. But secondly, this is I think the nub of the argument that I\u2019m making. I want to fire up businesses, to get young people starting their own businesses justas I started my own business and I accept that a cut incorporation tax isn\u2019t the most popular tax cut, but what it does, if you look at what President Trump did in America, he cut business taxes and it increased the American growth rate. It\u2019s now growing at about twice our rate, about 3% compared to our 1\u00bd%. If we did that in this country we would have an extra 20 billion pounds to spend on precious public services and further tax cuts and that is the heart of our success as a country will be to fire up the economy. Hunt says he would expect Brexit to happen before Christmas, but does not give a firm commitment to deliver it by then. (See 6.42pm.) Hunt says he can get a deal by the end of September. And it could then get through parliament within a month, he claims. I think in that situation parliament will be willing to sit at weekends, will be willing to sit late, to do this, but I think it may take a few extra days and I would be willing to allow those days, yes. Hunt says he would ask MPs to sit at weekends to get Brexit legislation passed before end of October if necessary. Neil challenges Hunt about a claim he has made about Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. You claim that Chancellor Merkel has told you she\u2019s prepared to look at changes to the withdrawal agreement. We\u2019ve spoken to the German chancellery and they have told us the withdrawal agreement is not up for renegotiation. Hunt replies: What I said was that Chancellor Merkel had said to me that if a new British prime minister came forward with a different plan for the Northern Irish border, of course they would look at the package and that is because they want to find a solution to this. Neil turns to the Brexit deal Hunt wants. Q: What is the biggest change you want? The backstop, says Hunt. Q: And would that make it deliverable? I think it would broadly make it deliverable within parliament. I think that certainly earlier this year that would be the case, but I will be, as I say, putting together a negotiating team ... Pressed on what other changes he might want, Hunt just says it is \u201cthe main one\u201d. Hunt repeats the point about the UK leaving. What I say, and what I say as prospective Prime Minister of this country, is that as a democracy, we are leaving the European Union. And if the only way that the Europeans will allow that to happen is without a deal, then so be it, we will do it. But it isn\u2019t my first choice. Hunt says he does not want a no-deal Brexit, but he says he is prepared to go for one if necessary. Neil says only a year ago Hunt said the only person rejoicing in no-deal would be Vladimir Putin. Hunt admits this. What I was saying in that interview is that we have to be very careful. I was saying to the Europeans actually in that interview, because I was in Holland when I gave that interview, be very careful. If you think that no deal is going to be a smooth process \u2013 it risks fracturing the friendship. Hunt explains how his Brexit strategy would be different from Theresa May\u2019s. The main thing that I would do differently to Theresa May is I would not be proposing anything to Brussels that we can\u2019t get through parliament. And so my negotiating team would have the DUP, the ERG, the Brexit purists in our party, Scottish and Welsh Conservatives, because we must think about the union as well. Hunt says Sir Kim Darroch has said that not being backed by Boris Johnson in the TV debate on Tuesday was one of the factors explaining his resignation. Neil taunts Hunt about his business experience. When you were an entrepreneur you didn\u2019t do negotiations anything like what will be required in Brussels, anything like the scale. And you go on about being an entrepreneur, you weren\u2019t exactly Steve Jobs or Bill Gates, were you? Hunt claims that as an entrepreneur he did learn relative skills. Well, I think you do learn the basics of negotiation. The learn the basics of being prepared to walk away ... This could be the smallest contract for someone trying to get a business off the ground as I did, but those basics remain the same. And I will tell you that in government those same skills I use to negotiate very complex things like the Licence Fee deal with the BBC, the NHS pay awards. But Neil is not impressed. Let\u2019s be honest. You may have been doing it all your life but you have no track record of successful negotiation in the big league. Maybe in the minor league, but this is the big league Mr Hunt. Hunt urges him not to \u201cbelittle people up and down the country who have built up businesses\u201d. Q: When you said the next PM has to be someone Brussels will talk to, were you saying the EU would not talk to Johnson? Hunt replies: Well, people can make their own conclusions. When pushed on this, he refuses to criticise Johnson. I have avoided in this leadership campaign making personal comments about Boris, because we\u2019ve got to come together as a party at the end of this. Hunt says he cannot stand up for democracy abroad unless he is will to defend it at home - by implementing the result of the 2016 referendum. How can I be a foreign secretary who stands up for democratic principles in somewhere like Hong Kong, if I\u2019m not prepared to stand up for democratic principles at home in this, one of the oldest, most robust democracies in the world? Q: Why did you vote for May\u2019s deal three times? Hunt replies: The reason I voted for it was because at every stage I voted for us to leave the European Union as quickly as possible. And I didn\u2019t think it was perfect, but I would have preferred right today to be outside the European Union, to have left the EU, to have resolved that issue and then to tackle the imperfections in that deal, the main one of which was the backstop. And as I say, other leading Eurosceptics, people like Jacob Rees-Mogg, for exactly the same reasons, they also voted for that deal because they also wanted us to leave as quickly as possible. Andrew Neil starts with a zinger. Jeremy Hunt - like Theresa May you voted to Remain. LikeTheresaMay you\u2019re a Tory technocrat. Like Theresa May you voted for her Brexit deal, three times. Why would the Tories want more of the same when it\u2019s hardly been a golden age for them? Jeremy Hunt says he is a \u201ctotally different person\u201d with a \u201ctotally different plan. Andrew Neil is opening the programme now. He says the Jeremy Hunt interview will be shown first. And we have a surfeit of interviews this evening. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg has had the challenging task of trying to get Theresa May to say something newsworthy. Some of these comments are almost identical to what Theresa May said in an interview with the Daily Mail this morning. But the highlight of of that interview was this comment, widely seen as a jibe at Boris Johnson. May said: Too many people in politics think being prime minister is a position of power. Actually, it is a position of service to the country where you are always asking yourself \u201cWhat more can I do for the public?\u201d. And here is the Jeremy Hunt clip cited earlier. Here is the Boris Johnson clip cited earlier. And this is what the Press Association has filed about the Jeremy Hunt interview. Tory leadership hopeful Jeremy Hunt has refused to commit to taking Britain out of the European Union before Christmas, saying prime ministers should \u201conly make promises they know they can deliver\u201d. The foreign secretary insisted it was possible to get a revised deal with Brussels by the end of September, and said if it took \u201ca few extra days\u201d to get it through parliament he would delay Brexit beyond the October 31 deadline. But, when pressed during an interview with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil, he refused to say whether the UK would have left by Christmas, though claimed \u201cit\u2019s not going to be months\u201d. Hunt has said that he believes he would be able to get a new deal with Brussels, but if that proved impossible, he would prepare for no deal on October 31, making a judgment on the best course to follow at the end of September. He expressed his confidence in getting a deal by the end of September, telling the BBC: \u201cI believe we can and I, as I say, I think that people like Angela Merkel want to solve this problem. \u201cIf we have a deal, if it\u2019s clear to us and to the Europeans there\u2019s a deal to be done, then of course I would go for that and if it took a little bit - you know, a few extra days - to get it through parliament.\u201d He said parliament would be \u201cwilling to sit at weekends, will be willing to sit late, to do this\u201d but that it \u201cmay take a few extra days and I would be willing to allow those days\u201d. Asked whether he would be prepared to delay by days, weeks or months, Mr Hunt replied: \u201cWell it\u2019s not going to be months.\u201d But pressed on whether the UK would be out by Christmas, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to give you those commitments ... \u201cIt\u2019s because prime ministers should only make promises they know they can deliver. And there\u2019s another reason why we have to be careful about this 31st of October date. \u201cIt is because parliament may try and take a no deal Brexit off the table altogether and so I think - my commitment is that I think I\u2019m the best person to get a deal and if we get a deal it will be on or around the 31st of October but I can\u2019t control what parliament does and that\u2019s why I\u2019m being honest with people about the difficulties.\u201d Hunt went on to say he expected Brexit to happen before Christmas and, when asked if there was any chance the UK could still go in to 2020 as a member of the EU, he replied: \u201cI don\u2019t believe so, no.\u201d In a swipe at his rival Boris Johnson, Hunt said he would deliver Brexit \u201cmore quickly than the alternative\u201d. \u201cIf you want to leave the EU quickly, if you want to avoid a general election, which is the risk if you go about this in the wrong way, I\u2019m the person who has the biggest chance of negotiating that deal and getting us out by October 31.\u201d Andrew Neil is widely regarded as the best prosecutorial interviewer on television. There are other styles of interviewing that can be equally effective and revelatory (sometimes more so), but since cockfighting and bear-baiting have been banned, the British have relied on alternative forms of entertainment and seeing their political leaders getting duffed up on TV by a brilliant forensic performer has been a good substitute. Tonight Neil gets to have a go at Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt. The two half-hour interviews, which have been pre-recorded and go out at 7pm, almost certainly come too late to influence the result. According to one assessment, Johnson already has enough votes in the post to have won, whatever happens before the election closes at the end of next week. But Johnson, who is almost certain to be prime minister within a fortnight, has given relatively few interviews during the campaign, especially to journalists who might be deemed difficult. This is an important moment of scrutiny for him. The Press Association has filed an early story based on what he said in the interview. Here it is. Boris Johnson has admitted a report of his comments about Sir Kim Darroch was a \u201cfactor\u201d in his resignation as Britain\u2019s ambassador to the United States. However, the Tory leadership frontrunner denied failing to give Sir Kim his backing and said his words during a televised leadership debate had been \u201cmisrepresented\u201d. Johnson\u2019s lack of explicit support for Darroch during the ITV debate on Tuesday was widely seen to have been the final straw for the envoy following the leak of his diplomatic cables criticising Donald Trump\u2019s White House. Furious Tory MPs accused the former foreign secretary, who is favourite to succeed Theresa May, of throwing Darroch \u201cunder a bus\u201d, leaving him no option but to resign. But in an interview with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil, Johnson said when he spoke to Darroch by telephone the ambassador told him he had not seen the debate himself although somebody had told him about Mr Johnson\u2019s comments. \u201cHe said that what somebody had relayed to him had been a factor in his resignation,\u201d Johnson said. He added: \u201cI think that unfortunately what I said on that TV debate was misrepresented to Kim.\u201d",

Even the conservative radio host Alan Jones has suggested he now supports moves towards decriminalisation, saying last month that though he \u201cnever thought I would say this\u201d but change was needed.</p> <p>\u201cEverything we have done to date has failed,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything.

It represents only tiny portion of all drug-related deaths in Australia. There were, for example, <a href=\"https://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/news/majority-opioid-overdose-deaths-australia-are-related-pharmaceutical-opioids\">1,045 opioid-related deaths in 2016 alone</a>.</p> <p>This week the inquest has heard about multiple issues with the medical care provided at some of the festivals, including inexperienced doctors, a lack of medical equipment, and issues for paramedics accessing and leaving the festival.</p> <p>It paid particular attention to the service provider EMS, which was employed to provide medical care at both Defqon.1 and the Knockout Circuz festivals in Sydney.</p> <p>Defqon.1 had 30,000 attendees but only two doctors, including one who had never intubated a patient. In his statement, that doctor, Andrew Beshara, conceded the doctors \u201cwere overwhelmed by having to deal with two critically ill patients who presented concurrently\u201d.</p> <p>On Friday the paramedic Timothy Mascorella \u2013 who worked at the Defqon.1 festival where both Nguyen and Pham died \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/12/defqon1-deaths-paramedic-tells-of-disarray-inside-music-festivals-medical-tent\">described the medical care provided at the venue by EMS as \u201ccompletely abhorrent\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Despite assurances by the EMS that they were prepared, he told the inquest the care provided was \u201cpoorly coordinated and indecisive\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"970712bfefc4702c61df2b0bcd8af64ce1dcb30e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/970712bfefc4702c61df2b0bcd8af64ce1dcb30e/0_90_3852_2311/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Timothy Mascorella told the inquest the medical care provided at the Defqon.1 festival was inadequate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Timothy Mascorella told the inquest the medical care provided at the Defqon.1 festival was inadequate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Rae/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI found it extremely difficult to deliver care to this patient as there was no team leader [and] nobody was advocating for the patient adequately,\u201d he said. \u201cThe doctors were giving the patient medications during the [cardiac] arrest that we weren\u2019t aware of.\u201d</p> <p>EMS was also the medical service provider at the Knockout Circuz festival in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney\">Sydney</a>, where Tran died in December 2017, and during the week another paramedic who worked at the festival, Beth Donnelly, also said there was \u201cno clear leadership\u201d among EMS staff.</p> <p>The National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre has also noted that as the purity of MDMA on the market in Australia began to rise in 2011, so too did the number of associated deaths.</p> <p>Brosnan, one of the victims studied by the inquest, who was described by his father, Cornelius, as a talented musician and devoted brother, died of mixed-drug toxicity after taking between six and nine MDMA caps at the Knockout Games of Destiny festival in Sydney in December.</p> <p>The inquest heard that Callum had been a regular MDMA user. He and his friends had first begun using the drug in 2014, when they were in year 9.

      "bodyText": "Outside a coroner\u2019s court in Sydney this week, Julie Tam tried to explain how surreal it felt to be talking about the death of her 22-year-old son, Joshua. His death, from MDMA toxicity suffered at a music festival on the state\u2019s central coast last summer, had \u201cdisrupted the natural order of our family\u2019s lives\u201d, she said. Flanked by her husband, John \u2013 both of them wearing black T-shirts with Joshua\u2019s face printed on the front \u2013 she explained, matter-of-factly, how her family\u2019s lives \u201ccan never, and will never be the same\u201d. \u201cThis was never meant to happen,\u201d she said. Then, in the same restrained voice, she said something heartbreakingly obvious: \u201cJust saying, \u2018don\u2019t do it\u2019, we must all now agree, isn\u2019t working.\u201d In the past decade, the rate of drug-related deaths in Australia has continued to rise. Between 2011 and 2015, deaths from opioid abuse increased by 60% compared with the previous decade while ice-related deaths doubled. This week the New South Wales coroner opened an inquiry into the deaths of six young people from MDMA toxicity at music festivals across the state. It came after a marked increase in the rate of deaths from the drug at festivals; before the five MDMA-related deaths at music festivals in NSW last summer, there had been only 12 across Australia in the previous decade. Something is clearly failing, with fatal results. The spike in deaths comes as other countries around the world are abandoning the rhetoric of \u201cjust say no\u201d and embracing harm reduction and decriminalisation. Now, in Australia too, those calls are getting louder. Even the conservative radio host Alan Jones has suggested he now supports moves towards decriminalisation, saying last month that though he \u201cnever thought I would say this\u201d but change was needed. \u201cEverything we have done to date has failed,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything. So something different has to be done.\u201d But still, state and federal governments are yet to heed that call. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has steadfastly refused to consider introducing pill-testing at music festivals, despite it being common place in many jurisdictions in Europe. \u201cWe are concerned by the unintended consequences of pill-testing,\u201d she said following another MDMA-related death in January. \u201cThe message to young people is \u2018Do not take these tablets\u2019.\u201d But it\u2019s a message harm-reduction advocates say is exacerbating the problem. \u201cThe idea of believing that saying to young people in possession of drugs \u2018just say no\u2019 is an effective message represents either a phenomenal misunderstanding of how the adolescent mind works, or just a lack of concern,\u201d the emergency doctor and pill-testing advocate David Caldicott said this week. The six deaths The youngest of three siblings, Joshua Tam liked to jokingly boast about being his parent\u2019s favourite. A popular, talented rugby player, he was, Julie Tam said outside the coroner\u2019s court, \u201ca normal kid\u201d. This week he was one of six normal kids \u2013 aged between 18 and 23 \u2013 whose deaths are being examined by the NSW coroner. Nathan Tran, 18, Diana Nguyen, 21, Joseph Pham 23, Callum Brosnan, 19, Alexandra Ross-King, 19, and Tam all died from MDMA toxicity or complications of MDMA use at music festivals between December 2017 and January 2019. In addition to those fatalities, at 25 music festivals held in the state in 2018-2019 there were 29 pre-hospital intubations, 25 drug-related intensive care admissions, and at least an additional 23 drug-related hospital admissions. \u201cIn other words, in addition to the five deaths over the summer period, there were many more near misses,\u201d counsel assisting the coroner, Peggy Dwyer, said in her opening address on Monday. According to research by the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, there were about 350 MDMA-related deaths across Australia between 2001 and 2016. It represents only tiny portion of all drug-related deaths in Australia. There were, for example, 1,045 opioid-related deaths in 2016 alone. This week the inquest has heard about multiple issues with the medical care provided at some of the festivals, including inexperienced doctors, a lack of medical equipment, and issues for paramedics accessing and leaving the festival. It paid particular attention to the service provider EMS, which was employed to provide medical care at both Defqon.1 and the Knockout Circuz festivals in Sydney. Defqon.1 had 30,000 attendees but only two doctors, including one who had never intubated a patient. In his statement, that doctor, Andrew Beshara, conceded the doctors \u201cwere overwhelmed by having to deal with two critically ill patients who presented concurrently\u201d. On Friday the paramedic Timothy Mascorella \u2013 who worked at the Defqon.1 festival where both Nguyen and Pham died \u2013 described the medical care provided at the venue by EMS as \u201ccompletely abhorrent\u201d. Despite assurances by the EMS that they were prepared, he told the inquest the care provided was \u201cpoorly coordinated and indecisive\u201d. \u201cI found it extremely difficult to deliver care to this patient as there was no team leader [and] nobody was advocating for the patient adequately,\u201d he said. \u201cThe doctors were giving the patient medications during the [cardiac] arrest that we weren\u2019t aware of.\u201d EMS was also the medical service provider at the Knockout Circuz festival in Sydney, where Tran died in December 2017, and during the week another paramedic who worked at the festival, Beth Donnelly, also said there was \u201cno clear leadership\u201d among EMS staff. The National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre has also noted that as the purity of MDMA on the market in Australia began to rise in 2011, so too did the number of associated deaths. Brosnan, one of the victims studied by the inquest, who was described by his father, Cornelius, as a talented musician and devoted brother, died of mixed-drug toxicity after taking between six and nine MDMA caps at the Knockout Games of Destiny festival in Sydney in December. The inquest heard that Callum had been a regular MDMA user. He and his friends had first begun using the drug in 2014, when they were in year 9. At one point, he had been using the drug every week, and had progressed from taking one to three tablets, to taking between five and 10 on some nights out. On the night he died, however, a leftover cap found in his possession returned, after testing, a \u201cvery high\u201d purity rate of 76%. While Dwyer said this week that there was \u201cno certainty\u201d the rest of the MDMA he consumed was of the same purity, it is \u201csuggestive that they were\u201d. Further risks are posed by the unregulated nature of the illicit drug market. Drug researchers have long been concerned about the exponential rise in so-called synthetic amphetamines, and users have little to no way of knowing what\u2019s in the substance they\u2019re taking. This week the inquest heard that Hoang Tran, known to his family as Nathan, was found with trace levels of the toxic drug PMA in his system. The drug, nicknamed \u201cDr. Death\u201d for its link to dozens of overdose deaths in Australia and overseas, did not initially show up in Tran\u2019s toxicology report but appeared in specialist testing done in Western Australia for the purposes of the inquest. While the result is only preliminary, and revealed only a trace amount of the drug in Tran\u2019s system, Guardian Australia understands the inquest intends to ask the WA lab to investigate whether it can determine what the level of the drug may have been at the time of his death. Caldicott said the drugs were \u201cquite different\u201d to MDMA in that they do not provide the same euphoric and connected feeling that users of the drug seek. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of those exposed to PMA or PMMA are exposed accidentally while pursuing an MDMA like experience,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are far, far more dangerous. The problem is of course is that it doesn\u2019t have that euphoric effect so when a young consumer [takes] it they might be left with the idea that it\u2019s not as good a pill as they intended, so therefore they will re-dose or re-consume and they\u2019re obviously rapidly increasing their dose.\u201d Exacerbating the problem In 1999 the then NSW premier, Bob Carr, called a drug summit in an effort to grapple with a heroin epidemic sweeping Sydney. The summit helped lead to an entire rethink on drug policy. Treatment was prioritised over punishment and NSW was a world leader in harm reduction measures. In June, at a government-commissioned inquiry into amphetamine-type substances including ice and MDMA, Karen Price, the deputy chief executive of Acon, noted the state once had a \u201cpragmatic\u201d approach that had fostered innovation in drug policy. \u201cIn relation to drugs and alcohol, [there was] the needle and syringe program ... the methadone program and probably the last major harm reduction initiative in NSW, the medically supervised injecting centre,\u201d she said. \u201cAll three of those very bold and, in some cases, very contentious initiatives at the time, you know, created a lot of commentary, required public defence and needed to be given enough time to show that they were efficacious, and they have.\u201d But, she noted, progress has since stalled. \u201cWe have, since the drug summit, a very big gap in relation to innovation and trialling and supporting new approaches,\u201d she told the inquiry. \u201cPerhaps some new things need [to be] tried because, to be honest, I think that\u2019s really what we are missing currently in our response.\u201d Indeed, where once NSW and Australia could fairly claim to be ahead of the curve on harm minimisation, other countries have since surged ahead. Portugal successfully decriminalised the possession and use of illicit substances 18 years ago. Canada has embraced the roll-out of medically supervised injection rooms. In the US, Illinois recently became the 11th state \u2013 plus the District of Columbia \u2013 to legalise recreational marijuana use. At the same time, state and federal governments have been resistant to change. In June, Guardian Australia reported that Peter Dutton\u2019s home affairs department had made a submission to the NSW amphetamine inquiry pushing back against growing calls for decriminalisation. Despite the vast majority of organisations in favour of decriminalisation for personal drug use explicitly stating their support for maintaining laws around trafficking and importation, home affairs has argued any move to decriminalisation would create \u201cuncertainty for law enforcement and at the Australian border\u201d. The NSW government has ignored evidence that heavy policing at music festivals \u2013 a staple of events in the state \u2013 can actually increase the risks associated with illicit drug taking. This week, the inquest heard that Ross-King, one of the victims, had taken an unusual \u2013 for her \u2013 amount of MDMA before entering the Fomo music festival in Parramatta in January because she feared being caught with the drugs by the heavy police presence at the event. Another witness, who cannot be named because of a non-publication order, described a police officer telling her she would make a strip search at a music festival \u201cnice and slow\u201d if she did not tell her where she was hiding drugs. Simon Coffey, the director of the Defqon.1 music festival, suggested the heavy police presence at events was an \u201cintimidating experience\u201d for young people that may be contributing to fatalities. \u201cIf a young people goes to a music event and they see a wall of police, drug dogs and riot police and they decide to ingest drugs even before or after that it\u2019s a very intimidating experience for young people,\u201d Coffey said. \u201cIf that young person is on drugs and they need help because they don\u2019t feel well I just wonder \u2026 I don\u2019t think they feel confident going up to a police person because they might feel scared they\u2019ll go to jail.\u201d Yet, as the government\u2019s opposition has hardened, the calls for change have only gotten louder. A range of experts including the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, the Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the former Australian federal police commissioner Mick Palmer have all called for pill-testing to be allowed at festivals. The inquiry into amphetamine-type substances including MDMA is considering pill-testing and decriminalisation, and in February, the NSW deputy state coroner, Harriet Grahame, released findings from an inquest held into opioid-related deaths in which she said the government should consider \u201cdecriminalising personal use of drugs, as a mechanism to reduce the harm caused by drug use\u201d. To people like Julie Tam, the need for change is obvious. \u201cThe reality is that we will continue to lose more of our youth if we don\u2019t change our approach to harm minimisation,\u201d she said this week. \u201cOur family looks forward to the promise of a better future in the hope that many other families will never know what our new normal feels like. A life without our precious son Joshua, for whom we had hopes and dreams and a life time of memories to make, but sadly will never get to experience.\u201d",

They guaranteed they would never get caught.\u201d</p> <p>Chefs around the world have been forwarding influencers\u2019 requests to the prominent Australian restaurant reviewer John Lethlean, who has been publishing them on his Instagram under the hashtag #couscousforcomment.</p> <p>Lethlean, whose restaurant reviews are published weekly in the Australian newspaper, told the Guardian he didn\u2019t republish influencer correspondence to endear himself to the restaurant industry. \u201cI do it mainly because I am so offended by a way a lot of these so-called influencers blur the lines between editorial purity and commercial message.\u201d</p> <p>This dilution of purity includes influencers offering to review a restaurant in exchange for a free meal.</p> <p>The hashtag #couscousforcomment was started in 2016 by Tim Philips-Johansson, co-owner of the Sydney bar and restaurant Bulletin Place, after an influencer contacted him asking for a free meal in exchange for a favourable review.</p> <p>\u201cAny review where the payment is a free meal, you are not going to get an objective outcome,\u201d Philips-Johansson said.</p> <p>As for influencers who promise exposure: \u201cWith influencers, you have no idea how tangible the outcome is. So much of it is guesswork, so much of it is fake followers. What is in it for a restaurant to give away $100 worth of food and drink and someone has, for example, followers outside the country?\u201d</p> <p>If Philips-Johansson has $100 to spend on marketing, he\u2019ll pay for a Facebook post to be targeted at people who live near Bulletin Place.</p> <p>But such is the ubiquity of influencers that some restaurants feel almost as if they are can be held hostage by social media.</p> <p>In Perth the West Australian reported that restaurants were giving away free food to Instagrammers because they were too intimidated to say no.</p> <p>At the Sparrow\u2019s Nest, the cafe\u2019s manager, Lara Wolinski, said she was getting three or four requests from influencers for free food every week and she never turned them away. \u201cThe main reason behind this is a fear of negative publicity or backlash,\u201d she <a href=\"https://thewest.com.au/lifestyle/food/social-media-influencers-hold-perth-restaurants-to-ransom-ng-b881190401z\">told the West Australian</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a certain smugness where they say, \u2018We can give you exposure.\u2019 Really?</p> <footer> <cite>Tim Philips-Johansson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In May a 10-seat Brisbane restaurant, Joy, was the victim of fake reviews after it turned down a request from an influencer for a free meal.</p> <p>After the influencer requested $400 worth of free food and was declined, the restaurant co-owner and chef Tim Scott posted his partner Sarah Scott\u2019s response to Instagram: \u201cI\u2019m not really sure when or why it became acceptable to exchange an Instagram post for years of hard work from two small business owners,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat is not something we are interested in. We run our business with dignity, honesty and integrity.\u201d</p> <p>Within 24 hours, the influencers had posted two fake Google reviews, one saying, \u2018Very rude, I would not go back. Disappointing food.\u2019</p> <p>But because the restaurant is so small, the owners greet every diner \u2013 so they were able to call out the posts as fake.</p> <p>Part of the problem, as far as the chefs are concerned, is the sense of entitlement among some influencers.</p> <p>Says Philips-Johansson: \u201cThere is a certain smugness where they say, \u2018We can give you exposure.\u2019 Really? We politely decline stuff \u2013 we tell every guest they have to pay their own way. Reputable reviewers are different. We can filter out the diamond and the dust.\u201d</p> <p>The big question is: can influencers bring people through the door?</p> <p>Pat Nourse, the creative director of Food and Wine Victoria and a former longtime editor of Gourmet Traveller\u2019s awards and restaurant guide says: \u201cThere\u2019s a handful of chefs and restaurateurs who are on TV shows five or six nights a week, that rate well, they have exposure in newspapers and on radio and have vast social followings and they can\u2019t keep a restaurant open for a year \u2013 some cannot keep the lights on.\u201d</p> <p>Point being: an Instagram post is not going to save them.</p> <p>Allira Carroll, the managing director of Tonic PR, which represents hospitality clients, says she does use influencers in marketing a restaurant but does it carefully, using vetted influencers.</p> <p>\u201cIt could be a client with a new menu,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of our clients is doing a truffle menu and the dishes are very Instagrammable, so we might use an Instagrammer there.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes influencers are paid but many get paid in food and drink and run their Instagram accounts alongside full-time jobs. This could be why so many Instagrammers try to get a free meal at a high-end restaurants \u2013 or post plenty of pictures of cheap food like ice-creams and hamburgers, items that \u201care pretty and not that expensive\u201d, says Nourse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Instagram post from Joy restaurant, Brisbane\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

      "bodyText": "One day in April Duncan Welgemoed, chef and part owner of Africola, was checking his emails when he saw a request from a contestant on the Australian reality TV cooking show My Kitchen Rules. She wanted to dine for free in his restaurant. In return she would post some stories on Instagram, giving him exposure. Africola didn\u2019t need the exposure. It\u2019s one of Australia\u2019s hottest restaurants. Celebrities such as Katy Perry dine there when in Adelaide and pay for their food. And anyway Welgemoed had a direct line to the MKR hosts. Plus his own Instagram account had far more followers than the influencer. His response to the request, posted to his Instagram stories, went viral: \u201cHow about you do the right thing and pay for your meal, like everyone else, you do not generate any hype or actual dollars for any business you post about. The ATO [Australian tax office], suppliers nor staff care about exposure. If katy perry can pay for a meal in my restaurant, so can you. Good luck with your depressing demo at Marion shopping centre.\u201d Welgemoed told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe reason why I was devastating to her is not because I\u2019m a bully, it\u2019s because it was disingenuous offering a collaboration with MKR. Also not doing any research on my restaurant or myself. I have far more real followers than many of these so-called influencers.\u201d The chef also wanted to empower smaller operators to push back. \u201cThe hospo industry is getting knocked pretty hard at the moment. Why I took her down was to encourage smaller operators to not bow to pressure to give away food and drink. I\u2019ve had everyone from knife sharpeners in Wollongong to photographers in Berlin lending their support to me.\u201d In the UK Mick Smith, a chef who runs three successful venues in St Ives, Cornwall including the Porthminster Beach Cafe, told the Guardian that some approaches he gets from influencers can feel like \u201cblackmail\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s like people try and blackmail us: \u2018We want stuff for free or else we\u2019ll write a bad review.\u2019 It\u2019s a big problem.\u201d Only this week, a customer who wanted a discounted glass of wine but was made to pay full price took her complaint to social media. \u201cWithin 30 minutes there were hundreds of extra comments on the post, many of them negative,\u201d says Smith. \u201cYou feel like you have to monitor every social media thing \u2013 people want to take you down.\u201d The chef is approached several times a week by influencers wanting free food. Most offers he declines. He also spends a large part of his time dealing with online reviews and scams. He\u2019s about to appear on the TV show Fake Britain to talk about the barrage of emails he received from fake reviewers on TripAdvisor, \u201csaying they would write thousands of fake reviews \u2013 50p for every review. They guaranteed they would never get caught.\u201d Chefs around the world have been forwarding influencers\u2019 requests to the prominent Australian restaurant reviewer John Lethlean, who has been publishing them on his Instagram under the hashtag #couscousforcomment. Lethlean, whose restaurant reviews are published weekly in the Australian newspaper, told the Guardian he didn\u2019t republish influencer correspondence to endear himself to the restaurant industry. \u201cI do it mainly because I am so offended by a way a lot of these so-called influencers blur the lines between editorial purity and commercial message.\u201d This dilution of purity includes influencers offering to review a restaurant in exchange for a free meal. The hashtag #couscousforcomment was started in 2016 by Tim Philips-Johansson, co-owner of the Sydney bar and restaurant Bulletin Place, after an influencer contacted him asking for a free meal in exchange for a favourable review. \u201cAny review where the payment is a free meal, you are not going to get an objective outcome,\u201d Philips-Johansson said. As for influencers who promise exposure: \u201cWith influencers, you have no idea how tangible the outcome is. So much of it is guesswork, so much of it is fake followers. What is in it for a restaurant to give away $100 worth of food and drink and someone has, for example, followers outside the country?\u201d If Philips-Johansson has $100 to spend on marketing, he\u2019ll pay for a Facebook post to be targeted at people who live near Bulletin Place. But such is the ubiquity of influencers that some restaurants feel almost as if they are can be held hostage by social media. In Perth the West Australian reported that restaurants were giving away free food to Instagrammers because they were too intimidated to say no. At the Sparrow\u2019s Nest, the cafe\u2019s manager, Lara Wolinski, said she was getting three or four requests from influencers for free food every week and she never turned them away. \u201cThe main reason behind this is a fear of negative publicity or backlash,\u201d she told the West Australian. In May a 10-seat Brisbane restaurant, Joy, was the victim of fake reviews after it turned down a request from an influencer for a free meal. After the influencer requested $400 worth of free food and was declined, the restaurant co-owner and chef Tim Scott posted his partner Sarah Scott\u2019s response to Instagram: \u201cI\u2019m not really sure when or why it became acceptable to exchange an Instagram post for years of hard work from two small business owners,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat is not something we are interested in. We run our business with dignity, honesty and integrity.\u201d Within 24 hours, the influencers had posted two fake Google reviews, one saying, \u2018Very rude, I would not go back. Disappointing food.\u2019 But because the restaurant is so small, the owners greet every diner \u2013 so they were able to call out the posts as fake. Part of the problem, as far as the chefs are concerned, is the sense of entitlement among some influencers. Says Philips-Johansson: \u201cThere is a certain smugness where they say, \u2018We can give you exposure.\u2019 Really? We politely decline stuff \u2013 we tell every guest they have to pay their own way. Reputable reviewers are different. We can filter out the diamond and the dust.\u201d The big question is: can influencers bring people through the door? Pat Nourse, the creative director of Food and Wine Victoria and a former longtime editor of Gourmet Traveller\u2019s awards and restaurant guide says: \u201cThere\u2019s a handful of chefs and restaurateurs who are on TV shows five or six nights a week, that rate well, they have exposure in newspapers and on radio and have vast social followings and they can\u2019t keep a restaurant open for a year \u2013 some cannot keep the lights on.\u201d Point being: an Instagram post is not going to save them. Allira Carroll, the managing director of Tonic PR, which represents hospitality clients, says she does use influencers in marketing a restaurant but does it carefully, using vetted influencers. \u201cIt could be a client with a new menu,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of our clients is doing a truffle menu and the dishes are very Instagrammable, so we might use an Instagrammer there.\u201d Sometimes influencers are paid but many get paid in food and drink and run their Instagram accounts alongside full-time jobs. This could be why so many Instagrammers try to get a free meal at a high-end restaurants \u2013 or post plenty of pictures of cheap food like ice-creams and hamburgers, items that \u201care pretty and not that expensive\u201d, says Nourse. Even then, some influencers try to get freebies. This month a San Francisco ice-cream truck operator made international headlines when he posted a sign saying \u201cinfluencers pay double\u201d after becoming fed up with so many requests for free ice-creams \u2013 that cost $4. Nourse sees the rise of Instagram emerging in tandem with the decline of traditional media and says it\u2019s here to stay. \u201cThe days of marquee reviewers are long gone,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are lots of people writing reviews for a free feed, partly because it\u2019s really expensive to write about restaurants when media companies are really strapped for cash.\u201d At the Good Food Guide, a three-hat restaurant used to be reviewed five times, says Nourse, and the Gourmet Traveller guide\u2019s budget for reviews \u201cwas a really fat six-figure sum\u201d. Says Carroll: \u201cChefs would agree that having a seasoned critic review the restaurant is amazing but there are a lot of young people who don\u2019t buy newspapers or magazines. They get their news from social. If you don\u2019t engage with that on some level you\u2019ll miss out.\u201d Nourse agrees: \u201cThe restaurant business is tough and if they can get an edge by giving someone a free hamburger or a glass of wine they will do it \u2013 if that someone is a football player or someone who does really good smoky eye YouTube video, or a semi-finalist in a cooking show. \u201cWho and what moves the dial, there\u2019s no magic bullet \u2013 no one knows how it works these days. It\u2019s the wild west now.\u201d",

It\u2019s a cliche, but the way this first set has played out, it will most likely just come down to very fine margins and who can take their chances. Federer didn\u2019t in the eighth game. But he may get another here, because it\u2019s deuce on Nadal\u2019s serve. Federer goes for the forehand down the line to Nadal\u2019s weaker side, the backhand, but his balance is off.

Another break point, but \u201cvamos\u201d from Bautista Agut indicates that one is saved. Then a drop volley offers the Spaniard a way out but after missing his first serve he is out-rallied by the defending champion. Then he makes a mess of a another drop volley, getting his angles all wrong. Yet another break point. Saved yet again with a crashing overhead slam dunk.

And if any tennis match merits a place on such lists, surely it\u2019s <em>that </em>Wimbledon final of 2008.</p> <p> The match widely seen as the greatest of all time had it all: a five-times defending champion against a fierce rival who he had beaten in the past two Wimbledon finals but had just denied him the French Open title for the third consecutive year; the contrast in styles between the calm and artful Swiss and the punkish and piratical Spaniard, all fist pumps and jumps and whose game plan was to wear his opponent down and drive him to despair; a quite staggering level of play punctuated by two rain breaks that added to the drama; a recovery from two sets to love down and the saving of two championship points to force a decider; and a 9-7 final-set finale in near darkness in which a new champion was crowned after the longest Wimbledon final in history. This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jul/01/roger-federer-rafael-nadal-wimbledons-greatest-final-a-decade-on\">wonderful piece from Andy Bull</a> is well worth a read if you want to relive the spectacle.</p> <p> Now here Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer are again, meeting at Wimbledon for the first time in 11 years. The fact they\u2019re still going so strong, aged 33 and 37 respectively, ranked second and third in the world and having shared the past 10 grand slam titles along with Novak Djokovic (Nadal has four, Federer and Djokovic three), is almost as staggering as that final itself. For all the talk of the so-called Next Gen, this great tennis triumvirate just keep going on, and the gap between them and the rest of the field is arguably wider than ever.</p> <p> Which brings us on to the great subplot to this Wimbledon finale: the battle to be the greatest of all time. A third Wimbledon triumph for Nadal, who added the 2010 title to his 2008 crown, would move him only one behind Federer\u2019s tally of 20, which would be the closest he\u2019s ever been to the record holder. Meanwhile victory for Djokovic would put him on 16 and, at the age of 32, with plenty of time to out-GOAT the GOAT.</p> <p>In the context of all of this, spare a thought for the odd man out today, Roberto Bautista Agut, who\u2019s appearing in his first grand slam semi-final. Being a 30-something, he does at least have something in common with Fedalovic \u00ad\u2013 if SerAndy/Murena is bestowed on Serena Williams and Andy Murray, surely the Big Three deserve a combined name of their own? \u2013 while Bautista Agut will take comfort from the fact he\u2019s beaten Djokovic twice already this year, in Doha and Miami. </p> <p> Defeating a fully focused Djokovic in the best of five sets at a grand slam is an entirely different proposition, however, and the world No 1 was in devastating form in the quarter-finals against David Goffin, dropping only six games. Bautista Agut has had to rearrange his stag do to be here today, but if his opponent is in a similar mood to Wednesday, things could get just as messy for the Spaniard as a week partying in Ibiza. </p> <p><strong>Play begins at:</strong> 1pm BST.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-12T11:54:00.202Z\">at 12.54pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Right, that\u2019s it from me for today. Thanks for reading/emailing/tweeting. Federer v Nadal 2019 was never going to trump the classic of 2008 but it was still some sequel, especially that gripping finale in which Nadal saved four match points. Do join me again tomorrow when another 37-year-old great will be looking to write her own piece of history. Bye! Kevin Mitchell\u2019s match report: So Federer\u2019s prize \u2013 or perhaps punishment \u2013 for victory is a final with Novak Djokovic. It will be the first time they\u2019ve met in a grand slam final since the 2015 US Open and their first meeting here since the final also four years ago, which Djokovic won in four sets. Djokovic, as the defending champion and world No 1, will be the favourite, no doubt, on Sunday but if Federer can reproduce the form he showed against Nadal, then he\u2019ll have a superb chance. Federer is interviewed. And he\u2019s actually sweating! I\u2019m exhausted. It was tough at the end. Rafa played some unbelievable shots to stay in the match. I enjoyed it. The crowd were amazing. I had spells where I was serving very well and probably the biggest points in the match went my way. That first set was huge as well, to get the lead. Novak played great against Bautista Agut. He\u2019s supreme again. He\u2019s not No 1 just by chance. He\u2019s been so good for the last year. I\u2019m very excited to say the least. Nadal decides to take off his shoe at the changeover and fiddle with a blister. No sign of the trainer though. It would take some nerve to call them on at this stage of the match. So Federer steps up to serve for a place in the final. Will he come to regret those two missed match points? It doesn\u2019t look like it at 30-15, but a Federer error follows and it\u2019s 30-all. He uses up his final Hawk-Eye challenge with an unsuccessful appeal. Federer makes an absolute hash of the smash! 30-40, break point. An enthralling rally ensues ... but Nadal bludgeons a backhand into the net! Deuce. Advantage Federer, a third match point, as Federer holds firm at the net. Time stands still as the pair play out a gripping point, and Nadal eventually pummels away a forehand winner! Mirka has her head in her hands. But she\u2019s celebrating when Federer soon brings up another match point. Again Nadal pulls off the winner! Here\u2019s a fifth match point, and this time Federer takes it when Nadal biffs a backhand long! The 40th instalment of their rivalry comes to an end with a warm embrace at the net. Federer is into his 12th Wimbledon final and one win away from a record-extending ninth title at the ripe old age of 37! The King of Wimbledon holds court in front of his adoring subjects while Nadal, ever the gentleman, still signs a few autographs despite his second consecutive semi-final defeat here. Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-1, 3-6, 4-5 Federer* (*denotes next server) I haven\u2019t seen this level of intensity from Federer in quite some time. He can get edgier than he did earlier in his career, but there\u2019s absolutely no indication that\u2019s going to happen here. Nadal seems comfortable at 40-15. Federer fights back to deuce. And he\u2019s two points from victory! Some Hawk-Eye drama as Federer stops the point to challenge. He\u2019s wrong. If he hadn\u2019t challenged it would be match point! Instead it\u2019s Nadal\u2019s advantage. But Federer puts that Hawk-Eye moment out of his mind to get back to deuce. And here\u2019s a match point! Federer\u2019s return is well long. Deuce. Ace, advantage Nadal. A fourth deuce. Advantage Federer, a second match point. Deuce. Advantage Nadal, after a quite wonderful rally. Game Nadal. There were two match points in the fourth set of their 2008 final before it went the distance. Could history be repeating itself? Fourth set: *Nadal 6-7, 6-1, 3-6, 3-5 Federer (*denotes next server) \u201cI think that 2008 final was indeed the greatest match of all time,\u201d emails Mark Pulfer, \u201cbut I really liked the 1992 final between Ivanisevic and Agassi; that was a five setter that swung back and forth and was only decided by a hairline margin at the end of the fifth. It was Agassi\u2019s first major against a gut wrenching performance by Ivanisevic. I felt so bad for Ivanisevic that day (although I was supporting Agassi) and was glad to see him win Wimbledon years later.\u201d Federer is showing no sign of blinking near the finish line, and another fuss-free hold has Nadal needing to hold serve to stay in this semi-final. Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-1, 3-6, 3-4 Federer* (*denotes next server) \u201cSafin v Federer, Aus Open, SF 2005 without a doubt,\u201d declares David Hindle. Federer defies physics with a ridiculous angled cross-court winner on the run, which causes thousands of jaws to fall on to the floor on Centre Court. 30-all. But it doesn\u2019t cause Nadal\u2019s shoulders to drop. He takes the next two points for the game. Fourth set: *Nadal 6-7, 6-1, 3-6, 2-4 Federer (*denotes next server) A punishing rally on the third point, in fact the most punishing of the day at 26 shots, and this time it\u2019s Nadal who takes it. 15-30. But Nadal is furious with himself when he can\u2019t take advantage of an inviting second serve. 30-all. 40-30. Game Federer, who swats the balls straight back to Nadal for the Spaniard to serve. Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-1, 3-6, 2-3 Federer* (*denotes next server) I must admit I didn\u2019t think Federer would be able to dominate Nadal like this, especially given the way Nadal surged to the semi-finals. Usually it\u2019s Nadal who has his opponents on a piece of string, lassoing those viciously spun forehands and catching them in his noose. But Nadal is the one struggling to breathe here and, despite a hold to 15, has so much to do to turn this around. Fourth set: *Nadal 6-7, 6-1, 3-6, 1-3 Federer (*denotes next server) \u201cI think Halep v Kerber Australia semi in 2018 deserves a shout here as one of the best tennis matches,\u201d emails Gordon Hunt. \u201cIn terms of finals, the Wozniaki v Halep match two days later is up there. Nadal v Djokovic Australia 2012, also. Obviously. I\u2019m not an Aussie, which I feel I should note after tipping three from that event! But Fed v Nadal 07, 08 were total gems.\u201d Federer is showing no signs of letting up here and holds to love. Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-1, 3-6, 1-2 Federer* (*denotes next server) Federer is on the charge at 0-30 but is checked by a net cord. 15-30. Nadal apologises. But given the severity of the situation, I doubt he\u2019s too sorry. A rocket of an inside-out forehand from Federer and here are two break points. His level of aggression today has been staggering. He\u2019s gliding around Centre Court like a 27-year-old rather than a 37-year-old. But Nadal then crunches a winner of his own. 30-40. Nadal appeals to Hawk-Eye when his serve is called out by the umpire on an overrule. The umpire was right. Nadal gets his second serve in, but Federer blows him away with his return, and Nadal overhits his backhand! Fourth set: *Nadal 6-7, 6-1, 3-6, 1-1 Federer (*denotes next server) Another superb volley to add to the Federer showreel on the fourth point. You wouldn\u2019t know he\u2019s 37 looking at his lightning reflexes today. Federer also holds to 30. Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-1, 3-6, 1-0 Federer* (*denotes next server) This match has a completely different complexion to that 2008 final, in which Federer was always chasing, having been two sets to love down. And he\u2019s such a formidable frontrunner. Federer gives Nadal a does of his own medicine at the start of this fourth set as he makes the Spaniard wait to serve. Federer is the king here, after all. He can do what he likes. It doesn\u2019t put off Nadal, who holds to 30. So Federer is serving for the set. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, when Nadal races forward and Federer picks him off with the pass. Three set points. And Nadal nets on the first! Federer serves out nervelessly to love and the eight-times champion is a set away from yet another Wimbledon final! Third set: Nadal 6-7, 6-1, 3-5 Federer* (*denotes next server) Federer looks as if he quite fancies breaking Nadal here, perhaps so he can serve first at the start of the fourth. 0-30. Nadal steadies himself for 15-30, before storming back to 30-all with an ace out wide. The camera pans to Uncle Toni, who\u2019s no longer Nadal\u2019s full-time coach but is watching today from the players\u2019 box. Nadal holds from there, to at least ask the question of Federer. Third set: *Nadal 6-7, 6-1, 2-5 Federer (*denotes next server) Some more reminiscing, this time courtesy of Kenneth Ross. \u201c1) Bjorn Borg v John McEnroe 2) Federer v Nadal 3) Goran Ivanisevic v Pat Rafter 4) Venus Williams v Lindsay Davenport. There\u2019s a reason why the All England Club recently did a theatrical recreation of the 1980 Borg, McEnroe final before this year\u2019s tournament. It was classic to watch then and remains a classic nearly four decades later. Best tennis match I\u2019ve ever seen on television. (Best live one I\u2019ve ever seen - 1984 US Open women\u2019s final, Evert v Navratilova, along with Lendl v Cash and McEnroe v Connors the same Super Saturday.)\u201d Federer holds to 15, and could be only a game away from taking a two sets to one lead that would leave this humble game-by-game reporter eating my words, given I predicted a Nadal win in four. Third set: Nadal 6-7, 6-1, 2-4 Federer* (*denotes next server) \u201cNadal v Federer 2007 is the second best final,\u201d says Steve Holt. Meanwhile this from Antony Powell: \u201cAshe v Connors without a doubt! Never forget the lone voice from the crowd, \u201cCome on, Jimmy!\u201d Connors: \u201cI\u2019m trying, dammit!\u201d\u201d And look here, Federer has 0-30 on Nadal\u2019s serve. Could this third set be as one-sided as the second? These are wild swings in momentum. 0-30 becomes 15-40. Nadal neutralises Federer on the first break point with an unreturned serve out wide. Another strong first serve sets up the second break point too. Deuce. Advantage Nadal. Game Nadal, but he\u2019s living extremely dangerously. Third set: *Nadal 6-7, 6-1, 1-4 Federer (*denotes next server) But Federer just can\u2019t shake Nadal off. Every time he thinks he\u2019s put some daylight between them, Nadal comes back at him, much like Nadal did after the first set. 15-30 turns into 15-40 when Federer double faults for the first time. Federer fends off the first break point. The pair trade blow after blow on the second, and Nadal knocks himself out when he goes long! That was the longest rally of the match at 23 shots. Deuce. Advantage Nadal. Deuce. Advantage Federer. Game Federer. That\u2019s a huge hold. Third set: Nadal 6-7, 6-1, 1-3 Federer* (*denotes next server) With this third set yet to really get going, a question for you: apart from Nadal v Federer in 2008, what\u2019s your favourite Wimbledon final? Goran Ivanisevic v Pat Rafter? Venus Williams v Lindsay Davenport? Bjorn Borg v John McEnroe and that 18-16 tie-break? Any others? But just as my thoughts drift away from today\u2019s action, Federer drills a backhand down the line for 30-all and then flicks away a forehand cross-court winner for 30-40, break point. Can Federer break Nadal for the first time in this match? A wonderful game of cat and mouse plays out at the net, Nadal appears to be in the ascendancy, but Federer emerges victorious with a backhand volley on the line! Third set: *Nadal 6-7, 6-1, 1-2 Federer (*denotes next server) James Keothavong, the umpire and brother of Britain\u2019s Fed Cup captain, Anne, is almost taken out by an errant ball, but that\u2019s about as much drama as there is in this game. Federer whizzes through to love again. Third set: Nadal 6-7, 6-1, 1-1 Federer* (*denotes next server) So can Federer regroup at the start of this third set? A love hold suggests he can. \u201cI wonder who would Novak want to play against,\u201d muses Abhinav Bhadula. \u201cFor obvious reasons, Federer seems like lesser of the two evils... older, strength waning out.... But playing a Wimbledon final against Fedrer would be like playing against the complete stadium and almost whole of the world. How do you play when everyone in the stadium wants you to lose?\u201d Nadal responds with a speedy hold of his own. Federer is a shadow of the player he was in the first-set tie-break and is again broken when a framed forehand flies into the stands. With Nadal serving for the second set, desperate times call for desperate measures, as Federer launches a SABR \u2013 sudden attack by Roger \u2013 charging in off his return. It doesn\u2019t pay off. Nadal has three set points at 40-0 and needs only one. After an absorbing first set, an all-too-quick second. We\u2019re all square. Second set: Nadal 6-7, 4-1 Federer* (*denotes next server) Having missed the chance to break in that previous game, Federer finds himself having to fight off three break points on his own serve at 0-40. As the shadows start to drift across Centre Court, Federer flaps into the net. His level has suddenly dipped and he may live to regret not being able to make the most of those break points at 1-1. Nadal consolidates the break with the minimum of fuss and the momentum of this match has quickly changed, just as it ebbed and flowed in that 2008 final. Second set: Nadal 6-7, 2-1 Federer* (*denotes next server) The 37-year-old Federer has a little break before commencing the next game. Usually it\u2019s Nadal keeping his opponent waiting with this tics and tricks. Speaking of which, have you noticed his eccentricities are so exact that he touches his shorts twice, shirt twice, nose twice and hair twice before every first serve? It\u2019s quite draining to watch when you focus on it. I wonder what would happen if he cut loose once in a while. Perhaps Centre Court would spin off its axis. But then perhaps it already has, because Federer has two break points at 15-40. Both come and go. Federer will feel he should have done better on the second, when he nets a second-serve return. And Nadal doesn\u2019t give him another chance. Two points later it\u2019s game. Second set: *Nadal 6-7, 1-1 Federer (*denotes next server) Beware a wounded Nadal. He first holds to 30, before getting himself a break point at 30-40 in the next game. It comes and goes, but a breathtaking point at deuce goes Nadal\u2019s way. The match took a while to really get going, but this is staggering stuff. Even Federer, usually so quiet, is grunting on every ball because of the sheer effort he\u2019s having to put in. On the second break point Federer withstands a barrage of balls at the net to get it back to deuce. And after another couple of deuces he\u2019s able to hold. Centre Court breathes again. ... and this time Federer forges ahead for the first time in the tie-break, going to Nadal\u2019s backhand, before conjuring up a forehand winner! 4-3 Federer with the mini-break. Make that 5-3, 6-3, after two stinging first serves. Three set points, the first of which is on Nadal\u2019s serve. But no bother, Federer wins it anyway, with a great return, rounded off with another forehand strike! He leaps into the air, the crowd are on their feet, as is his wife, Mirka. After 12 consecutive holds, Federer has taken five points on the spin to claim what could be a crucial first set. They\u2019re both such great frontrunners; in their contests the player who\u2019s won the first set has taken the match 31 out of 39 times. It\u2019s the first set Nadal had dropped here since that acrimonious arm-wrestle with Nick Kyrgios in the second round. That 2008 final was not only the Greatest Match of All Time \u2122, it featured two of the best tie-breaks the game has ever seen. What can they produce here? A quite ridiculous first point has the crowd on their feet as Nadal shows stunning speed to chase down the drop volley and dispatch it for the winner. But Nadal concedes the mini-break immediately. 1-1. Which becomes 2-2. Federer feathers a slice into the net, giving Nadal another mini-break for 3-2. Again, Nadal can\u2019t capitalise and his lob loops long. 3-3 at the change of ends ... First set: Nadal 6-6 Federer* (*denotes next server) \u201cKaty, what do you think will be the deciding factor in this match?\u201d asks Kenneth Ross. \u201cOffence or defence? Serving aggressively or attacking on the returns? So glad these two are back on Centre Court playing each other. As a lifelong tennis fan and player approaching 50, I still vividly remember watching their 2008 final that Sunday in July - first at home, then in a newspaper newsroom, where all of us reporters and editors were watching the end of the match, absolutely spellbound.\u201d Well both are going for offence at the moment. It\u2019s a cliche, but the way this first set has played out, it will most likely just come down to very fine margins and who can take their chances. Federer didn\u2019t in the eighth game. But he may get another here, because it\u2019s deuce on Nadal\u2019s serve. Federer goes for the forehand down the line to Nadal\u2019s weaker side, the backhand, but his balance is off. Advantage Nadal. Game Nadal. This will be settled by a tie-break. First set: *Nadal 5-6 Federer (*denotes next server) Both players are looking so business-like at the business end of this set. These are short, sharp points, and they\u2019re both battering the poor lines to within about a millimetre of their lives. Federer fizzes through to love. Cue Abhinav Bhadula. \u201cPeople keep saying Nadal is favourite to win this tie... somehow I feel that\u2019s insulting to Federer. No one would call Federer the favourite on a clay court against Nadal. Federer deserves the same respect on grass.. I think he\u2019ll prove many people wrong today.\u201d First set: Nadal 5-5 Federer* (*denotes next server) The camera zooms in on a boy who\u2019s reading a book in the stands. Get him out! There\u2019s several thousand spectators around the grounds who\u2019d bite his hand off for his ticket. Nadal holds to 15. First set: *Nadal 4-5 Federer (*denotes next server) Now it\u2019s Federer\u2019s turn to feel a little pressure on serve at 30-all. But he responds by firing down not one but two aces for the game. First set: Nadal 4-4 Federer* (*denotes next server) Nadal is serving with new balls, as if he needs any more serving assistance right now. His serve has been so strong this tournament. But as soon as I write that Nadal slips to 15-30. He decides attack is the best form of defence as he strides toward the net, forcing the error from Federer. 30-all. He launches an all-out attack on the next point but fires long. 30-40, the first break point of the match, and it\u2019s come out of nowhere. The pair go at each other in the longest rally of the match, the crowd gasp when a viciously spun Nadal forehand they thought was going out dips in, and after 21 shots Nadal is victorious. Deuce. Advantage Nadal. And Nadal slams the door shut just as quickly as it opened. First set: *Nadal 3-4 Federer (*denotes next server) You can guess what happens next, right? 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game Federer. Both players are more aggressive than they were 11 years ago and are looking to finish the points more quickly. Federer\u2019s conceded only three points on serve in four games, Nadal two points in three. First set: Nadal 3-3 Federer* (*denotes next server) There\u2019s absolutely nothing giving on serve right now. Nadal holds to love. I\u2019ve been asked to plug this women\u2019s final preview, but the way these two are ripping through their service games the first set may nearly be over by the time you come back: First set: *Nadal 2-3 Federer (*denotes next server) \u201cNadal = GOAT,\u201d emails Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cNadal is my favourite player. Nadal is fresh off another inevitable Roland Garros triumph. Nadal is virtually impossible to beat if he wins the first set, which he should. In conclusion, Nadal is going to the final after a victory against Federer, where he will lose to Djokovic again.\u201d Federer looks as if he quite fancies proving Abhijato wrong as he flies through another service game, this time to 15. First set: Nadal 2-2 Federer* (*denotes next server) At 15-0, Federer\u2019s effort stops dead on the line. 15-all. The first point he\u2019s won on Nadal\u2019s serve. But he shanks his return and it\u2019s 30-15. A classic one-two punch straight from the tennis textbook from Nadal, with a serve out wide backed up by a forehand to the other side, and it\u2019s 40-15. Federer reduces his arrears to 40-30 but is unable to make further inroads into Nadal\u2019s serve. First set: *Nadal 1-2 Federer (*denotes next server) The crowd are by no means muted but they\u2019re not in full voice either. Perhaps they\u2019re conflicted as to who to support. Federer is, of course, the king of Wimbledon. But then the crowd also adore the King of Clay. Federer responds to Nadal\u2019s love hold with one of his own. First set: Nadal 1-1 Federer* (*denotes next server) I mentioned the need for Federer to get off to a strong start \u2013 he\u2019s only beaten Nadal twice after dropping the first set \u2013 so he could do with finding his feet quickly on Nadal\u2019s serve. But that doesn\u2019t happen here, with Nadal racing to 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game. First set: *Nadal 0-1 Federer (*denotes next server) Are you ready for Federer v Nadal XL? They\u2019re ready. Let\u2019s play. It took 14 strokes to settle the first point of that 2008 final; this one is over in one as Federer rattles down an ace. The whole game looks as if it\u2019ll be over in less than 14 shots at 40-15, but Federer fires long, before coming through to 30. Tim Henman says he\u2019s also going for Nadal in four. Boris Becker is hedging his bets and can\u2019t decide between Federer in three or Nadal in four. But his indecision does highlight that it\u2019s more important for Federer to get off to a quick start. Tik! Tok! Tikity! Tok! They\u2019re warming up. The last time these two met only four weeks ago, Federer was blown away by Nadal in the Roland Garros dust bowl, in some of the worst conditions seen at French Open. Conditions are set fair today, with the sun broken up by only a few clouds. They arrive on court to a rip-roaring welcome. It would have been fun if Federer had rocked up in his daft gold-trimmed cardigan of 2008 and Nadal had opted for the sleeveless top and long shorts. But some things don\u2019t change, as Nadal carefully lines up his two water bottles with the labels facing the court, jumps up and down during the coin toss and then does his raging bull charge to the back of the court for the warm-up. But I digress. Here they are waiting to step on to court. Nadal makes sure he\u2019s not under the door frame as he performs his obligatory jump. What a difference a year makes. At this stage 12 months ago, time became one flat circle as Kevin Anderson and John Isner drove themselves - and Centre Court - to despair with that 26-24 final set in a serving slugathon lasting six hours and 35 minutes. There\u2019s no chance of a repeat of that scoreline today, what with that match having prompted this year\u2019s introduction of a fifth-set tie-break at 12-12, but I\u2019m sure everyone here would take a 50-game decider between Federer and Nadal. Nadal says: \u201cPlaying against Roger is always a unique situation. I\u2019m excited to be back on Centre Court against him after 11 years. It means a lot for me and probably for him, too. The opportunities to play against each other are becoming less, but we still here. \u201cI\u2019m not expecting to learn new things about him. I just expect to play against probably the best player in history on this surface. I know he\u2019s playing well. He feels comfortable here. \u201cI\u2019m playing well, too. I am playing with a very high intensity, playing aggressive, serving well and returning very well. I know that I have to play my best.\u201d Federer says: \u201cRafa has improved so much over the years on this surface. He\u2019s also playing very differently. I remember back in the day how he used to serve, and now how much bigger he\u2019s serving, how much faster he finishes points. \u201cWe have a lot of information on Rafa, as does he on us. So you can dive into the tactics like mad, or you say: \u2018It\u2019s grass-court tennis so I\u2019m going to come out and play my tennis.\u2019 I\u2019m excited to play him again.\u201d Prediction time. I\u2019m conflicted. My heart says Federer \u2013 this is his tournament, after all \u2013 but my head says Nadal. He\u2019s arguably been the better player this fortnight. And he\u2019s usually the better player when these two meet, leading the head-to-head 24-15. Though we probably shouldn\u2019t read too much into Nadal\u2019s 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 win over Federer at the French Open four weeks ago given it was on clay. I\u2019m going for Nadal, probably in four, as is Greg Rusedski: Which gives you enough time to read this. And perhaps watch this. I\u2019m getting goosebumps just thinking about that match. There\u2019s a 30-minute break between the semi-finals, by the way, so Federer and Nadal will be on court in around 10 minutes\u2019 time. Here\u2019s Simon Cambers\u2019s match report: I\u2019m back. Thanks for seeing that out John. It was a tasty enough appetiser to the main event. Things were in the balance after two sets but then Djokovic did what Djokovic does. He\u2019s just so damn hard to beat. The world No 1 seems to have fully recovered from the disappointment of losing in the French Open semi-finals last month when his bid for a second Novak Slam ended, and whoever wins between Federer and Nadal next, Djokovic will be the favourite to win a fifth Wimbledon title \u2013 which would draw him level with Bjorn Borg \u2013 on Sunday. As for Bautista Agut, having just gone four sets with the world No 1, including that 45-shot rally, he\u2019ll now have to find some energy for his stag. Djokovic speaks: This has been a dream tournament for me as a child, to be in the final is a dream come true. Playing finals at Wimbledon is something different. I had to dig deep. He was not overwhelmed with the stadium and occasion. The first set he was probably managing his nerves but at the beginning of the second he established himself. I got a bit tight. It was a very close opening four or five games of the third set. I\u2019m glad it went my way. Of course I\u2019ll watch [Federer v Nadal]. It\u2019s one of the most epic rivalries of all time. That was harder work than expected, but the job is completed. Bautista Agut initially lets Djokovic off with a failed forehand winner. Then comes an ace. The celebrations are temporarily delayed by a scrabbling winner from the Spaniard. A whipped smash that sends his opponent the wrong way takes Djokovic takes him to match point. But...a brilliant passing shot evades his dive. Then, a drop shot forces a run from Bautista Agut and his own drop volley. It\u2019s called out. But is challenged and we are back to deuce. Then comes a wide service return to force another match point, and that\u2019s not taken up when Djoko hits the net cord. We go again, for a third match point after a weary backhand. OK, here it comes..no, failed attempt at an ace. Then there\u2019s another save. Four match points saved, in fact. Then an ace on second serve forces a FIFTH match point. Then it comes, as his serve cannot be returned. The champion is into the final once more and has the chance of a fifth title. Ok, cue Roger and Rafa. And Bautista Agut\u2019s stag do can be properly convened. Fourth set: Djokovic* 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 5-2 Bautista Agut (*denotes next server) A dead cat bounce? Bautista Agut recovers some lost pride with three points in a row, including an ace to make it 40-0. Then a decent second serve forces mistake from Djokovic. Bautista Agut holds to love and all credit to him. Fourth set: Djokovic 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 5-1 Bautista Agut* (*denotes next server) No mistake made here, with Bautista Agut looking bereft of spirit. A serve volley takes it to 30-0, then a wild ground shot takes it to 40-0. Then comes an ever wilder attempt at a forehand winner. Two successive service games to love from Djokovic. Fourth set: Djokovic* 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 4-1 Bautista Agut (*denotes next server) Oh dear, this one looks over. Bautista Agut could not afford to lose this one, but his serve fails him as he double faults to make it 30-30 and give Djokovic the glimpse of another break. Then another of those disastrous drop shots hands Djokovic that break point. Djokovic steps up to bully his way to seizing it. Bautista Agut needs a miracle. Fourth set: Djokovic 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 3-1 Bautista Agut* (*denotes next server) This looks ominous. To force home his advantage, the champion drills home a service game to love. Bautista Agut is now playing on sudden death, his efforts now failing him. Fourth set: Djokovic* 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 2-1 Bautista Agut (*denotes next server) First break of the fourth set. Djoko is making far better use of the drop shot than his opponent. There is a gasp as Djokovic falls to the ground as he is beaten by a forehand winner. No harm done, and he is swiftly back on his feet. It goes to 30-30, and then another failed Bautista Agut drop shot is chased down to force a break point. Then the Spaniard goes long, too long when Djokovic ramps up the pressure with some fierce baseline hitting. Fourth set: Djokovic 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 1-1 Bautista Agut* (*denotes next server) Djoko begins the game a little lazily once more. Then finds his gears to chase Bautista Agut all over the court. Bautista makes a challenge on a shot that would have made it 15-30 but he had misjudged the flight of the ball. He then misses a winner that would have given him break point. Djokovic serves his way to levelling the score in the fourth set. Fourth set: Djokovic* 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 0-1 Bautista Agut (*denotes next server) This was a marathon. A hold. Just. Djokovic looks a little weary after blasting through that last set but he takes Bautista Agut to deuce with a shot right to the apex of the court. Bautista Agut a little wobbly on his serve, and even wobblier when he plays a drop shot after a long rally. Djokovic was lost, but the ball came off the net to hand over a break point. The Spaniard serves and volleys his way out of that. Djoko calls to the heavens and his prayers are answered with his execution of a far better drop shot. Another break point, but \u201cvamos\u201d from Bautista Agut indicates that one is saved. Then a drop volley offers the Spaniard a way out but after missing his first serve he is out-rallied by the defending champion. Then he makes a mess of a another drop volley, getting his angles all wrong. Yet another break point. Saved yet again with a crashing overhead slam dunk. Then a forehand winner to force another advantage by the server. Then a serve and volley - only his fourth of the entire tournament - means Bautista Agut holds his serve. John Brewin is here to take you through the fourth set. Over to you, John ... Bautista Agut has enough in the tank after that draining duel to hold comfortably, forcing Djokovic to serve this out. A rare sign of frustration from Bautista Agut as he slaps the net with his racket after slipping 30-0 down. He\u2019s soon 40-0 behind. Three set points for Djokovic. Djokovic steps up to the plate ... and produces only his second double fault. It matters not, though, because he secures the set on the next point with a cross-court volley, aided by a net cord. So they\u2019re even after Bautista Agut\u2019s good fortune at the end of the second. But there\u2019s nothing even about the score, with Djokovic potentially a set away from his sixth Wimbledon final. Third set: Djokovic 6-2, 4-6, 5-2 Bautista Agut* (*denotes next server) However a tennis player is always at their most vulnerable just after they\u2019ve broken and the world No 1 is no different. 15-40. Two break-back points for Bautista Agut. The first comes and goes. The second is a more drawn-out affair, neither is willing to budge, neither wants to pull the trigger ... it goes on ... and on ... and on ... I\u2019m not sure how they\u2019re still breathing, I\u2019m not. Djokovic eventually settles matters on the 45th shot! And has the energy to turn to the crowd and put his finger to his ear. Deuce. After the longest rally of the match, Djokovic is grateful for a free point on his serve. His advantage. Bautista Agut rifles his return long and Djokovic roars once more. He maintains his breathing space. Third set: Djokovic* 6-2, 4-6, 4-2 Bautista Agut (*denotes next server) David Beckham is in the Royal Box this afternoon, after all. Perhaps Fergie has gone for a break. Djokovic, with his elastic limbs at full stretch, gets to 15-30 on Bautista Agut\u2019s serve. He\u2019s kicking himself when he lets Bautista Agut recover to 30-all. Djokovic always seems in control of the fifth point, setting it up for a simple put-away at the net. A first break point of the third set. And Djokovic\u2019s first since the first set. Djokovic carves Bautista Agut up with several slices before sticking the knife in with a one-two punch and a defiant smash. He roars in delight. He\u2019s managed to ride out the storm and has the break. Third set: Djokovic 6-2, 4-6, 3-2 Bautista Agut* (*denotes next server) My colleague Jacob Steinberg and I were just wondering whether that ankle Djokovic rolled in the fifth game of the match is causing him problems. Something is awry. As if to illustrate the point, Djokovic then misses a forehand he could make in his sleep. It\u2019s 40-30. Make that deuce. A defiant Djokovic takes the next two points to hold. Third set: *Djokovic 6-2, 4-6, 2-2 Bautista Agut (*denotes next server) Djokovic holds to 30, though the highlight of the game was a brilliant backhand from Bautista Agut, perhaps his best of this contest so far. With the score level at one set all, this is effectively a three-set match now. And we know Bautista Agut\u2019s already won two of those this year against Djokovic. What Djokovic would give for Bautista Agut\u2019s friends to jump out of the box and bundle him on to a plane for that stag do right now. But I\u2019m rambling. Bautista Agut holds to 15, showing no signs of dropping his level from the second set. Third set: *Djokovic 6-2, 4-6, 1-1 Bautista Agut (*denotes next server) Having let out a bit of frustration on the crowd, Djokovic then releases some more with a dismissive hold. He\u2019s soon pushing on Bautista Agut\u2019s serve, but at 30-all Bautista Agut pulls off a forehand winner down the line with laser-like precision. 40-30. Djokovic goes long, before almost taking a chunk of grass out of the court with his racket. He pulls away at the last moment, which is probably wise given Serena Williams\u2019s fine this tournament for damaging the sacred grass. There again what\u2019s a $10,000 fine to a man who\u2019s earned more than $130m in prize money? So Bautista Agut is serving for the set. This is usually the moment when Djokovic laughs in the face of danger and breaks. But he slaps into the net at 15-all. A nervous-looking Bautista Agut fails to land a timid first serve, makes the second, before Djokovic takes the point by wrong-footing his opponent and blocking the ball for a winning volley. 30-all. 40-30, set point, with Bautista Agut allowing himself a little fist pump. That\u2019s probably the first emotion we\u2019ve seen from the Spaniard today. And he\u2019s both celebrating and apologising moments later when his shot clatters into the top of the net and just trickles over! Djokovic, meanwhile, is bizarrely telling the crowd to applaud. We\u2019re all square. Second set: Djokovic 6-2, 4-5 Bautista Agut* (*denotes next server) This is such a crucial game. If Djokovic can hold and find a way to break Bautista Agut and go on to win the set, this will surely be over in three. But if Bautista Agut seizes the second, then we may be here for some time. Djokovic comes through to 30. The crowd, it has to be said, are rather quiet. Perhaps they\u2019re thrown by the way this match has changed. Perhaps they\u2019re not sure who to support. Or perhaps they\u2019re saving themselves for Federer and Nadal. Whatever it is, it won\u2019t help Djokovic feel loved. And all he wants \u2013 well, apart from another grand slam title \u2013 is to be as loved as those two. Second set: *Djokovic 6-2, 3-5 Bautista Agut (*denotes next server) A massive miss from Djokovic on the opening point, that was so far out it probably landed on Wimbledon Common. He quickly puts it out of his mind for 15-all. Djokovic has taken his cap off as he tries to get down to business, but it\u2019s just not happening for him in this second set. An error-strewn game from the Serb and Bautista Agut remains in charge of this set, holding to 15. Second set: Djokovic 6-2, 3-4 Bautista Agut* (*denotes next server) Djokovic appears in control at 40-15. But Bautista Agut scraps to 40-30, and then strikes his way to deuce when the pair trade forehand after forehand after forehand, with Djokovic then hitting beyond the baseline. Djokovic runs to his chair, hoping a change of racket will change his fortunes. It does the trick, but he needs another deuce before advancing. Second set: *Djokovic 6-2, 2-4 Bautista Agut (*denotes next server) Oohs and aaahs and cheers after a drop shot/lob showdown on the second point. Bautista Agut emerges victorious, much to the delight of his stag do friends in his box. They probably thought they\u2019d be catching a flight back to Ibiza at 3pm given the way the first set went. But Bautista Agut is determined to make a match of this and holds superbly to love. Second set: Djokovic 6-2, 2-3 Bautista Agut* (*denotes next server) Bautista backs up the break with the minimum of fuss, one netted shot the only blot in an otherwise perfect game for the Spanish 23rd seed. However there\u2019s a risk his momentum could be checked, when a spectator is taken ill. Both players sit down for a few minutes. But when they\u2019re back under way, Bautista Agut starts exactly where he left off, with a ferocious forehand. 0-15. Which is soon 15-40! Two points for a double break. Well, well. Bautista Agut blazes a backhand well wide. Djokovic drills down an ace. Deuce. The pair are moving each other this way and that way and t\u2019other way on the next point, it\u2019s the longest rally of the match at 23 shots, and Bautista Agut blinks first. Djokovic\u2019s advantage. Djokovic\u2019s game. The world No 1 dug himself out of a hole there but he\u2019ll still have to find his way out of a bigger one if he\u2019s to win this set. Second set: Djokovic 6-2, 1-2 Bautista Agut* (*denotes next server) Distracted by Federer\u2019s sweat, I look up and realise Bautista Agut has not only one but two break points. He had a bit of luck to get there, with Djokovic\u2019s string breaking at 15-30. There\u2019s nothing fortunate about the way Bautista Agut breaks though. He flashes a forehand winner past a stranded Djokovic and the stag do crew are on their feet. Their man has his first break! Second set: Djokovic* 6-2, 1-1 Bautista Agut (*denotes next server) Two straightforward holds get the second set under way. Meanwhile in far a more newsworthy development: proof that Roger Federer does actually sweat. Such is the effort he\u2019ll put in on the practice courts before his meeting with Nadal later. Djokovic looks ready to pounce at 30-all. But instead of going straight for the jugular, he bides his time on the next point, eventually working his way to the net. It puts Bautista Agut off and the Spaniard nets. 40-30, set point. A strong serve, but a Djokovic return on the spin bamboozles Bautista Agut, who fires out! First set: Djokovic 5-2 Bautista Agut* (*denotes next server) Time for some emails. \u201cAlthough it feels like the same-old same-old, this is the first time the Big Three have reached the semis of the same Wimbledon since 2007. The heart wants Federer or Nadal, but the head says Djokovic. As for a Big Three name, I rather like Fedalvic,\u201d writes Greg Phillips. And this from krishnamoorthy: \u201cI wrote this blog in June 2011 after Nadal destroyed Federer yet again. Eight years on, Federer is still playing and Nadal is still playing, and they are competing as fiercely as ever. Only one word for them: respect. And one word for me, having written this blog eight years ago: moron.\u201d A lightning hold from Djokovic, meanwhile, leaves Bautista Agut needing to hold serve to detain the world No 1 in this set for any longer. First set: *Djokovic 4-2 Bautista Agut (*denotes next server) With the sun shining brightly, both players have got their caps on, which makes it slightly difficult for spectators to differentiate between them. Djokovic\u2019s trademark spinning and sliding helps them out on the second point though, however his defensive scrambling isn\u2019t enough to prevail. 30-0. Djokovic comes back at Bautista Agut for 30-all. Bautista Agut produces a big first serve just when he needs it, surely 5-1 would be too big a mountain for him to climb. 40-30. Deuce, Djokovic finishing off an absorbing point with a stop volley. Advantage Baustista Agut. Game BA. First set: Djokovic 4-1 Bautista Agut* (*denotes next server) Gasps from the crowd when Djokovic slips on the grass while attempting to charge towards the net. 15-30. A glimmer for Bautista Agut? No, because Djokovic slams the door shut with a brutal backhand down the line backed up by a colossal cross-court forehand. 30-all. 40-30. Game. First set: *Djokovic 3-1 Bautista Agut (*denotes next server) Bautista Agut\u2019s players\u2019 box is looking rather crowded, with the friends who had flown to Ibiza for his stag do arriving en masse here to watch him in action. But Centre Court must feel like a lonely place for the Spaniard right now, he really needs a game on the board. And that he does, squeezing through from deuce to get off the mark after the longest game of the match so far. Brad Gilbert, though, has already written this set off: First set: Djokovic 3-0 Bautista Agut* (*denotes next server) Djokovic doesn\u2019t have it all his own way, with Bautista Agut getting to 30-all, but yet another failed forehand and it\u2019s game point for the Serb. Bautista Agut\u2019s favoured shot is his forehand so he really needs to get that going if he\u2019s to stand any chance this afternoon. He shows fight to get to deuce, but then chops wide. Advantage Djokovic. Game Djokovic, after a delightful angled half-volley. First set: *Djokovic 2-0 Bautista Agut (*denotes next server) The crowd are appreciating Bautista Agut\u2019s effort early on, as he sprints forward to Djokovic\u2019s drop shot, putting it away with a tightly angled winner. 15-all. But Djokovic is already applying the pressure on the Spaniard\u2019s serve at 15-30, and he gets two break points when Bautista Agut slaps into the net. That\u2019s four forehand errors from the Spaniard already, who may well become known as BA for RSI-preventing purposes if this match is long. No indication yet that that\u2019s going to happen; Djokovic gobbles up the first break point and the defending champion\u2019s already making it clear who\u2019s the boss. First set: Djokovic 1-0 Bautista Agut* (*denotes next server) Bautista Agut wins the first point for 0-15 on Djokovic\u2019s serve. \u201cHe\u2019d like the match to end right there,\u201d parps John Inverdale on the BBC commentary. A longer second point plays out, and the Spaniard eventually makes the error. Expect plenty of long rallies; Bautista Agut loves nothing more than scampering around, getting everything back, much like his now-retired fellow Spaniard Daveeeed Ferrrerrrrrr and much like the opponent he\u2019s facing this afternoon. But can he out-Djokovic Djokovic? He can\u2019t in this opening game, which Djokovic wins to 15 with a forehand winner. Bautista Agut says: \u201cThe difference to previous years is that I\u2019ve put in even more hard work. I have always had a will to progress, to improve my game. My goal has always been to become a more complete player. Not wanting to stop being a better player has brought me here now. \u201c[Djokovic] is very solid from the baseline. He likes to play a lot of rallies. Well, I like to play against opponent like this, to play a match with a lot of rallies. Against Novak, that\u2019s what we do.\u201d Djokovic says: \u201cI\u2019ve been playing [my] best tennis in this tournament in the last two rounds, fourth round and [quarter-final]. The ball all of a sudden looks and seems larger than it actually is. It\u2019s a good feeling, I must say. \u201c[Bautista Agut\u2019s] been definitely playing some very, very high-quality tennis in this tournament. He has won twice against me so far this year. That\u2019s certainly going to give him confidence. \u201cObviously playing on grass, it\u2019s different. [It is the] semi-finals of grand slam, [so I am] going to try to use my experience in being in these kinds of matches, get myself tactically prepared. Hopefully I can execute everything I intend to do.\u201d It may seem as if Bautista Agut is here to make up the numbers today, but he has beaten Djokovic in both of their meetings this year and in three of their past five. So perhaps he\u2019s Superman\u2019s kryptonite. Though those were best of three, this is best of five on the biggest stage of all. And Djokovic has had an aura of invincibility this fortnight. Here they are, Bautista Agut making his way on to Centre Court for the match of his life with his head down, perhaps looking a little nervous, just a few steps ahead of the defending champion and world No 1, who is smiling and appears extremely relaxed. Ho hum. It\u2019s one o\u2019clock. No sign of Djokovic and Bautista Agut yet. Laver\u2019s among the big guns in the Royal Box this afternoon. The names include Sir Alex Ferguson, Sir David Attenborough, Hugh Grant, Bear Grylls, Jude Law, Nick Faldo, Gary Player, Michael Stich and Pat Cash. David Beckham was also on the list originally handed out in the press centre but his name has now mysteriously disappeared. Maybe Fergie came armed with a flying boot. Here are the thoughts of the great man Rod Laver: And some pre-match reminiscing: Some pre-match reading: A few results already: CENTRE COURT - 1pm 1 Novak Djokovic (SRB) [1] 1 vs Roberto Bautista Agut (ESP) [23] 56 2 Rafael Nadal (ESP) [3] 96 vs Roger Federer (SUI) [2] 128 No 1 COURT - 1pm 1 Gabriela Dabrowski (CAN) / Yifan Xu (CHN) [4] 48 vs Barbora Krejcikova (CZE) / Katerina Siniakova (CZE) [2] 64 2 Timea Babos (HUN) / Kristina Mladenovic (FRA) [1] 1 vs Su-Wei Hsieh (TPE) / Barbora Strycova (CZE) [3] 17 3 Bruno Soares (BRA) / Nicole Melichar (USA) [1] or Matwe Middelkoop (NED) / Zhaoxuan Yang (CHN) 12 vs Robert Lindstedt (SWE) / Jelena Ostapenko (LAT) or Franko Skugor (CRO) / Raluca Olaru (ROU) [12] 25 No 3 COURT - 11am 1 Jamie Delgado (GBR) / Jonathan Marray (GBR) vs Xavier Malisse (BEL) / Max Mirnyi (BLR) (RR) NOT BEFORE 12.45 2 Jacco Eltingh (NED) / Paul Haarhuis (NED) vs Greg Rusedski (GBR) / Fabrice Santoro (FRA) (OD) 3 Cara Black (ZIM) / Martina Navratilova (USA) vs Iva Majoli (CRO) / Magdalena Maleeva (BUL) (SL) COURT 12 - 11am 1 Marion Bartoli (FRA) / Daniela Hantuchova (SVK) vs Conchita Martinez (ESP) / Barbara Schett (AUT) (SL) 2 Arthur Fery (GBR) / Toby Samuel (GBR) 18 vs Brandon Nakashima (USA) / Valentin Royer (FRA) 23 (BD) 3 Mary Joe Fernandez (USA) / Ai Sugiyama (JPN) vs Anne Keothavong (GBR) / Arantxa Sanchez Vicario (ESP) (SL) 4 Martin Damm (USA) / Toby Kodat (USA) [3] 9 vs Jacob Fearnley (GBR) / Connor Thomson (GBR) 15 (BD) COURT 18 - 11am 1 Shintaro Mochizuki (JPN) [8] 16 vs Martin Damm (USA) [4] 17 (BS) 2 Carlos Gimeno Valero (ESP) 47 vs Harold Mayot (FRA) [17] 56 (BS) 3 Natsumi Kawaguchi (JPN) / Adrienn Nagy (HUN) [3] or Polina Kudermetova (RUS) / Giulia Morlet (FRA) 11 vs Funa Kozaki (JPN) / Amarissa Kiara Toth (HUN) 13 (GD) 4 Liam Draxl (CAN) / Govind Nanda (USA) [7] 25 vs Shintaro Mochizuki (JPN) / Holger Vitus Nodskov Rune (DEN) [2] 32 (BD) COURT 5 - 11am 1 Emma Navarro (USA) [1] 1 vs Daria Snigur (UKR) 26 (GS) 2 Diane Parry (FRA) [4] 48 vs Alexa Noel (USA) [10] 56 (GS) 3 Kamilla Bartone (LAT) / Oksana Selekhmeteva (RUS) or Robin Montgomery (USA) / Maria Camila Osorio Serrano (COL) 4 vs Holly Fischer (GBR) / Matilda Mutavdzic (GBR) or Chloe Beck (USA) / Emma Navarro (USA) [7] 8 (GD) COURT 8 - 11am 1 Savannah Broadus (USA) / Abigail Forbes (USA) 26 vs Alina Charaeva (RUS) / Anastasia Tikhonova (RUS) [2] 32 (GD) 2 Jonas Forejtek (CZE) / Jiri Lehecka (CZE) [1] 1 vs Cannon Kingsley (USA) / Alexander Zgirovsky (BLR) or Shunsuke Mitsui (JPN) / Keisuke Saitoh (JPN) [6] 8 (BD) 3 Hurricane Tyra Black (USA) / Shavit Kimchi (ISR) [8] or Aubane Droguet (FRA) / Selena Janicijevic (FRA) 19 vs Joanna Garland (TPE) / Sohyun Park (KOR) [4] 24 (GD) COURT 14 - 11am 1 Dylan Alcott (AUS) / Andy Lapthorne (GBR) 1 vs Koji Sugeno (JPN) / David Wagner (USA) 2 2 Diede De Groot (NED) [1] 1 vs Kgothatso Montjane (RSA) 3 3 Stephane Houdet (FRA) / Nicolas Peifer (FRA) [1] 1 vs Alfie Hewett (GBR) / Gordon Reid (GBR) 2 (DM) 4 Sabine Ellerbrock (GER) / Kgothatso Montjane (RSA) 3 vs Marjolein Buis (NED) / Giulia Capocci (ITA) [2] 4 (DW) COURT 15 - 11am 1 Stephane Houdet (FRA) or Nicolas Peifer (FRA) 6 vs Gustavo Fernandez (ARG) [2] 8 COURT 17 - 11am 1 Shingo Kunieda (JPN) [1] 1 vs Stefan Olsson (SWE) 4 2 Aniek Van Koot (NED) 5 vs Yui Kamiji (JPN) [2] 8 3 Gustavo Fernandez (ARG) / Shingo Kunieda (JPN) 3 vs Joachim Gerard (BEL) / Stefan Olsson (SWE) [2] 4 (DM) 4 Diede De Groot (NED) / Aniek Van Koot (NED) [1] 1 vs Yui Kamiji (JPN) / Jordanne Whiley (GBR) 2 (DW) MATCHES TO BE ARRANGED NOT BEFORE 5pm 1 Wesley Koolhof (NED) / Kveta Peschke (CZE) [5] 33 vs Ivan Dodig (CRO) / Latisha Chan (TPE) [8] or Evan Hoyt (GBR) / Eden Silva (GBR) 60 2 Colin Fleming (GBR) / Ross Hutchins (GBR) vs Fernando Gonzalez (CHI) / Sebastien Grosjean (FRA) (RR) The release of Nelson Mandela. The fall of the Berlin Wall. The inauguration of President Obama. Just some of those \u201cwhere were you when \u2026\u201d moments in history. And if any tennis match merits a place on such lists, surely it\u2019s that Wimbledon final of 2008. The match widely seen as the greatest of all time had it all: a five-times defending champion against a fierce rival who he had beaten in the past two Wimbledon finals but had just denied him the French Open title for the third consecutive year; the contrast in styles between the calm and artful Swiss and the punkish and piratical Spaniard, all fist pumps and jumps and whose game plan was to wear his opponent down and drive him to despair; a quite staggering level of play punctuated by two rain breaks that added to the drama; a recovery from two sets to love down and the saving of two championship points to force a decider; and a 9-7 final-set finale in near darkness in which a new champion was crowned after the longest Wimbledon final in history. This wonderful piece from Andy Bull is well worth a read if you want to relive the spectacle. Now here Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer are again, meeting at Wimbledon for the first time in 11 years. The fact they\u2019re still going so strong, aged 33 and 37 respectively, ranked second and third in the world and having shared the past 10 grand slam titles along with Novak Djokovic (Nadal has four, Federer and Djokovic three), is almost as staggering as that final itself. For all the talk of the so-called Next Gen, this great tennis triumvirate just keep going on, and the gap between them and the rest of the field is arguably wider than ever. Which brings us on to the great subplot to this Wimbledon finale: the battle to be the greatest of all time. A third Wimbledon triumph for Nadal, who added the 2010 title to his 2008 crown, would move him only one behind Federer\u2019s tally of 20, which would be the closest he\u2019s ever been to the record holder. Meanwhile victory for Djokovic would put him on 16 and, at the age of 32, with plenty of time to out-GOAT the GOAT. In the context of all of this, spare a thought for the odd man out today, Roberto Bautista Agut, who\u2019s appearing in his first grand slam semi-final. Being a 30-something, he does at least have something in common with Fedalovic \u2013 if SerAndy/Murena is bestowed on Serena Williams and Andy Murray, surely the Big Three deserve a combined name of their own? \u2013 while Bautista Agut will take comfort from the fact he\u2019s beaten Djokovic twice already this year, in Doha and Miami. Defeating a fully focused Djokovic in the best of five sets at a grand slam is an entirely different proposition, however, and the world No 1 was in devastating form in the quarter-finals against David Goffin, dropping only six games. Bautista Agut has had to rearrange his stag do to be here today, but if his opponent is in a similar mood to Wednesday, things could get just as messy for the Spaniard as a week partying in Ibiza. Play begins at: 1pm BST.",

It was Federer\u2019s sixth shootout win over Nadal from seven on Centre Court. \u201cIt came from a good game plan,\u201d Federer said. \u201cI served well on top of it.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was the 40th match of their 15-year rivalry and the first here since 2008, when Nadal won a final that scaled the heights of greatness. This did not match that. How could it? They are 11 years older, with a combined age of 70, and there is a limit to how much even these very special players can stretch their genius.</p> \n<p>As Nadal said of Federer: \u201cHe is always able to do the most difficult things easy. He\u2019s able to move inside the court quicker than anyone. He puts pressure on the opponent all the time because he has the ability to take the ball earlier than anybody else.\u201d</p> \n<p>As for their special relationship, he thinks there is life in it yet. \u201cWe are not done, so ... things continue. Of course we know that every time there are fewer chances to play against each other in these important matches. I am sad to lose because that was another opportunity. But I have to accept it was not my day. And I know chances are not forever. Last year I had chances here [in the semi-final against Djokovic].

      "bodyText": "When Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic step on to Centre Court on Sunday to contest the Wimbledon men\u2019s singles final for the third time in six years two Spaniards back in the Balearics will pause to wonder might have been. Although there was little in the end that Roberto Bautista Agut \u2013 late for his stag party in Ibiza \u2013 could have done to stop the Djokovic train in the first semi-final on Friday, he did take a set off the world No 1, just as his compatriot from Mallorca briefly had Federer in his tight grip. As Nadal said after Federer had won 7-6 (3), 1-6, 3-6, 6-4, \u201cI had my chances. He played little bit better than me. Probably I didn\u2019t play as good as I did in the previous rounds, so he deserves it.\u201d The key at the start was the tie-break. It was Federer\u2019s sixth shootout win over Nadal from seven on Centre Court. \u201cIt came from a good game plan,\u201d Federer said. \u201cI served well on top of it.\u201d It was the 40th match of their 15-year rivalry and the first here since 2008, when Nadal won a final that scaled the heights of greatness. This did not match that. How could it? They are 11 years older, with a combined age of 70, and there is a limit to how much even these very special players can stretch their genius. As Nadal said of Federer: \u201cHe is always able to do the most difficult things easy. He\u2019s able to move inside the court quicker than anyone. He puts pressure on the opponent all the time because he has the ability to take the ball earlier than anybody else.\u201d As for their special relationship, he thinks there is life in it yet. \u201cWe are not done, so ... things continue. Of course we know that every time there are fewer chances to play against each other in these important matches. I am sad to lose because that was another opportunity. But I have to accept it was not my day. And I know chances are not forever. Last year I had chances here [in the semi-final against Djokovic]. I had another one today and I was not able to convert.\u201d Even diminished by age, however, they still are better than the young contenders who fell like leaves from a tree in the first week, and all the others who clung to their dreams in the second. It is fitting Djokovic stood with them in the last four. Between them they have not only won the last 11 majors, but 15 of the last 17 Wimbledon titles and 50 of the last 58 grand slam titles. It is always mind-boggling to comprehend that dominance. On a mild Friday afternoon, with a wisp of wind to soothe nervous brows (and that was just in the paid seats), Federer led them out to thunderous applause, each wearing a white bandana, like a pair of old hippies who might have been otherwise sitting in Hyde Park waiting for the arrival of Bob Dylan and Neil Young. They would make some sweet music of their own soon enough. Federer deserved his win. He out-served the Spaniard, with 14 aces to three, tucked him up on the baseline to stifle his attacking instincts and held him off in a stirring finish when Nadal saved four match points. That was one of two dramatic passages of the semi-final. The first was the inexplicable collapse by Federer in the second set, after he had hung on to win the first in a tie-break.

On Friday Bolsonaro said the appointment would not constitute nepotism. \u201cThat\u2019s for the supreme court to decide. It is not nepotism, I would never do that,\u201d Bolsonaro said That argument has failed to convince many in Brazil. \u201cIf it\u2019s confirmed, the nomination will bring Brazil closer to becoming a banana republic,\u201d wrote Bernardo Mello Franco in his blog for Rio\u2019s O Globo newspaper. Eduardo was the most voted congressional deputy in Brazilian history in last October\u2019s elections, heads the congress\u2019s foreign relations committee and had a front-row seat when his father visited Donald Trump in March. He has ties to the US president\u2019s former strategist Steve Bannon and is South American representative for Bannon\u2019s rightwing populist network, the Movement. \u201cThis is more about a political ideological project,\u201d said Maur\u00edcio Santoro, professor of international relations at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. Eduardo told reporters he would accept if the invitation was made official. \u201cObviously I am not a career diplomat,\u201d he said on Thursday, but he added: \u201cThe nomination or indication of a person so close to the president \u2026 would be well seen by the American side.\u201d The Viriginia-based far-right astrologist and conspiracy theorist Olavo de Carvalho, a guru to the Bolsonaro clan, could be an \u201cadviser\u201d, he said. On Friday Eduardo met Brazil\u2019s foreign minister, Ernesto Ara\u00fajo, and said he had received his support. \u201cI\u2019ve already fried hamburgers in the United States,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the receptive North American treatment for Brazilians.\u201d Ara\u00fajo denied the appointment would constitute nepotism, even though one supreme court judge has already said he believes it is. \u201cIt is not because he is the son of the president of the republic, it is because he has the capacity for political action and ideas that are what we consider to be correct,\u201d Ara\u00fajo said. Luiz Castro Neves, who served as Brazil\u2019s ambassador to China, Japan and Paraguay, said the decision was \u201csurprising\u201d but added that Eduardo\u2019s relationship with the Trump family might be an advantage. \u201cHaving access to the inner circles of Trump and his family \u2026 could make some sense,\u201d Neves said. \u201cHe will certainly be well-advised.\u201d But Eduardo\u2019s diplomatic naivety could also be a disadvantage, said Oliver Stuenkel, a professor of international relations at S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Getulio Vargas Foundation, a business school. \u201cI have spoken to some people who have participated in meetings with him and they were taken aback by how self-abasing he was \u2026 he was basically saying whatever you want, we will give it to you,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Washington you don\u2019t do that.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>I had always naively imagined that parenting would get easier the older the children got. And in many mundane ways it has. I no longer have to worry so much about keeping them alive, about making sure they have done their homework or whether they are happy at university. They are now their own people, making their own decisions and sometimes even telling us what they are. Parenting has moved from practical problems to existential ones. Our daughter, who was over from Minneapolis for the first time in six months to direct a play at the <a href=\"https://www.thelatchmere.co.uk/theatre503/\">Latchmere theatre</a> in London, has gone back home. Her home. I find that hard to imagine because part of me still thinks of our home as her home. But it isn\u2019t. She has moved on, even if I haven\u2019t. My wife and I are no longer such key figures in her life. Not that she doesn\u2019t love us, but we are no longer as important as we once were. Which is as it should be. If she was still living with us at 27, we\u2019d all be driving one another mad. And for the most part, I have got used to the 4,000-mile distance between us, but having had her back for three weeks I feel bereft once more \u2013 despite the towels no longer being left on the floor. This is my new reality of getting older. A series of ever more frequent losses, each one diminishing me a little more. Until the rest is silence.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>The spin rooms for televised political debates are usually dripping with sweat and adrenaline, as MPs and supporters of the rival participants do their best to push themselves centre stage of lobby reporters to persuade everyone that their candidate has landed all the killer lines. Tonight\u2019s debate at the ITV studios in Salford was rather different. A large number of Tory MPs had been expected, but at the last minute they were forced to remain in Westminster as the Conservative whips did not trust Labour to honour their pairing commitments in the crucial amendment put forward to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/07/30-plus-tory-rebels-willing-to-defy-whip-and-block-no-deal-brexit\">Northern Ireland bill by Dominic Grieve</a> that would make it difficult for Boris Johnson to prorogue parliament. Not that it did them much good as the government still contrived to lose by one vote as one MP got caught short in the toilet. So up in Salford, the spinner-in-chief for Team Boris was Jason McCartney, a former Tory MP who lost his seat at the 2017 election. Understandably, McCartney had little idea of why Boris was so marvellous because no one had bothered to tell him. Team Hunt was led by another former Tory MP, Rob Wilson. Not even Wilson seemed to know who Wilson was. This meant that most of the spinning was journalists asking other journalists who they thought had done well, which led to a much more agreeable and better informed level of analysis. The general consensus was that my dog would make a better prime minister than Boris or Jeremy.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/28/apollo-11-review-moon-landing-documentary-nasa-neil-armstrong-buzz-aldrin\">Apollo 11 review \u2013 stunning return to an incredible journey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Normally the TV schedules are rather thin at this time of the year as the broadcasters save up their best shows for the winter months.

My plan not to watch England matches \u2013 yet again the cricket was only on in the background with the sound turned down \u2013 is paying dividends. All I need to do to ensure our first World Cup victory is to make sure I miss large chunks of Sunday\u2019s final. It will be a sacrifice, but my sense of public service demands no less. It will also be an act of atonement. I was at the last World Cup final in which England took part 27 years ago in Melbourne and was unashamedly cheering on Pakistan; I had been following the team throughout the tournament as I was writing a book about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/the-nightwatchman/2015/mar/09/cricket-world-cup-final-1992-sweater-wasim-akram-pakistan-england\">Wasim Akram</a> and Waqar Younis and had become close to many of the players.

But he insisted that his remarks had been misrepresented to Darroch.</p> \n<p>In a Tory leadership hustings that took place at about the same time as the prerecorded interview was being broadcast, Johnson admitted he should have handled the situation differently, as he was heckled by an audience member who demanded that he \u201canswer the bloody question\u201d.</p> \n<p>Johnson had declined repeated opportunities during a televised debate on Tuesday to explicitly back Darroch, an act he told the BBC had been a \u201cfactor\u201d in the envoy\u2019s decision to resign.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson belatedly admitted to failures in his handling of the leaked cables issue that led to the resignation of a British diplomat as he came under intense political pressure on Friday. In a tense interview on the BBC, the would-be prime minister acknowledged that his refusal to explicitly back Sir Kim Darroch, the UK\u2019s outgoing ambassador to Washington, amid a diplomatic row had been a factor in the envoy\u2019s decision to step down. But he insisted that his remarks had been misrepresented to Darroch. In a Tory leadership hustings that took place at about the same time as the prerecorded interview was being broadcast, Johnson admitted he should have handled the situation differently, as he was heckled by an audience member who demanded that he \u201canswer the bloody question\u201d. Johnson had declined repeated opportunities during a televised debate on Tuesday to explicitly back Darroch, an act he told the BBC had been a \u201cfactor\u201d in the envoy\u2019s decision to resign. He later told the hustings audience, however: \u201cI don\u2019t think that anything I said was actually decisive in Kim\u2019s decision to resign. Had I my time again, to answer your question directly, yes \u2013 I probably should have been more emphatic that Kim personally had my full support.\u201d Even as he acknowledged his impact, Johnson robustly defended his role. He told the BBC his remarks in the hustings had only been \u201crelayed\u201d to the ambassador and that they had been \u201cmisrepresented\u201d. Darroch, he claimed, had not seen the debate himself and, after hearing the second-hand report of the remarks, decided to resign from one of the UK\u2019s most prestigious foreign postings without watching the broadcast. Darroch quit his post on Wednesday, after Donald Trump publicly expressed his fury about a series of highly critical reports that had been leaked to the Mail on Sunday. Johnson, challenged repeatedly about the issue in the interview with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil on Friday, denied that he failed to support Darroch in Tuesday\u2019s ill-tempered ITV leadership debate. \u201cI stood up completely for the principle that civil servants should be allowed to say what they want for their political masters without fear or favour,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe real culprits are the people who leaked that material.\u201d He said: \u201cI spoke to him [Darroch] the next day and said how sorry I was that he had resigned, and he said he had not watched it,\u201d Johnson said. But he added: \u201cWhat he said was that somebody had relayed to him what I had said. He said that what somebody had relayed to him had certainly been a factor in his resignation.

The department\u2019s permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, told MPs he believed the incident was unprecedented. In his own interview with Neil, Hunt said he \u201cexpects\u201d Brexit to be completed by Christmas. Throughout the campaign, Hunt has carefully avoided echoing Johnson\u2019s pledge to take Britain out of the EU by the 31 October deadline \u201ccome what may\u201d \u2013 though he claims his background as an entrepreneur will help him to strike a new compromise with the EU27.

His remakes of The Hills Have Eyes and Piranha were mostly effective, but Mirrors and Horns less so, and good luck finding anyone who\u2019s even heard of his last film, the barely released Canadian thriller The 9th Life of Louis Drax. While Crawl is hardly a rousing, career-saving return to form, it\u2019s a solid, crowd-pleasing reminder that he knows his genre, an 87-minute exercise in pushing and then securing audience members to the very edge of their seats. The lean running time means he\u2019s quite often successful, and there\u2019s an awareness of just how much mileage he can wring from the film\u2019s high-concept premise.</p> <p>The script, from brothers Michael and Shawn Rasmussen, continues to find novel ways to extend the tension through to the relentless final act and right up to the frantic finale. The father-daughter duo are well and truly put through the wringer: bitten, bloodied and broken at every step (the film\u2019s bone violence is particularly, horribly efficient) and Aja choreographs the mayhem with a precise eye and a canny grasp of sound design. The majority of the chaos unfolds in the confines of a dank crawlspace but unlike so many horror films, the murkiness of the setting doesn\u2019t prevent us from following the action and Aja is keen to show off his vicious predators in all their leathery splendour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e01d264579d8375751fcf48dc0fbb6c64338db8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e01d264579d8375751fcf48dc0fbb6c64338db8a/0_0_2208_1474/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crawl: direct, nasty, entirely unpretentious.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crawl: direct, nasty, entirely unpretentious.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergej Radovi\u0107/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The film only crumbles when we\u2019re forced into family soap as \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 the estranged pair reminisce over the past while trying to rebuild for the future. As soon as Pepper utters the soul-crushing line \u201cYou remember when you were little\u201d, you\u2019d be wise to take a bathroom break as the film is far more skilled at making you jump than it is at making you care. Scodelario, a British actor who broke out in Skins but has struggled ever since, is similarly one-sided, selling us on her ability as a physical performer without ever truly convincing us of her competence as an emotional actor.</p> <p>But Crawl mostly chomps off exactly the right amount to chew. It\u2019s a direct, nasty, entirely unpretentious B-movie and while this remains faint, faint, <em>faint</em> praise given the state of the genre, it\u2019s one of the year\u2019s sturdiest horror films. I wouldn\u2019t exactly urge you to run rather then crawl to see it, but a brisk walk should do.</p> <ul> <li><p>Crawl is out now in the US and in the UK on 23 August</p></li> </ul>",

After Aja broke out with his ferocious 2003 slasher High Tension, a film that kicked off a string of hardcore French horrors, he\u2019s had a patchy time in Hollywood. His remakes of The Hills Have Eyes and Piranha were mostly effective, but Mirrors and Horns less so, and good luck finding anyone who\u2019s even heard of his last film, the barely released Canadian thriller The 9th Life of Louis Drax. While Crawl is hardly a rousing, career-saving return to form, it\u2019s a solid, crowd-pleasing reminder that he knows his genre, an 87-minute exercise in pushing and then securing audience members to the very edge of their seats. The lean running time means he\u2019s quite often successful, and there\u2019s an awareness of just how much mileage he can wring from the film\u2019s high-concept premise. The script, from brothers Michael and Shawn Rasmussen, continues to find novel ways to extend the tension through to the relentless final act and right up to the frantic finale. The father-daughter duo are well and truly put through the wringer: bitten, bloodied and broken at every step (the film\u2019s bone violence is particularly, horribly efficient) and Aja choreographs the mayhem with a precise eye and a canny grasp of sound design. The majority of the chaos unfolds in the confines of a dank crawlspace but unlike so many horror films, the murkiness of the setting doesn\u2019t prevent us from following the action and Aja is keen to show off his vicious predators in all their leathery splendour. The film only crumbles when we\u2019re forced into family soap as \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 the estranged pair reminisce over the past while trying to rebuild for the future. As soon as Pepper utters the soul-crushing line \u201cYou remember when you were little\u201d, you\u2019d be wise to take a bathroom break as the film is far more skilled at making you jump than it is at making you care. Scodelario, a British actor who broke out in Skins but has struggled ever since, is similarly one-sided, selling us on her ability as a physical performer without ever truly convincing us of her competence as an emotional actor. But Crawl mostly chomps off exactly the right amount to chew. It\u2019s a direct, nasty, entirely unpretentious B-movie and while this remains faint, faint, faint praise given the state of the genre, it\u2019s one of the year\u2019s sturdiest horror films. I wouldn\u2019t exactly urge you to run rather then crawl to see it, but a brisk walk should do. Crawl is out now in the US and in the UK on 23 August",

Kane Williamson is a wonderful cricketer in a very quiet way. In this World Cup, on two-paced pitches, he has been supernaturally consistent. The only way to stop him making 40 is by a fluke: he had cruised to 27 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/03/england-new-zealand-match-report\" title=\"\">against England</a> when he was run out by the flick of a fast bowler\u2019s fingertips.</p> <p>Williamson specialises in doing just enough. \u201cHe\u2019s calculating,\u201d his coach from Tauranga Boys\u2019 College, Josh Syms, once told the New Zealand Herald. \u201cHe boils things down to nuts and bolts. He\u2019ll take the emotion out of it and ask: \u2018If I do this, what will be the outcome?\u2019\u201d Or, as a parody of the celebrated Barack Obama slogan put it, Yes he Kane. He finished off a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/19/new-zealand-south-africa-cricket-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">cliffhanger against South Africa</a> by hitting a six to reach his century, followed by a four to seal the match. He set up a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/22/new-zealand-west-indies--carlos-brathwaite-cricket-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">cliffhanger against West Indies</a> by making an ODI career-best of 148, which, thanks to Guptill\u2019s travails, had begun with Williamson facing the second ball of the day. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/10/india-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">the semi-final</a> against India, he held his team together with 67. And then, when the chips were down, he calmly took two catches off skiers \u2013 the kind of chance that stays in the air long enough to encourage the fielder to have an existential crisis. Williamson did not just hold the catches, he held his nerve, which is half the job at the very top of sport.</p> <p>Of today\u2019s four great middle-order batsmen, Williamson is the only one to carry his excellence into captaincy. Kohli, for all his intensity, is often over-reactive, placing a fielder where the ball has just gone. Joe Root, likeable as he is, shies away from his destiny as a Test No 3 and makes runs more consistently in one-day games, when he is not the boss.</p> <p>Steve Smith allowed the business with the sandpaper to happen on his watch and lost the Australia captaincy as a result. On Thursday, skilfully though he batted, it was striking that Smith kept showing his annoyance with his teammates, playing the prima donna rather than the leader.</p> <p>Williamson bears a heavier burden than any of them, as a captain who is also a talisman. He does not have a Rohit Sharma scoring hundreds so he does not have to. In this World Cup, Williamson has made 30% of New Zealand\u2019s runs with the bat. A slight figure, only 5ft 9in, he carries a nation on his shoulders. Graham Gooch, taking on New Zealand in Richard Hadlee\u2019s day, famously said it was like facing the World XI at one end and Ilford 2nds at the other. You could say the same about bowling to the Kiwis of 2019. Their run rate throughout the tournament is 4.99 an over, lower than anyone\u2019s, bar Afghanistan. They still have not reached 300 in an innings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>And yet Williamson keeps on doing enough. In the composite team of this tournament, he is surely the captain. He has forged a team in his own image, despite having a hard act to follow in Brendon McCullum, the man who dared to introduce New Zealand to excitement. Williamson, who had been head boy at Tauranga, was in danger of being the goody-goody taking over from a pirate but he did not let that bother him. Rather than play McCullum-ball, he likes his team to be pragmatic. At Lord\u2019s, the true heir to McCullum will be Eoin Morgan.</p> <p>A natural-born Test cricketer, playing the ball late, Williamson has become good enough at Twenty20 to captain Sunrisers Hyderabad. And he may be a nice guy but he is steely as a nail. Something else his school coach said lingers in the air. \u201cHe had a thirst to be phenomenal but not at anyone else\u2019s expense.\u201d Except, of course, his opponents\u2019.</p>",

The half is Lockie Ferguson, the up-and-coming fast bowler who appears to have been plucked from a school production of Journey\u2019s End. Six weeks ago you would have added Martin Guptill, then New Zealand\u2019s designated rocket-launcher, but he is now so short of runs he has become a specialist fielder. The final star has been New Zealand\u2019s shining light for five years. Kane Williamson is a wonderful cricketer in a very quiet way. In this World Cup, on two-paced pitches, he has been supernaturally consistent. The only way to stop him making 40 is by a fluke: he had cruised to 27 against England when he was run out by the flick of a fast bowler\u2019s fingertips. Williamson specialises in doing just enough. \u201cHe\u2019s calculating,\u201d his coach from Tauranga Boys\u2019 College, Josh Syms, once told the New Zealand Herald. \u201cHe boils things down to nuts and bolts. He\u2019ll take the emotion out of it and ask: \u2018If I do this, what will be the outcome?\u2019\u201d Or, as a parody of the celebrated Barack Obama slogan put it, Yes he Kane. He finished off a cliffhanger against South Africa by hitting a six to reach his century, followed by a four to seal the match. He set up a cliffhanger against West Indies by making an ODI career-best of 148, which, thanks to Guptill\u2019s travails, had begun with Williamson facing the second ball of the day. In the semi-final against India, he held his team together with 67. And then, when the chips were down, he calmly took two catches off skiers \u2013 the kind of chance that stays in the air long enough to encourage the fielder to have an existential crisis. Williamson did not just hold the catches, he held his nerve, which is half the job at the very top of sport. Of today\u2019s four great middle-order batsmen, Williamson is the only one to carry his excellence into captaincy. Kohli, for all his intensity, is often over-reactive, placing a fielder where the ball has just gone. Joe Root, likeable as he is, shies away from his destiny as a Test No 3 and makes runs more consistently in one-day games, when he is not the boss. Steve Smith allowed the business with the sandpaper to happen on his watch and lost the Australia captaincy as a result. On Thursday, skilfully though he batted, it was striking that Smith kept showing his annoyance with his teammates, playing the prima donna rather than the leader. Williamson bears a heavier burden than any of them, as a captain who is also a talisman. He does not have a Rohit Sharma scoring hundreds so he does not have to. In this World Cup, Williamson has made 30% of New Zealand\u2019s runs with the bat. A slight figure, only 5ft 9in, he carries a nation on his shoulders. Graham Gooch, taking on New Zealand in Richard Hadlee\u2019s day, famously said it was like facing the World XI at one end and Ilford 2nds at the other. You could say the same about bowling to the Kiwis of 2019. Their run rate throughout the tournament is 4.99 an over, lower than anyone\u2019s, bar Afghanistan. They still have not reached 300 in an innings. And yet Williamson keeps on doing enough. In the composite team of this tournament, he is surely the captain. He has forged a team in his own image, despite having a hard act to follow in Brendon McCullum, the man who dared to introduce New Zealand to excitement. Williamson, who had been head boy at Tauranga, was in danger of being the goody-goody taking over from a pirate but he did not let that bother him. Rather than play McCullum-ball, he likes his team to be pragmatic. At Lord\u2019s, the true heir to McCullum will be Eoin Morgan. A natural-born Test cricketer, playing the ball late, Williamson has become good enough at Twenty20 to captain Sunrisers Hyderabad. And he may be a nice guy but he is steely as a nail. Something else his school coach said lingers in the air. \u201cHe had a thirst to be phenomenal but not at anyone else\u2019s expense.\u201d Except, of course, his opponents\u2019.",

Meanwhile Iran has breached the JCPOA by increasing its uranium enrichment over the agreed threshold, albeit modestly. This, like earlier attacks on tankers attributed to Iran (despite its denials) and the shooting down of a US drone, are essentially symbolic actions. A far more significant step would be to halt International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring and supervision. Iran believes it must up the ante if it is to gain any kind of relief from the crippling sanctions regime now imposed upon it, and though it knows the US could start a war, hopes the fear of not finishing it will continue to deter Mr Trump. The risk is that the president may be goaded into a war by those around him, particularly if things go wrong on the ground \u2013 and that Britain will be dragged in by a White House-appeasing prime minister. Meanwhile the slow slog of diplomacy continues, with European foreign ministers due to meet again on Monday. The EU says that more members, and non-member states too, are buying into the Instex barter-style system created to enable trade. But it still needs proper funding. Ministers must also throw their full weight behind the French-led mission to calm tensions and call out US actions as unequivocally as they have Iran\u2019s. Hopes of halting the escalation may be faint, but the alternative should be unthinkable.",

Youness Bentahar, from Bromley in Kent, was wrestled to the ground after he became involved in an argument with police officers on Tuesday in Poplar, east London. He had refused to move his car, which displays a blue badge, from a single yellow line.

Disruption could also occur across other London airports in separate disputes over pay and conditions, while British Airways pilots have been balloted for a strike. Unite said that over 4,000 employees including security guards, engineers and passenger service staff were set to walk out for six days, including two of the summer\u2019s busiest weekends, in a move that could potentially shut down the airport. Heathrow said it would implement contingency plans to ensure the airport remained open and that disruption for passengers was minimised.

This week British Airways and Ryanair warned that as well as possible airport worker strikes, holiday flights could again be disrupted by air traffic bottlenecks, staff shortages and controller strikes.

Check-in staff at London Stansted serving easyJet \u2013 which accounts for less than 10% of flights from the airport \u2013 will also strike this summer for 17 days in a dispute over pay and conditions with employer Stobart Aviation.

The leave campaign won in 2016 by suggesting the noble British people had been cheated of their democratic birthright by the evil bureaucrats of Brussels. Now the Brexit party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/19/nigel-farage-brexit-party-on-the-road-populism\" title=\"\">offers textbook populism</a>, railing against an establishment bent on thwarting the \u201cwill of the people\u201d.</p> <p>But populism in Britain does not begin and end with Nigel Farage.

      "bodyText": "In Britain we sometimes imagine that populism lurks in our future or over there, in Donald Trump\u2019s America or Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary. Even those who are alarmed by the prospect of populist politics and all it entails take comfort that we\u2019re not there yet, that it\u2019s still some time, or distance, away. But what if that\u2019s wrong? What if it\u2019s already here? If populism is a politics that pits the virtuous mass of ordinary people against a wicked, corrupt elite, then Britain was an early adopter. The leave campaign won in 2016 by suggesting the noble British people had been cheated of their democratic birthright by the evil bureaucrats of Brussels. Now the Brexit party offers textbook populism, railing against an establishment bent on thwarting the \u201cwill of the people\u201d. But populism in Britain does not begin and end with Nigel Farage. Boris Johnson is remoulding himself into a populist figure too, not least to take on Farage. His refusal to rule out the suspension of parliament to drive through a no-deal Brexit is a move that would make even Orb\u00e1n blush. Like all populists, the Hungarian leader would happily argue that only the will of the people matters and that all other institutions that safeguard liberal democracy \u2013 the rule of law, an independent judiciary and civil service, a free press \u2013 are obstacles to be cast aside to ensure that will is done. He calls it \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d. While Orb\u00e1n has sought to emasculate the courts and the press, even he has not yet dared to bypass parliament. Johnson, however, refuses to rule out that very move, just as he trashed the principle of a non-partisan, professional civil service when he failed to defend Britain\u2019s ambassador to Washington, effectively firing Kim Darroch for the crime of giving expert advice. So much for Britain\u2019s main party of the right. What of the main party of the left?

However, many of his supporters in the party backed a campaign saying he had been vilified and badly treated.

Seumas Milne, one of Corbyn\u2019s closest aides, told officials the party was 'muddling up political disputes with racism' and must review processes.

      "bodyText": "The Equality and Human Rights Commission has begun contacting up to 100 Labour figures it wants to hear from as part of its investigation into antisemitism, warning they may be committing a criminal offence if they withhold information. Formal letters are being sent to the whistleblowers who appeared in Wednesday\u2019s Panorama documentary, as well as some serving Labour staffers, and members of the party\u2019s national executive committee (NEC), the Guardian understands. Recipients are warned that failing to comply with requests for information could mean they have committed a criminal offence. The EHRC launched its inquiry in May, saying at the time it would seek to \u201cdetermine whether the Labour party has unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish\u201d. It is only the second time the watchdog has launched a full statutory inquiry using the powers it was granted in the Equality Act of 2006 \u2013 the first being an investigation into the Metropolitan police. Labour has insisted throughout that it will cooperate with the EHRC. The body does not have the power to fine individuals, but can make legally binding recommendations for changes in policy. Its statutory powers allow it to demand that evidence, including electronic communications and documents, be handed over. In giving evidence, former staffers served notice by the EHRC would no longer be bound by the non-disclosure agreements they signed when they left, while serving Labour employees would be protected under whistleblowing laws. The latest development in the investigation, which could take up to a year to complete, came as the war of words over the party\u2019s handling of antisemitism complaints continued to escalate. Labour\u2019s general secretary, Jennie Formby, hit back against Corbyn\u2019s deputy, Tom Watson, accusing him of \u201ctraducing\u201d her while she is undergoing treatment for breast cancer. Watson wrote to Formby after the Panorama documentary, asking her to share with him the party\u2019s submission to the EHRC investigation. He also asked for reassurances that all relevant data would be retained \u2013 hinting he feared evidence could be destroyed. Separately, he complained publicly that Labour had \u201csmeared\u201d the staffers who featured in the documentary. Before Panorama aired, a Labour spokesman claimed the participants were \u201cdisaffected\u201d and had \u201caxes to grind\u201d. Replying to Watson on Thursday evening, Formby said she was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d he had criticised the party\u2019s response on antisemitism and accused him of abusing his position. \u201cThe party has at all levels consistently shown that it recognises the vital importance of combating antisemitism, yet you consistently abuse your considerable platform to denigrate any progress that has been made and any individual that is involved in that,\u201d she said. \u201cTraducing my reputation and publicly attacking me when you know I am undergoing chemotherapy and am unable to respond in the media is another example of the inappropriate way in which you choose to discuss this issue.\u201d She also defended Labour\u2019s treatment of the individuals featured in the documentary, some of whom said they had suffered mental health problems as a result of the issue. Formby said she was \u201cvery concerned to hear for the first time the distress suggested by some of our former staff members\u201d, adding, \u201cto be clear we were not made aware of them at the time\u201d. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, a key ally of Corbyn, threw his weight behind Formby, tweeting it \u201cgoes beyond my understanding\u201d that the letter was sent \u201cwhen he knows she\u2019s undergoing chemotherapy\u201d. He wrote: \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why the deputy leader of the Labour party uses the media to demand information from Labour\u2019s general secretary @JennieGenSec, which has already been offered to him.\u201d Claudia Webbe, who sits on Labour\u2019s ruling national executive committee, called for Watson to consider his position \u2013 a demand that was retweeted by allies of Corbyn, including the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott. The fallout from the programme, based on interviews and leaked emails, continues to cause serious ructions in the party. Corbyn\u2019s team believe Watson is seeking to use the issue as a way of undermining the leadership, just as divisions on Brexit policy had been papered over after the shadow cabinet agreed to support remain in a future referendum. Watson said a document produced for the EHRC\u2019s investigation should be made public because \u201conly sunlight can disinfect Labour of antisemitism now\u201d, but Formby insisted she had offered to meet him and provide any information he demanded. Formby took over last year as general secretary of the party, with the support of the leadership, and was tasked with speeding up the response to complaints of antisemitism. During her treatment for cancer, Formby\u2019s duties are covered by the party\u2019s executive directors, who include Corbyn\u2019s close aide Seumas Milne and chief of staff Karie Murphy. Formby attended the shadow cabinet meeting earlier this week at which the new \u201csettled position\u201d on Brexit was agreed.",

He said the requirement to fill in a special form that only assigns the right to vote for one year was discriminatory and did not exist in other EU member states. \u201cWell over half of EU nationals who are registered to vote in the UK are systematically disenfranchised in this way,\u201d he added.

The letter accuses the government of four breaches of law including discrimination. In the UK, EU citizens were required to fill in a UC1 form which remained valid for only 12 months. No such requirement is made in EU law and other member states do not interpret the law in this way, underlining the legal case that the hurdle is exclusively a British invention.

We are already on board. Since Pope Francis\u2019s letter to the world, Laudato Si\u2019, Catholics have been reflecting on how we can work for climate justice. Thousands of our churches now run on renewable energy, while thousands of parishioners have taken to the streets to demand political action.</p> <p>Last month, for instance, nearly 1,500 Cafod supporters joined people from other faith communities as part of a climate and environment lobby of parliament. Some 12,000 people of all faiths and none travelled from across the country to speak to more than 350 MPs about the political and economic decisions needed if the UK is to reach net-zero emissions. And faith leaders undertook a Walk of Witness down Whitehall to show our commitment to protecting creation and our poorest sisters and brothers \u2013 those who will pay the greatest price if we fail to urgently cut emissions.</p> <p>So, people in faith communities are taking action.

      "bodyText": "Michael Barrett (Letters, 9 July) calls upon the religions to join with ecologists to take action on climate change as it offers \u201ca compelling cause\u201d to tackle declining memberships. We are already on board. Since Pope Francis\u2019s letter to the world, Laudato Si\u2019, Catholics have been reflecting on how we can work for climate justice. Thousands of our churches now run on renewable energy, while thousands of parishioners have taken to the streets to demand political action. Last month, for instance, nearly 1,500 Cafod supporters joined people from other faith communities as part of a climate and environment lobby of parliament. Some 12,000 people of all faiths and none travelled from across the country to speak to more than 350 MPs about the political and economic decisions needed if the UK is to reach net-zero emissions. And faith leaders undertook a Walk of Witness down Whitehall to show our commitment to protecting creation and our poorest sisters and brothers \u2013 those who will pay the greatest price if we fail to urgently cut emissions. So, people in faith communities are taking action. But not because it\u2019s a membership drive. It\u2019s because we hear the cry of the Earth and of the poor, who experience the injustice of climate change right now through lost lives and livelihoods. We care for our common home because it\u2019s our moral duty to act. Christine Allen Director, Catholic Agency for Overseas Development \u2022 The government may be responding to the climate crisis like a \u201cDad\u2019s Army\u201d (Report, 10 July) but more than 120 local authorities led by all of the main political parties have declared that this really is a climate emergency and that they will go into battle with or without government support. Between us we have multibillion-pound budgets, cross party determination, increasing public support and some legislative powers. We are already building up some impressive examples of what can be done and are pooling our experience and expertise. But we can\u2019t win the campaign our own: we need the government to send reinforcements, bringing legislation and resources to support renewable energy, zero-carbon building, public transport, carbon sequestration, action on biodiversity and much more. Cllr Kevin Frea Co-chair, UK Climate Emergency Network \u2022 Your coverage of the Committee on Climate Change\u2019s report, with its stinging criticism of government failure to tackle climate change, does not sufficiently identify how the aviation industry needs to be held to immediate account. Given that parliament and many city councils and local authorities have declared a climate emergency, aviation should no longer be protected from scrutiny. The suggested action by the CCC is for a plan to be published limiting the increase in air traffic to 60%. This target is too generous, and is unattainable if all airports are allowed to expand as currently planned. It certainly does not enable the government to achieve net carbon neutrality. We call for no airport expansion, and for a process to begin to roll back existing flights. This could begin with the introduction of a frequent-flyer levy, banning short-haul flights, and forcing airlines to fly planes full (ie to share passengers and cancel low-density flights). A citizens\u2019 assembly should sort the details of how to reduce air travel. Mark Smalley XR Bristol, John Adams Professor emeritus and chair of Stop Bristol Airport Expansion, Hilary Burn Chair, Parish Councils Airport Association, Stephen Clarke Green councillor, Bristol city council, Tanguy Tomes Environmental consultant, Tarisha Clarke Airport Action, Dr Steve Melia Senior lecturer in transport policy, University of the West of England \u2022 That the government\u2019s climate advisers, the committee on climate change, reveal little preparation has taken place to deal with extreme weather isn\u2019t, in itself, a shock. What is shocking is that the government, distracted by the not-so-smooth process of grappling with Brexit, still doesn\u2019t appear to get it. By failing to see the problems with fracking despite all of the evidence, green-lighting climate-damaging infrastructure like more new roads, and blithely approving another runway at Heathrow, it\u2019s clear the government has been resisting the hard and immediate policy work needed to kickstart a massive programme of change. This change will be for the unalloyed good of all of us, as well as make for a healthier environment \u2013 even if it possibly dents some multinationals\u2019 balance sheets. Mike Childs Head of science, Friends of the Earth \u2022 In Weatherwatch (9 July), Paul Brown highlighted the risks to nuclear power stations with climate change. As he pointed out, nuclear reactors are not a reliable source of base load power. The increasing number of heatwaves threatens their supply of cooling water, particularly in France, which exports electricity.

      "body": "<p>The International Trade Union Confederation\u2019s latest report shows the shocking extent of violence against trade unionists in Colombia. Thirty-four trade unionists were murdered in 2018 \u2013 almost two-thirds of worldwide cases. This is more than double the previous year\u2019s tally of 15 murders, which even then made Colombia the most dangerous country for labour organising.</p> <p>The violence has continued into 2019, with 10 members of the Fensuagro agricultural union killed this year, and 30 since late 2016. Thirteen teachers were also killed in 2018 amid nationwide strike action over conditions and pay.</p> <p>In 2018, Colombia was invited to join the OECD, formed of the world\u2019s richest countries, even though it clearly violates established standards of labour rights and conditions.</p> <p>Anti-union violence is a major contributor to Colombia\u2019s abysmal labour rights record. Protecting trade unionists therefore will not only save lives but improve conditions for millions of working people.</p> <p>Violence against civil society has continued despite the 2016 peace agreement between the state and the Farc to end decades of armed conflict. Colombia faces a human rights catastrophe, with more than 500 social activists and 135 Farc former guerrillas killed since the deal was signed. The UN says the agreement is vital for tackling violence, and reminded the government of its obligations to the peace process.</p> <p>The international community must demand that Colombia guarantee security for trade unionists and activists.

      "bodyText": "The International Trade Union Confederation\u2019s latest report shows the shocking extent of violence against trade unionists in Colombia. Thirty-four trade unionists were murdered in 2018 \u2013 almost two-thirds of worldwide cases. This is more than double the previous year\u2019s tally of 15 murders, which even then made Colombia the most dangerous country for labour organising. The violence has continued into 2019, with 10 members of the Fensuagro agricultural union killed this year, and 30 since late 2016. Thirteen teachers were also killed in 2018 amid nationwide strike action over conditions and pay. In 2018, Colombia was invited to join the OECD, formed of the world\u2019s richest countries, even though it clearly violates established standards of labour rights and conditions. Anti-union violence is a major contributor to Colombia\u2019s abysmal labour rights record. Protecting trade unionists therefore will not only save lives but improve conditions for millions of working people. Violence against civil society has continued despite the 2016 peace agreement between the state and the Farc to end decades of armed conflict. Colombia faces a human rights catastrophe, with more than 500 social activists and 135 Farc former guerrillas killed since the deal was signed. The UN says the agreement is vital for tackling violence, and reminded the government of its obligations to the peace process. The international community must demand that Colombia guarantee security for trade unionists and activists. We also urge Colombia\u2019s government to fully implement the peace agreement.

Or rather, to do him justice, he\u2019s gone full-tilt Gordon Ramsay in the news this week.</p> <p>In January, the Michelin Guide demoted his Haute-Savoie restaurant, La Maison des Bois in Manigod. He became, as he put it, the only chef in history to get a third star one year \u2013 and lose it the very next. And the six months since have been a living hell.

He hasn\u2019t been able to sleep or feed himself. He has cried as if his parents had passed away all over again. He has envisaged the very worst.</p> <p>The worst, of course, to his mind, had already happened. The Michelin, he said, would never be able to atone for this terrible injury. When he travelled to Paris to ask Michelin for an explanation, he says the only reasons he got for this destarring were that he\u2019d used a piece of cheddar in one of his dishes and that his scallops were a bit mealy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/11/le-maison-des-bois-chef-marc-veyrat-demands-removal-michelin-guide\">'They said we used cheddar!': chef demands removal from Michelin Guide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is where the souffl\u00e9 deflates. Mealy? You can feel him fuming. \u201cIt is impossible that my scallops be mealy. I cook them in the shell of a passion fruit,\u201d he told Le Point. And that cheddar? That was actually a highly technical bit of culinary nous, using beaufort, a firm raw-cow\u2019s-milk Alpine cheese. \u201cHow can anyone with so much power be so incompetent?\u201d he wanted to know.</p> <p>It\u2019s a rant that neatly brings to mind Kevin McCallister\u2019s sister in Home Alone saying, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-4-q3AiTcw\" title=\"\">\u201cYou\u2019re what the French call <em>les incomp\u00e9tents</em>\u201d</a>, when the kid doesn\u2019t know how to pack a suitcase. And just as that scene was all about tantrums and bullies, of course that is all this is about, too. Not food. Power. The power of the <em>toque blanche</em>, that puffy white chef\u2019s hat that signals quasi-cartoon-like authority in the militarily minded ranks of the world\u2019s professional kitchens, one that will not stand to be disputed. And the power of the omniscient, omnipresent Michelin inspectors, arriving unannounced and in disguise, and doing as they please with your worldwide reputation.</p> <p>Veyrat has decided that if he can\u2019t have three stars, he doesn\u2019t want any. \u201cNo one takes Marc Veyrat\u2019s third star away,\u201d he said, <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/dirty-dancing-nobody-puts-baby-in-the-corner_n_5898dabfe4b0c1284f27894c\" title=\"\">channelling Dirty Dancing.</a> He is accusing the guide of sensationalism. It\u2019s not selling enough in print, and a public feud with Veyrat (yes, he twice referred to himself in the third person) has legs.</p> <p>But the Michelin doesn\u2019t do returns. Though many \u2013 from a street vendor in Bangkok to<a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2018/9/12/17850256/marco-pierre-white-turned-down-michelin-english-house-singapore\" title=\"\"> Marco Pierre White in 1999</a> \u2013 have tried to give back their stars, to actually lose your position in the guide you either have to rename your place, radically rework your menu, or close up shop (which is what White ended up doing, and, boy. was he a model of equanimity and self-restraint). The only time, to my knowledge, that the guide has agreed to a chef\u2019s request was last year when an altogether humbler <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2018/1/30/16949794/michelin-takes-back-stars-le-suquet-a-laguiole-sebastien-bras\" title=\"\">S\u00e9bastien Bras of Le Suquet in Laguiole</a> cited immense pressure and stress as reasons for wanting to relinquish the three-star status he and his father had maintained since the late 1990s. And even then, it didn\u2019t last. Le Suquet is back in the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46958825\" title=\"\">red book\u2019s pages this year</a>. No respect, declared Le Figaro but Bras appears nonplussed. In January, he said nothing on his side had changed, but he was no longer that bothered \u2013 either by the stars or by the guide\u2019s strategies.</p> <p>Stars are a lot like likes. One Spanish chef said he didn\u2019t want one any more because of how they go to your head. Get one and you\u2019re pissed off when you don\u2019t get another. There is a difference in that you can choose to be on social media, but as a chef, you\u2019ve no say in whether you\u2019re in the Michelin or not.</p> <p>You absolutely can choose to care, though. And increasingly a certain kind of chef \u2013 and many a wised-up punter, too \u2013 simply doesn\u2019t. \u201cWe don\u2019t wanna win a Michelin star,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/nzkzbq/this-chef-doesnt-want-a-michelin-star-he-wants-you-to-have-a-cool-time\" title=\"\">said Magnus Reid</a>, of now-defunct east London restaurant Legs a few years back. \u201cWe just want people to have a cool time.\u201d Eater, the news website, refers to Michelin as the tyre company. Which it is, quite literally. But in the same way that referring to Nobel as an explosives merchant (again, true albeit reductive) might, that descriptor attempts to knock the fabled taste-maker down a peg or two. To put it as <a href=\"https://genius.com/Stormzy-big-for-your-boots-lyrics\" title=\"\">Stormzy might</a>, they\u2019re all getting way too big for their boots.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Dale Berning Sawa is a writer covering culture, food, health, tech and work</p>",

      "bodyText": "Marc Veyrat, a French chef and Bob Dylan lookalike (he\u2019s as famous for his Michelin-starred cooking as he is for his wide-rimmed black hat), has been in the news this week. Or rather, to do him justice, he\u2019s gone full-tilt Gordon Ramsay in the news this week. In January, the Michelin Guide demoted his Haute-Savoie restaurant, La Maison des Bois in Manigod. He became, as he put it, the only chef in history to get a third star one year \u2013 and lose it the very next. And the six months since have been a living hell. A few weeks ago, he texted \u2013 texted! \u2013 the French weekly Le Point, saying: \u201cHello, call me back please, it\u2019s urgent.\u201d And when they did, he proceeded to relay, in great, indeed in operatic detail, quite how awful the fallout has been. He has been depressed, he has had dark thoughts. He hasn\u2019t been able to sleep or feed himself. He has cried as if his parents had passed away all over again. He has envisaged the very worst. The worst, of course, to his mind, had already happened. The Michelin, he said, would never be able to atone for this terrible injury. When he travelled to Paris to ask Michelin for an explanation, he says the only reasons he got for this destarring were that he\u2019d used a piece of cheddar in one of his dishes and that his scallops were a bit mealy. This is where the souffl\u00e9 deflates. Mealy? You can feel him fuming. \u201cIt is impossible that my scallops be mealy. I cook them in the shell of a passion fruit,\u201d he told Le Point. And that cheddar? That was actually a highly technical bit of culinary nous, using beaufort, a firm raw-cow\u2019s-milk Alpine cheese. \u201cHow can anyone with so much power be so incompetent?\u201d he wanted to know. It\u2019s a rant that neatly brings to mind Kevin McCallister\u2019s sister in Home Alone saying, \u201cYou\u2019re what the French call les incomp\u00e9tents\u201d, when the kid doesn\u2019t know how to pack a suitcase. And just as that scene was all about tantrums and bullies, of course that is all this is about, too. Not food. Power. The power of the toque blanche, that puffy white chef\u2019s hat that signals quasi-cartoon-like authority in the militarily minded ranks of the world\u2019s professional kitchens, one that will not stand to be disputed. And the power of the omniscient, omnipresent Michelin inspectors, arriving unannounced and in disguise, and doing as they please with your worldwide reputation. Veyrat has decided that if he can\u2019t have three stars, he doesn\u2019t want any. \u201cNo one takes Marc Veyrat\u2019s third star away,\u201d he said, channelling Dirty Dancing. He is accusing the guide of sensationalism. It\u2019s not selling enough in print, and a public feud with Veyrat (yes, he twice referred to himself in the third person) has legs. But the Michelin doesn\u2019t do returns. Though many \u2013 from a street vendor in Bangkok to Marco Pierre White in 1999 \u2013 have tried to give back their stars, to actually lose your position in the guide you either have to rename your place, radically rework your menu, or close up shop (which is what White ended up doing, and, boy. was he a model of equanimity and self-restraint). The only time, to my knowledge, that the guide has agreed to a chef\u2019s request was last year when an altogether humbler S\u00e9bastien Bras of Le Suquet in Laguiole cited immense pressure and stress as reasons for wanting to relinquish the three-star status he and his father had maintained since the late 1990s. And even then, it didn\u2019t last. Le Suquet is back in the red book\u2019s pages this year. No respect, declared Le Figaro but Bras appears nonplussed. In January, he said nothing on his side had changed, but he was no longer that bothered \u2013 either by the stars or by the guide\u2019s strategies. Stars are a lot like likes. One Spanish chef said he didn\u2019t want one any more because of how they go to your head. Get one and you\u2019re pissed off when you don\u2019t get another. There is a difference in that you can choose to be on social media, but as a chef, you\u2019ve no say in whether you\u2019re in the Michelin or not. You absolutely can choose to care, though. And increasingly a certain kind of chef \u2013 and many a wised-up punter, too \u2013 simply doesn\u2019t. \u201cWe don\u2019t wanna win a Michelin star,\u201d said Magnus Reid, of now-defunct east London restaurant Legs a few years back. \u201cWe just want people to have a cool time.\u201d Eater, the news website, refers to Michelin as the tyre company. Which it is, quite literally. But in the same way that referring to Nobel as an explosives merchant (again, true albeit reductive) might, that descriptor attempts to knock the fabled taste-maker down a peg or two. To put it as Stormzy might, they\u2019re all getting way too big for their boots. \u2022 Dale Berning Sawa is a writer covering culture, food, health, tech and work",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Vlieghe said the outlook had deteriorated since his last speech on the economy in February, with the UK no longer being supported by robust global growth.

In signs of growing Threadneedle Street concern about the fragility of the economy, Gertjan Vlieghe, a member of the rate-setting monetary policy committee, said he would be prepared to cut borrowing costs aggressively in the event that the UK left the EU without a transition agreement on 31 October this year. The Bank\u2019s official position is that interest rates could move in either direction in the event of a disruptive no-deal scenario, because it would need to assess which was the greater threat: recession or rising inflation. But Vlieghe used a speech in London to indicate that he saw the risks of a collapse in demand as greater than the risk of inflation caused by the higher costs of imports triggered by a fall in the value of the pound or by the imposition of tariffs. \u201cOn balance, I think it is more likely that I would move to cut [the] bank rate towards the effective lower bound of close to 0% in the event of a no-deal scenario,\u201d Vlieghe said during a speech at Thompson Reuters.

The opening lines of Arbel\u00e1ez\u2019s After the War are now displayed on the wall of the metro. First written in a letter to Jaramillo in 1964 \u2013 the year in which the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) rebels took up arms \u2013 the poem became an emblematic anti-war verse. After the War by Jotamario Arbel\u00e1ez a day after the war if there is a war if after the war there is a day I will hold you in my arms a day after the war if there is a war if after the war there is a day if after the war I have arms and I will make love to you with love a day after the war if there is a war if after the war there is a day if after the war there is love and if there is what it takes to make love Translated by Nicol\u00e1s Suesc\u00fan Five decades later, it was a second generation Nadaista, Humberto de la Calle, who successfully negotiated the end of the conflict with the Farc as the government\u2019s chief negotiator in peace talks in Cuba. De la Calle credits the group with his political development. \u201cNada\u00edsmo taught me never to swallow anything whole, to avoid dogmas and to listen to others,\u201d he says. \u201cThat sense of irony and pessimism helped me in Havana \u2026 and I think it would be useful right now as our society becomes increasingly hateful.\u201d De la Calle ran for president in 2018, but received just 2% of first-round votes as his centrist platform lost out before an increasingly polarized electorate. \u201cI suffered one of the most thunderous defeats in Colombian electoral history,\u201d says De la Calle with a laugh. He sees President Iv\u00e1n Duque\u2019s proposals to renegotiate aspects of the peace deal as having the potential to deepen political divisions. \u201cWe\u2019re returning to the sort of polarization we saw in the 1940s and 50s,\u201d says Arbel\u00e1ez. \u201cGonzalo [Arango] understood the need to create an alternative to violent partisan politics. I think nada\u00edsmo helped many Colombians exit that particular cave, but apparently a lot of people were left inside.\u201d The remaining Nadaistas continue their 60-year struggle. Jaramillo is one of the country\u2019s leading historians and teaches poetry workshops in a Medell\u00edn library. Arbel\u00e1ez continues to appear at book fairs around the world. Escobar spent 2018 rereading Latin American Marxist texts in preparation for a new book and last year was reunited with his teenage girlfriend. They plan to marry. Belated recognition hasn\u2019t dampened the underlying contrarianism, however. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to disagree with the world \u2013 even when the world has acknowledged we were right all along,\u201d says Arbel\u00e1ez.",

Murphy\u2019s friends insist she is simply an effective manager who gets things done.</p> \n<p>Two incidents in particular following the drubbing in the European elections raised eyebrows, too. The first was the abrupt expulsion of Tony Blair\u2019s spinner Alastair Campbell, for admitting that he had voted Lib Dem \u2013 a decision formally taken by Formby, without consultation with Corbyn or any other politician.</p> \n<p>Corbyn\u2019s team blame Campbell \u2013 alongside another ex-spinner, Ed Miliband\u2019s former adviser Tom Baldwin \u2013 for popularising the phrase \u201cthe four Ms\u201d to describe Milne and Murphy, together with the Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, and the union\u2019s chief of staff, Andrew Murray.</p> \n<p>The quartet is perhaps the closest thing Labour has to the \u201cchumocracy\u201d of David Cameron\u2019s Notting Hill set. Murray, a Communist party member until Corbyn won the Labour leadership, is a longstanding friend of Milne\u2019s, currently seconded part-time from Unite to LOTO. Murray\u2019s daughter Laura was recently appointed as Labour\u2019s head of complaints, after working in LOTO. (And one of Corbyn\u2019s sons, Seb, works for another powerful Labour M, John McDonnell.)</p> \n<p>Murphy is a close friend of McCluskey\u2019s, and Labour frontbenchers sometimes regarded her as a proxy for him \u2013 though her main role is as Corbyn\u2019s enforcer and gatekeeper.</p> \n<p>McCluskey has frequently infuriated Labour frontbenchers with offstage interventions, particularly on Brexit \u2013 though he was fully signed up to the collective trade union position that paved the way for the Brexit compromise this week.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2f2edbf1-3c40-4085-8d38-5952840484ce\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>When did accusations of antisemitism in Labour start and how have they escalated?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Two major public furores about antisemitism occurred in 2016, with Labour MP&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/27/shadow-minister-calls-for-suspension-of-naz-shah-over-israel-posts\">Naz Shah apologising</a>&nbsp;for an antisemitic Facebook post, and former London mayor Ken Livingstone making&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/28/ken-livingstone-suspended-from-labour-after-hitler-remarks\">remarks about \u201cthe Israel lobby\u201d and Hitler supporting Zionism</a>&nbsp;in broadcast interviews that eventually led to him quitting the party after a lengthy disciplinary process. A report that year by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/29/jeremy-corbyn-sets-up-inquiry-into-labour-antisemitism-claims\">Shami Chakrabarti</a>&nbsp;exonerated the party of widespread antisemitism but reported an 'occasionally toxic atmosphere'.</p>\n    <p>Matters escalated in 2018 when it became evident that the party was receiving more and more complaints, to the extent that there was a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/20/jewish-labour-group-accuses-failing-act-antisemitism\">backlog of disciplinary cases</a>. Jeremy Corbyn&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/05/corbyn-sorry-for-hurt-inflicted-on-jewish-people-by-antisemitism-row-labour\">apologised that April</a>&nbsp;for hurt caused to the Jewish community by problems in the process and pointed to only 0.1% of members being under investigation for alleged antisemitic comments.</p>\n    <p>But the party was also mired in a row about whether to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, which it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/04/labour-adopts-ihra-antisemitism-definition-in-full\">ended up ultimately approving</a>. Then accusations of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/02/new-labour-party-row-over-antisemitism-jeremy-corbyn\">political interference in the complaints process</a>&nbsp;by aides close to Corbyn began to emerge earlier this year, which the party strongly denies.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>When did the complaints about antisemitism turn into a full-blown crisis?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The resignations of some MPs and peers over antisemitism in February 2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/28/labour-worst-day-shame-tom-watson-luciana-berger-resignation\">alarmed many Labour colleagues</a>.

However, many of his supporters in the party backed a campaign saying he had been vilified and badly treated. Then came the announcement that the Equalities and Human Rights Commission was placing the party&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/equality-body-launches-investigation-of-labour-antisemitism-claims\">under formal investigation</a>&nbsp;over antisemitism.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What allegations were made in the BBC Panorama documentary?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In a July 2019 programme, eight whistleblowers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/labour-bosses-accused-of-undermining-fight-against-antisemitism-bbc-panorama\">spoke to a BBC Panorama documentary</a>, with some saying they felt there was political meddling from Corbyn\u2019s office in the process for handling antisemitism complaints. Seumas Milne, one of Corbyn\u2019s closest aides, told officials the party was 'muddling up political disputes with racism' and must review processes. Jennie Formby, the general secretary, was accused of attempting to interfere in who sat on a panel examining the case of Jackie Walker, a high-profile activist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/labour-expels-jackie-walker-for-leaked-antisemitism-comments\">who was eventually expelled from the party</a>.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Labour\u2019s response to the BBC\u2019s Panorama?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Labour&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/labour-bosses-accused-of-undermining-fight-against-antisemitism-bbc-panorama\">strongly denied the allegations</a>&nbsp;of political interference, and came out on the offensive, accusing the BBC of bias and calling for the documentary to be pulled.

      "bodyText": "As Jeremy Corbyn mooched through the sunlit atrium of Westminster\u2019s Portcullis House on Tuesday lunchtime, he looked as though a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. An hour or so earlier, he had emailed every Labour member, detailing the party\u2019s new \u201csettled position\u201d on Brexit, which will see the leadership demand a referendum on any new deal the next PM manages to secure \u2013 and campaign for remain. \u201cJeremy\u2019s a lot happier. He thinks with patience we\u2019ve got to the right position,\u201d said one sympathetic shadow minister that afternoon. At that day\u2019s shadow cabinet meeting, both sides of the Brexit divide, from Keir Starmer to Ian Lavery, had signed off on the policy. Corbyn\u2019s restive deputy, Tom Watson, was the lone dissenter. The Labour leader and his inner circle hoped the shift would help to calm the civil war that has raged in his party for months \u2013 and whose frontline had come dangerously close to his own door. In particular, they were keen to prevent Watson from driving a wedge between Corbyn and the remain-supporting membership. But the truce was to be short-lived. Just 24 hours later, Corbyn\u2019s team was under pressure once again, as the BBC Panorama documentary about the handling of antisemitism cases hit the screens. Even before the programme was aired, Labour\u2019s official press operation went on the offensive against the seven whistleblowers who gave evidence on camera. \u201cThese disaffected former officials include those who have always opposed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, worked to actively undermine it, and have both personal and political axes to grind,\u201d Corbyn\u2019s spokesman said. Ruthless counterattack is a characteristic tactic of the committed cadre who surround the Labour leader, including his chief of staff, Karie Murphy, and the executive director of strategy and communications, Seumas Milne. It has served their political project well in the past, not least during the \u201cchicken coup\u201d, in the summer of 2016, when scores of frontbenchers resigned en masse, to little or no effect, and Owen Smith launched his ill-fated tilt at the leadership. They are a tight-knit group, who spent many years banished to the fringes of Labour politics. Corbyn\u2019s better than expected performance at the 2017 general election, after a campaign punctuated by joyful mass rallies, appeared to vindicate their belief that the British public was tired of the fraying consensus, and ready for a decisive shift to the left. And after Labour achieved the biggest increase in its share of the vote at any general election since 1945, the 2017 campaign also drove out any lingering sense on the right of the party that Corbyn was a temporary aberration, whose fellow travellers would soon be banished. Instead, his project of transforming the party surged ahead, with more supporters elected to the party\u2019s ruling national executive committee (NEC), and the sympathetic Jennie Formby chosen as Labour\u2019s general secretary \u2013 the party\u2019s most powerful official. Some Labour insiders claim that, as the Brexit battle has raged in recent weeks and months, the siege mentality that characterised the early period of Corbyn\u2019s tenure has returned. \u201cThey\u2019re back in the bunker,\u201d said one staffer this week. Corbyn\u2019s inner circle had already come under increasing scrutiny in recent months. With pressure mounting to shift the party\u2019s position \u2013 in particular after the party polled just 14% in May\u2019s European elections \u2013 even some of Corbyn\u2019s closest allies, including Diane Abbott and John McDonnell, had become exasperated. They blamed, at least in part, what they saw as the committed Euroscepticism of Milne and Murphy, as did many of the leftwing MPs who formed the campaign group Love Socialism Hate Brexit, in a bid to amplify the remain message in their party. \u201cSeumas and Karie will brook no deviation from the true path of Brexit,\u201d one shadow cabinet member told the Guardian at the time. Another claimed: \u201cKarie thinks a referendum is all about giving in to Tom Watson.\u201d McDonnell, the Labour leader\u2019s closest political comrade, had come to fear that party morale was threatened by the continued attempt to play both sides of the Brexit divide \u2013 despite the genuine fears of those MPs who feared backing a referendum would annihilate Labour\u2019s support in leave-voting areas. Labour sources insist that Corbyn was clearly signalling the direction of travel \u2013 but waiting until a consensus could be built across the party before any formal shift was made. And they dismiss the concerns about Milne and Murphy\u2019s role as just the latest version of the \u201cgood king, bad advisers\u201d trope that has dogged Corbyn throughout his tenure. After last week\u2019s shadow cabinet meeting the Brexit divide has been healed for now, but it could well erupt once again in the run-up to a general election. Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, who had been doubtful in the past about the merits of a referendum, said: \u201cI think the main thing is that Jeremy wanted to build a consensus \u2013 and he has done.\u201d But he made clear that Labour could still enter a general election in the coming months offering to negotiate its own Brexit deal. As well as niggling fears about the political influence of Corbyn\u2019s advisers, there are also concerns about reports of Murphy\u2019s untrammelled control over LOTO \u2013 the \u201cleader of the opposition\u2019s office\u201d \u2013 and the wider party. Several party staff loyal to Corbyn have told the Guardian that anxieties about a domineering management style have been aired at trade union meetings \u2013 though a simmering pay dispute has now been resolved. Murphy\u2019s friends insist she is simply an effective manager who gets things done. Two incidents in particular following the drubbing in the European elections raised eyebrows, too. The first was the abrupt expulsion of Tony Blair\u2019s spinner Alastair Campbell, for admitting that he had voted Lib Dem \u2013 a decision formally taken by Formby, without consultation with Corbyn or any other politician. Corbyn\u2019s team blame Campbell \u2013 alongside another ex-spinner, Ed Miliband\u2019s former adviser Tom Baldwin \u2013 for popularising the phrase \u201cthe four Ms\u201d to describe Milne and Murphy, together with the Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, and the union\u2019s chief of staff, Andrew Murray. The quartet is perhaps the closest thing Labour has to the \u201cchumocracy\u201d of David Cameron\u2019s Notting Hill set. Murray, a Communist party member until Corbyn won the Labour leadership, is a longstanding friend of Milne\u2019s, currently seconded part-time from Unite to LOTO. Murray\u2019s daughter Laura was recently appointed as Labour\u2019s head of complaints, after working in LOTO. (And one of Corbyn\u2019s sons, Seb, works for another powerful Labour M, John McDonnell.) Murphy is a close friend of McCluskey\u2019s, and Labour frontbenchers sometimes regarded her as a proxy for him \u2013 though her main role is as Corbyn\u2019s enforcer and gatekeeper. McCluskey has frequently infuriated Labour frontbenchers with offstage interventions, particularly on Brexit \u2013 though he was fully signed up to the collective trade union position that paved the way for the Brexit compromise this week. The second recent incident that sparked alarm even on the left of the party was the abrupt ditching of Emily Thornberry from her customary role as Corbyn\u2019s deputy for PMQs, after she infuriated Corbyn\u2019s office by launching an outspoken critique of the party\u2019s Brexit position on live TV just after the EU election polls closed. Journalists were told she was attending the D-day celebrations, but in fact she did not travel to France until later on that Wednesday, and was sitting on the front bench to watch Rebecca Long-Bailey make her debut at the weekly joust. Party sources now insist they simply wanted to highlight the importance of the climate crisis, which lies in Long-Bailey\u2019s brief. But the move allowed Theresa May\u2019s deputy, David Lidington, to quip: \u201cAnybody who outshines the dear leader at the dispatch box risks being airbrushed out of the politburo history at the earliest opportunity.\u201d Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, was widely regarded as having performed well. Indeed, rumours immediately began swirling that Corbyn\u2019s advisers were beginning to peer over the shoulder of the 70-year-old leader and line up Long-Bailey as an ideologically amenable successor, to continue the leftwing project \u2013 Corbynism after Corbyn. One shadow cabinet ally of the Labour leader claimed: \u201cJeremy won\u2019t hear a word against Seumas and Karie. He says he needs them and they are loyal to him. Neither is true.\u201d As the ugly issue of antisemitism rears its head once again, and with a general election perhaps just months away, loyalties on all sides are likely to be tested to the limit in the weeks ahead.",

The most commonly used drugs, known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), work by stopping the brain mopping up the chemical serotonin.

Ketamine appears to act on a different brain chemical called glutamate, and in animal studies has been shown to restore connections between brain cells that are thought to shrink back during prolonged periods of depression.

It means that no individual officers have been held to blame over Orchard\u2019s death \u2013 only the \u201coffice\u201d of the chief constable.</p> <p>In a statement, the family said: \u201cStrangely, we are not surprised, and yet deeply shocked. We are not surprised because, in our assessment, we have witnessed it again and again over the past seven years. We are not surprised because, to be honest, we never really had any faith in this tribunal, believing it to be an investigation held \u2013 only reluctantly after direction from the IOPC \u2013 by the police, for the police.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, we also remain deeply shocked. As a family we used to believe in the system; we believed that if something bad happened, justice would be served. But no one and no process that we have witnessed to date has fully explored \u2013 openly, honestly and constructively \u2013 the catastrophic failings surrounding Thomas\u2019s death. We feel let down and have been failed beyond belief.</p> <p>\u201cThe saddest thing for us is that Thomas\u2019s death was in vain; worse than that, it seems to have reinforced the notion that the police can behave in ways that we see to have been grossly irresponsible, negligent and reckless \u2026 and get away with it.\u201d</p> <p>The disciplinary panel, which was chaired by a senior officer from another force, concluded the officers could not have a fair hearing because of issues including the lapse in time since Orchard\u2019s death and concern over the disclosure process. Orchard\u2019s family was able to attend the hearing but was refused access to documentation in the case, running to more than 12,000 pages.</p> <p>Orchard was a fit and physically healthy man living independently in supported accommodation at the time of his death. He had a history of mental illness and a diagnosis of schizophrenia. On 3 October 2012 he was arrested and detained by officers in Exeter.</p> <p>He was transported by police van to Heavitree Road police station. Upon arrival a US-made emergency response belt (ERB), constructed from a tough webbing fabric, was put around his face as a spit or bite hood. The ERB remained held around his face as he was carried face down to a cell, where he was left lying on the floor. By the time officers re-entered the cell, Thomas was in cardiac arrest. He was transferred to hospital and pronounced dead a week later.</p> <p>In 2017 a police sergeant and two detention officers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/14/thomas-orchard-death-police-cleared-of-manslaughter\">were cleared by a jury of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/14/thomas-orchard-death-police-cleared-of-manslaughter\">manslaughter</a>. They argued the force they used was lawful and proportiona,l but his family has always rejected the depiction of Orchard as an angry and violent man during his arrest, insisting he was frightened and fighting for his life.</p> <p>After the acquittal,<a href=\"https://www.policeconduct.gov.uk/news/six-devon-and-cornwall-police-officers-and-staff-face-misconduct-proceedings-following-death\"> the IOPC argued four officers had cases to answer for gross misconduct. The force disagreed. But the IOPC directed it to hold misconduct hearings.</a></p> <p>Deborah Coles, the director of the charity INQUEST, which has supported the family, said: \u201cThat this disciplinary hearing has been stopped before it even started is simply deplorable.\u201d</p> <p>Helen Stone of the the law firm Hickman &amp; Rose, who represents the family, said: \u201cIt is a matter of general public concern that no police officers will face disciplinary hearings to account for their actions towards Thomas, after a panel decided today that they could not have a fair hearing.\u201d</p> <p>The chief constable of Devon and Cornwall police, Shaun Sawyer, said: \u201cI accept the decision made by the independent panel. Matters relating to the case are not over yet and there are still ongoing IOPC-directed misconduct proceedings against two police [civilian] staff.</p> <p>\u201cThis was an IOPC-directed hearing against the representations of the force. I understand the significant impact of this long-running matter on the officers, staff and their families, and of course the family of Thomas Orchard.</p> <p>\u201cI am unable to comment further at this stage due to ongoing misconduct proceedings against two police staff members.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew Berry, chair of Devon and Cornwall Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said: \u201cThese four police officers turned up to work that day, as they did every day, to do their job, using the equipment that was provided by their employer, acting in accordance with the training they had been given. Two criminal trials and a gross misconduct process have failed to evidence any wrongdoing on their part.\u201d</p> <p>He called for the IOPC to carry out an internal investigation in to how long proceedings had dragged on for. \u201cLessons need to be learned for the sake of all,\u201d Berry added.</p> <p>The IOPC regional director Sarah Green said: \u201cWe will carefully consider the panel\u2019s decision. We are extremely mindful of the impact this case has had on both the Orchard family and the officers involved.\u201d Green said it was a priority for the IOPC to improve the speed of investigations.</p>",

This year the office of Devon and Cornwall police admitted breaches under the Health and Safety at Work Act related to Orchard\u2019s death and was fined \u00a3234,500. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) ordered the force to bring disciplinary hearings for gross misconduct against four police officers \u2013 a sergeant and three constables \u2013 who were involved in the restraint of Orchard at Heavitree Road police station. But on Friday it emerged that the proceedings had been discontinued after a private preliminary hearing during which the officers argued there had been an abuse of process. The decision is a huge blow for the Orchard family, who are deeply hurt that they have never received an apology from the force. It means that no individual officers have been held to blame over Orchard\u2019s death \u2013 only the \u201coffice\u201d of the chief constable. In a statement, the family said: \u201cStrangely, we are not surprised, and yet deeply shocked. We are not surprised because, in our assessment, we have witnessed it again and again over the past seven years. We are not surprised because, to be honest, we never really had any faith in this tribunal, believing it to be an investigation held \u2013 only reluctantly after direction from the IOPC \u2013 by the police, for the police. \u201cHowever, we also remain deeply shocked. As a family we used to believe in the system; we believed that if something bad happened, justice would be served. But no one and no process that we have witnessed to date has fully explored \u2013 openly, honestly and constructively \u2013 the catastrophic failings surrounding Thomas\u2019s death. We feel let down and have been failed beyond belief. \u201cThe saddest thing for us is that Thomas\u2019s death was in vain; worse than that, it seems to have reinforced the notion that the police can behave in ways that we see to have been grossly irresponsible, negligent and reckless \u2026 and get away with it.\u201d The disciplinary panel, which was chaired by a senior officer from another force, concluded the officers could not have a fair hearing because of issues including the lapse in time since Orchard\u2019s death and concern over the disclosure process. Orchard\u2019s family was able to attend the hearing but was refused access to documentation in the case, running to more than 12,000 pages. Orchard was a fit and physically healthy man living independently in supported accommodation at the time of his death. He had a history of mental illness and a diagnosis of schizophrenia. On 3 October 2012 he was arrested and detained by officers in Exeter. He was transported by police van to Heavitree Road police station. Upon arrival a US-made emergency response belt (ERB), constructed from a tough webbing fabric, was put around his face as a spit or bite hood. The ERB remained held around his face as he was carried face down to a cell, where he was left lying on the floor. By the time officers re-entered the cell, Thomas was in cardiac arrest. He was transferred to hospital and pronounced dead a week later. In 2017 a police sergeant and two detention officers were cleared by a jury of manslaughter. They argued the force they used was lawful and proportiona,l but his family has always rejected the depiction of Orchard as an angry and violent man during his arrest, insisting he was frightened and fighting for his life. After the acquittal, the IOPC argued four officers had cases to answer for gross misconduct. The force disagreed. But the IOPC directed it to hold misconduct hearings. Deborah Coles, the director of the charity INQUEST, which has supported the family, said: \u201cThat this disciplinary hearing has been stopped before it even started is simply deplorable.\u201d Helen Stone of the the law firm Hickman &amp; Rose, who represents the family, said: \u201cIt is a matter of general public concern that no police officers will face disciplinary hearings to account for their actions towards Thomas, after a panel decided today that they could not have a fair hearing.\u201d The chief constable of Devon and Cornwall police, Shaun Sawyer, said: \u201cI accept the decision made by the independent panel. Matters relating to the case are not over yet and there are still ongoing IOPC-directed misconduct proceedings against two police [civilian] staff. \u201cThis was an IOPC-directed hearing against the representations of the force. I understand the significant impact of this long-running matter on the officers, staff and their families, and of course the family of Thomas Orchard. \u201cI am unable to comment further at this stage due to ongoing misconduct proceedings against two police staff members.\u201d Andrew Berry, chair of Devon and Cornwall Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said: \u201cThese four police officers turned up to work that day, as they did every day, to do their job, using the equipment that was provided by their employer, acting in accordance with the training they had been given. Two criminal trials and a gross misconduct process have failed to evidence any wrongdoing on their part.\u201d He called for the IOPC to carry out an internal investigation in to how long proceedings had dragged on for. \u201cLessons need to be learned for the sake of all,\u201d Berry added. The IOPC regional director Sarah Green said: \u201cWe will carefully consider the panel\u2019s decision. We are extremely mindful of the impact this case has had on both the Orchard family and the officers involved.\u201d Green said it was a priority for the IOPC to improve the speed of investigations.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s today\u2019s report from Jeremy Whittle. Well, we got there in the end. And after six hours, two minutes and 44 seconds, so did Dylan Groenewegen. It\u2019s his fourth Tou de France stage win, but his first at this year\u2019s Tour. It\u2019s his team\u2019s third stage win at this Tour. Dylan Groenewegen wins. That was impressive from the Dutch 26-year-old. He found himself stuck in traffic in the closing stages, but muscled his way into position and launched his sprint from a long way back. It was Caleb Ewan he beat by centimetres, to secure another stage for Team Jumbo-Visma. The Jumbo-Visma sprinter fights his way through, launches his sprint and wins despite coming from furthest back. Viviani was second, mere centimetres behind. 1.5km to go: Wout van Aert peels off the front and Amund Grondahl Jansen takes over at the front for Jumbo-Visma. 4km to go: Jumbo Visma lead the charge as we head towards the 3km-to-go mark where the GC teams can sit up and leave the sprint teams to it. Should anything happen any of the GC contenders inside the three-kilometre to go mark, everybody finishes on the same time. 5km to go: It\u2019s getting a little bit messy at the front, where there\u2019s now a lot of jockeying for position going on. 6km to go: The carriages of various sprint trains have been coupled together and assorted riders are waiting for the final 1.5 kilometres when they\u2019ll have to start shovelling coal in earnest. Team Ineos, who will be unconcerned with the sprint, are currently at the front, where it\u2019s safe, while the sprint teams sit back and bide their time. 8km to go: The road is wide at the moment, but the final three kilometres are quite technical before a gun-barrel straight run-in to the finish. 10km to go: Yoann Offredo is spat out the back of the peloton and smiles for the cameras as a Moto pulls alongside him. 12km to go: Offredo is caught and our breakaway is no more. Will anyone launch an audacious attack or is a sprint finish guaranteed? 14km to go: A sharp left for the peloton, which has the breakaway in sight. The gap is 11 seconds. Chapeau Stephane Rosetto! Chapeau Yoann Offredo! It\u2019s been nice getting to know you over the past 218 kilometres. Rosetto gets caught, but Offredo stays out on his own, almost certainly earning himself today\u2019s combativity award. 16km to go: The gap is 17 seconds after five hours 48 minutes of racing. 19km to go: The road is wide and riders from Astana, Bora Hansgrohe, UAE Team Emirates, Lotto Soudal, Jumbo Visma and Quick Step are all towards the front, ready to do a job for their sprinters. The gap is 21 seconds, but again, the bunch is not chasing the breakaway with anything resembling urgency. 21km to go: The gap between our breakaway duo and the chasing posse is 28 seconds. In the peloton, assorted teams are jockeying for position, but they\u2019re not riding with any particular urgency. 27km to go: The word on the street is that Nairo Quintana might have stopped for a comfort break at an inopportune moment, which is why the peloton did not pile on the hurt when he found himself way behind them. He doesn\u2019t seem the brightest, that boy Nairo. His ongoing reluctance to attack during Tours when he looks like he could punish fellow GC contenders never ceases to baffle me. Still, I suppose if you gotta go, you gotta go. He\u2019s gotta way with it on this occasion. 28km to go: I\u2019m not sure how that happened, but Dan Martin and Quintana somehow found themselves in a group 30 seconds down on the peloton. I don\u2019t think it was anything to do with the weather, but it may have been down to a couple of them dropping back to team cars at the same time the front of the bunch were gearing up for the intermediate sprint. Whatever happened, the peloton have not capitalised and all concerned are now back in touch. The peloton has split: Things are hotting up, finally. And how! The peloton has split and a bunch of 20 or 30 riders including Simon Yates, Dan Martin, Nairo Quintana and Jack Haig are now 38 seconds behind the rest of the bunch. 33km to go: A warmly - certainly not hotly - contested sprint at the head of the peloton and Sonny Colbrelli is next over the line at the intermediate sprint, ahead of Peter Sagan, Elia Viviani and Michael Matthews. 36km to go: Rossetto \u201cwins\u201d the uncontested intermediate sprint from Offredo. Next man over will take 17 points - lots to fight over for the green jersey contenders. Intermediate sprint: The breakaway riders are getting near the intermediate sprint. There\u2019s \u20ac1,500 up for grabs for the team of the first man over the line, while that of the second will get \u20ac1,000 (third gets \u20ac500). It will be intriguing to see if our two breakaway riders contest it, as the points that are up for grabs are no use to either of them. The gap is 1min 46sec. Name that breakaway: That\u2019s a good pic of the scrawny youth atop the wood pile,\u201d writes Ian Miles. \u201cTV gave him great coverge as well. His name is, of course, Offredo Rossetto.\u201d An informative email: \u201cThe finish of today\u2019s stage, Chalon-sur-Soane, is the scene of the farcical treatment of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway in the latter\u2019s A Moveable Feast,\u201d writes Patrick Galey. \u201cAfter driving all day in Scott\u2019s Renault from Lyon (which his wife Zelda inexplicably decided to remove the roof from) and getting soaked in several rain showers, the pair check into a hotel in Chalon, upon which Scott decides that he is dying. \u201cHe takes to bed and begs Hemingway to go to a pharmacy to fetch a thermometer. Hemingway instead orders two double whiskeys and citron presses, finds a bath thermometer from a waiter and fools Scott into thinking he\u2019s read his temperature. While waiting for him to calm down, Hem polishes off an entire bottle of Macon, orders another round of whiskey lemonades and dresses for dinner, whereupon the pair polish off a carafe of Fleurie and a bottle of Montagny with snails. I wonder if the riders shall sup likewise in Chalon this evening.\u201d A view from the front of the race. Closely followed by a view from the back. An email: \u201cDo they still give a prize for the Lanterne Rouge at the end of the Tour?\u201d asks Matthew Lysaght. \u201cIf so then Yoann Offredo may well have gotten into the break safe in the knowledge that he\u2019d be spat out the back of the Peloton once caught thereby cementing his position as last man on GC. Genius if so.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if they still give out an actual prize, but there is a certain cachet to being Laterne Rouge that can be monetised by charging more to participate in various criteriums after the Tour. Put it this way, nobody wants to finish last, but there\u2019s literally no shame in it and doing so is a heck of a lot more commercially beneficial than finishing second last or third last. On today\u2019s finish: \u201cLast time I arrived in Chalon-sur-Saone train station with a bike, it was a Brompton folder which I was road testing for a bike magazine,\u201d writes Gareth Thomas. \u201cThere is a \u2018voie verte\u2019 going south from Chalon on an old railway route and I took the bike along for the opening celebrations in 1997. There is a world class bicycle museum halfway along that cycleway, before the town of Cluny. It has Chris Boardman\u2019s revolutionary Barcelona Olympics track bike in it. Look it up.\u201d 56km to go: \u201cIs Brian Smith sponsored by the Scottish Tourist Board?\u201d asks Adam Hirst. \u201cNext up, how drinking whisky is the best way to warm down. And listen out for how these Alpine lakes don\u2019t compare to the beauty of Loch Ness, as they have no monster. He\u2019ll need to work porridge in there somewhere as well.\u201d 57km to go: The gap is 2min 11sec and something interesting might begin to happen in the next 20 kilometres or so. Julian Alaphilippe, GC contender? \u201cIn answer to Luke Harrison\u2019s question about Alaphilippe, he\u2019s still pretty young,\u201d writes Dave Langlois. \u201cI reckon that with his bodily make-up and innate strength he could end up as a big Tour winner when he gain\u2019s more resistance, race craft and experience. In the Spanish tour commentary yesterday Pedro Delgado and Joaqu\u00edn Rodriguez were arguing along those lines.\u201d 61km to go: \u201cShortbread is probably more beneficial to kids than some of these cereal bars you get,\u201d adds Brian. The gap is in to 1min 47sec. 66km to go: \u201cYou\u2019d need quite a few bidons on a day like this?\u201d asks Eurosport\u2019s Carlton Kirby of his co-commentator Brian Smith, with more than a hint of desperation. \u201cA bidon takes up a lot of room in a support vehicle,\u201d replies Brian gamely, having pointed out you\u2019d get through one every half hour and that drinking warm water isn\u2019t very pleasant. That sound you can hear is the bottom of a barrel being scraped with commendable professionalism. Where\u2019s Sean Kelly when you need him to wheel out that that story about the time he would have won the Vuelta if it hadn\u2019t been for the boil on his buttock? And we\u2019re back in the room: There are 71km to go and the gap is 2min 04sec. The riders have been in the saddle for four hours and 28 minutes. 80km to go: Our two breakaway riders are bored, those behind them in the peloton are bored, those following them in the support cars are, presumably, bored. The TV commentary team is bored, their audience is bored, I\u2019m bored, you\u2019re bored and there\u2019s still 79 kilometres \u2013 all of it on the flat - to go. I need a coffee to help me stay awake, so here are some mildly intrigued cows to look at while I go and get one. Back in five. 83km to go: The gap is 2min 34sec as our two breakaway riders continue to plough their lonely furrow of futility. On cycling books: \u201cI absolutely loved Slaying The Badger by this parish\u2019s Richard Moore,\u201d writes Guy Hornsby. \u201cA brilliant tale of the rivalry between Hinault and Lemond, it captures the old v new battle, especially poignant as these were the first Tours I watched. \u201cSimilarly, In Search Of Robert Millar is a great read, by Richard. One of cycling\u2019s great enigmas, whose life as Philippa York is as intriguing as her former one as a sinewy climber. Obviously David Millar\u2019s Racing Through The Dark is a must-read. Whatever your views on him, it\u2019s a rare cycling memoir that ditches the rose-tinted specs and genuinely sounds like the author\u2019s voice is at the centre.\u201d 87km to go: Giulio Ciccone has been quick to capitalise on being zipped into the yellow jersey yesterday. The 24-year-old Italian inked a new deal last night and has extended his contract with Trek-Segafredo until 2021. An email: \u201cAs the \u2018racing\u2019 is boring us all a bit today, I thought I would email in my second question of the day,\u201d writes Luke Harrison. \u201cWhy is Julian Alaphilippe not considered as a GC contender? Yes his wiki page calls him a Puncheur and we know he can win the Classics, but I have always thought of him as an excellent climber. He showed that again yesterday and he has had a few top ten finishes on some of the shorter tours. Is it just that a rider like him that has the kind of muscle mass that allows him to punch and sprint as well, just can\u2019t do it day after day over a three week tour?\u201d 91km to go: Dylan Groenewegen is the warm 6-4 favourite to win today\u2019s stage, followed by Elia Viviani, Caleb Ewan, Peter Sagan and Alexander Kristoff in the betting. While there\u2019s no doubting his ability, on the evidence of Groenewegen\u2019s performances in the sprints to date, I wouldn\u2019t be too interested in getting heavily involved at that short a price. My 50p is going on Kristoff. They\u2019ll be coming down the mountain when they come dept: \u201cAt the top of the Madonna a few years back, the hotels are down the bottom, so it makes sense that the vehicles don\u2019t go up after the riders,\u201d writes Adam Hirst, playing fast and loose with his tenses. \u201cThe earlier finishers all rolled down happily enough, on the brakes all the time. On that type, you just have to stick to the outside of the corners I suppose. The grupetto is all spread out and moving slowly, easy to avoid. There were also plenty of people holding out breadboards of crackers, pepperoni and cheese, which the cyclists stopped and tucked into very greedily, swapping for bidons.\u201d Name that breakaway: \u201cOffredo Rossetto sounds like if The Handmaid\u2019s Tale was based in a Spanish holiday resort,\u201d writes Stefan Glosby. Meanwhile, the word from Team EF Education First is that despite soldiering on after his heavy fall earlier today, Tejay van Garderen is in a lot of pain and will be taken for x-rays once today\u2019s stage concludes. Offredo and Rossetto continue to lead the field by a margin of 4min 08sec. Name that breakaway: \u201cYou\u2019re bored,\u201d writes Paul Tindle. \u201cWe\u2019re bored. It\u2019ll be over soon. Meanwhile, myself and friends play name that breakaway daily. Here are a couple from our musings today. Rossetto and Offredo is a high end couture brand notable for making clothes that look terrible on anyone over six stone and for adverts that are the most nonsensical of any fashion house.\u201d This much we know: Yoann Offredo (Wanty-Gobert) and Stephane Rosetto (Cofidis) are in a somewhat unenthusiastic two-man breakaway that is 3min 35sec clear of a peloton that is being towed along by Tony Martin (Jumbo-Visma) and Yves Lampaert (Deceuninck-Quick Step). The riders have been pedalling for three hours 30 minutes and still have another 109 kilometres of largely flat road to go. I\u2019ll be back in 10 minutes. Name that breakaway: \u201cOffredo Rossetto \u2013 a sweet, tangy liqueur from the Tuscan hills, usually served with a dash of soda,\u201d writes Declan Clark. \u201cOften brought back as a memory of the wonderful holiday, always ends up languishing in the dark of the understairs cupboard after Christmas.\u201d Andre Greipel speaks: Talking to Eurosport this morning, the likeable German explains that he went in the breakaway yesterday because he fancied a change and thought it would give him an advantage to be further up the road than the grupetto when he was inevitably dropped. \u201cI would have finished those climbs in the same speed whether I was at the front or the back,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I thought I might as well be at the front.\u201d I\u2019d like to see Andre win one last Tour stage, but at 36 years old he\u2019s not getting any younger and I\u2019m not sure his team are good enough to give him the lead-out he needs. 115km to go: We have reached halfway. And it\u2019s taken three hours and 15 minutes. 121km to go: In the breakaway, Cofidis rider Stephane Rossetto is about to enjoy the highlight of his day. His team car has pulled along side him and somebody in the passenger seat is handing him a selection of treats \u2013 sweet and savour rice cakes, proper cake, chocolate, etc \u2013 wrapped in tinfoil, which are going into his pocket along with the usual selection of energy gels and bars. We\u2019re still not halfway in what must be one of the most boring stages in Tour history ... An email: \u201cIn my personal experience of La Vuelta the descent of riders on no-exit finishes is pure common sense,\u201d writes Dave Langlois, who has something to say about everything we\u2019ve been discussing today. \u201cCycling back down from watching the finish at Los Lagos de Covadonga we\u2019ve even passed some of the last stragglers still struggling up. \u201cIndexing: I agree with emailers who\u2019ve said that gears can go out of synch even without the bike being used, perhaps even more so. |Boring stages: the best big tour recently was Froome\u2019s Vuelta. Hardly one boring flat stage. Lots of punchy climbs day after day. Surely real sprinters should be able to climb moderate hills and then dispute the sprint like Sagan or Matthews? Stages like today\u2019s should be no more than one or two per Tour.\u201d 131km to go: Stephane Rossetto was the first of our breakaway duo over the second climb of the day, the Cote de Chassagne-St Denis. It\u2019s a category three climb, so he gets two King of the Mountains points. Yoann Offredo takes the other one available. 133km to go: The gap goes back out to 4min 10sec, while in the peloton, Astana rider Jakob Fuglsang drops back to his team car for a change of shoes. On Eurosport, the commentary team are deep in conversation, trying to figure out why he\u2019s the second rider to have changed his shoes on this stage. Yes, it\u2019s that kind of day. 138km to go: Nothing much continues to happen out on the road, where the two-man breakaway is being kept on a tight rein. The gap is down to 2min 58sec. Meanwhile in my email inbox, the subject of my jumpy bicycle gears is proving much more of a crowd-pleaser. \u201cThe indexing on the gears of a new bike are actually quite prone to be a tad temperamental,\u201d writes Euan McKinnon. \u201cAny new bike will have been indexed without any significant power being put through the pedals, save for a cursory rotation of the cranks. Once you put a human on a bike and they start pedalling the components are likely to behave slightly differently. \u201cSome futzing around with the barrel adjuster on the rear derailleur should solve the problem, although it does take a bit of trial and error. Your local bike shop should be able to help with this for a very low price. I had this done by Pop Up Bikes in Manchester which is a fantastic cycle repair shop and caf\u00e9 underneath a railway arch near Victoria Stations.\u201d Some clarification: \u201cYep, that\u2019s oilseed rape,\u201d writes barley expert Bob O\u2019Hara. |They were on the floor above us. It\u2019s the seed pods, so it\u2019s already flowered. Oilseed rape is basically the cabbage\u2019s first cousin.\u201d Everyday\u2019s a school day. An email: \u201cMyself and 1,076 other cyclists will be telling you your gears need re-indexing if they\u2019re jumping about,\u201d writes Paul Graham and 1,076 other cyclists. \u201cA decent local bike shop should be able to do this in an hour or so. You could try to follow a gear indexing tutorial on Youtube, but I\u2019ve always found that once you start fiddling it\u2019s a hiding to nothing.\u201d You may well be right, Paul, but I think it\u2019s just me not knowing how to use all those gears properly. I haven\u2019t done enough kilometres on this bike for anything to need re-anything-ing. Like, less than 50. 147km to go: Tony Martin (Jumbo-Visma), Kasper Asgreen (Deceuninck-Quick Step) and Maxime Monfort (Lotto Soudal) are taking turns at the front of the bunch, maintaining the necessary speed to control the breakaway for the benefit of their respective team\u2019s sprinters come stage\u2019s end. The gap is 3min 46sec. 150km to go: \u201cI realise that for someone following the Tour from abroad or far away, a day like today is a bit like watching paint dry,\u201d writes Michael Godden. \u201cHowever, having grown up in a tiny village outside of Belfort, the fact the Tour goes through the hills and city is a big deal. No other event (other than Zidane dragging France to the world cup final in 98) brings complete strangers in the street in such a positive and uplifting environment! Think of the tour as a 3500km picnic. \u201cShout out to my mates Ren\u00e9, Dabbi and Siddi in Reykjavik, where I currently live! Just in Belfort for the Tour, and the temperature difference is brutal!\u201d 151km to go: Once our breakaway duo have cycled another 36 kilometres, they\u2019ll be halfway through this stage. It\u2019s a milestone I\u2019m looking forward to. An email: \u201cI\u2019m always amazed when mention of cycling books is made, that more people haven\u2019t experienced the absolute joy of reading Need For The Bike, by Paul Fournel (who also wrote Anquetil Alone),\u201d writes Howard Rich. \u201cIt\u2019s personal, poetic and utterly beguiling. Every page makes you long to be on your bike. Given the nature of today\u2019s stage, here\u2019s Fournel on gear changing: \u2018On the flats, I had to learn the merits of going from tooth to tooth. There can be a chasm between 53x16 and 53x17, and as a general rule it\u2019s the wind that carves it out\u2019.\u201d I\u2019ve just started reading that book and it is delightful. On the subject of gear changes, in a bid to shift excess timber, I am planning on getting back on my bike after a long absence. It\u2019s a fancy racer that\u2019s far too good for me, but I recall that the last few times I rode it, the gears kept jumping around without being asked by me. The bike is too new for there to be anything wrong with them - so I presume I\u2019m just not used to them and am using them wrong. Anyone got any pointers as to what I might be doing wrong? 160km to go: The gap from Messrs Offredo and Rossetto to the bunch is 4min 22sec. An email: \u201cDo we no longer name the breakaway on these TDF live blogs or did I miss it?\u201d asks Robert Moore. \u201cIn case I haven\u2019t, I\u2019d like to suggest Offredo &amp; Rossetto - an Italian inspired deli/cafe - possibly in Fulham, definitely overpriced. Do a lovely range of Cannoli though.\u201d Corrections and clarifications: \u201cIt is oilseed rape in the photo below, not barley,\u201d writes Tom Overbury. This happened last year too. Perhaps the Guardian needs an agriculture consultant for the live blogs?\u201d Are you sure about that, Tom? I thought oilseed rape was a lot more yellow?\u201d Bob O\u2019Hara might be able to help. \u201cFor my PhD (a few years ago now) I would spend a lot of time cutting up leaves of barley, so that I could blow mildew spores all over them.\u201d 167km to go: \u201cIn response to Luke Harrison,\u201d writes Banaby Nicholls. \u201cThe latecomers have to watch out for more than the early finishers descending the mountain - when attending stages last summer it was common to see spectators riding and walking down once their favourites had passed. There didn\u2019t appear to be any protocol, but people would take the corners wide and slow. I felt a twang of pity for the slower racers but they didn\u2019t appear to be in any danger.\u201d 169km to go: The peloton is ridiculously strung out and is being towed along by Deceuninck-Quick Step\u2019s Kasper Asgreen. The gap to the breakaway is 4min 06sec. 174km to go: Further to Luke Harrison\u2019s email regarding Tour riders having to cycle back down a mountain they\u2019ve just asccended once the stage is over. In that Mitchelton Scott video diary of yesterday\u2019s stage, Matteo Trentin points out that spectators accompanying them back down can be a problem, as they tend to take risks, presumably in a bid to show off. He carries a whistle around his neck in lieu of a bell to ring, to get them out of his way. This suggest to me they take a different route down to the one the riders go up, presumably on any spare bit of road that is left over once they erect the barriers. 178km to go: The gap from our two-man escape party to the bunch is 4min 20sec. At the back of the peloton, Movistar rider Carlos Verona has just raised his arm to call for assistance from his team car. An email: \u201cI know that on some mountain top finishes, such as yesterday, there is not enough room for the team buses at the top so the riders have to freewheel back down again after finishing,\u201d writes Luke Harrison. \u201cI noticed from the helicopter shot soon after the soon after the leaders finished yesterday that some of them were already starting to head down while the slower riders (most of the race) must still have been making their way up the climb. \u201cWhat is the protocol here to prevent the descending riders going round a bend straight in to a group of ascending riders or an official car? Do the slow guys know that they have to keep to the right side of the road for this reason?\u201d A good question. I\u2019ve seen this happen, but I don\u2019t know what - if any - the protocol is. There may well be some fenced off corridor for the riders who are finished to descend down, but I can\u2019t remember. Perhaps they just rely on good sense and trust that these guys know what they\u2019re doing. Anyone? 186km to go: \u201cLike James Davison I\u2019ve always thought bike racing makes for better written accounts than TV,\u201d writes Martin Gilbert. \u201cThe classic writing comes from the early Tours when the heroism and mystery was preserved by the riders being out of view for long periods. \u201cTim Krabbe captures it well. I\u2019d also recommend Tomorrow We Ride by Jean Bobet- inside knowledge but he\u2019s a proper writer too. The modern Tour is often a bit like watching a travel show with some sport going on. Look at the transcontinental race for a bit of the original Tour spirit.\u201d 188km to go: Yoann Offredo (Wanty-Gobert) and Stephane Rosetto (Cofidis) are 5min 38sec clear of the peloton. Offredo, who has spent an inordinate amount of time in assorted breakaways this week, has got the point on offer at the top of Col de Ferriere, a category four speed-bump. An email: \u201cLong time reader, first time emailer here,\u201d writes Riocard. \u201cJust on the subject of great cycling books, Paul Kimmage\u2019s Rough Ride has to be up there? Perhaps a somewhat controversial choice, but nonetheless a great and revealing read. Also, on the matter of pointless and futile tasks - I work in finance, so I reckon my jobs up there with the most pointless and futile?\u201d 192.5km to go: BIG NEWS!!! Mikael Cherel (AG2R La Mondiale) has just dropped back to his car to change his shoes. Rather impressively, he did so without getting off his bike. 197km to go: Yoann Offredo (Wanty-Gobert) and Stephane Rosetto (Cofidis) are 4min 52sec clear of the bunch. I\u2019m about to abandon my post for five minutes and 52 seconds, which is just enough time for you to enjoy yesterday\u2019s thrilling instalment of the always entertaining Mitchelton Scott Tour diary in my absence. An email: \u201cI also enjoyed Max Leonard\u2019s Higher Calling, his examination of why cyclists feel the need to taste the exquisite pain of riding up higher and higher mountains,\u201d writes Philip Laing. \u201cThe Rider by Tim Krabb\u00e9 is, I think, a semi-autobiographical work of fiction, in turns a rider\u2019s description of an amateur bike race in France and a history of the anonymous rider\u2019s life in cycling. Thoroughly examines the mindset of a racing cyclist, and all the whims and doubts therein. Lastly, I read the Escape Artist, by the Guardian\u2019s Matt Seaton, years ago, a real autobiographical work, taking us through his life on and off the bike, his racing career and his family life, encompassing both triumph and tragedy. It\u2019s stayed with me over the years, which I put down to it\u2019s authentic humanity.\u201d 205km to go: We\u2019re 2,470 or so kilometres from Paris, but just 205 from Chalon-sur-Saone. The gap from the two lads to the other 172 lads is out to 4min 28sec. An email: \u201cI am recording the diameter of craters on a bit of Mars\u2019s surface,\u201d writes Adam Hepburn, who is a PhD candidate in Glaciology. \u201cI take great comfort in knowing that someone else is spending their day watching a screen on which nothing happens for six hours. At least yours vaguely promises some action at the end.\u201d Yours might too, Adam, if a little green man pops up out of one of the craters. OK, we have our challenge for the day - can anyone top the tasks being undertaken by Adam and I this Friday for futility and pointlessness? As mine is guaranteed to liven up at some point, our clubhouse leader is currently recording the diameter of craters on the surface of Mars. That\u2019s going to take some beating. 211km to go: Stephane Rosetto, for anyone who\u2019s interested, began the day in 128th place, over 49 minutes off the pace set by maillot jaune Giulio Ciccone. 214km to go: Arguably the most reluctant two-man breakaway in Tour de France history, Yoann Offredo (Wanty-Gobert) and Stephane Rosetto (Cofidis) are now 3min 50sec clear of the peloton. In 174th place out of the 174 remaining riders, Ofredo is currently the Lanterne Rouge ... which seems as good a time as any to recommend the excellent book of the same name, by Max Leonard. An email (and please keep them coming): \u201cI hope the scenery and roadside antics are able to make up for the lack of sparks today,\u201d writers James Davison. \u201cThe TV commentators will need some content. There was an article the other day about the relaxing nature of watching a stage play out on live television. I\u2019d not thought about it in that way before but makes sense. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought that a bike racing was best reflected in writing (a stage race and long Monument all have their narrative arcs, heroes, villains and intrigue, even apart from the human endeavour, geography, elements etc), and there are no end of cycling books that to me are not far short of literature. Maybe in the quiet periods today we can suggest our favourites \u2013 I\u2019ll kick off with Riding In The Zone Rouge by Tom Isett, recounting the 1919 stage race around the Western Front battlefields.\u201d Maybe in the quiet periods? Today will be 229 kilometres of period, followed by one kilometre of hot sprint action. 223km to go: With the peloton dawdling along at a snail\u2019s pace, Several EF Education First riders hit the deck and Tejay van Garderen takes a while to get to his feet and back on his bike before getting going again. He\u2019s got a cut under his left eye and has clearly clattered his left knee too. He pedals away looking very sorry for himself after hitting the ground hard. 223km to go: We have our breakaway and it\u2019s a reluctant two-man kamikaze mission b eing carried out by Yoann Offredo (Wanty-Gobert) and Stephane Rosetto (Cofidis). They have opened a gap of 1min 57sec on the bunch. 229km to go: Cofidis rider Stephane Rossetto shoots off into the distance, somewhat reluctantly if the way he\u2019s jabbering into his radio is anything to go by. Behind him, Wanty-Gobert rider Yoann Offredo bridges the gap with all the enthusiasm of a condemned man walking to the gallows. He\u2019s obviously under orders from his directeur sportif and keeps looking behind him in something approaching desperation to see if anyone else is coming with him. There are no takers. 230km to go: No, really. There are 230km to go. A point to ponder: Ahead of this stage, the riders will have spent 20 minutes or so warming up on their rollers by the team coaches. They\u2019re now engaged in what is ostensibly another 10-kilometre warm-up before the signal to start racing is given. And once that signal is given, the vast majority of the field will find themselves on what is ostensibly yet another warm-up \u2013 one that is 200 kilometres in length - before it\u2019s time for them to start getting their ducks in a row ahead of the inevitable sprint finish. And what do you know? Once that\u2019s done with and the stage is over ... it\u2019s back to the rollers by the team buses for a warm-down!!!!!!! It all seems rather unecessary to me. I suspect Dave Brailsford, Sky and their small margins have an awful lot to answer for - and I don\u2019t mean the kind of questions they fielded so unconvincingly when called before a government select committee. The roll-out has begun: THe ridfers on their way out of Belfort, going at a gentle pace before the signal to start racing is given by race director Christian Prudhomme. Once he waves his flag, a breakaway group will get away and cycle along on their own for several hours, before getting caught by the bunch ahead of a sprint finish in Chalon-sur-Saone. Schedule: Today\u2019s stage is due to start in 15 minutes or so. At 230 kilometres in length over a largely flat parcours, the Tour organisers have dubbed it \u201cThe Longest Day\u201d - metaphorically and existentially, as well as liteally, one presumes. Barring accidents, police intervention or very strong crosswinds, it\u2019s likely to be an utterly forgettable day\u2019s racing. Don\u2019t touch that dial!!! The Move podcast: Lance Armstrong, George Hincapie and JD look back at stage six in the podcast many cycling and Tour de France aficionados can\u2019t quite decide whether or not it\u2019s OK to like. Stage six review Jeremy Whittle was at La Planche Les Belles Filles to see defending champion Geraint Thomas throw down a marker, as Belgium\u2019s Dylan Teuns won the stage. General Classification after stage six Giulio Ciccone came up agonisingly short on yesterday\u2019s brutal summit finish, but earned himself a day \u2013 and possibly more \u2013 in yellow by way of consolation. William Fotheringham: The longest stage of the Tour follows one of the toughest, but will give the flat-road sprinters another chance. It\u2019s a hilly start, but a very flat run over the final 80km, plus there is a good chance that one of the favourites will have taken yellow the previous day which will lend some structure to the race. The pressure will be felt the most by the older sprinters, led by Andr\u00e9 Greipel, who moved to the small French team Ark\u00e9a-Samsic over the winter but hasn\u2019t produced much, and Cofidis\u2019s Nacer Bouhanni, who has never shone in the Tour.",

Within 41 days Bartoli had retired, at only 28, after losing to Simona Halep in Cincinnati, unable to stand the aggregated pain of a long career, becoming the first Wimbledon champion not to defend her title since the 1969 winner, Ann Jones.</p> <p>The antagonists in the final six years ago handled the aftermath in their own ways. Bartoli contemplated a comeback, thought better of it and found a home in the commentary box, while \u201cBoom Boom\u201d Lisicki, the fastest server in the game between 2014 and 2016 at 130mph, never quite got back the magic. At the Australian Open this year, and only 29, she went out in the first round of qualifying, for the third time on the spin at a slam.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/11/wimbledon-simona-halep-elina-svitolina-semi-final\">Wimbledon 2019: Halep \u2018desperate\u2019 for title after semi-final win over Svitolina</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is a deceptively tough sport, as the finalists on Saturday know too well. Halep began to flower in the years that followed her defeat of Bartoli, to the point where she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/09/simona-halep-wins-french-open-womens-title-sloane-stephens\" title=\"\">won the French Open</a> last year and has reigned as No 1 in the world; Williams\u2019s story is familiar to all, a tale of alternating glory and struggle that would seem to have at least a chapter or two left.</p> <p>What they both share is a lingering fight with their emotions. Until Halep calmed her outer shell over the past couple of years, she was among the most volatile of competitors on the WTA Tour. Williams, as she admitted on Thursday after her best performance of the tournament \u2013 a 59-minute <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/11/serena-williams-barbora-strycova-wimbledon-2019\" title=\"\">demolition of Barbora Strycova</a> \u2013 cannot be sure from day to day how she will handle the pressures and expectations of her calling, even though she is by overwhelming consensus the finest player of her era.</p> <p>Privately, she would agree with that. Good manners prevent her from saying so in public \u2013 and that brings its own baggage. When Williams was in place to record a calendar slam in the latter stages of the 2015 US Open, her emotions ran wild and she collapsed in a lachrymose cloud not dissimilar to the one that enveloped Lisicki, losing in the semi-finals to the Italian doubles artist Roberta Vinci.</p> <p>And last September, again the red mist came down across her furious and disbelieving eyes as she railed against the perceived injustice heaped on her by the chair umpire Carlos Ramos and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/08/serena-williams-rails-at-umpire-as-superb-naomi-osaka-wins-us-open\" title=\"\">lost in the most theatrical exit</a>. This week, in an article in Harper\u2019s Bazaar, she reached out to her Flushing Meadows conqueror, Naomi Osaka, in a reprise of her case against Ramos, blaming the media for the furore.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9402e67cec1816f1107e3fd06307b58bdc220d21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9402e67cec1816f1107e3fd06307b58bdc220d21/0_34_3387_2032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simona Halep\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simona Halep in practice before her first Wimbledon final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now she is returned to another statistical hell \u2013 or heaven, if she wins: victory on Saturday would give Williams her eighth Wimbledon singles title and her 24th major, matching the Australian Margaret Court for the most slams in the history of the sport. That is some achievement \u2013 yet Williams again is trying to downplay its significance, just as she did ahead of her match against Vinci four years ago.</p> <p>She alternates between handling the responsibilities and rewards of greatness and being consumed by them. She should be comforted, though, by the evidence of her progress to the final, which contained only one glaring blip, when she fell over the line in three sets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/09/serena-williams-battles-past-alison-riske-into-wimbledon-semi-finals\" title=\"\">against Alison Riske</a>. Her return to form in the semi-finals against Strycova was astonishing.</p> <p>It could come down to a factor as obvious as the serve \u2013 and Serena, predictably, has a considerable edge here. No one in the draw has hit more than her 45 aces but, for someone who red-lines her power at around 120mph, she has logged surprisingly few double-faults: 11, in fact, which is a risk-reward ratio of about four to one.</p> <p>Halep, however, is tied for 26 on the list with a clutch of others who have fallen, including Coco Gauff, who went out in the fourth round, and Belinda Bencic, a round earlier. But her risk-reward return is way poorer than Williams\u2019s: nine aces, 12 double-faults.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Recap\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Romanian is no slouch with racket in hand, of course, but her fastest serve of the fortnight is 110mph \u2013 fully 12 miles an hour slower than the booming deliveries of her opponent.</p> <p>Once that ball is in play, the return is vital and, if it is to be of any quality coming back at the American, Halep has to be brave, taking it on the rise occasionally, or making sure she delivers a heavy and precise enough blow from deep to keep the exchange alive. Only then is parity possible.</p> <p>She is 15th on the tournament leaderboard for getting her return back, with 83%, and that is healthy. And here is the shock of the numbers: Williams lies tied for 66th in returns with 283 from 383, or 74%. That is exactly a hundred balls she has failed to get back in play when receiving and Halep will have taken that into account, no doubt.</p> <p>After all that, it will be a surprise \u2013 not on the scale of her defeat by Vinci in New York \u2013 if Williams does not stand in the middle of Centre Court as the freshly crowned queen of Wimbledon, and the game itself.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Sabine Lisicki lost the final at Wimbledon to Marion Bartoli in 2013, she could not control the flow of tears that showed her desolation. Within 41 days Bartoli had retired, at only 28, after losing to Simona Halep in Cincinnati, unable to stand the aggregated pain of a long career, becoming the first Wimbledon champion not to defend her title since the 1969 winner, Ann Jones. The antagonists in the final six years ago handled the aftermath in their own ways. Bartoli contemplated a comeback, thought better of it and found a home in the commentary box, while \u201cBoom Boom\u201d Lisicki, the fastest server in the game between 2014 and 2016 at 130mph, never quite got back the magic. At the Australian Open this year, and only 29, she went out in the first round of qualifying, for the third time on the spin at a slam. This is a deceptively tough sport, as the finalists on Saturday know too well. Halep began to flower in the years that followed her defeat of Bartoli, to the point where she won the French Open last year and has reigned as No 1 in the world; Williams\u2019s story is familiar to all, a tale of alternating glory and struggle that would seem to have at least a chapter or two left. What they both share is a lingering fight with their emotions. Until Halep calmed her outer shell over the past couple of years, she was among the most volatile of competitors on the WTA Tour. Williams, as she admitted on Thursday after her best performance of the tournament \u2013 a 59-minute demolition of Barbora Strycova \u2013 cannot be sure from day to day how she will handle the pressures and expectations of her calling, even though she is by overwhelming consensus the finest player of her era. Privately, she would agree with that. Good manners prevent her from saying so in public \u2013 and that brings its own baggage. When Williams was in place to record a calendar slam in the latter stages of the 2015 US Open, her emotions ran wild and she collapsed in a lachrymose cloud not dissimilar to the one that enveloped Lisicki, losing in the semi-finals to the Italian doubles artist Roberta Vinci. And last September, again the red mist came down across her furious and disbelieving eyes as she railed against the perceived injustice heaped on her by the chair umpire Carlos Ramos and lost in the most theatrical exit. This week, in an article in Harper\u2019s Bazaar, she reached out to her Flushing Meadows conqueror, Naomi Osaka, in a reprise of her case against Ramos, blaming the media for the furore. Now she is returned to another statistical hell \u2013 or heaven, if she wins: victory on Saturday would give Williams her eighth Wimbledon singles title and her 24th major, matching the Australian Margaret Court for the most slams in the history of the sport. That is some achievement \u2013 yet Williams again is trying to downplay its significance, just as she did ahead of her match against Vinci four years ago. She alternates between handling the responsibilities and rewards of greatness and being consumed by them. She should be comforted, though, by the evidence of her progress to the final, which contained only one glaring blip, when she fell over the line in three sets against Alison Riske. Her return to form in the semi-finals against Strycova was astonishing. It could come down to a factor as obvious as the serve \u2013 and Serena, predictably, has a considerable edge here. No one in the draw has hit more than her 45 aces but, for someone who red-lines her power at around 120mph, she has logged surprisingly few double-faults: 11, in fact, which is a risk-reward ratio of about four to one. Halep, however, is tied for 26 on the list with a clutch of others who have fallen, including Coco Gauff, who went out in the fourth round, and Belinda Bencic, a round earlier. But her risk-reward return is way poorer than Williams\u2019s: nine aces, 12 double-faults. The Romanian is no slouch with racket in hand, of course, but her fastest serve of the fortnight is 110mph \u2013 fully 12 miles an hour slower than the booming deliveries of her opponent. Once that ball is in play, the return is vital and, if it is to be of any quality coming back at the American, Halep has to be brave, taking it on the rise occasionally, or making sure she delivers a heavy and precise enough blow from deep to keep the exchange alive. Only then is parity possible. She is 15th on the tournament leaderboard for getting her return back, with 83%, and that is healthy. And here is the shock of the numbers: Williams lies tied for 66th in returns with 283 from 383, or 74%. That is exactly a hundred balls she has failed to get back in play when receiving and Halep will have taken that into account, no doubt. After all that, it will be a surprise \u2013 not on the scale of her defeat by Vinci in New York \u2013 if Williams does not stand in the middle of Centre Court as the freshly crowned queen of Wimbledon, and the game itself.",

      "body": "<p>Open days are not just a good opportunity for students; they also give family members an insight into university life. But parents shouldn\u2019t try to \u201crelive their youth\u201d, says James Busson, co-director of student recruitment at the University of Sheffield. Instead, they are there to play a supporting role, to help students learn about a university.</p> <p>So how can you all get the most out of the day?</p> <p>First off, it\u2019s a good idea to plan in advance and to do some research. \u201cMy parents and I avoided a lot of stress by writing an itinerary,\u201d says Rebecca Hansom, 20, a student at Sheffield Hallam University who has also worked as a student ambassador.</p> <p>University guides, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/universityguide\" title=\"\">Guardian University Guide</a>, can help narrow down your options, but once you\u2019ve decided where you want to visit, some specific research will stand you in good stead on the day. Hansom says this could include: researching transport and parking; times and locations of talks, tours and stalls you want to attend; downloading a map of the campus; and putting together a list of questions. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising how many families come to open days without a plan and, as a result, don\u2019t get the most out of it,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>Expect an introductory lecture and course-specific talks, as well as the option to go on tours of the teaching facilities, student union or accommodation \u2013 but don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re a \u201cslave to a schedule\u201d, says Richard Harvey, the academic in charge of admissions at the University of East Anglia (UEA). \u201cIt\u2019s important to chill out, wander around and get a feel for the place.\u201d When you\u2019re walking around, talk to students. They\u2019re \u201cmaybe less guarded\u201d about what they say about the university and local area, says Karen Packham, a consultant and parent who\u2019s been to many open days with her two daughters.</p> <p>\u201cEngage with student ambassadors on forums and ask questions,\u201d says Busson, \u201ceven if it\u2019s just to find out where you get the best fish and chips.\u201d</p> <p>Amy Morton, 23, a recent graduate at the University of Dundee who worked as an ambassador at a number of open days, points out that many university societies have social media accounts on which they will answer questions.</p> <p>When it comes to questions on the day, parents have an important role. \u201cIt\u2019s about helping [your son or daughter] to see the big picture and think about the realities,\u201d Packham says, suggesting parents can encourage young people to think about practical things like financial costs. But it\u2019s not all serious. \u201cOne of the side benefits [of going to open days] was getting to spend one-on-one time with my daughters,\u201d Packham adds.</p> <p>Busson has a word of caution, however: \u201cParents are there to support [students] and not to be the leader.\u201d And Morton says she\u2019s spotted \u201cparents who look bored all day\u201d, which isn\u2019t helpful.</p> <p>Above all, an open day should be enjoyable for all. \u201cIt\u2019s not a competitive event,\u201d says Harvey. \u201cDon\u2019t put yourself under pressure to discover everything. It should be a fun day out.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Timeline</strong></h2> <p><strong>University open days<br></strong><em>June \u2013 October 2019<br></em>Universities mostly hold open days between June and October \u2013 see the <a href=\"www.ucas.com\" title=\"\">Ucas website</a> for full listings.</p> <p><strong>Ucas entry opens<br></strong><em>4 September, 2019<br></em>Students can now submit their application for university, although most wait until closer to the 15 January deadline.

      "bodyText": "Open days are not just a good opportunity for students; they also give family members an insight into university life. But parents shouldn\u2019t try to \u201crelive their youth\u201d, says James Busson, co-director of student recruitment at the University of Sheffield. Instead, they are there to play a supporting role, to help students learn about a university. So how can you all get the most out of the day? First off, it\u2019s a good idea to plan in advance and to do some research. \u201cMy parents and I avoided a lot of stress by writing an itinerary,\u201d says Rebecca Hansom, 20, a student at Sheffield Hallam University who has also worked as a student ambassador. University guides, such as the Guardian University Guide, can help narrow down your options, but once you\u2019ve decided where you want to visit, some specific research will stand you in good stead on the day. Hansom says this could include: researching transport and parking; times and locations of talks, tours and stalls you want to attend; downloading a map of the campus; and putting together a list of questions. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising how many families come to open days without a plan and, as a result, don\u2019t get the most out of it,\u201d she adds. Expect an introductory lecture and course-specific talks, as well as the option to go on tours of the teaching facilities, student union or accommodation \u2013 but don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re a \u201cslave to a schedule\u201d, says Richard Harvey, the academic in charge of admissions at the University of East Anglia (UEA). \u201cIt\u2019s important to chill out, wander around and get a feel for the place.\u201d When you\u2019re walking around, talk to students. They\u2019re \u201cmaybe less guarded\u201d about what they say about the university and local area, says Karen Packham, a consultant and parent who\u2019s been to many open days with her two daughters. \u201cEngage with student ambassadors on forums and ask questions,\u201d says Busson, \u201ceven if it\u2019s just to find out where you get the best fish and chips.\u201d Amy Morton, 23, a recent graduate at the University of Dundee who worked as an ambassador at a number of open days, points out that many university societies have social media accounts on which they will answer questions. When it comes to questions on the day, parents have an important role. \u201cIt\u2019s about helping [your son or daughter] to see the big picture and think about the realities,\u201d Packham says, suggesting parents can encourage young people to think about practical things like financial costs. But it\u2019s not all serious. \u201cOne of the side benefits [of going to open days] was getting to spend one-on-one time with my daughters,\u201d Packham adds. Busson has a word of caution, however: \u201cParents are there to support [students] and not to be the leader.\u201d And Morton says she\u2019s spotted \u201cparents who look bored all day\u201d, which isn\u2019t helpful. Above all, an open day should be enjoyable for all. \u201cIt\u2019s not a competitive event,\u201d says Harvey. \u201cDon\u2019t put yourself under pressure to discover everything. It should be a fun day out.\u201d Timeline University open days June \u2013 October 2019 Universities mostly hold open days between June and October \u2013 see the Ucas website for full listings. Ucas entry opens 4 September, 2019 Students can now submit their application for university, although most wait until closer to the 15 January deadline. Even then, students can apply for 2020 entry until late September (see below). Deadline for Oxbridge applications and most medicine, veterinary medicine, and dentistry courses 15 October, 2019 Oxford, Cambridge, and most medicine, veterinary medicine and dentistry courses have an early deadline. Students can add further choices at a later date. Cambridge and Oxford interviews December 2019 Most interviews take place in the first two (Oxford) to three weeks (Cambridge) of December; offers are made before the end of January. Main deadline \u2013 university applications 15 January, 2020 By now, students should have written and checked personal statements, and can apply to up to five universities. If students want a gap year, they can still apply and ask to defer, but it\u2019s worth checking whether a university will accept this \u2013 most do. Ucas Extra opens 25 February, 2020 Students who\u2019ve used all five choices and haven\u2019t received or accepted any offers can apply for one course at a time through Extra \u2013 it\u2019s available until 4 July. If this doesn\u2019t work out, they can still use clearing. Universities decide 31 March, 2020 Most universities will accept or decline applicants by today, but each has a slightly different admissions process. Applicants now have a few weeks to decide. Accept a place May to June 2020 Mid January applicants must reply to university offers by 5 May \u2013 after which universities may make fresh offers. Students can answer late offers by 18 June at the latest. Applicants can choose whether to accept an insurance choice too \u2013 ideally an offer with lower grades. Student loans (2020 entry) Early 2020 Loans take at least six weeks to process, and students don\u2019t need a confirmed place to apply. Last day for applications (before clearing) 30 June, 2020 (although Extra applicants who don\u2019t hold an offer can apply until 5 July) Students have until the end of July to respond to offers. Clearing opens International Baccalaureate (IB) Results Announced 6 July, 2020 Clearing \u2013 which helps match students to course vacancies \u2013 opens. IB and BTec students and those who know their results and who\u2019ve missed their grades can now apply to some courses through clearing. A-level results announced 13 August, 2020 Those who\u2019ve met their grades can relax; those who haven\u2019t enter clearing and can attend clearing open days. Adjustment (2020 entry) 13 August \u2013 31 August, 2020 Students who\u2019ve done better than expected can use Ucas Adjustment to look around for different courses. Their firm university place remains safe. Last day to apply to university for 2020 entry 21 September, 2020 Last day to enter a new Ucas application for 2020 entry.

By the end England were dancing their way to their first World Cup final in 27 years. Had they forgotten what a serious business this was?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/12/ross-taylor-new-zealand-undersdogs-cricket-world-cup-final-england\">\u2018We enjoy being the underdogs\u2019: Ross Taylor issues England final warning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ostensibly Morgan played a relatively minor role in all this. Earlier in the day Jofra Archer and Chris Woakes tormented the upper order, where Australia\u2019s three major batsmen can be found, of which only Steve Smith could last for long. Adil Rashid delivered his leg-breaks competently and his googlies rather brilliantly. And then Jason Roy and Joe Root batted sublimely in their contrasting styles.</p> <p>Morgan\u2019s contribution was an unbeaten 45 at the end. It was not a beautiful innings, nor an especially significant one given that England were well on the way to winning the game by the time he came to the crease. But it was strangely compelling. There were reminders why Morgan never became a Test regular (he played 16 matches, the last of which was in 2012).</p> <p>Technically Test cricket is not his game. On Thursday he was a wee bit jumpy against the short ball and he was inevitably peppered by Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins upon arrival. He shunned the hook shot which had produced easy top-edged catches earlier in the tournament. He ducked and swayed. He was uncomfortable but certainly not scared. Then he slapped a short ball from Starc over cover and the runs began to flow again; upon the reintroduction of Nathan Lyon he reverse swept to the boundary; he began to advance down the pitch to Jason Behrendorff and he swung \u2013 often to no great effect.</p> <p>His timing was awry for most of that innings. But he kept attacking in what became a tangible sign that his England side was going to stay true to their aggressive instincts whatever the situation. That batting display <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/21/england-sri-lanka-cricket-world-cup-report\" title=\"\">against Sri Lanka at Headingley</a>, tentative at one moment, frenetic the next, had been exorcised. England were back on track.</p> <p>Even the winning runs from Morgan\u2019s bat came from another ugly slap over mid-on. No matter; England had won at a romp. It was time to head for Lord\u2019s and New Zealand. His team was rolling again and Morgan had released the handbrake. The mid-tournament blip had been banished, for which the captain was entitled to take most of the credit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f19f4bf309001033b6e52723ab808abdd483835\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f19f4bf309001033b6e52723ab808abdd483835/0_289_4367_2622/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eoin Morgan reverse sweeps to help England canter to victory over Australia and reach Sunday\u2019s World Cup final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eoin Morgan reverse sweeps to help England canter to victory over Australia and reach Sunday\u2019s World Cup final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morgan is the most influential England captain in decades, no matter that he is in charge exclusively in white-ball cricket. He has the absolute confidence of his team; he always remains calm \u2013 at least he always looks calm \u2013 and he enhances cricketers in his team (Rashid is the obvious example but there are others): he is like Mike Brearley \u2013 plus some runs.</p> <p>In any other sport the captain would not be the only one receiving the plaudits. What of the coach or the manager? Just in case you have forgotten the England coach \u2013 for the next two months only \u2013 is Trevor Bayliss. You might be excused for not knowing this since he seldom makes an appearance except when things are going wrong and even then he does not say much. He has no ego; he would probably be a terrible pundit.</p> <p>The cynics often ask: \u201cWhat does he do?\u201d At practice he can sometimes be spotted sitting on the roller staring into the middle distance for minutes on end. Yet he is among the best of England coaches. Who knows? If England end up winning the World Cup and the Ashes he might be regarded as the best.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/12/cricket-tickets-world-cup-final-prices\">Cricket fans warned over World Cup final tickets as prices reach \u00a316,000</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So what does he do? He gives freedom and responsibility \u2013 to his captain and his players. He does not want any credit and he does not like to intervene too often \u2013 even though he has a deep reservoir of cricketing knowledge. He manages to take the pressure off; he trusts his men and he supports them. He talks to them a bit, but not too much. It sounds simple but it isn\u2019t. He will take some replacing. When England\u2019s \u201cretiring manager\u201d was quizzed by the Today programme after the victory over Australia Bayliss was typically phlegmatic. \u201cWe had a good chat after the game. You can listen too much to the outside noise, whether it\u2019s good or bad.\u201d There would be no new cunning strategy for the final. For him cricket has never been a game of chess orchestrated by the coaches.</p> <p>Of course, England do not have a monopoly in sound leadership as the 12th World Cup final approaches. New Zealand\u2019s Kane Williamson is the polar opposite to Morgan as a batsman. He provides the ballast when his side is batting; it is a burden he bears lightly; he looks so calm at the crease. And so he does in the field, which is where there are parallels with his opposite number at Lord\u2019s on Sunday. His team is probably in awe of him as a batsman; they also trust him as a captain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>New Zealand\u2019s coach played five more Tests than Bayliss \u2013 he represented his country five times in 1999 \u2013 but Gary Stead would struggle to be recognised outside Christchurch.

And the best coaches understand that. We will do well to spot either Bayliss or Stead as the final ceremonies are conducted on Sunday night. Either Morgan or Williamson will be raising the trophy. Both are deserving of that honour.</p>",

Earlier in the day Jofra Archer and Chris Woakes tormented the upper order, where Australia\u2019s three major batsmen can be found, of which only Steve Smith could last for long. Adil Rashid delivered his leg-breaks competently and his googlies rather brilliantly. And then Jason Roy and Joe Root batted sublimely in their contrasting styles. Morgan\u2019s contribution was an unbeaten 45 at the end. It was not a beautiful innings, nor an especially significant one given that England were well on the way to winning the game by the time he came to the crease. But it was strangely compelling. There were reminders why Morgan never became a Test regular (he played 16 matches, the last of which was in 2012). Technically Test cricket is not his game. On Thursday he was a wee bit jumpy against the short ball and he was inevitably peppered by Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins upon arrival. He shunned the hook shot which had produced easy top-edged catches earlier in the tournament. He ducked and swayed. He was uncomfortable but certainly not scared. Then he slapped a short ball from Starc over cover and the runs began to flow again; upon the reintroduction of Nathan Lyon he reverse swept to the boundary; he began to advance down the pitch to Jason Behrendorff and he swung \u2013 often to no great effect. His timing was awry for most of that innings. But he kept attacking in what became a tangible sign that his England side was going to stay true to their aggressive instincts whatever the situation. That batting display against Sri Lanka at Headingley, tentative at one moment, frenetic the next, had been exorcised. England were back on track. Even the winning runs from Morgan\u2019s bat came from another ugly slap over mid-on. No matter; England had won at a romp. It was time to head for Lord\u2019s and New Zealand. His team was rolling again and Morgan had released the handbrake. The mid-tournament blip had been banished, for which the captain was entitled to take most of the credit. Morgan is the most influential England captain in decades, no matter that he is in charge exclusively in white-ball cricket. He has the absolute confidence of his team; he always remains calm \u2013 at least he always looks calm \u2013 and he enhances cricketers in his team (Rashid is the obvious example but there are others): he is like Mike Brearley \u2013 plus some runs. In any other sport the captain would not be the only one receiving the plaudits. What of the coach or the manager? Just in case you have forgotten the England coach \u2013 for the next two months only \u2013 is Trevor Bayliss. You might be excused for not knowing this since he seldom makes an appearance except when things are going wrong and even then he does not say much. He has no ego; he would probably be a terrible pundit. The cynics often ask: \u201cWhat does he do?\u201d At practice he can sometimes be spotted sitting on the roller staring into the middle distance for minutes on end. Yet he is among the best of England coaches. Who knows? If England end up winning the World Cup and the Ashes he might be regarded as the best. So what does he do? He gives freedom and responsibility \u2013 to his captain and his players. He does not want any credit and he does not like to intervene too often \u2013 even though he has a deep reservoir of cricketing knowledge. He manages to take the pressure off; he trusts his men and he supports them. He talks to them a bit, but not too much. It sounds simple but it isn\u2019t. He will take some replacing. When England\u2019s \u201cretiring manager\u201d was quizzed by the Today programme after the victory over Australia Bayliss was typically phlegmatic. \u201cWe had a good chat after the game. You can listen too much to the outside noise, whether it\u2019s good or bad.\u201d There would be no new cunning strategy for the final. For him cricket has never been a game of chess orchestrated by the coaches. Of course, England do not have a monopoly in sound leadership as the 12th World Cup final approaches. New Zealand\u2019s Kane Williamson is the polar opposite to Morgan as a batsman. He provides the ballast when his side is batting; it is a burden he bears lightly; he looks so calm at the crease. And so he does in the field, which is where there are parallels with his opposite number at Lord\u2019s on Sunday. His team is probably in awe of him as a batsman; they also trust him as a captain. New Zealand\u2019s coach played five more Tests than Bayliss \u2013 he represented his country five times in 1999 \u2013 but Gary Stead would struggle to be recognised outside Christchurch. I assume he is a fine coach. But I don\u2019t know that. One of the features of this World Cup, which applies to most good cricket teams, is that the captain remains the man in charge. And the best coaches understand that. We will do well to spot either Bayliss or Stead as the final ceremonies are conducted on Sunday night. Either Morgan or Williamson will be raising the trophy. Both are deserving of that honour.",

One set all with Roberto Bautista Agut, Djokovic broke to lead 4-2 in the third set but found himself 15-40 down, two chances for the Spaniard to get back on serve. The first came and went quickly but on the second, Djokovic went into brick wall mode, moving side to side with the effortlessness of a ballet dancer, refusing to miss. Backhand to backhand they went until finally, when Djokovic had manoeuvred his man wide on the court, he unleashed a stunning backhand down the line to win it on the 45th stroke of the rally.</p> \n<p>Djokovic put his finger to his ear, the applause ringing around Centre Court in recognition of his resilience, fitness, stamina and mental strength. Sometimes one point can make all the difference and that epic rally was it.

      "bodyText": "If anyone wanted to know what makes Novak Djokovic such a great champion then one point in his semi-final summed it up perfectly. One set all with Roberto Bautista Agut, Djokovic broke to lead 4-2 in the third set but found himself 15-40 down, two chances for the Spaniard to get back on serve. The first came and went quickly but on the second, Djokovic went into brick wall mode, moving side to side with the effortlessness of a ballet dancer, refusing to miss. Backhand to backhand they went until finally, when Djokovic had manoeuvred his man wide on the court, he unleashed a stunning backhand down the line to win it on the 45th stroke of the rally. Djokovic put his finger to his ear, the applause ringing around Centre Court in recognition of his resilience, fitness, stamina and mental strength. Sometimes one point can make all the difference and that epic rally was it. Not too long later, Djokovic was back in the locker-room, a 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 winner and into the Wimbledon final for the sixth time in his career. Four times the champion here, including 12 months ago, victory on Sunday would lift him alongside Bjorn Borg, Pete Sampras and Roger Federer as the only men to win the title five times or more in the Open era. It is his 25th grand slam final and he is one win away from a 16th grand slam title, nudging him ever closer to Federer (20) and Rafael Nadal (18) on the all-time list. \u201cWinning that game was crucial for me, gave me more confidence and relief and I could swing more freely,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cI had to dig deep.

      "bodyText": "A 17-year-old boy has been dramatically cleared of murdering a private school pupil in an affluent suburb of Greater Manchester. The teenager, who cannot be named, was accused of stabbing to death his friend Yousef Makki, 17, following a botched attempt to rob a drug dealer. There were angry scenes in Manchester crown court as the defendant, referred to as Boy A, was found not guilty of both murder and manslaughter. Makki\u2019s father, Ghaleb Makki, exploded in fury and shouted expletives as the judge cleared the courtroom. \u201cWhere\u2019s the justice for my son? Where\u2019s the justice?\u201d he asked. Another voice was heard saying, \u201cAre you joking?\u201d as the verdicts were returned. Makki later reportedly collapsed in the public gallery. Boy A puffed out his cheeks and closed his eyes as he was acquitted before hugging his tearful family. A second 17-year-old, Boy B, who was not charged with murder or manslaughter, was cleared of perverting the course of justice. The trial heard that Makki was stabbed in the heart with a flickknife after getting into an argument with his friends in the upmarket village of Hale Barns, a suburb popular with footballers and television stars. Makki, who came from an Anglo-Lebanese family and lived in Burnage, had won a scholarship to attend Manchester Grammar school, and had dreamed of becoming a heart surgeon. On 2 March, Makki was with the two defendants when they made a botched attempt to buy \u00a345 worth of cannabis on a farm track. Boy A was attacked and had his bicycle thrown over a hedge. Boy A then later pushed Makki, who called him a \u201cpussy\u201d and punched him in the face, the court heard. The defendant told the jury Makki pulled out a knife and he responded by also taking out a knife, then accidentally stabbed his friend. Boy A then got rid of the knives before, in a panic, realising how serious the injury was, trying to staunch the blood pouring from his wounded friend\u2019s chest as he lay dying in the street. Boy A\u2019s barrister, Alastair Webster QC, told the jury that the two teenage defendants led \u201cdouble lives\u201d and that, despite being from privileged backgrounds, they spoke and acted like \u201cmiddle class gangsters\u201d. Calling each other \u201cBro\u201d and \u201cFam\u201d, the defendants smoked cannabis, listened to rap or drill music and Boy A posted videos on social media posing with his \u201cshanks\u201d or knives. Wesbter said: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with a whole generation of children with the advantage of good families and good education?

      "body": "<h2>CROUCH END</h2> <p>Of all the English language\u2019s most welcome word pairings \u2013 including \u201ccut price\u201d, \u201cextra strength\u201d and \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d \u2013 the one most likely to raise a smile among football folks might just be \u201cPeter Crouch\u201d. So tears welled in more than a few bleary eyes when dear ol\u2019 Crouchie announced that, at the age of 76, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/12/peter-crouch-retires-from-football\">he has decided to call time</a> on a playing career that spanned more than two decades, 11 clubs, 42 England caps and 7,435 urgent phone calls from \u2018Arry Redknapp.</p> <p>\u201cAfter a lot of deliberation this summer I have decided to retire from football!\u201d declared Crouch on Social Media Atrocity Twitter, adding: \u201cIf you told me at 17 I\u2019d play in World Cups, get to a [Big Cup] final, win the FA Cup and get 100 Premier League goals, I would have avoided you at all costs.\u201d But that\u2019s the thing about Crouch: he confounded expectations from the start. He turned out to be the gawky-looking striker with a velvet touch, the beanpole who had a sideline in bicycle kicks, the giant who could only outjump a Trinidad &amp; Tobago defender by pulling his hair. Most endearingly of all, the so-called \u201cfreak\u201d had an everyman appeal to go with his exceptional ability.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/12/peter-crouch-retires-from-football\">Peter Crouch retires from football at the age of 38</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ultimately, Crouch made the people who ridiculed him look silly without ever taking himself too seriously. He became a style icon and a dance master. He even produced one of the greatest quotes ever given by a self-deprecating sportsman when, asked what he would have been were he not a footballer, he replied famously, deadpan as you like: \u201cThe Fiver.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis former footballer has had the time of his life, it\u2019s time to write the next chapters,\u201d he concluded, leaving us to speculate as to what he might go on to do. He is already active in the media and it is easy to envisage him becoming another of those pleasant pundits who combines knowledge with wit, a Lanky Ally McCoist, a Blonde Ian Wright, Not Danny Mills. But it is also simple to imagine him presenting a range of programmes that have nothing to with football, becoming a sort of Likable Jeremy Clarkson, a Drinking Man\u2019s Louis Theroux, Not Danny Mills. Then again, maybe he will eschew all work and while away his days watching TV, a happy Crouch Potato. Whatever, ol\u2019 Crouchie has the world at his feet, which is right where he needs it because, yes, he has a good touch for a big man.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cRoy went on: \u2018One week I look at you and you\u2019re controlling the game, the next week I can\u2019t find you on the pitch, but it\u2019s OK because I don\u2019t blame you, I blame your parents for the way they brought you up.\u2019 It depends how the lad takes it but everyone is different. The last lad he went to, [he said]: \u2018Do you want to be a footballer, or do you want to collect p1ss for a living like that fella?\u2019 And all you see is the drug tester in the corner and the poor fella didn\u2019t know what was going on\u201d \u2013 former Ipswich keeper Brian Murphy offers a little insight into Roy Keane\u2019s renowned man-management skills.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"648970357468f228ace08a428f908dd581bf14ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/648970357468f228ace08a428f908dd581bf14ee/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Underwhelming views of drug testers, earlier.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Underwhelming views of drug testers, earlier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niall Carson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> <p>\u201cGood to see Jonathan Wilson on the lineup for <a href=\"https://www.latitudefestival.com/line-up/\">Latitude</a>.

      "bodyText": "CROUCH END Of all the English language\u2019s most welcome word pairings \u2013 including \u201ccut price\u201d, \u201cextra strength\u201d and \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d \u2013 the one most likely to raise a smile among football folks might just be \u201cPeter Crouch\u201d. So tears welled in more than a few bleary eyes when dear ol\u2019 Crouchie announced that, at the age of 76, he has decided to call time on a playing career that spanned more than two decades, 11 clubs, 42 England caps and 7,435 urgent phone calls from \u2018Arry Redknapp. \u201cAfter a lot of deliberation this summer I have decided to retire from football!\u201d declared Crouch on Social Media Atrocity Twitter, adding: \u201cIf you told me at 17 I\u2019d play in World Cups, get to a [Big Cup] final, win the FA Cup and get 100 Premier League goals, I would have avoided you at all costs.\u201d But that\u2019s the thing about Crouch: he confounded expectations from the start. He turned out to be the gawky-looking striker with a velvet touch, the beanpole who had a sideline in bicycle kicks, the giant who could only outjump a Trinidad &amp; Tobago defender by pulling his hair. Most endearingly of all, the so-called \u201cfreak\u201d had an everyman appeal to go with his exceptional ability. Ultimately, Crouch made the people who ridiculed him look silly without ever taking himself too seriously. He became a style icon and a dance master. He even produced one of the greatest quotes ever given by a self-deprecating sportsman when, asked what he would have been were he not a footballer, he replied famously, deadpan as you like: \u201cThe Fiver.\u201d \u201cThis former footballer has had the time of his life, it\u2019s time to write the next chapters,\u201d he concluded, leaving us to speculate as to what he might go on to do. He is already active in the media and it is easy to envisage him becoming another of those pleasant pundits who combines knowledge with wit, a Lanky Ally McCoist, a Blonde Ian Wright, Not Danny Mills. But it is also simple to imagine him presenting a range of programmes that have nothing to with football, becoming a sort of Likable Jeremy Clarkson, a Drinking Man\u2019s Louis Theroux, Not Danny Mills. Then again, maybe he will eschew all work and while away his days watching TV, a happy Crouch Potato. Whatever, ol\u2019 Crouchie has the world at his feet, which is right where he needs it because, yes, he has a good touch for a big man. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cRoy went on: \u2018One week I look at you and you\u2019re controlling the game, the next week I can\u2019t find you on the pitch, but it\u2019s OK because I don\u2019t blame you, I blame your parents for the way they brought you up.\u2019 It depends how the lad takes it but everyone is different. The last lad he went to, [he said]: \u2018Do you want to be a footballer, or do you want to collect p1ss for a living like that fella?\u2019 And all you see is the drug tester in the corner and the poor fella didn\u2019t know what was going on\u201d \u2013 former Ipswich keeper Brian Murphy offers a little insight into Roy Keane\u2019s renowned man-management skills. FIVER LETTERS \u201cGood to see Jonathan Wilson on the lineup for Latitude. Can the revellers expect some red-hot Afcon chat before Primal Scream take to the stage, or an in-depth look at tactics in the Colombian second division from 1982? I, for one, cannot wait to find out\u201d \u2013 Tim Woods. \u201cGoing to keep this brief but how can you be an \u2018ex-Notts County\u2019 fan (yesterday\u2019s letters)? You\u2019re either a fan or you\u2019re not \u2013 it\u2019s neither negotiable nor optional. So sayeth the Morton fan\u201d \u2013 Alistair Moffat. \u201cRe: yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters. On the subject of Guy Robert\u2019s Fiver appearing in his \u2018Promotion\u2019 folder: it used to crop up in mine, too, until I set up my email inbox in such a way that it would be automatically diverted into my own bespoke \u2018Relegation\u2019 folder, and suddenly all seemed right with the world again\u201d \u2013 DH Cauthery (and 1,056 others). \u201cI strongly object to the inclusion of Matt Richman\u2019s missive (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters).

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS A member of Manchester United\u2019s backroom team has been taken to hospital after falling ill on the tour of Australia before the club\u2019s pre-season friendly against Perth Glory.

Hilarious., 5:B - Hingis is the youngest winner of any senior title at Wimbledon. She was only 15 years and 282 days old when she won the doubles in 1996. And she won the singles a year later. No pressure, Coco., 6:C - Crouch had already scored twice when the penalty was awarded in the 81st minute, so he took the ball and stepped up to complete what would be his first \u2013&nbsp;and perhaps only \u2013 hat-trick for England. He chipped the ball towards the goal but, instead of watching it sail into the net, he looked on in horror as it flew over the bar. \u201cIt was highly embarrassing,\u201d said Crouch later. \u201cWhen that penalty went over, I thought to myself I\u2019m never going to have another chance to score a hat-trick for my country again and I\u2019ve just tried a Panenka. I felt like the biggest knob.\u201d It looked as if his chance to score a hat-trick for England had gone but, with one minute left to play, he scored again. \u201cThank God the ball came to me, I finished off and got my hat-trick. Thankfully I\u2019ve got that moment and can show my kids the ball and say that I\u2019ve scored a hat-trick for England. I almost didn\u2019t have that just from being stupid.\u201d, 7:B - And yet, for a big man, he really was good with his feet., 8:B - The World Cup begins on Friday in Liverpool, with Australia (nicknamed the Diamonds) favourites to retain their trophy., 9:B - The total prize money was \u00a31,700. It is now \u00a38.5m. , 10:B - He was a big Beckham fan in the early days, saying: \"I liked him a lot. He was my idol. That\u2019s why I wear a long-sleeved jersey and the No7. He had a lot of class on and off the pitch. That\u2019s what I liked about him.

I think all glass-blowers might be jerks.

That example is real, by the way. One of the contestants really did try to filter the totality of the decades-long Aids crisis into a lump of curly glass. And this brings me to my absolute favourite thing about Blown Away; the utter, nonstop, turbocharged, million-percent, face-melting pretension of it all. A huge part of glass-blowing, which I didn\u2019t even realise until now, is the ability to name your work after some sort of potentially seminal lost prog rock album. At one point, someone announces that they\u2019ve made something called No Peace Without Struggle. Another names their piece A Framework for Unconditional Inspiration. Then there\u2019s Lachrymatory View (For Cleo), and Existential Awakening, and \u2013 my favourite \u2013 a rudimentary cartoonish killer whale simply entitled Duality. It\u2019s so ridiculous. The whole thing is so hilariously ridiculous. Oh God, please watch this. Someone please watch Blown Away with me. It is one of the most absurd things I have ever seen. I really do need to talk to someone about it as soon as possible. Please?",

But there are a couple of caveats worth mentioning in the form of erratic factors. First, German car production, which has been highly volatile recently, rose by 7.4% m-o-m. Second, there was a 3.6% m-o-m increase in transport equipment output in France, possibly relating to aircraft production, which can be lumpy. Strength in both these sub-categories is unlikely to be sustained in June. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the broader trend remains soft. The level of production in the eurozone, Germany and Italy is still below levels seen at the start of 2018. And output would need to grow by 0.2% in June - despite the possible unwinding of erratic factors - to achieve positive growth in Q2 as a whole. What\u2019s more, the eurozone manufacturing PMI remains in contractionary territory, notably in June where world trade tensions escalated - that could pose a risk to the \u2018hard\u2019 data in the coming months .</p> <p>In other words, one swallow doesn\u2019t make a summer.

Currently, the Bank\u2019s Inflation Report conditions its inflation and output growth forecasts on two alternative scenarios: (a) the current interest rate (which stays the same in the future) and (b) an interest rate moving up or down in line with the expectations of financial markets. </p> <p>Nevertheless, as my colleague Michael Ellington and I have <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/future-path-interest-rates/\">recently argued</a>, the Bank\u2019s forecasting record under the assumption of constant interest rates is pretty weak. The same holds under the assumption of interest rates moving in line with market expectations.</p> <p>Even worse, market expectations of interest rates are often at odds with the Bank\u2019s repeated message that interest rates will rise gradually over the next 2 to 3 years. </p> <p>With this in mind, the Bank is currently facing an embarrassing situation where it produces forecasts based on what others (the markets, that is) believe.

      "bodyText": "The big corporate news of the day is that Thomas Cook is in advanced talks to receive a \u00a3750m bailout from its largest shareholder - China\u2019s Fosun - and its main bank lenders. The equity injection would allow the debt-ridden travel company continue trading through winter. Chief executive Peter Fankhauser said that while it wasn\u2019t the desired outcome, it was the only option left. Existing shareholdings will be diluted, and shares hit a record low of 7p. On the economics front, there was very little data today, but Bank of England rate-setter Gertjan Vlieghe made up for it by telling an audience in London that interest rates might have to be cut to virtually zero in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He also said that the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee - of which he is one of nine members - should publish its own preferred interest rate, rather than continue to make market expectations the focus of its forecasts. The business secretary Greg Clark issued his own no-deal Brexit warning, telling fellow Conservatives to do all they can to avoid it. If they don\u2019t, \u201cmany thousands\u201d of UK jobs will be lost, he said. Markets in the US have hit fresh record highs on heightened expectations of an imminent rate cut, and that has boosted sentiment in Europe too. That said, the FTSE 100 is up just three points, or 0.04%, at 7,512. That\u2019s all for today, thank you for all the comments and do join us again on Monday. Have a good weekend. AM US producer prices picked up by just 0.1% June, suggesting wider inflationary pressures are weak, according to Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics: The small gain in producer prices in June suggests the increase in tariffs on $200bn of imports from China has yet to generate a pick-up in inflation and confirms that underlying domestic inflationary pressures remain subdued. That should help ease any fears, following the June CPI figures released yesterday, that underlying consumer price inflation will rise back above 2%. Wall Street is open and the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 have both hit record highs, after comments from Fed chairman Jerome Powell boosted expectations of a US rate cut this month. Dow Jones: +0.2% at 27,139 S&amp;P 500: 0.1% at 3,003 Nasdaq: 0.2% at 8,209 Figures published earlier showed industrial production in the eurozone increased by 0.9% in May, beating economists\u2019 expectations of a 0.2% rise. Chris Hare, economist at HSBC, said that although it was better than expected, the broader trend remains soft. He says: Good news is good news, and it\u2019s fair to say that May\u2019s bounce in the eurozone ... was materially stronger than we had expected. But there are a couple of caveats worth mentioning in the form of erratic factors. First, German car production, which has been highly volatile recently, rose by 7.4% m-o-m. Second, there was a 3.6% m-o-m increase in transport equipment output in France, possibly relating to aircraft production, which can be lumpy. Strength in both these sub-categories is unlikely to be sustained in June. Meanwhile, the broader trend remains soft. The level of production in the eurozone, Germany and Italy is still below levels seen at the start of 2018. And output would need to grow by 0.2% in June - despite the possible unwinding of erratic factors - to achieve positive growth in Q2 as a whole. What\u2019s more, the eurozone manufacturing PMI remains in contractionary territory, notably in June where world trade tensions escalated - that could pose a risk to the \u2018hard\u2019 data in the coming months . In other words, one swallow doesn\u2019t make a summer. And we want to see a more sustained recovery to feel confident that headwinds from global trade weakness will not prove too damaging. We suspect the ECB will take a similar view. A cryptocurrency exchange in Tokyo has halted services after it lost $32m (\u00a325m) in the latest apparent hack on volatile virtual monies. Full story here: Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe has won support today for suggesting the MPC should publish its own preferred interest rate, rather than focusing its forecasts on the market\u2019s expectations for rates. Professor Costas Milas of Liverpool University\u2019s Management School, has written in on the point: MPC Member Gertjan Vlieghe suggested that the Bank of England\u2019s Inflation Report should publish its preferred path of interest rates. Currently, the Bank\u2019s Inflation Report conditions its inflation and output growth forecasts on two alternative scenarios: (a) the current interest rate (which stays the same in the future) and (b) an interest rate moving up or down in line with the expectations of financial markets. Nevertheless, as my colleague Michael Ellington and I have recently argued, the Bank\u2019s forecasting record under the assumption of constant interest rates is pretty weak. The same holds under the assumption of interest rates moving in line with market expectations. Even worse, market expectations of interest rates are often at odds with the Bank\u2019s repeated message that interest rates will rise gradually over the next 2 to 3 years. With this in mind, the Bank is currently facing an embarrassing situation where it produces forecasts based on what others (the markets, that is) believe. Would it not make more sense for the Bank to provide forecasts based on what it actually thinks itself as the most appropriate interest rate? Deutsche Bank has scaled back its redundancy packages for laid off City workers, according to a report in Financial News. The German bank is offering less generous terms compared with previous rounds of redundancy, the report claims: Deutsche is offering staff affected by its latest round of sweeping job cuts a package of statutory redundancy pay plus a one-off payment of less than 10% of salary, according to people familiar with matter. They are also being paid for notice periods \u2014 typically three months \u2014 which is taxable. Those in the first wave have received less than the German lender has historically paid out, according to people affected and recruiters. Deutsche has traditionally paid a lump sum that amounts to around a month\u2019s salary for every year of service, former staff at the bank and employment lawyers told Financial News. Deutsche Bank chief executive Christian Sewing has spoken out after it emerged that top executives at its City of London office were fitted for \u00a312,000 suits on the day that thousands of the bank\u2019s staff lost their jobs. Tailors from Fielding &amp; Nicholson, an upmarket tailor, were pictured walking out of the bank\u2019s office with suit bags on Monday. The men were initially assumed to be workers who had been made redundant. Sewing told the German newspaper Handelsblatt that he had personally reprimanded those executives involved: That someone would let a tailor come on such a day is disrespectful. In no way is this behaviour in keeping with our values. I assume in any case that the two colleagues will not forget my telephone call. The business secretary Greg Clark has urged his fellow Conservatives to do everything possible to avoid a no-deal Brexit, warning that it would lead to the loss of \u201cmany thousands\u201d of jobs. He said MPs should \u201cstrain every sinew\u201d to avoid crashing out of the EU under the next prime minister, with leadership rivals Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt both saying they would be prepared to leave the bloc on 31 October without a deal. He told Sky News: It\u2019s evident that if you have the disruption that comes from a no-deal Brexit there will be people that will lose their jobs. It\u2019s many thousands of jobs. Everyone knows that. I think every person that considers the evidence that companies have given \u2013 whether it\u2019s in the automotive sector, whether it\u2019s in the food sector, whether it\u2019s in aerospace, in industries up and down the country \u2013 you know if you become less efficient and your ability to trade is impeded, then of course losing your competitiveness means there will be jobs lost. Equity markets are fairly subdued across Europe this morning: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,530 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.1% at 12,322 France\u2019s CAC: +0.5% at 5,577 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.3% at 22,237 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.1% at 9,289 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: It\u2019s fair to say there hasn\u2019t been a huge response from currency traders to Vlieghe\u2019s speech and his assertion that UK interest rates could be cut to virtually zero in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The pound is up 0.07% against the dollar at $1.2535, and up 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1131. The full speech from MPC member Gertjan Vlieghe: Gertjan Vlieghe\u2019s speech this morning was ostensibly about how the Bank of England could improve its communication of monetary policy to the wider public. He said the Monetary Policy Committee should publish its own preferred interest rate, rather than continue to make market expectations the focus of its forecasts. I have argued today that publishing an MPC forecast based on a preferred path for policy, rather than based on a market path, would be a further improvement in our communications. Our current forecasting approach is unnecessarily complex, and at times, the growth and inflation forecasts are not consistent with the MPC\u2019s objectives, and not consistent with the MPC\u2019s intended actions. Publishing an outlook for growth and inflation consistent with the MPC\u2019s best collective view of the preferred path of interest rates would be easier for us to communicate and easier for others to understand. Since many other central banks have, by now, preceded us in this approach, we have been able to learn from their experience that commonly perceived problems with the preferred path approach can be overcome or have not materialised elsewhere. The Bank of England might have to cut interest rates to virtually zero if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal, and it is not clear how long it would take for them to rise again. That is the verdict of Gertjan Vlieghe, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee. Speaking at the London office of Thomas Reuters, Vlieghe said: On balance I think it is more likely that I would move to cut Bank Rate towards the effective lower bound of close to 0% in the event of a no-deal scenario. It is highly uncertain when I would want to reverse these interest rate cuts. Interest rates are already ultra low, at 0.75%, but the record low was 0.25% in the aftermath of the Brexit aftermath, when the MPC felt an emergency response was necessary. The Guardian\u2019s Kalyeena Makortoff reports: The boss of Thomas Cook has been speaking to journalists and insists a deal with Fosun is the best (and only?) option to keep the company trading. It is not clear what, if any, impact the reorganisation of the group will have on its 22,000 employees, but Peter Fankhauser said he could offer no guarantees: That is up to Fosun then to decide... the priority is no to complete the recapitalisation of the business. What happens to jobs? Today\u2019s announcement is really about a plan that ensures the business to continue to trade and operate as normal, and the deal preserves our brand with a sustainable balance sheet, giving us the stability to invest and grow our business. So that is principally really good news for our employees, that is a very sensitive discussions to get to this point, what we have announced today so we did not engage with wider stakeholders like unions, which will happen now. Here\u2019s our full story on Thomas Cook: To put Thomas Cook\u2019s woes into context, it has a market value of around \u00a3200m and net debts of \u00a31.25bn. As Neil Wilson, chief analyst at markets.com, says, \u201cit\u2019s desperate times\u201d. He adds: Thomas Cook largest shareholder Fosun is in advanced talks with management over a deal that would effectively hand over the company to the Chinese firm. Shareholders face significant dilution \u2013 basically it\u2019s wipe out time. They can take part in the recapitalisation alongside Fosun should they so choose... News of a deal with Fosun has gone down badly with investors and Thomas Cook shares have hit a record low of 7.5p in early trading, down 44%. Under the terms of the deal, the shareholding of existing investors will be diluted. The sell off also reflects the cautious tone from Thomas Cook, which highlighted an uncertain consumer backdrop, \u201cparticularly in the UK\u201d. It expects earnings in the second half of the year to be behind the same period last year. The holiday group also cancelled its third-quarter trading update: All future reporting dates, as previously disclosed, are now under review pending the outcome of the recapitalisation of the Group. As a result, the third quarter trading update originally scheduled for 18 July 2019 is cancelled. Fosun has issued a statement on its plans to inject capital and take a bigger stake in Thomas Cook: Fosun is a shareholder in Thomas Cook, because it is a British company operating in the global travel industry, in which we have extensive experience. We are committed investors, with a proven track record of turning around iconic brands including ClubMed and Wolverhampton Wanderers FC. Thomas Cook boss Peter Fankhauser has been speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme and says a deal with Fosun is the \u201cbest available option for us\u201d. He added: It secures the value for our employees, for our suppliers and as well for our customers and that is the main focus that we have. This is a very good option to secure the business and to put the business on the solid financial footing for the future. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Thomas Cook has confirmed this morning that is in talks with its largest shareholder and the owner of Club Med, China\u2019s Fosun, over a rescue deal. Britain\u2019s oldest package holiday company, which has been struggling with a large debt pile and weaker trading, said it was in \u201cadvanced discussions\u201d with Fosun, which -together with Thomas Cook\u2019s core lending banks - inject \u00a3750m into the firm, allowing it to keep trading over the winter season. The deal would give Fosun a large majority of the tour operator business and a large minority stake in its airline, diluting the shareholding of existing investors. Chief executive Peter Fankhauser said the deal would secure a future for the business, its customers and its employees: After evaluating a broad range of options to reduce our debt and to put our finances onto a more sustainable footing, the board has decided to move forward with a plan to recapitalise the business, supported by a substantial injection of new money from our long-standing shareholder, Fosun, and our core lending banks. While this is not the outcome any of us wanted for our shareholders, this proposal is a pragmatic and responsible solution which provides the means to secure the future of the Thomas Cook business for our customers, our suppliers and our employees.

Disney\u2019s main strategy over the last 15 years has been to pay big money for top-of-the-range franchises and exploit them ruthlessly. \u201cThere are always going to be ups and downs, and studios prefer to bet on tried-and-tested properties with huge fanbases,\u201d says Kay. \u201cDisney has more of them than any other studio, and they are sparing no expense in marketing and distributing them globally.\u201d</p> <p>Disney\u2019s clout has just taken a further giant leap: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/20/disney-seals-71bn-deal-for-21st-century-fox-as-it-prepares-to-take-on-netflix\">in March they swallowed one of their biggest rivals, Fox</a>, a fellow member of the elite \u201cbig six\u201d Hollywood studios.

No Fox projects have yet shown up on Disney\u2019s release slate, but the threat of a decreasingly competitive studio system is preoccupying Hollywood. \u201cDisney can take its pick of the Fox properties and develop them,\u201d says Kay. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly not great for competitors when one company dominates market share so aggressively, but the other studios have their hits, too \u2013 just not as frequently as Disney.

Considered a relatively small, independent operator for much of its early existence as a producer of family-oriented animation, Disney was not considered to possess \u201cmajor\u201d studio status until the mid-80s, after Michael Eisner became CEO. Founder Walt Disney had embraced spinoffs and ancillary marketing much earlier, encapsulated in his <a href=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2013/05/disney-2.jpeg\">famous hand-drawn \u201csynergy map\u201d</a><a href=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2013/05/disney-2.jpeg\"> of 1957</a>, which illustrated his films\u2019 place at the heart of cross-media product lines. Via a network of theme parks, TV channels and merchandising, Disney instinctively understood, perhaps even pioneered, what we now think of as the \u201cmovie universe\u201d. In the early 80s, <a href=\"http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/the-walt-disney-company-history/\">theme parks accounted for 70% of the Disney\u2019s income</a>; in 2018, the company reported that <a href=\"https://www.thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-earnings-for-fiscal-2018/\">non-studio activities made up over 83% of its $59.4bn total revenue</a>.</p> <p>The current swath of live-action remakes also harks back to an early Disney strategy, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254942/disney-vault-streaming-service-plus-animated-live-action\">its \u201cvault\u201d programme</a>, where it would briefly re-release its most popular classic films every few years to attract a new generation of children as the previous one grew out of them. Having scored a massive commercial hit with the Tim Burton-directed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/04/alice-in-wonderland-review\">Alice in Wonderland</a> in 2010, Disney embarked on a string of similar \u201creimaginings\u201d: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/28/maleficent-review-angelina-jolie-sleeping-beauty-horns-vinegar\">Maleficent</a> (a Sleeping Beauty reboot), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/26/cinderella-review-kenneth-branagh-cate-blanchett\">Cinderella</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/03/beauty-and-the-beast-review-emma-watson-disney\">Beauty and the Beast</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/12/the-jungle-book-review\">The Jungle Book</a>. By this time next year we will have had The Lion King, Lady and the Tramp and Mulan \u2013 the latter, in particular, aimed at the increasingly lucrative Chinese box office.</p> <p>But Disney\u2019s rivals aren\u2019t simply the other Hollywood studios: its main opposition is the streaming giant Netflix, which it is taking aim at with its own streaming service, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/12/disney-plus-new-streaming-service-launched-with-marvel-and-star-wars-spin-offs\">Disney+</a>. By producing large numbers of films and earning income through subscriptions rather than tickets, Netflix has launched a successful assault on standard film-industry practice and put Hollywood on the back foot. But the studios, led by Disney, are now responding by setting up their own rival services and keeping their products for themselves.</p> <p>\u201cNetflix has that first-mover advantage,\u201d says Kay, \u201cand it will be hard for anyone to overtake its huge subscriber base of around 150 million worldwide.<strong> </strong>But Netflix also has a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/may/30/netflix-to-raise-prices-for-uk-subscribers\">huge debt load</a>, and needs to make compelling original content or risk losing subscribers to these other platforms. Disney has the great brands and back catalogue to put in its service. It\u2019s an arms race.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2cd9aa3904149070176438c91baa4dda8d6fdd5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cd9aa3904149070176438c91baa4dda8d6fdd5e/0_0_1911_782/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Revamped classic \u2026 Beauty and the Beast.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"409\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Revamped classic \u2026 Beauty and the Beast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Walt Disney Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What makes a Disney hit?</h2> <p><strong>Superheroes</strong><br>More than anything else, caped-and-Spandexed crusaders ballast the modern all-ages movie.

Star Wars now covers pretty much identical turf. It\u2019ll be a long time before Hollywood gets tired of it all.</p> <p><strong>Feminism</strong><br>Over the decades the traditional Disney princess has come in for a lot of flak, and recently the company has taken steps to reconfigure its female characters into kickass, self-reliant heroes. Moana, Elsa, Merida, Elastigirl, even Judy Hopps (from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/03/zootopia-zootropolis-zoomania-review-disney\">Zootopia</a>) are not people you want to mess with.</p> <p><strong>Friendship and family</strong><br>In ditching its submissive female characters, Disney has also moved away from the boy-meets-girl, princess-meets-prince blueprint.

The Emma Watson Beauty and the Beast is still the old-fashioned fairytale.</p> <p><strong>Stars</strong><br>In the age of the effects-heavy franchise we are often told the movie star is dead. But that\u2019s not quite the case: Marvel movies make a lot of famous actors even more famous (and a lot of money). Watson\u2019s presence put Beauty and the Beast into the premier league. You couldn\u2019t do Maleficent without Angelina Jolie. Human actors remain a key part of the package, even if they are not quite the main draw they used to be.</p>",

According to Jeremy Kay, Americas editor for Screen International, this string of purchases has afforded the studio \u201can unmatched stable of brands that have given them a steady flow of hits\u201d. Disney\u2019s main strategy over the last 15 years has been to pay big money for top-of-the-range franchises and exploit them ruthlessly. \u201cThere are always going to be ups and downs, and studios prefer to bet on tried-and-tested properties with huge fanbases,\u201d says Kay. \u201cDisney has more of them than any other studio, and they are sparing no expense in marketing and distributing them globally.\u201d Disney\u2019s clout has just taken a further giant leap: in March they swallowed one of their biggest rivals, Fox, a fellow member of the elite \u201cbig six\u201d Hollywood studios. After a $71bn deal that dwarfed its previous acquisitions, Disney now owns another clutch of giant franchises (Avatar, X-Men, Deadpool) as well as such TV series as The Simpsons. No Fox projects have yet shown up on Disney\u2019s release slate, but the threat of a decreasingly competitive studio system is preoccupying Hollywood. \u201cDisney can take its pick of the Fox properties and develop them,\u201d says Kay. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly not great for competitors when one company dominates market share so aggressively, but the other studios have their hits, too \u2013 just not as frequently as Disney. It will force the other studios to adapt or die.\u201d While mass acquisitions may appear to be its new way of business, Disney\u2019s franchise hunger has its roots in the company\u2019s original ethos. Considered a relatively small, independent operator for much of its early existence as a producer of family-oriented animation, Disney was not considered to possess \u201cmajor\u201d studio status until the mid-80s, after Michael Eisner became CEO. Founder Walt Disney had embraced spinoffs and ancillary marketing much earlier, encapsulated in his famous hand-drawn \u201csynergy map\u201d of 1957, which illustrated his films\u2019 place at the heart of cross-media product lines. Via a network of theme parks, TV channels and merchandising, Disney instinctively understood, perhaps even pioneered, what we now think of as the \u201cmovie universe\u201d. In the early 80s, theme parks accounted for 70% of the Disney\u2019s income; in 2018, the company reported that non-studio activities made up over 83% of its $59.4bn total revenue. The current swath of live-action remakes also harks back to an early Disney strategy, its \u201cvault\u201d programme, where it would briefly re-release its most popular classic films every few years to attract a new generation of children as the previous one grew out of them. Having scored a massive commercial hit with the Tim Burton-directed Alice in Wonderland in 2010, Disney embarked on a string of similar \u201creimaginings\u201d: Maleficent (a Sleeping Beauty reboot), Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast and The Jungle Book. By this time next year we will have had The Lion King, Lady and the Tramp and Mulan \u2013 the latter, in particular, aimed at the increasingly lucrative Chinese box office. But Disney\u2019s rivals aren\u2019t simply the other Hollywood studios: its main opposition is the streaming giant Netflix, which it is taking aim at with its own streaming service, Disney+. By producing large numbers of films and earning income through subscriptions rather than tickets, Netflix has launched a successful assault on standard film-industry practice and put Hollywood on the back foot. But the studios, led by Disney, are now responding by setting up their own rival services and keeping their products for themselves. \u201cNetflix has that first-mover advantage,\u201d says Kay, \u201cand it will be hard for anyone to overtake its huge subscriber base of around 150 million worldwide. But Netflix also has a huge debt load, and needs to make compelling original content or risk losing subscribers to these other platforms. Disney has the great brands and back catalogue to put in its service. It\u2019s an arms race.\u201d What makes a Disney hit? Superheroes More than anything else, caped-and-Spandexed crusaders ballast the modern all-ages movie. Kids love them, adults admire them and films about them range from sugar-rush CGI action that flattens entire cities to the kind of encoded social messaging Disney loves. Star Wars now covers pretty much identical turf. It\u2019ll be a long time before Hollywood gets tired of it all. Feminism Over the decades the traditional Disney princess has come in for a lot of flak, and recently the company has taken steps to reconfigure its female characters into kickass, self-reliant heroes. Moana, Elsa, Merida, Elastigirl, even Judy Hopps (from Zootopia) are not people you want to mess with. Friendship and family In ditching its submissive female characters, Disney has also moved away from the boy-meets-girl, princess-meets-prince blueprint. Alice bonds with her mum in Through the Looking Glass, Meg searches for her dad in A Wrinkle in Time, Anna and Elsa explore sisterly connections in Frozen. Nostalgia When all\u2019s said and done, Disney likes to go back to the well it knows best: espousing traditional values while reminding paying parents of their own childhoods. Mary Poppins Returns harked back to prewar London as well as being a virtual replica of Disney\u2019s 1964 hit. The Lion King evokes sonorous tribal pieties as it replays the hits from its 1994 source. The Emma Watson Beauty and the Beast is still the old-fashioned fairytale. Stars In the age of the effects-heavy franchise we are often told the movie star is dead. But that\u2019s not quite the case: Marvel movies make a lot of famous actors even more famous (and a lot of money). Watson\u2019s presence put Beauty and the Beast into the premier league. You couldn\u2019t do Maleficent without Angelina Jolie. Human actors remain a key part of the package, even if they are not quite the main draw they used to be.",

And while the arena was still largely empty as New Zealand and Malawi began the first session to a blast of Republica, it did not stay that way for long.

These women have been to netball all over the globe \u2013 Christchurch, Fiji, Jamaica, Sydney \u2013 but even they were impressed. More than 103,000 tickets have already been sold for the next 11 days\u2019 play, out of a total capacity of 125,000. And while several sessions are sold out including many of England\u2019s sessions \u2013 6,500 tickets had been sold to their opening game \u2013 the organisers are keen to emphasise the remaining availability, and opportunities for people to join in, particularly in next week\u2019s midweek games.</p> <p>For the preliminary rounds two courts have been created, one on each side of the arena, so that four teams can play at once, and the result is a blur of activity and colour. But it\u2019s the sounds of netball that are truly distinctive, and here they infiltrated every part of the stadium as if they were a living, breathing member of the crowd. The ever-present squeaking of the players\u2019 shoes as they run up and down the court, suggesting a mice infestation at a cheese factory. Whistles punctuating the air with military frequency \u2013 a morse code of player instructions delivered in short blasts, ending each quarter with a melodic flourish.</p> <p>Sometimes a klaxon sounded and you would have sworn it was a horn on one of the Stena Line ferries in the dock outside, calling all aboard.

      "bodyText": "It was hard to say who could claim the more vibrant exhibition on the Liverpool waterfront on Friday. Was it the Keith Haring retrospective at Tate Liverpool, where brightly coloured figures leapt about in glorious abandon, their every pose capturing the wild energy of a genius at work? Or was it the opening day of the Netball World Cup, where \u2013 well \u2013 ditto? Against a splashy backdrop of pinks and purples \u2013 the design palate of global sports tournaments is surely one London 2012\u2019s true legacies \u2013 netball\u2019s greatest showpiece hit the ground running. You would expect no less of the world\u2019s ultimate quicksilver sport. Even the spectators did not waste any time. At 8.30am the queue to pick up tickets at the box office was already a surprising 50 people long. They waited cheerfully and patiently \u2013 netball fans are passionate but they are also incredibly collegiate. And while the arena was still largely empty as New Zealand and Malawi began the first session to a blast of Republica, it did not stay that way for long. By half-time \u2013 the Kiwis had long begun to pull away \u2013 the cheap seats were almost full and the first chant had started. \u201cEverywhere we go-o \u2026\u201d sang a cluster of women wearing black-and-white perm wigs. \u201cPeople always ask us \u2026\u201d The answer to the question was New Zealand: one of a number of tour groups who have travelled here especially for the tournament. These women have been to netball all over the globe \u2013 Christchurch, Fiji, Jamaica, Sydney \u2013 but even they were impressed. More than 103,000 tickets have already been sold for the next 11 days\u2019 play, out of a total capacity of 125,000. And while several sessions are sold out including many of England\u2019s sessions \u2013 6,500 tickets had been sold to their opening game \u2013 the organisers are keen to emphasise the remaining availability, and opportunities for people to join in, particularly in next week\u2019s midweek games. For the preliminary rounds two courts have been created, one on each side of the arena, so that four teams can play at once, and the result is a blur of activity and colour. But it\u2019s the sounds of netball that are truly distinctive, and here they infiltrated every part of the stadium as if they were a living, breathing member of the crowd. The ever-present squeaking of the players\u2019 shoes as they run up and down the court, suggesting a mice infestation at a cheese factory. Whistles punctuating the air with military frequency \u2013 a morse code of player instructions delivered in short blasts, ending each quarter with a melodic flourish. Sometimes a klaxon sounded and you would have sworn it was a horn on one of the Stena Line ferries in the dock outside, calling all aboard. No one made as much noise as the Zimbabwe fans who took over court two at lunchtime with their flags, their families and their joyful presence. After the Kiwi game (and in spite of a large defeat), a small knot of Malawi supporters had broken into happy, spontaneous song next to the food and drink concessions. It was a mere prelude to the full-on musical that accompanied Zimbabwe v Sri Lanka. Zimbabwe\u2019s team \u2013 and their passionate fans \u2013 had plenty of reason to be delighted even before a ball was thrown.

The Trump administration holds the record for the highest turnover of cabinet and White House staff. He said his resignation would be effective in seven days.</p> \n<p>Acosta said he did not think it was right for his handling of Epstein\u2019s case to distract from his work as secretary of labor. <br><br>\u201cI called the president this morning and told him I thought the right thing was to step aside,\u201d Acosta said, adding that \u201cit would be selfish for me to stay in this position and continue talking about case that\u2019s 12 years old rather than the amazing economy we have right now\u201d.</p> \n<p>Acosta was the US attorney in Miami when he oversaw a non-prosecution agreement for Epstein in 2008, which secretly ended a federal sex abuse investigation involving at least 40 teenage girls that could have landed him behind bars for life.</p> \n<p>Epstein instead pleaded guilty to state charges and was jailed for 13 months \u2013 though he was allowed to leave during the day to work at his luxury office. He paid settlements to victims and is a registered sex offender.</p> \n<p>Fresh charges of sex trafficking filed this week against Epstein by federal prosecutors in New York had put Acosta\u2019s role in the 2008 deal under renewed scrutiny. The charges were brought following an investigation by the Miami Herald.</p> \n<p>He is accused of sexually exploiting and abusing dozens of underage girls from 2002 to 2005 at his homes in Manhattan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\">New York</a>, and Palm Beach, Florida.</p> \n<p>The indictment charges that Epstein \u201centiced and recruited, and caused to be enticed and recruited, minor girls\u201d to \u201cengage in sex acts with him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars in cash\u201d.</p> \n<p>Top Democratic lawmakers and presidential candidates demanded that Acosta resign over his handling of the 2008 plea deal, which a federal judge has said violated federal law because Acosta did not notify Epstein\u2019s victims of the arrangement. The justice department is undertaking an investigation.</p> \n<p>Acosta was further criticised for leading efforts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/09/labor-secretary-alexander-acosta-sex-trafficking-budget-cut\">dramatically cut</a> labor department budgets dedicated to combating human trafficking.</p> \n<p>Acosta had attempted to clear his name and, encouraged by Trump, held a news conference on Wednesday to defend his actions.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, has resigned following criticism of his handling of a 2008 plea deal with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, who is awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking underage girls. Trump announced the news on Friday with Acosta by his side at the White House. \u201cAlex Acosta is a great secretary of labor,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI hate to see this happen.\u201d He said he did not ask Acosta to leave the cabinet. Acosta becomes the latest in a long line of high-profile officials to resign their post. The Trump administration holds the record for the highest turnover of cabinet and White House staff. He said his resignation would be effective in seven days. Acosta said he did not think it was right for his handling of Epstein\u2019s case to distract from his work as secretary of labor. \u201cI called the president this morning and told him I thought the right thing was to step aside,\u201d Acosta said, adding that \u201cit would be selfish for me to stay in this position and continue talking about case that\u2019s 12 years old rather than the amazing economy we have right now\u201d. Acosta was the US attorney in Miami when he oversaw a non-prosecution agreement for Epstein in 2008, which secretly ended a federal sex abuse investigation involving at least 40 teenage girls that could have landed him behind bars for life. Epstein instead pleaded guilty to state charges and was jailed for 13 months \u2013 though he was allowed to leave during the day to work at his luxury office. He paid settlements to victims and is a registered sex offender. Fresh charges of sex trafficking filed this week against Epstein by federal prosecutors in New York had put Acosta\u2019s role in the 2008 deal under renewed scrutiny. The charges were brought following an investigation by the Miami Herald. He is accused of sexually exploiting and abusing dozens of underage girls from 2002 to 2005 at his homes in Manhattan, New York, and Palm Beach, Florida. The indictment charges that Epstein \u201centiced and recruited, and caused to be enticed and recruited, minor girls\u201d to \u201cengage in sex acts with him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars in cash\u201d. Top Democratic lawmakers and presidential candidates demanded that Acosta resign over his handling of the 2008 plea deal, which a federal judge has said violated federal law because Acosta did not notify Epstein\u2019s victims of the arrangement. The justice department is undertaking an investigation. Acosta was further criticised for leading efforts to dramatically cut labor department budgets dedicated to combating human trafficking. Acosta had attempted to clear his name and, encouraged by Trump, held a news conference on Wednesday to defend his actions. Acosta argued his office had secured the best deal it could at the time and was working in the victims\u2019 best interests. \u201cWe did what we did because we wanted to see Epstein go to jail,\u201d he said, refusing to apologize for his actions. \u201cWe believe that we proceeded appropriately.\u201d Pressed on whether he had any regrets, Acosta repeatedly suggested that circumstances had changed since then. \u201cWe now have 12 years of knowledge and hindsight and we live in a very different world,\u201d he said. \u201cToday\u2019s world treats victims very, very differently,\u201d he said. After federal attorneys in New York announced the new charges against Epstein this week, Acosta tweeted that he was \u201cpleased\u201d by their decision. \u201cNow that new evidence and additional testimony is available, the NY prosecution offers an important opportunity to more fully bring him to justice,\u201d he said. Epstein, a well-connected financier, was known for socializing with politicians and royalty, with friends who have included Trump, Bill Clinton and, according to court papers, Prince Andrew. None of those people was mentioned in the New York indictment. \u201cI\u2019ve known Jeff for 15 years,\u201d Trump said in a 2002 New York magazine article. \u201cTerrific guy. He\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d Trump has since tried to distance himself from Epstein. Announcing Acosta\u2019s resignation, he said: \u201cYes, I did have a falling out a long time ago. The reason doesn\u2019t make any difference \u2026 I haven\u2019t spoken to him in 15 years or more. I wasn\u2019t a big fan of Jeffrey Epstein, that I can tell you.\u201d Acosta took on the role of labor secretary officially in early 2017, leading a sprawling agency that enforces more than 180 federal laws covering about 10 million employers and 125 million workers. He was confirmed in the Senate 60-38. But Acosta had frustrated some conservatives who had been pushing for his ouster long before the Epstein uproar. Among their frustrations were Acosta\u2019s decisions to proceed with several employment discrimination lawsuits and to allow certain Obama holdovers to remain on the job.

The ruling confirmed that the man arrested in the Sudanese capital and extradited to Rome was in fact a 29-year-old Eritrean named Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe, who had fallen victim to what may be one of the most embarrassing cases of mistaken identity in Italian legal history.</p> <p>He was found guilty of the much lesser charge of aiding illegal immigration for helping his cousin reach Libya, but was released immediately for time served. </p> <h2>The hunt for Mered</h2> <p>Led by Italian prosecutors, the hunt for Mered and his affiliates began after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/lampedusa-boat-tragedy-italy-migrants\">shipwreck in October 2013</a>, in which 368 people died a few miles off the Italian island of Lampedusa. The next day Italy and its allies in Europe declared war on human traffickers. The goal was to capture the smugglers who organised the crossings. Amid growing public disquiet about the arrival of thousands of migrants on boats each week, the idea gained immediate support.</p> <p>News of the arrest in June 2016, after an investigation that spanned two continents and five countries, was presented to the press as a brilliant victory for the new anti-trafficking strategy. The Eritrean was apparently the first human smuggler to be extradited from Africa and regarded as the \u201cAl Capone of the desert\u201d by the authorities.</p> <p>The analogy with the American mobster is not coincidental. In order to capture the Eritrean, authorities in Palermo convinced their EU counterparts to join the crusade on an alluring premise: that the <a href=\"https://www.occrp.org/en/blog/6028-in-sicily-anti-mafia-skills-used-in-the-fight-against-people-smugglers\">same tactics used to combat the Sicilian mafia</a> in the 1990s could ensnare modern human smugglers \u2013 wiretaps and the intuition that among smugglers lies a power structure regulated by a code of honour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"093bae6d84a9e3eb5698fe0c4587f478ebf1dcd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/093bae6d84a9e3eb5698fe0c4587f478ebf1dcd7/157_0_2343_1406/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Italian police\u2019s 2016 handout picture shows Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe, who was arrested and presented as Medhanie Yehdego Mered.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italian police\u2019s 2016 handout picture shows Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe, who was arrested and presented as Medhanie Yehdego Mered.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But within a few hours of the Italian authorities\u2019 announcement of the arrest, hundreds of Mered\u2019s victims were already claiming the wrong man had been detained. According to the family of the extradited man, far from being a notorious people smuggler, Berhe earned his living milking cows on a farm and working once in a while as a carpenter. What\u2019s more, Berhe did not even resemble the trafficker Mered, whose picture the prosecutors had released to the press: long hair, blue T-shirt, a proud mien and a gold crucifix on his chest.</p> <p>The Guardian investigated the case, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/nov/22/people-smuggling-suspect-sends-facebook-message-that-man-on-trial-is-not-him\">uncovering new witnesses and documents</a> which were later produced by the defence to help prove his innocence.</p> <p>The Guardian published photographs that showed Mered, the real smuggler, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/16/people-smuggling-new-photos-boost-claim-that-wrong-man-is-on-trial-in-italy\">celebrating at a family wedding in Khartoum</a> \u2013 giving fresh impetus to claims that the man on trial in Italy and accused of being the smuggler was in fact a victim of mistaken identity.</p> <p>Among the evidence suggesting Berhe\u2019s innocence, including two DNA tests and an array of witnesses, was an article published in July 2017 by the New Yorker \u2013 headlined \u201c<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/how-not-to-solve-the-refugee-crisis\">How Not to Solve the Refugee Crisis</a>\u201d \u2013 based in part on a three-hour telephone interview with the real Mered, which revealed he had actually been in a jail in the Middle East for using a forged passport when Italian prosecutors travelled to Sudan and arrested an innocent refugee in his place.</p> <p>The revelations were confirmed a few months later in November 2017 by Sgt Samuel Sasso of the Italian coastguard, who had investigated Mered\u2019s trafficking activity years before. Sasso testified in court that in the summer of 2016, after Berhe\u2019s arrest, coastguard sources confirmed that the real Mered was in the United Arab Emirates.</p> <h2>The evidence</h2> <p>However, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, prosecutors continued to insist the man captured in Khartoum was the real smuggler and began waging an offensive against activists and journalists, wiretapping phone conversations among reporters who exposed their alleged error and the journalists\u2019 sources.</p> <p>Meanwhile, some of the real Mered\u2019s trafficking victims came to Palermo to testify about the case of mistaken identity. They were also put under investigation by the prosecutors, who believed they were covering for Berhe.</p> <p>One question remained unanswered: if the prosecutors had arrested an innocent man, then where was the real Mered?</p> <p>In April 2018, a <a href=\"https://www.svtplay.se/video/17635602/uppdrag-granskning/uppdrag-granskning-sasong-19-avsnitt-13?start=auto&amp;tab=2018\">documentary</a> by the Swedish broadcaster SVT, in collaboration with the Guardian, confirmed the suspicions and revealed that the real Mered was living it up in Kampala, the Ugandan capital, spending his substantial earnings in nightclubs while Berhe, the farmworker, faced up to 15 years in jail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f06f235e406425a5929346c9eb2a4fc58846a0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f06f235e406425a5929346c9eb2a4fc58846a0c/0_57_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A photo of Medhanie Yehdego Mered (second left) at a family wedding in October 2015 gave fresh momentum to claims the extradited man was a victim of mistaken identity.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photo of Medhanie Yehdego Mered (second left) at a family wedding in October 2015 gave fresh momentum to claims the extradited man was a victim of mistaken identity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Withheld</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The SVT reporter Ali Fegan and the Eritrean journalist and activist Meron Estefanos <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/apr/11/medhanie-yehdego-mered-people-smuggler-italians-claim-jailed-seen-uganda\">travelled to Kampala and collected dozens of testimonies</a> from Ugandan and Eritrean citizens who said they had seen and met Mered. \u201cHe is some kind of a wild celebrity and no one tries to arrest him,\u201d one witness said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just say we heard.

In December 2018, Mered\u2019s brother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/19/not-my-brother-italian-court-told-defendant-is-not-eritrean-smuggler\">Merhawi Yehdego, testified before the judge in Palermo</a> via videolink from the Netherlands, saying the man facing trial in Sicily was not his sibling. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/may/18/not-my-husband-trafficking-kingpin-wife-claims-wrong-man-in-jail-sicily-trial-medhanie-yehdego-mered\">The week before, a woman reported to be the trafficker\u2019s wife, Lidya Tesfu, testified as well</a>. She corroborated Merhawi\u2019s testimony, telling the judge that the man in Italian prison was not her husband. \u201cI know you have placed my husband under investigation,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the man on trial is not Mered.\u201d</p> <p>A few months earlier, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/09/people-smugglers-sons-dna-boosts-case-that-italian-prosecutors-have-wrong-man\">Lidya had authorised </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/09/people-smugglers-sons-dna-boosts-case-that-italian-prosecutors-have-wrong-man\">a DNA test </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/09/people-smugglers-sons-dna-boosts-case-that-italian-prosecutors-have-wrong-man\"> on her three-year-old son</a>, Rae Yehdego, who she and the prosecutorssay is the trafficker\u2019s first son.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c77a5e7e334d8d868cbdf83b5b8b952fe3f5ee6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c77a5e7e334d8d868cbdf83b5b8b952fe3f5ee6a/0_93_640_384/500.png\" alt=\"Medhanie Yehdego Mered with his wife in a photograph discovered in 2016, again boosting claims the extradited man was a victim of mistaken identity.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medhanie Yehdego Mered with his wife in a photograph discovered in 2016, again boosting claims the extradited man was a victim of mistaken identity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe took a sample of saliva from the trafficker\u2019s wife and son and crosschecked it with that of the detained man,\u201d said Berhe\u2019s lawyer, Michele Calantropo. \u201cThe result leaves no room for doubt: the man in prison is not the father of the child, and consequently is not the trafficker Mered.\u201d</p> <p>The DNA evidence reinforced the results of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/26/italian-prosecutors-reject-dna-test-mistaken-identity-case\">earlier test on Berhe\u2019s mother</a>, Meaza Zerai Weldai, 59, who travelled to Palermo from the Eritrean capital, Asmara, last October. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/26/italian-prosecutors-reject-dna-test-mistaken-identity-case\">Analysis showed she was the mother of the detained man</a>.</p> <p>While thousands were mobilising across Europe to demand that Berhe be freed, Italian prosecutors controversially invited to Palermo two members of the Sudanese secret police who had collaborated with the NCA to arrest Berhe, to testify in the case against the man on trial.</p> <h2>Deals with the devil</h2> <p>The obsession with arresting smugglers has in fact driven European democracies to forge ties with authoritarian regimes, which raises ethical questions: in order to extradite Berhe, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/feb/21/uk-risks-legitimising-sudan-rights-abuses-with-migration-talks-mps-warn\">UK and Italy struck an agreement with Sudan</a>, whose now deposed president, Omar al-Bashir, is the subject of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/apr/24/uk-blind-spot-sudan-human-rights-abuses\">an international arrest warrant for genocide</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe were told we had to arrest a man who was accused of human trafficking,\u201d one of the Sudanese officials stated. \u201cThey gave us a picture and a phone number. We have just executed the order. The detainee told us he was not the trafficker Medhanie Yehdego Mered, but called himself Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe. He also said he was a refugee and that a trafficker had asked him for $1,800 to reach Europe.\u201d</p> <p>At the end of that hearing, Berhe described being tortured by Sudanese police officers.</p> <p>\u201cThey beat me when they arrested me, beat me in prison,\u201d he said. \u201cThey beat me with a heavy chain and tried to take off my clothes and do bad things to me. I had an ID card with me from Eritrea and a document from the refugee camp when I was in Ethiopia. But they took everything. I had a little money with me and they took that too. They told me if I\u2019d had more money, they would have released me.\u201d</p> <p>The most recent, and perhaps the most crucial, proof of his innocence was a voice analysis of Berhe and Mered, who had been caught on wiretap in 2014. The result unequivocally concluded that the man in prison was not the trafficker.</p> <p>But despite the overwhelming evidence they had got the wrong man, prosecutors still demanded a 14-year prison term for Berhe in their closing remarks last month.</p>",

The arrest was presented to the press as a brilliant coup by the Italian prosecutors, who had captured the suspect with the help of the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency after a long, sprawling international investigation that spanned two continents and five countries. According to the Italian investigators, the man they named as Medhanie Yehdego Mered was guilty of personally overseeing the perilous boat journeys of more than 13,000 people from Libya to Europe. But on Friday, a Palermo judge acquitted the suspect, who has spent more than three years in jail on charges of being a human trafficker. The ruling confirmed that the man arrested in the Sudanese capital and extradited to Rome was in fact a 29-year-old Eritrean named Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe, who had fallen victim to what may be one of the most embarrassing cases of mistaken identity in Italian legal history. He was found guilty of the much lesser charge of aiding illegal immigration for helping his cousin reach Libya, but was released immediately for time served. The hunt for Mered Led by Italian prosecutors, the hunt for Mered and his affiliates began after a shipwreck in October 2013, in which 368 people died a few miles off the Italian island of Lampedusa. The next day Italy and its allies in Europe declared war on human traffickers. The goal was to capture the smugglers who organised the crossings. Amid growing public disquiet about the arrival of thousands of migrants on boats each week, the idea gained immediate support. News of the arrest in June 2016, after an investigation that spanned two continents and five countries, was presented to the press as a brilliant victory for the new anti-trafficking strategy. The Eritrean was apparently the first human smuggler to be extradited from Africa and regarded as the \u201cAl Capone of the desert\u201d by the authorities. The analogy with the American mobster is not coincidental. In order to capture the Eritrean, authorities in Palermo convinced their EU counterparts to join the crusade on an alluring premise: that the same tactics used to combat the Sicilian mafia in the 1990s could ensnare modern human smugglers \u2013 wiretaps and the intuition that among smugglers lies a power structure regulated by a code of honour. But within a few hours of the Italian authorities\u2019 announcement of the arrest, hundreds of Mered\u2019s victims were already claiming the wrong man had been detained. According to the family of the extradited man, far from being a notorious people smuggler, Berhe earned his living milking cows on a farm and working once in a while as a carpenter. What\u2019s more, Berhe did not even resemble the trafficker Mered, whose picture the prosecutors had released to the press: long hair, blue T-shirt, a proud mien and a gold crucifix on his chest. The Guardian investigated the case, uncovering new witnesses and documents which were later produced by the defence to help prove his innocence. The Guardian published photographs that showed Mered, the real smuggler, celebrating at a family wedding in Khartoum \u2013 giving fresh impetus to claims that the man on trial in Italy and accused of being the smuggler was in fact a victim of mistaken identity. Among the evidence suggesting Berhe\u2019s innocence, including two DNA tests and an array of witnesses, was an article published in July 2017 by the New Yorker \u2013 headlined \u201cHow Not to Solve the Refugee Crisis\u201d \u2013 based in part on a three-hour telephone interview with the real Mered, which revealed he had actually been in a jail in the Middle East for using a forged passport when Italian prosecutors travelled to Sudan and arrested an innocent refugee in his place. The revelations were confirmed a few months later in November 2017 by Sgt Samuel Sasso of the Italian coastguard, who had investigated Mered\u2019s trafficking activity years before. Sasso testified in court that in the summer of 2016, after Berhe\u2019s arrest, coastguard sources confirmed that the real Mered was in the United Arab Emirates. The evidence However, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, prosecutors continued to insist the man captured in Khartoum was the real smuggler and began waging an offensive against activists and journalists, wiretapping phone conversations among reporters who exposed their alleged error and the journalists\u2019 sources. Meanwhile, some of the real Mered\u2019s trafficking victims came to Palermo to testify about the case of mistaken identity. They were also put under investigation by the prosecutors, who believed they were covering for Berhe. One question remained unanswered: if the prosecutors had arrested an innocent man, then where was the real Mered? In April 2018, a documentary by the Swedish broadcaster SVT, in collaboration with the Guardian, confirmed the suspicions and revealed that the real Mered was living it up in Kampala, the Ugandan capital, spending his substantial earnings in nightclubs while Berhe, the farmworker, faced up to 15 years in jail. The SVT reporter Ali Fegan and the Eritrean journalist and activist Meron Estefanos travelled to Kampala and collected dozens of testimonies from Ugandan and Eritrean citizens who said they had seen and met Mered. \u201cHe is some kind of a wild celebrity and no one tries to arrest him,\u201d one witness said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just say we heard. I can say in absolute terms Mered is here,\u201d said another. The Palermo prosecutors who led the hunt for Mered not only ignored the evidence but yet again targeted someone who questioned their case, placing Estefanos under investigation \u2013 although she had put her life in danger to find the real Mered in Uganda. In the meantime, the Italian magistrates\u2019 investigation began to weaken. In December 2018, Mered\u2019s brother, Merhawi Yehdego, testified before the judge in Palermo via videolink from the Netherlands, saying the man facing trial in Sicily was not his sibling. The week before, a woman reported to be the trafficker\u2019s wife, Lidya Tesfu, testified as well. She corroborated Merhawi\u2019s testimony, telling the judge that the man in Italian prison was not her husband. \u201cI know you have placed my husband under investigation,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the man on trial is not Mered.\u201d A few months earlier, Lidya had authorised a DNA test on her three-year-old son, Rae Yehdego, who she and the prosecutorssay is the trafficker\u2019s first son. \u201cWe took a sample of saliva from the trafficker\u2019s wife and son and crosschecked it with that of the detained man,\u201d said Berhe\u2019s lawyer, Michele Calantropo. \u201cThe result leaves no room for doubt: the man in prison is not the father of the child, and consequently is not the trafficker Mered.\u201d The DNA evidence reinforced the results of an earlier test on Berhe\u2019s mother, Meaza Zerai Weldai, 59, who travelled to Palermo from the Eritrean capital, Asmara, last October. Analysis showed she was the mother of the detained man. While thousands were mobilising across Europe to demand that Berhe be freed, Italian prosecutors controversially invited to Palermo two members of the Sudanese secret police who had collaborated with the NCA to arrest Berhe, to testify in the case against the man on trial. Deals with the devil The obsession with arresting smugglers has in fact driven European democracies to forge ties with authoritarian regimes, which raises ethical questions: in order to extradite Berhe, the UK and Italy struck an agreement with Sudan, whose now deposed president, Omar al-Bashir, is the subject of an international arrest warrant for genocide. \u201cWe were told we had to arrest a man who was accused of human trafficking,\u201d one of the Sudanese officials stated. \u201cThey gave us a picture and a phone number. We have just executed the order. The detainee told us he was not the trafficker Medhanie Yehdego Mered, but called himself Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe. He also said he was a refugee and that a trafficker had asked him for $1,800 to reach Europe.\u201d At the end of that hearing, Berhe described being tortured by Sudanese police officers. \u201cThey beat me when they arrested me, beat me in prison,\u201d he said. \u201cThey beat me with a heavy chain and tried to take off my clothes and do bad things to me. I had an ID card with me from Eritrea and a document from the refugee camp when I was in Ethiopia. But they took everything. I had a little money with me and they took that too. They told me if I\u2019d had more money, they would have released me.\u201d The most recent, and perhaps the most crucial, proof of his innocence was a voice analysis of Berhe and Mered, who had been caught on wiretap in 2014. The result unequivocally concluded that the man in prison was not the trafficker. But despite the overwhelming evidence they had got the wrong man, prosecutors still demanded a 14-year prison term for Berhe in their closing remarks last month.",

Robin Kowalski and Annie McCord asked more than 400 participants, aged over 30, and got some entertaining replies (\u201cDon\u2019t marry her. Do. Not. Marry. Her\u201d). But we\u2019re little closer to clarifying the mystery that\u2019s always bothered me: what, precisely, do people take themselves to be doing when they ask themselves this question?</p> <p>Because it rests, pretty obviously, on a paradox. You only acquired the wisdom on which your advice is based by making the mistakes you\u2019re now advising your former self to avoid. For example, many respondents gave some version of the answer \u201cStop being so afraid\u201d \u2013 of failure, of other people\u2019s judgments, of life. Excellent advice, but you\u2019ll never feel its force until you\u2019ve first acted afraid and seen where that got you. Experience, as the saying goes, is a harsh teacher: it makes you sit the test first and only gives you the lesson afterwards.</p> <p>Of course, if \u201cadvising your younger self\u201d were just a happiness-boosting technique for calling to mind everything you\u2019ve learned in life, nobody could object. But, <a href=\"https://osf.io/5x7ty/\" title=\"\">browsing the replies to the study</a>, what you sense, far more frequently, is the shiver of regret. People truly wish they hadn\u2019t married so young, chosen a career to please their parents, or spent their money instead of saving it. And this only brings into focus the fact that regret, while entirely understandable, is a fundamentally self-contradictory emotion: the very fact that you\u2019re feeling it means that you\u2019ve grown into the kind of person who can look back critically on what you did in the past, when you were another kind of person. Which means that, judged by your present values, you\u2019ve emerged from your life experience better than before, and ought (rationally speaking, anyhow) to be happy rather than regretful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/05/how-to-tackle-your-to-do-lists-oliver-burkeman\">Overwhelmed by your to-do lists?

This echoes the well-known observation that adopting a third-person perspective on your problems \u2013 <a href=\"https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/emotions/benefits-talking-like-egomaniac.htm\" title=\"\">thinking or writing about yourself in the third person</a>, for instance \u2013 can encourage a calmer and less self-berating approach. But, in that case, I\u2019d suggest we abandon all this time-travel business (the self-help equivalent of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/10/24/9605406/killing-baby-hitler\" title=\"\">Would you kill baby Hitler?</a>\u201d) and go straight to the real question: how would you advise a beloved friend?</p> <p>Because the crucial issue, after all, isn\u2019t what you might have done differently in the past, had you been someone that you couldn\u2019t have been back then.

      "bodyText": "In the Journal of Social Psychology, two US researchers just published the first serious study of a question that seems to obsess millions, and to which every celebrity, from Bill Gates to Kesha, is required to have an answer: what advice would you give your younger self? Robin Kowalski and Annie McCord asked more than 400 participants, aged over 30, and got some entertaining replies (\u201cDon\u2019t marry her. Do. Not. Marry. Her\u201d). But we\u2019re little closer to clarifying the mystery that\u2019s always bothered me: what, precisely, do people take themselves to be doing when they ask themselves this question? Because it rests, pretty obviously, on a paradox. You only acquired the wisdom on which your advice is based by making the mistakes you\u2019re now advising your former self to avoid. For example, many respondents gave some version of the answer \u201cStop being so afraid\u201d \u2013 of failure, of other people\u2019s judgments, of life. Excellent advice, but you\u2019ll never feel its force until you\u2019ve first acted afraid and seen where that got you. Experience, as the saying goes, is a harsh teacher: it makes you sit the test first and only gives you the lesson afterwards. Of course, if \u201cadvising your younger self\u201d were just a happiness-boosting technique for calling to mind everything you\u2019ve learned in life, nobody could object. But, browsing the replies to the study, what you sense, far more frequently, is the shiver of regret. People truly wish they hadn\u2019t married so young, chosen a career to please their parents, or spent their money instead of saving it. And this only brings into focus the fact that regret, while entirely understandable, is a fundamentally self-contradictory emotion: the very fact that you\u2019re feeling it means that you\u2019ve grown into the kind of person who can look back critically on what you did in the past, when you were another kind of person. Which means that, judged by your present values, you\u2019ve emerged from your life experience better than before, and ought (rationally speaking, anyhow) to be happy rather than regretful. Or maybe I\u2019m ignoring the obvious explanation, also hinted at in the study, which is that people find it useful to advise their younger selves as a way of advising their present selves, to bring their current behaviour more closely in line with what they\u2019ve learned. This echoes the well-known observation that adopting a third-person perspective on your problems \u2013 thinking or writing about yourself in the third person, for instance \u2013 can encourage a calmer and less self-berating approach. But, in that case, I\u2019d suggest we abandon all this time-travel business (the self-help equivalent of \u201cWould you kill baby Hitler?\u201d) and go straight to the real question: how would you advise a beloved friend? Because the crucial issue, after all, isn\u2019t what you might have done differently in the past, had you been someone that you couldn\u2019t have been back then. It\u2019s what you\u2019d do now, if you treated yourself with half the kindness and goodwill you unhesitatingly extend to your favourite relatives or friends. For many people, I know, this can be a major challenge. But unlike changing the past, it has the enormous advantage of not being impossible.

The next day Italy and its allies in Europe declared war on human traffickers. The goal was to capture the smugglers who organised the crossings. Amid growing public disquiet about the arrival of thousands of migrants on boats each week, the idea gained immediate support.</p> <p>The Eritrean was apparently the first human smuggler to be extradited from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa\">Africa</a> and regarded as the \u201cAl Capone of the desert\u201d by the authorities.</p> <p>The analogy with the American mobster is not coincidental.

      "bodyText": "A Palermo judge has acquitted an Eritrean man of being a human trafficking kingpin, confirming he was the victim of mistaken identity when he was arrested more than three years ago in a joint operation between Italian and British authorities. The arrest of Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe in 2016 was presented to the press as a brilliant coup by Italian and British authorities, who mistook him for one of the world\u2019s most-wanted human traffickers, Medhanie Yehdego Mered, aka the General. But Judge Alfredo Montalto of the criminal court of Palermo on 12 July rejected prosecutors\u2019 claims and ordered the immediate release of Berhe, who was arrested in Khartoum, Sudan, on 24 May 2016 with help of the British National Crime Agency and the Sudanese police. \u201cIt was a case of mistaken identity,\u201d the judge said. \u201cThe man in prison was wrongly arrested.\u201d Berhe was found guilty instead of a much lesser charge of aiding illegal immigration for having helped his cousin to reach Libya, but because he had already served three years in prison, the judge ordered his immediate release. \u201cI have no words to explain the way I feel,\u201d said Hiwett Tesfamariam, Berhe\u2019s sister, who had travelled from Norway for the verdict. \u201cIt was a nightmare. A real nightmare.\u201d Michele Calantropo, Berhe\u2019s lawyer, said: \u201cAfter three years, finally the judge confirmed what we have been saying: we had a farmer in jail and a smuggler at large.\u201d Despite the judge\u2019s ruling, the NCA insisted it had got the right man. The NCA said: \u201cThe NCA assisted Italian partners in locating a specific individual. That man has today been convicted of significant people smuggling offences. We remain confident in our intelligence gathering, and believe the support provided to Italian authorities in this case was consistent with good operational practice.\u201d Francesco Lo Voi, the Palermo chief prosecutor also refused to apologise for the mistake. \u201cAt least the judge charged him with aiding illegal immigration,\u201d he said. Led by Italian prosecutors, the hunt for Mered and his affiliates began after a shipwreck in October 2013, in which 368 people died a few miles off the Italian island of Lampedusa. The next day Italy and its allies in Europe declared war on human traffickers. The goal was to capture the smugglers who organised the crossings. Amid growing public disquiet about the arrival of thousands of migrants on boats each week, the idea gained immediate support. The Eritrean was apparently the first human smuggler to be extradited from Africa and regarded as the \u201cAl Capone of the desert\u201d by the authorities. The analogy with the American mobster is not coincidental. In order to capture the Eritrean, authorities in Palermo convinced their EU counterparts to join the crusade on an alluring premise: that the same tactics used to combat the Sicilian mafia in the 1990s could ensnare modern human smugglers \u2013 wiretaps and the intuition that among smugglers lies a power structure regulated by a code of honour. However, within a few hours of Berhe\u2019s arrest, hundreds of Mered\u2019s victims claimed the wrong man had been detained. According to Berhe\u2019s family, far from being a notorious trafficker he was an Eritrean refugee who earned his living on a dairy farm and working occasionally as a carpenter. Among many factors that pointed to his innocence, including two DNA tests and an array of witnesses, was a documentary by the Swedish broadcaster SVT, in collaboration with the Guardian, which revealed that the \u201creal\u201d Mered was living in the Ugandan capital, spending his substantial earnings in Kampala nightclubs while Berhe faced up to 15 years in jail. The most recent, and perhaps most crucial, proof of Berhe\u2019s innocence was a voice analysis of him and Mered, who had been caught on a wiretap in 2014. The result unequivocally concluded that the man in prison was not the trafficker. But prosecutors continued to insist the man captured in Khartoum was the real smuggler and began waging an offensive against activists and journalists, wiretapping the phone conversations among reporters that exposed their alleged error and the journalists\u2019 sources. In the last few months, as more than 44,000 signatures have been gathered in favour of Berhe\u2019s release, hundreds of people have been protesting in Oslo, Stockholm, London and Frankfurt, calling for Italian authorities to release the arrested man. They are all Eritreans and many of them were trafficked to Europe by Mered, who appears to be still on the run. Despite the fact he had not been able to provide a single witness to testify against Berhe, at the end of his five-hour closing remarks on 17 June the prosecutor Calogero Ferrara dismissed suggestions they had apprehended the wrong man and demanded a 14-year prison term. But Berhe\u2019s saga, a case that has become one of the most spectacular examples of mistaken identity in the last 30 years, may not be over. Relatives have asked that Berhe be awarded damages for his wrongful detention and that an investigation be opened into Sicily\u2019s top prosecutors who, they argue, are guilty of having bungled a high-profile arrest, covered it up and framed an innocent man for the ruthless and lucrative crimes of another.",

Anything else is a bonus but that is the primary goal.\u201d Rory McIlroy\u2019s second 67 in as many days moved him to eight under. Ian Poulter matched McIlroy\u2019s Friday tally to reach minus 10 to keep him on contention for the weekend. \u201cI want to win,\u201d said Poulter. \u201cSo that, first and foremost, burns hard within and when I get in contention, when I\u2019m playing good golf and I feel great, that kind of dog-eat type person wants to come out and play ball. I\u2019m 43, I\u2019m happy and I\u2019m playing some of the best golf of my life.\u201d Matt Wallace\u2019s 66 means an eight under par total after the opening two rounds, a stroke adrift of the 2017 champion Rafa Cabrera Bello and Matt Kuchar.",

      "body": "<p>It is 4.30 on a Thursday morning and I am writing these words on the big red IBM Selectric III that once belonged to Hunter S Thompson. Owl Farm, Thompson\u2019s \u201cfortified compound\u201d in Woody Creek, Colorado, is dark and silent outside. Even the peacocks he raised are sleeping. The only sound anywhere is the warm hum of this electric typewriter and the mechanical rhythm of its key strikes, as clear and certain as gunfire.</p> <p>In April, Thompson\u2019s widow, Anita, began renting out the writer\u2019s cabin to help support the Hunter S Thompson scholarship for veterans at Columbia University, where both she and Hunter studied. It sits beside the main Thompson home on a 17-hectare estate marked with hoof prints and elk droppings that gradually rises towards a mountain range. A short walk uphill is the spot where Thompson\u2019s ashes were fired into the sky from a 153ft tower in the shape of a \u201cGonzo fist\u201d, a logo he first adopted during his unsuccessful 1970 campaign to be sheriff of nearby Aspen. Johnny Depp, who played Thompson in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/01/johnny-depp-spent-3m-blasting-hunter-s-thompson-ashes-from-cannon-ex-managers-claim\">picked up the $3m tab</a> for that elaborate sendoff, which took place shortly after Thompson killed himself in 2005.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"569f4a1ebd9497eefcff04163a44baf4da1fcc94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/569f4a1ebd9497eefcff04163a44baf4da1fcc94/0_143_3968_2833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The command centre \u2026 Kevin EG Perry with Anita Thompson at Owl Farm.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The command centre \u2026 Kevin EG Perry with Anita Thompson at Owl Farm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin EG Perry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is still a piece of rebar buried in the ground where the tower once stood. It now marks the heart of a labyrinth, picked out in red rocks that were placed there by Anita several years ago. Walking there during the day, I found myself lulled into a state of meditation. It was reading Thompson as a teenager that made me want to write for a living. Like many, my gateway drug was Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, his vicious satirical broadside against the American dream that begins with the line: \u201cWe were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold.\u201d</p> <p>There is, I realise now, a certain irony to the fact that a journey beginning with that debauched and hallucinatory tale has brought me to one of the most serene and peaceful places I\u2019ve been. While sitting at the typewriter, I glance out the window and see a lone white-tailed deer standing on the ridge just above Thompson\u2019s cherry-red Pontiac Grand Ville. In the afternoon, Anita shows me around their home, including the kitchen that was once his \u201ccommand centre\u201d. Another typewriter remains where he left it, engulfed in a snowdrift of books and papers. Indeed, the whole room is largely unchanged, part of Anita\u2019s plans to preserve the home as a museum.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He did have a way of consuming more food, more alcohol and more drugs than anybody I\u2019ve ever seen</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She met Thompson in 1997, when he saved her from being mauled by a pair of crazed great danes on the boardwalk of Venice Beach in LA. At least, that\u2019s the way he tells it in his sort-of memoir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/17/biography.huntersthompson\">Kingdom of Fear</a>, published in 2003. In truth, they were introduced by a mutual friend: she had a question about football and the friend thought Thompson, then primarily a sportswriter, would know the answer. She had no idea who he was.</p> <p>\u201cI was 25 and I had an instant crush on him,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d never met anyone like him. I knew him as Hunter before I knew him as a writer. He was an intense and kind person. When I met him, he wasn\u2019t a wild partier. He wasn\u2019t a Raoul Duke character.\u201d That\u2019s his drug-snorting alter ego, the name he gives himself in Fear and Loathing. \u201cWhen he was under stress or having a lot of fun, that character would come out, but generally he was just like you and me. Having said that, he did have a way of consuming more food, more alcohol and more drugs than anybody I\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 and still be able to function.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"02f7be156030b7d4545b95125a14d1a0900c75f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02f7be156030b7d4545b95125a14d1a0900c75f9/0_0_5084_3438/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018One of the great political voices of our time\u2019 \u2026 Thompson and his typewriter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018One of the great political voices of our time\u2019 \u2026 Thompson and his typewriter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Geographic Image Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anita helped Thompson get back to writing in the last half-decade of his life; he produced as much work in those five years as he had in the previous 15. That included a regular column for sports network ESPN that included a <a href=\"http://proxy.espn.com/espn/page2/story?id=1250751#inbox/_blank\">startlingly prescient piece</a>, published the day after 9/11, that predicted the US military follies that would define the decade to come.</p> <p>In 2001, he also returned to campaigning journalism with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/04/hunter-s-thompson-prisoner-of-denver\">his </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/04/hunter-s-thompson-prisoner-of-denver\">battle to free Lisl Auman</a>, a Colorado woman convicted of murdering a police officer even though she had been handcuffed in the police car when the shot was fired by her companion. The supreme court overturned her conviction two weeks after Thompson died. \u201cIt was bittersweet for all of us,\u201d says Anita.</p> <p>These days, Anita finds herself charged with <a href=\"https://www.thegonzofoundation.org/\">preserving her husband\u2019s legacy</a>. There have been rumours of TV shows, a film adaptation of his 1983 Hawaiian escapade The Curse of Lono, even a branded cannabis line, but she is understandably cautious. \u201cI try to steer the conversation back to his writing, because there\u2019s always a focus on his lifestyle,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the clickbait, but it\u2019s the writing that\u2019s important. We need him now more than ever, and his work is so poignant and personal. He\u2019s always in the present moment. In every story, he\u2019s showing you what it felt like, all the smells and sensations. Every time you read a page, it makes you more empowered today, in 2019, whether you\u2019re reading about the 1970s or 2003.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"909b6d918de471e1019ad8d3ed6d53071c25ddc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/909b6d918de471e1019ad8d3ed6d53071c25ddc5/0_230_2976_2582/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Echoes \u2026 our writer starts his piece on Thompson\u2019s typewriter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"868\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Echoes \u2026 our writer starts his piece on Thompson\u2019s typewriter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin EG Perry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have worked as a journalist for the best part of a decade now, and there are elements of Thompson\u2019s mythology I can no longer romanticise. There\u2019s a section of Fear and Loathing that begins with this editor\u2019s note: \u201cThe original manuscript is so splintered that we were forced to seek out the original tape recording and transcribe it verbatim.\u201d Any illusion I once held that this was a sort of meta-joke was shattered when I read that it had been written up by Sarah Lazin, an editorial assistant at Rolling Stone in the 70s. \u201cI had done a lot of transcribing in several languages,\u201d she recalled last year in a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/08/the-women-who-transformed-rolling-stone-in-the-mid-70s#inbox/_blank\">Vanity Fair</a><em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/08/the-women-who-transformed-rolling-stone-in-the-mid-70s#inbox/_blank\"> </a></em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/08/the-women-who-transformed-rolling-stone-in-the-mid-70s#inbox/_blank\">piece</a>, \u201cbut this was pretty intense. In one of the tapes they\u2019re in this restaurant, and they\u2019re essentially torturing the waitress \u2013 yelling and screaming and throwing things \u2013 and I had no idea how to transcribe that.\u201d</p> <p>While that sort of behaviour may make Thompson seem like a relic from a different time, when one could be a nightmare to work with and be forgiven, his writing still resonates \u2013 some of it more noisily than ever. Unfortunately, there is nothing outdated about this observation from Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail \u201972: \u201cThe main problem in any democracy is that crowdpleasers are generally brainless swine who can go out on a stage and whup their supporters into an orgiastic frenzy \u2013 then go back to the office and sell every one of the poor bastards down the tube for a nickel apiece.\u201d</p> <p>A new biography, Freak Kingdom by Timothy Denevi<em>,</em> focuses on Thompson\u2019s incendiary writing in the decade between two seismic events in American politics: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1963/nov/22/kennedy.usa\">assassination of John F Kennedy</a> in 1963 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/09/editorial-nixon-the-man-who-stayed-too-long-archive-1974\">Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation</a> in 1974. Denevi started writing his book after rereading <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/eob_texts-production/texts/22/1297809321_Strange_Rumblings_in_Aztlan_small.pdf?1297809321\">Strange Rumblings in Aztlan</a>, Thompson\u2019s 1971 Rolling Stone piece about the death of Mexican-American reporter Rub\u00e9n Salazar at the hands of the LAPD \u2013 a story that has obvious resonance both with President Trump\u2019s attacks on immigrant communities and the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e1ea6f4b26ee21b5ac678d2023c8a666c25f85f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1ea6f4b26ee21b5ac678d2023c8a666c25f85f4/0_0_1672_2500/669.jpg\" alt=\"Out with a bang \u2026 Thompson\u2019s ashes hit the sky accompanied by fireworks in August 2005.\" width=\"669\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Out with a bang \u2026 Thompson\u2019s ashes hit the sky accompanied by fireworks in August 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Mountain/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cReading that piece, I began to realise that this is one of the great literary political voices of our time,\u201d says Denevi, down the line to the cabin. \u201cHe was indicting and attacking those with the most power for their dishonesty. Although I don\u2019t mention Trump or his administration, of course my book was coloured by the present corruption which shines its garbage light upon us all. Thompson understood that power is inseparable from the people who abuse it. That means you have to look at the people who are abusing it to understand its nature and how it can be manipulated, in America especially, to hurt the people who already have the least.\u201d</p> <p>This isn\u2019t the first time Thompson\u2019s prescience has rung bells. Alex Gibney\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/dec/21/hunter-thompson-gonzo-review\">2008 documentary Gonzo</a><em> </em>made it clear how easily his work in the 1960s and 70s also applied to the George W Bush era. Here we are again, a decade later. History doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it does rhyme. \u201cThat\u2019s because what Thompson is really writing about is how people abuse the American system to gain more power, and that\u2019s as old as America itself,\u201d says Denevi. \u201cThompson\u2019s insight is like Mark Twain\u2019s insight, in that it lasts outside of its cultural moment. It\u2019s his logic, perspective and rigour that allows his work to fit into the Bush administration, or Reagan, or now.\u201d</p> <p>Having spent roughly half my life reading and rereading Thompson, it is serious fun to come to Owl Farm and hear the sound of his typewriter, moving once again under my fingers. I come away thinking that his voice too, leaping from every page with righteous anger, is still needed.</p> <p>Before I leave, I tell Anita how meditative I found walking the labyrinth. \u201cIt\u2019s a really powerful spot,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a tattoo. You pin something very painful to the earth and it frees your mind. All labyrinths serve the same purpose, which is to centre you and set you in the present moment. As Hunter said, we only have the present moment, and it\u2019s so easy to get out of it. The future can bring anxiety, the past can bring depression, but right here? Right here is good.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 The cabin is no longer on Airbnb.

In April, Thompson\u2019s widow, Anita, began renting out the writer\u2019s cabin to help support the Hunter S Thompson scholarship for veterans at Columbia University, where both she and Hunter studied. It sits beside the main Thompson home on a 17-hectare estate marked with hoof prints and elk droppings that gradually rises towards a mountain range. A short walk uphill is the spot where Thompson\u2019s ashes were fired into the sky from a 153ft tower in the shape of a \u201cGonzo fist\u201d, a logo he first adopted during his unsuccessful 1970 campaign to be sheriff of nearby Aspen. Johnny Depp, who played Thompson in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, picked up the $3m tab for that elaborate sendoff, which took place shortly after Thompson killed himself in 2005. There is still a piece of rebar buried in the ground where the tower once stood. It now marks the heart of a labyrinth, picked out in red rocks that were placed there by Anita several years ago. Walking there during the day, I found myself lulled into a state of meditation. It was reading Thompson as a teenager that made me want to write for a living. Like many, my gateway drug was Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, his vicious satirical broadside against the American dream that begins with the line: \u201cWe were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold.\u201d There is, I realise now, a certain irony to the fact that a journey beginning with that debauched and hallucinatory tale has brought me to one of the most serene and peaceful places I\u2019ve been. While sitting at the typewriter, I glance out the window and see a lone white-tailed deer standing on the ridge just above Thompson\u2019s cherry-red Pontiac Grand Ville. In the afternoon, Anita shows me around their home, including the kitchen that was once his \u201ccommand centre\u201d. Another typewriter remains where he left it, engulfed in a snowdrift of books and papers. Indeed, the whole room is largely unchanged, part of Anita\u2019s plans to preserve the home as a museum. She met Thompson in 1997, when he saved her from being mauled by a pair of crazed great danes on the boardwalk of Venice Beach in LA. At least, that\u2019s the way he tells it in his sort-of memoir Kingdom of Fear, published in 2003. In truth, they were introduced by a mutual friend: she had a question about football and the friend thought Thompson, then primarily a sportswriter, would know the answer. She had no idea who he was. \u201cI was 25 and I had an instant crush on him,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d never met anyone like him. I knew him as Hunter before I knew him as a writer. He was an intense and kind person. When I met him, he wasn\u2019t a wild partier. He wasn\u2019t a Raoul Duke character.\u201d That\u2019s his drug-snorting alter ego, the name he gives himself in Fear and Loathing. \u201cWhen he was under stress or having a lot of fun, that character would come out, but generally he was just like you and me. Having said that, he did have a way of consuming more food, more alcohol and more drugs than anybody I\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 and still be able to function.\u201d Anita helped Thompson get back to writing in the last half-decade of his life; he produced as much work in those five years as he had in the previous 15. That included a regular column for sports network ESPN that included a startlingly prescient piece, published the day after 9/11, that predicted the US military follies that would define the decade to come. In 2001, he also returned to campaigning journalism with his battle to free Lisl Auman, a Colorado woman convicted of murdering a police officer even though she had been handcuffed in the police car when the shot was fired by her companion. The supreme court overturned her conviction two weeks after Thompson died. \u201cIt was bittersweet for all of us,\u201d says Anita. These days, Anita finds herself charged with preserving her husband\u2019s legacy. There have been rumours of TV shows, a film adaptation of his 1983 Hawaiian escapade The Curse of Lono, even a branded cannabis line, but she is understandably cautious. \u201cI try to steer the conversation back to his writing, because there\u2019s always a focus on his lifestyle,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the clickbait, but it\u2019s the writing that\u2019s important. We need him now more than ever, and his work is so poignant and personal. He\u2019s always in the present moment. In every story, he\u2019s showing you what it felt like, all the smells and sensations. Every time you read a page, it makes you more empowered today, in 2019, whether you\u2019re reading about the 1970s or 2003.\u201d I have worked as a journalist for the best part of a decade now, and there are elements of Thompson\u2019s mythology I can no longer romanticise. There\u2019s a section of Fear and Loathing that begins with this editor\u2019s note: \u201cThe original manuscript is so splintered that we were forced to seek out the original tape recording and transcribe it verbatim.\u201d Any illusion I once held that this was a sort of meta-joke was shattered when I read that it had been written up by Sarah Lazin, an editorial assistant at Rolling Stone in the 70s. \u201cI had done a lot of transcribing in several languages,\u201d she recalled last year in a Vanity Fair piece, \u201cbut this was pretty intense. In one of the tapes they\u2019re in this restaurant, and they\u2019re essentially torturing the waitress \u2013 yelling and screaming and throwing things \u2013 and I had no idea how to transcribe that.\u201d While that sort of behaviour may make Thompson seem like a relic from a different time, when one could be a nightmare to work with and be forgiven, his writing still resonates \u2013 some of it more noisily than ever. Unfortunately, there is nothing outdated about this observation from Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail \u201972: \u201cThe main problem in any democracy is that crowdpleasers are generally brainless swine who can go out on a stage and whup their supporters into an orgiastic frenzy \u2013 then go back to the office and sell every one of the poor bastards down the tube for a nickel apiece.\u201d A new biography, Freak Kingdom by Timothy Denevi, focuses on Thompson\u2019s incendiary writing in the decade between two seismic events in American politics: the assassination of John F Kennedy in 1963 and Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation in 1974. Denevi started writing his book after rereading Strange Rumblings in Aztlan, Thompson\u2019s 1971 Rolling Stone piece about the death of Mexican-American reporter Rub\u00e9n Salazar at the hands of the LAPD \u2013 a story that has obvious resonance both with President Trump\u2019s attacks on immigrant communities and the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cReading that piece, I began to realise that this is one of the great literary political voices of our time,\u201d says Denevi, down the line to the cabin. \u201cHe was indicting and attacking those with the most power for their dishonesty. Although I don\u2019t mention Trump or his administration, of course my book was coloured by the present corruption which shines its garbage light upon us all. Thompson understood that power is inseparable from the people who abuse it. That means you have to look at the people who are abusing it to understand its nature and how it can be manipulated, in America especially, to hurt the people who already have the least.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time Thompson\u2019s prescience has rung bells. Alex Gibney\u2019s 2008 documentary Gonzo made it clear how easily his work in the 1960s and 70s also applied to the George W Bush era. Here we are again, a decade later. History doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it does rhyme. \u201cThat\u2019s because what Thompson is really writing about is how people abuse the American system to gain more power, and that\u2019s as old as America itself,\u201d says Denevi. \u201cThompson\u2019s insight is like Mark Twain\u2019s insight, in that it lasts outside of its cultural moment. It\u2019s his logic, perspective and rigour that allows his work to fit into the Bush administration, or Reagan, or now.\u201d Having spent roughly half my life reading and rereading Thompson, it is serious fun to come to Owl Farm and hear the sound of his typewriter, moving once again under my fingers. I come away thinking that his voice too, leaping from every page with righteous anger, is still needed. Before I leave, I tell Anita how meditative I found walking the labyrinth. \u201cIt\u2019s a really powerful spot,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a tattoo. You pin something very painful to the earth and it frees your mind. All labyrinths serve the same purpose, which is to centre you and set you in the present moment. As Hunter said, we only have the present moment, and it\u2019s so easy to get out of it. The future can bring anxiety, the past can bring depression, but right here? Right here is good.\u201d \u2022 The cabin is no longer on Airbnb. New rental details here.",

Luis Camacho, Jose Gutierez, Salim Gauwloos, Carlton Wilborn, Gabriel Trupin, Kevin Stea and were all plucked from relative obscurity to become dancers on one of pop\u2019s most notorious tours. Known for its raunchy staged moments, including mimed masturbation, the Vatican objected when the tour came to Italy, calling the show \u201csinful and blasphemous\u201d. </p> <p>The dancers all spoke about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/15/dancer-carlton-wilborn-on-madonna-rehearsal-boot-camp-tour\">the brilliant time they had on tour with Madonna</a>, but once it was over some of the tensions between the star and her dancers surfaced. Trupin, Stea and Crumes eventually sued Madonna for the use of backstage footage of them in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/20/20-best-music-documentaries-ranked-rock-pop\">Truth or Dare (AKA In Bed With Madonna)</a>, the documentary that was made during the tour. The case was dismissed in 1994 after an out-of-court settlement was agreed, but the relationship with the singer was ruined. Wilborn auditioned for Madonna\u2019s 2001 Drowned world tour but was not selected as she moved on to live shows where props \u2013 like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/jul/05/artsfeatures.popandrock\">a mechanical bull which she rode on during part of the set</a> \u2013 took priority over dancers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a struggle,\u201d said Tsoi. \u201cIt\u2019s not like every month I get a big job. I have regular classes that I teach and on top I have a music video or a corporate campaign. It\u2019s extra income that\u2019s not regular. It\u2019s hard. But, ultimately, you have to throw yourself out there and attend auditions.\u201d</p>",

She went to an underground voguing event, took part and earned the respect of people in that scene. \u201cIf you\u2019re giving me blood, sweat and tears then that\u2019s better than any dollar amount,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was a dancer too and that support probably came from her own experiences.\u201d The pair danced together at live events and shot a music video, but for Auguste \u2013 who works part-time in the hospitality industry to support himself \u2013 opportunities are often fleeting, with the vague promise of \u201cexposure\u201d used as a bargaining chip even after 17 years in the industry. \u201c[Artists] pitch the exposure: \u2018Would you be interested in being a part of this, it\u2019s a great opportunity for exposure?\u2019 But in reality the talent they\u2019re already reaching out to is already exposed, they\u2019re known. We do so much more for them and they do nothing for us. They recycle dancers like they recycle looks.\u201d Auguste had a public falling out with R\u2019n\u2019B star Teyana Taylor last year after he choreographed her video for Work This Pussy. The row made its way into the pages of the New York Post\u2019s gossip column. He claimed he was given less than half the agreed amount by Taylor\u2019s team and therefore decided to pay only a select group of principal dancers. Her management team said that they would pay the dancers adding that she \u201cassumes responsibility for her projects\u201d. Strike a Pose, the 2016 documentary about the five surviving members of Madonna\u2019s backing dancers who worked with her on the Blond Ambition tour in 1990, showed the long-term impact this insecure lifestyle can have. Luis Camacho, Jose Gutierez, Salim Gauwloos, Carlton Wilborn, Gabriel Trupin, Kevin Stea and were all plucked from relative obscurity to become dancers on one of pop\u2019s most notorious tours. Known for its raunchy staged moments, including mimed masturbation, the Vatican objected when the tour came to Italy, calling the show \u201csinful and blasphemous\u201d. The dancers all spoke about the brilliant time they had on tour with Madonna, but once it was over some of the tensions between the star and her dancers surfaced. Trupin, Stea and Crumes eventually sued Madonna for the use of backstage footage of them in Truth or Dare (AKA In Bed With Madonna), the documentary that was made during the tour. The case was dismissed in 1994 after an out-of-court settlement was agreed, but the relationship with the singer was ruined. Wilborn auditioned for Madonna\u2019s 2001 Drowned world tour but was not selected as she moved on to live shows where props \u2013 like a mechanical bull which she rode on during part of the set \u2013 took priority over dancers. \u201cIt\u2019s a struggle,\u201d said Tsoi. \u201cIt\u2019s not like every month I get a big job. I have regular classes that I teach and on top I have a music video or a corporate campaign. It\u2019s extra income that\u2019s not regular. It\u2019s hard. But, ultimately, you have to throw yourself out there and attend auditions.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A cryptocurrency exchange in Tokyo has halted services after it lost $32m (\u00a325m) in the latest apparent hack on volatile virtual monies. Remixpoint, which runs the Bitpoint Japan exchange, discovered that about \u00a53.5bn in various digital currencies had gone missing from under its management. The apparent hack emerged after an error appeared in the firm\u2019s outgoing funds transfer system on Thursday night. It said the cryptocurrency went missing from a so-called hot wallet, which is connected to the internet, but that currency held in cold wallets that are offline was not affected. The exchange handles various virtual currencies, including bitcoin, ethereum and ripple. Remixpoint said it was analysing the loss and gave no further details on the incident. This is the latest hack involving cryptocurrencies, which have become synonymous with vast fluctuations in value, being used in criminality and frequent theft through hacks. Last year, Japan\u2019s Coincheck was hacked and more than $500m-worth of digital currency stolen. In 2017 the South Korean exchange Youbit shut down and filed for bankruptcy after being hacked twice. The Tokyo-based MtGox exchange, which at one time handled almost 80% of all global bitcoin transactions, was shut down in 2014 after 850,000 bitcoins (worth half a billion US dollars at the time) disappeared from its virtual vaults. The Financial Conduct Authority has proposed a ban on financial instruments linked to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, warning that such products could cause huge losses for retail consumers unlikely to understand their risks or value. Remixpoint said it would compensate customers for the losses. About \u00a52.5bn-worth of the missing currency was customer funds, with the rest owned by the firm. Shares in Remixpoint plunged almost 20% after the announcement. Japan has been relatively open to cryptocurrencies, which use a technology called blockchain, despite the high-profile heists.

Manuel Pellegrini desperately needs a striker after allowing Marko Arnautovic to join Shanghai SIPG for \u00a322.4m this week and was hopeful of landing G\u00f3mez, only for the Uruguayan to choose Valencia. West Ham released Andy Carroll and sold Lucas P\u00e9rez to Alav\u00e9s before deciding to cut their losses on Arnautovic, leaving them with Javier Hern\u00e1ndez and Jordan Hugill as their only senior forwards. That has placed them under pressure to bring in reinforcements and they were prepared to break their transfer record to sign G\u00f3mez for \u20ac50m (\u00a344.5m). G\u00f3mez\u2019s snub came as a major disappointment to Pellegrini, who had targeted the 22-year-old since January, but West Ham have looked to move on quickly and have since stepped up their interest in Haller. They have held talks with Frankfurt over a potential \u00a340m deal for the highly rated 25-year-old, who has been identified by Manchester United as a potential replacement for Romelu Lukaku if the Belgian striker moves to Internazionale. Haller\u2019s representatives are waiting to see whether West Ham can agree a fee with the Bundesliga side. It also remains to be seen whether West Ham can convince Haller to move to the London Stadium. There is a feeling that the former France Under-21 international, who has scored 33 goals in 77 appearances since joining Frankfurt from Utrecht two years ago, could want to see whether he receives offers from clubs who have qualified for next season\u2019s Champions League. West Ham have signed Pablo Fornals from Villarreal from \u00a324m and brought in two goalkeepers, Roberto and David Martin, on frees.",

The sea was 50 metres deep and once covered 3,000sq km of what is now the world\u2019s biggest sand desert. The marine sediment it left behind is filled with fossils, which allowed thescientists who published the study to build up a picture of a region that teemed with life. Between 100m and 50m years ago, today\u2019s arid, boulder-strewn northern Mali \u201clooked more like modern Puerto Rico\u201d; the sun shone on some of the earliest mangroves, and molluscs lined the shallow seabed, according to Maureen O\u2019Leary, the palaeontologist who led the study.

She said significant paleontological riches were buried under the sands of northern Mali, and there was also extensive archaeological work to be done, but the security situation that had left so many Malians dead or displaced meant this work would be on hold indefinitely. \u201cThis is such a terrible thing to happen to such an interesting country with such a rich legacy. I hope that by telling our scientific story, it gets the word out that there\u2019s many important and interesting things to be known about Mali that are probably not that well understood. There\u2019s a tremendous amount of scientific work to be done there and it\u2019s impossible.\u201d The study builds on the work of British expeditions to Mali in the 1980s which, among other things, had discovered but not written about a large turtle shell and an important collection of fossils. The collected fossils remain Mali\u2019s property, but are on loan to the American Museum of Natural History for scientific study. O\u2019Leary said the fact that the Sahara was once under water showed there was a precedent for climate change and sea level rises that should give climate deniers pause for thought. \u201cHopefully, by understanding these historical examples, in the current dialogue people can be more accepting that what scientists are telling them is true, and that not only is it true, but there are historical examples of much greater magnitude where the planet has changed,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps talking about human-induced climate change seems like \u2018Oh, is this the first time\u2019. It\u2019s not the first time. There\u2019s been a lot of change in Earth\u2019s history. And understanding those examples may make it more palatable to people, set their expectations differently.\u201d",

Decora is an explosion of bright colours and accessories, making wearers look like walking rainbows. \u201cKawaii culture and J-fashion has always been an aspect of the event we\u2019ve fostered and encouraged, with exhibitors such as Tofu Cute and the J-fashion community,\u201d says festival director Ken dos Remedios. \u201cWhen we started in 2010, it was a minor subculture that only a few knew about. Since then, it\u2019s grown to where most of our attendees know about it and it has a strong following on social media. We\u2019ve noticed it moving from a subculture enjoyed by a minority in the know, to a subculture with the ability to influence fashion beyond its immediate community.\u201d Kiri Raimona from Tofu Cute, a kawaii store based in the UK, says: \u201cKawaii culture has boomed over the past 10 years, with exposure to all things kawaii becoming more accessible than ever before. People of all ages are exploring bright colours and cute characters, adapting them into their everyday lives.\u201d This year, there is a new addition to the fashion and kawaii zone \u2013 the Hyper Kawaii Contest. Artists and crafters have been given the chance to submit their handmade kawaii or Japan-inspired work via Instagram in the months leading up to the event. The finalists\u2019 work will be on display for festival visitors to vote on, and the winner will receive prizes including a kawaii subscription box service and an instant camera. The festival also provides a place for J-fashion enthusiasts to socialise, show off their outfits and get inspiration for future looks. On Saturday and Sunday, there will be two fashion shows featuring festival attendees who were selected by organisers after submitting their looks online. The J-Style Collection fashion show has previously featured guests from Japan, such as fashion designer Kurebayashi, who is also a model for yamikawaii (\u201cdark cute\u201d) brand Listen Flavor. Tickets to the 10th anniversary of Hyper Japan cost \u00a350 for a three-day pass, with day tickets also available.",

When European colonizers ventured to Africa, Asia, North and South America, they invariably plundered the local natural resources, damaged habitats, hunted species to extinction and often forced human inhabitants into slavery. Undergirding European colonialism was the assumption that everything on the earth was meant to be extracted, bought and sold \u2013 and to make an elite minority very rich. In the eyes of the colonizers, the \u201cnew\u201d lands they encountered had no owners \u2013 no one had purchased them with a recognizable currency or could prove ownership with property records \u2013 so it was free pickings. Along with this attitude came the idea that nothing \u2013 not air, not water, not trees, not animals \u2013 was sacred or priceless.</p> <p>Colonialism\u2019s mindset of heedless extraction, greed and human exploitation not only planted the seeds of today\u2019s climate crisis, it remains visible in the crisis\u2019s central injustice: although the poor are responsible for only a tiny share of humanity\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, they generally suffer first and worst from the heatwaves, droughts, storms, rising seas and other effects of those emissions. Most countries in Asia, Africa and South America that endured centuries of colonization remain relatively poor today, and even countries like India and China whose prosperity is increasing emit much less per capita than do the rich countries in North America and Europe. Extreme weather and other climate impacts strike all over the world, but the rich are better positioned to withstand those impacts. The rich have the money to build seawalls, for example, and to operate satellites that warn about an impending hurricane so coastal dwellers can retreat to safety. And when disaster strikes, nonwhite or non-affluent communities are often shortchanged during relief efforts. After Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005, black homeowners received $8,000 less per family in government resettlement aid than did <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/business/worldbusiness/02iht-orleans.4.7353442.html\">white homeowners</a>. Which helps explain why, even eight years after the storm, roughly 80% of the mostly black residents of the city\u2019s Lower Ninth ward <a href=\"https://talkpoverty.org/2016/08/29/white-new-orleans-recovered-hurricane-katrina-black-new-orleans-not/\">had not returned</a>.</p> <p>That brings us to the next system of oppression driving today\u2019s climate crisis \u2013 racism. Study after study has shown that people of color and those living in poverty are exposed to higher levels of environmental pollution and suffer commensurately greater health problems. More than half of the residents within two miles of toxic waste facilities in the United States are <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/news/2016/04/25/136361/5-things-to-know-about-communities-of-color-and-environmental-justice/\">people of color</a>, according to a study by the Natural Resources Defense Council. People of color are nearly twice as likely as white people to live close to an <a href=\"https://www.foreffectivegov.org/shadow-of-danger\">industrial facility</a>, a report by the Center for Effective Government found. People who lived close to industrial facilities and waste sites in the Bronx borough of New York City were 66% more likely<strong> </strong>to be hospitalized for asthma, according to the <a href=\"https://medium.com/asthma-in-the-south-bronx/asthma-by-the-numbers-73553b2c9621\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p> <p>Why are the vast majority of fossil fuel production sites located in low income or immigrant or communities of color? Because these people have long been victimized by racism, and their perceived powerlessness makes them easy targets for the corporations that operate those facilities and the governments that permit them. By contrast, wealthy white citizens tend to have the money and power to keep such projects out of their neighborhoods. Take the Dakota Access pipeline, a project designed to transport up to half a million barrels of crude oil daily from North Dakota to Illinois. As <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/previously-proposed-route-dakota-access-pipeline-rejected/story?id=43274356\">ABC News reported</a>, that pipeline was originally set to be built through a majority white community, Bismarck, North Dakota, but when that community rejected it, the pipeline was rerouted through indigenous land. Jesse Jackson, who joined the protests against the rerouting, called it \u201cthe ripest case of environmental racism I\u2019ve seen in a long time\u201d.</p> <p>On top of colonialism and racism, the third system of oppression shaping the climate crisis is patriarchy. Simply put, women are more affected by climate disruption than men are. The UN\u2019s Gateway on Gender Equality and Empowerment <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-43294221\">project has documented that 80% of the people displaced by climate disasters are female</a>. Women\u2019s roles as primary caregivers and providers of food and fuel make us more vulnerable when flooding and drought occur. In central Africa, where up to 90% of Lake Chad has disappeared, nomadic indigenous <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-43294221\">women are particularly at risk</a>. As the lake\u2019s shoreline recedes, women have to walk much further to collect water. With dry seasons becoming longer, women are forced to work harder to feed and care for their families. In addition, <a href=\"http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2017/11/news-un-women-and-the-world-bank-unveil-new-data-analysis-on-women-and-poverty\">women worldwide are more likely to be living in poverty</a>, so it\u2019s more difficult for them to recover after climate-related and other disasters.</p> <p>This is how systems of oppression intertwine with the climate crisis. People of color, women, poor people, disabled people, queer people, homeless people \u2013 pretty much everyone who is already vulnerable is disproportionately at risk from climate disruption.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We must speak truth to power, call out these systems of oppression and put social justice at the center of our fight for a livable future</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Which is why the climate crisis demands bigger solutions than we initially thought.

      "bodyText": "Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief executive has criticised two managers who ordered upmarket tailors to their London office on Monday as the lender was announcing 18,000 job losses worldwide. \u201cI can\u2019t understand that someone would call tailors to fit suits on Monday. On the same day, we had to tell many colleagues in share trading that they had to leave,\u201d Christian Sewing told the German business daily Handelsblatt. \u201cI expect the two colleagues won\u2019t forget my call,\u201d he added, saying the London managers\u2019 behaviour \u201cin no way corresponds with our values\u201d. After two men carrying suit bags were spotted leaving the Deutsche Bank premises earlier this week, it emerged that they were from Fielding &amp; Nicholson, an upmarket tailor. Ian Fielding-Calcutt, the tailor\u2019s founder, and Alex Riley were there to fit suits for senior managers \u2013 just as the bank announced plans to cut a fifth of its global workforce. Deutsche Bank employs 7,000 people in London; some analysts believe up to 3,000 jobs could go from its City operations. \u201cOur timing was not great,\u201d Fielding-Calcutt told Financial News this week. \u201cI think a lot of the people getting laid off were traders of some sort, who don\u2019t wear suits, and so we just went ahead as normal with our clients, who obviously weren\u2019t affected by the cuts.\u201d Fielding &amp; Nicholson suits take up to eight weeks to make and prices start at \u00a31,200. Financial News also reported on Friday that Deutsche was scaling back redundancy packages for hundreds of its City staff as it tried to rein in costs during the shrinking of its investment business. The lender is reportedly offering staff the legally required minimum of one week\u2019s salary for every year worked until the age of 41, while older workers are offered one and a half weeks\u2019 worth. However, Deutsche is said to have previously paid out a month\u2019s salary for every year of service. Staff being let go in the first wave of cuts are also reportedly being paid a lump sum covering salary equal to the three-month notice period they would have otherwise worked. That is on top of a one-off payment of less than 10% of salary. Deutsche Bank told the Guardian that it pays above the legally required minimum for redundancy pay, but refused to comment further on the packages being offered to staff. As well as carrying out 18,000 job cuts by 2022, Deutsche is retreating from most share-trading activity as it slashes an investment banking business that expanded at breakneck pace in the years before the financial crisis. Under Sewing and the previous chief executive, Deutsche Bank has struggled to rectify an image that has been tarnished by a slew of costly scandals, over a range of issues including mis-selling mortgage-backed debt and failing to prevent Russian money laundering, which have resulted in multi-billion-dollar fines and settlements. In the latest blow to the bank\u2019s reputation, US officials announced this week that they are investigating whether Deutsche Bank violated foreign corruption or anti-money-laundering laws while working for the scandal-hit Malaysian state development fund, 1MDB.

      "body": "<p>As a travel writer (and therefore frequent flier), I\u2019m always keen to start exploring a new destination straight off the plane. That\u2019s why I think Nantes, which is just a short flight from the UK, makes an ideal weekend break destination. Here\u2019s how to maximise your time there, from touchdown to takeoff.</p> <p><strong>Ensure a smooth arrival<br></strong>Nantes airport is located in Bouguenais, a small town about six miles from the city, so you\u2019ll need a taxi or bus ride into the centre. Taxis from Bouguenais cost around \u20ac30, while the shuttle bus (\u20ac9) departs every 20 minutes and takes only half an hour to arrive in Nantes. Rather drive? Car hire companies are located in a building opposite the main terminal. There\u2019s a self-service fuel station by the entrance to the rental return \u2013 essential info if you\u2019ve ever driven around France shouting \u201cwhy are there no service stations?\u201d when you\u2019re desperate to fill your tank and return your car.</p> <p><strong>Make drinks the first stop<br></strong>There\u2019s nothing like wheeling your suitcase out of the office doors and knowing you\u2019ll be miles away in just a couple of hours. Catch the 3pm flight from Gatwick and you\u2019ll be landing by 5:25pm, with plenty of time to find a suitable bistro for drinks. Check out Caf\u00e9 de l\u2019Orangerie \u2013 hidden behind a park near the bus drop-off point, it\u2019s a convenient and pretty place to sample local beers and wines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f1fd76bd85a31544085c54c2534164fce1a994e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f1fd76bd85a31544085c54c2534164fce1a994e/0_247_3639_2184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 0809 Cafe de L\u201dOrangerie, Nantes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caf\u00e9 de l\u2019Orangerie is a pretty spot for drinks</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tick off the main attraction<br></strong>When you get to the city centre, make a beeline for <a href=\"https://www.lesmachines-nantes.fr/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Machines de L\u2019\u00eele</a>, Nantes\u2019 most famous attraction.

      "bodyText": "As a travel writer (and therefore frequent flier), I\u2019m always keen to start exploring a new destination straight off the plane. That\u2019s why I think Nantes, which is just a short flight from the UK, makes an ideal weekend break destination. Here\u2019s how to maximise your time there, from touchdown to takeoff. Ensure a smooth arrival Nantes airport is located in Bouguenais, a small town about six miles from the city, so you\u2019ll need a taxi or bus ride into the centre. Taxis from Bouguenais cost around \u20ac30, while the shuttle bus (\u20ac9) departs every 20 minutes and takes only half an hour to arrive in Nantes. Rather drive? Car hire companies are located in a building opposite the main terminal. There\u2019s a self-service fuel station by the entrance to the rental return \u2013 essential info if you\u2019ve ever driven around France shouting \u201cwhy are there no service stations?\u201d when you\u2019re desperate to fill your tank and return your car. Make drinks the first stop There\u2019s nothing like wheeling your suitcase out of the office doors and knowing you\u2019ll be miles away in just a couple of hours. Catch the 3pm flight from Gatwick and you\u2019ll be landing by 5:25pm, with plenty of time to find a suitable bistro for drinks. Check out Caf\u00e9 de l\u2019Orangerie \u2013 hidden behind a park near the bus drop-off point, it\u2019s a convenient and pretty place to sample local beers and wines. Tick off the main attraction When you get to the city centre, make a beeline for Machines de L\u2019\u00eele, Nantes\u2019 most famous attraction. Hop on a tram (line 1) from the centre of town and you\u2019ll soon be marvelling at mechanical spiders the size of a car and giant ants, plus hitching a 30-minute ride on a four-storey steel elephant.

      "body": "<p>Berlin, Barcelona, Amsterdam: we\u2019re spoilt for choice when it comes to artistic hotspots in Europe. But if you want to get off the well-trodden track for your fix of avant-garde installations, world-class collections and spectacular street art, then look to western France. Since the late 1980s, the formerly low-key town of Nantes has been making cultural waves thanks to the vision of artistic director Jean Blaise and Nantes\u2019 then-mayor Jean-Marc Ayrault, who decreed that artistic events should be free, and take place outdoors or in public spaces. Today, it\u2019s filled with creatives, mavericks and idealists, who have transformed the city into a destination buzzing with imagination and ingenuity \u2013 especially in the summer, when the two-month <a href=\"https://www.levoyageanantes.fr/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Voyage \u00e0 Nantes</a> celebration kicks off. Here\u2019s your arts and culture hitlist.</p> <p><strong>Le Lieu Unique<br></strong>Blaise founded this contemporary <a href=\"http://www.lelieuunique.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">music and arts venue</a> in a former biscuit factory in 2000. Its magnificent art nouveau exterior \u2013 note the iconic external tower \u2013 houses a range of performance and exhibition spaces. The extensive event programme regularly covers everything from visual arts to theatre, dance, literature, philosophy and architecture, and inside you\u2019ll also find a bookshop, bar, restaurant, day nursery and even a hammam. Groovy.</p> <p><strong>The Estuaire art trail<br></strong>This <a href=\"http://www.estuaire.info/en/estuaire/\" rel=\"nofollow\">permanent, open-air collection of 30 original artworks</a> was originally established in 2007 and takes you all the way from Nantes\u2019 town centre along the Loire estuary (with works on both sides of the river) to the port town of Saint-Nazaire. You can explore them on foot, or by bike, car or, during the summer, by boat, where you\u2019ll come across anything from a semi-submerged house to a 12ft-tall metal tree. The international featured artists include Daniel Buren, Tadashi Kawamata, Atelier Van Lieshout and Mrzyk &amp; Moriceau. It\u2019s also a particularly scenic way to experience art, as you\u2019ll get the chance to observe river wildlife as well as the region\u2019s maritime heritage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"514809e96d938043098a2f67f378068d474cf752\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/514809e96d938043098a2f67f378068d474cf752/0_0_4256_2420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"6350 - Quai du village de Trentemoult.

It, too, has a respectable artistic pedigree, being home to more than 30 professional artists and their workshops. Here, you\u2019ll find sculptors, photographers, ceramicists and illustrators, who all work and live in an informal community, based in gardens, outhouses, or even old boatyards. The appeal comes from strolling around the village\u2019s network of old streets, identifying each studio or workshop as you pass, and having a chat or just a peek inside. Drop in on contemporary mosaicist Ana\u00efs Landes, or check out the self-defined \u201csilly sculptures\u201d of Siobhan Gately.</p> <p><strong>Street art<br></strong>Nantes has designated particular areas around the city as \u201cfree spaces\u201d, where graffiti artists and muralists have carte blanche to decorate the area. Chiming with the city\u2019s vision for free, accessible art, you can find them in areas such as under the Pont Aristide-Briand at the Quai Magellan, or as reworked shop and building signs \u2013 check out the Katorza cinema, hat-maker Falbalas St Junien, or the hairdresser on Rue de Verdun. And always look up; artists Gr\u00e9goire Romanet and Gavin Pryke, in particular, are fond of locating works on high walls and above doorways.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"028d33eedf0ce3356697d85f08e80294607c7653\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/028d33eedf0ce3356697d85f08e80294607c7653/0_291_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HeHe, \u201cUndercurrent\u201d, douves du chateau des ducs de Bretagne, Nantes, dans le cadre du Voyage a Nantes 2016 \u00a9 Franck Tomps / LVAN Le Voyage \u00e0 Nantes, A Journey to Nantes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Voyage \u00e0 Nantes features a seven mile-long art trail passing through locations such as the moat of the castle of the Dukes of Brittany</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franck Tomps / LVAN</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/nantes-atlantic-loire-valley/2019/jul/12/beyond-nantes-unexpected-adventures-in-the-atlantic-loire-valley\">Beyond Nantes: unexpected adventures in the Atlantic Loire Valley</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Voyage \u00e0</strong> <strong>Nantes<br></strong>Launched in 2011, this two-month summer street festival runs from 6 July until 1<sup> </sup>September this year. \u201cThe idea was to colonise every part of town with artistic creation,\u201d says its co-founder, Blaise.

      "bodyText": "Berlin, Barcelona, Amsterdam: we\u2019re spoilt for choice when it comes to artistic hotspots in Europe. But if you want to get off the well-trodden track for your fix of avant-garde installations, world-class collections and spectacular street art, then look to western France. Since the late 1980s, the formerly low-key town of Nantes has been making cultural waves thanks to the vision of artistic director Jean Blaise and Nantes\u2019 then-mayor Jean-Marc Ayrault, who decreed that artistic events should be free, and take place outdoors or in public spaces. Today, it\u2019s filled with creatives, mavericks and idealists, who have transformed the city into a destination buzzing with imagination and ingenuity \u2013 especially in the summer, when the two-month Voyage \u00e0 Nantes celebration kicks off. Here\u2019s your arts and culture hitlist. Le Lieu Unique Blaise founded this contemporary music and arts venue in a former biscuit factory in 2000. Its magnificent art nouveau exterior \u2013 note the iconic external tower \u2013 houses a range of performance and exhibition spaces. The extensive event programme regularly covers everything from visual arts to theatre, dance, literature, philosophy and architecture, and inside you\u2019ll also find a bookshop, bar, restaurant, day nursery and even a hammam. Groovy. The Estuaire art trail This permanent, open-air collection of 30 original artworks was originally established in 2007 and takes you all the way from Nantes\u2019 town centre along the Loire estuary (with works on both sides of the river) to the port town of Saint-Nazaire. You can explore them on foot, or by bike, car or, during the summer, by boat, where you\u2019ll come across anything from a semi-submerged house to a 12ft-tall metal tree. The international featured artists include Daniel Buren, Tadashi Kawamata, Atelier Van Lieshout and Mrzyk &amp; Moriceau. It\u2019s also a particularly scenic way to experience art, as you\u2019ll get the chance to observe river wildlife as well as the region\u2019s maritime heritage. Trentemoult Just a short trip across the Loire by Navibus is the former fishing village of Trentemoult, recognisable for the distinctive, red-tiled roofs of its buildings. It, too, has a respectable artistic pedigree, being home to more than 30 professional artists and their workshops. Here, you\u2019ll find sculptors, photographers, ceramicists and illustrators, who all work and live in an informal community, based in gardens, outhouses, or even old boatyards. The appeal comes from strolling around the village\u2019s network of old streets, identifying each studio or workshop as you pass, and having a chat or just a peek inside. Drop in on contemporary mosaicist Ana\u00efs Landes, or check out the self-defined \u201csilly sculptures\u201d of Siobhan Gately. Street art Nantes has designated particular areas around the city as \u201cfree spaces\u201d, where graffiti artists and muralists have carte blanche to decorate the area. Chiming with the city\u2019s vision for free, accessible art, you can find them in areas such as under the Pont Aristide-Briand at the Quai Magellan, or as reworked shop and building signs \u2013 check out the Katorza cinema, hat-maker Falbalas St Junien, or the hairdresser on Rue de Verdun. And always look up; artists Gr\u00e9goire Romanet and Gavin Pryke, in particular, are fond of locating works on high walls and above doorways. Voyage \u00e0 Nantes Launched in 2011, this two-month summer street festival runs from 6 July until 1 September this year. \u201cThe idea was to colonise every part of town with artistic creation,\u201d says its co-founder, Blaise. The city\u2019s annual showpiece, it includes a seven mile-long arts trail marked by a green line, which leads through various sights and heritage locations, such as the lively Talensac food market, the moat of the castle of the Dukes of Brittany, and the museum dedicated to the city\u2019s famous son, Jules Verne. In addition to the acts and events, museums will stay open late with free admission, and there will be a series of live music performances scattered throughout town. Machines de L\u2019\u00eele, one of the city\u2019s best-known attractions, featuring a menagerie of mechanical animals, will be showcasing new prototypes of its most ambitious project to date, the Heron Tree \u2013 a giant arboreal sculpture alive with mechanical birds. Le Cantine du Voyage The festival\u2019s lively restaurant returns to the banks of the Loire in a collapsible greenhouse. For the fifth year running, it\u2019s been decorated by hip, Nantes-based arts collective Appelle Moi Papa (call me daddy), five graphic designers who work with musicians such as Christine and the Queens.

Her breathy but sharp delivery draws you into nightmarish Gilead from the get go. Flights by Olga Tokarczuk, translated by Jennifer Croft, read by Clare Corbett (Audible) Currently an Audible exclusive, this audiobook of the 2018 Man Booker International prize winner is read beautifully by Corbett, who captures the playfulness and grace of Tokarczuk\u2019s writing across a range of stories about 21st-century travel and human anatomy. Mortimer &amp; Whitehouse: Gone Fishing by Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse, read by the authors (Blink) Like Jaws, here\u2019s a story that isn\u2019t really about the fish. In the audiobook, Mortimer and Whitehouse natter on in the most enjoyable, natural way about mortality and friendship, with plenty of off-page asides and affectionate nitpicking. Stay Sexy and Don\u2019t Get Murdered by Georgia Hardstark and Karen Kilgariff, read by the authors (Orion) If you love the My Favourite Murder podcast and don\u2019t mind missing out on the few pages of family and pet photos in the book, this is the option for you.

Chase Darkness With Me by Billy Jensen, read by the author (Audible) This memoir is currently an audiobook \u2013 and Audible \u2013 exclusive, with a print version to follow in August. Exhausted by his career as a journalist, Jensen decided to focus on reporting cold cases \u2013 then began solving them himself. His accounts of his cases and his methodology are utterly fascinating. One for any true crime fan. Airhead by Emily Maitlis, read by the author (Penguin Books) The Newsnight presenter reads her memoirs with her usual dignified delivery, but with just enough emotion to make this worth downloading. Her amusing, internal asides during interviews with Simon Cowell and Bill Clinton have something wonderfully gossipy about them. A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man by James Joyce, read by Colin Farrell (Audible) Some have argued that Joyce is best enjoyed read aloud; and Farrell shows off his acting chops in this new interpretation, his lilting tones suiting the musicality of Joyce\u2019s writing perfectly. My Sister, the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite, read by Weruche Opia (Whole Story Books) Shortlisted for this year\u2019s Women\u2019s prize for fiction, this darkly funny tale, about a young woman dealing with her sister Ayoola\u2019s taste for murdering boyfriends is sharp as nails. Opia\u2019s performance is light and fresh, her handling of Braithwaite\u2019s comic dialogue particularly vibrant. How to Be a Woman by Caitlin Moran, read by author and cast (BBC) This abridged dramatisation of Moran\u2019s bestselling book about her feminist education is read by a full BBC Radio 4 cast, with scenes from her life acted out with verve. Still extremely funny, and made even more lively by the cast. And some for little ears \u2026 How to Train Your Dragon and sequels by Cressida Cowell, read by David Tennant (Hodder Children\u2019s) The adventures of unlikely hero Hiccup, his fellow young Vikings in training and his dragon Toothless, could not be better voiced than by Tennant, enjoying every moment and evoking every stink, splash, mishap and calamity with relish. Murder Most Unladylike and sequels by Robin Stevens, read by Gemma Chan (Penguin) Gemma Chan\u2019s assured reading invites the listener to 1930s England, where indomitable schoolgirl detectives Wells and Wong investigate the mysterious death of Miss Bell at Deepdean School for Girls. The Complete Chronicles of Narnia by CS Lewis, read by Maurice Denham (BBC) A handsome full-cast production, adapted slightly from the books so that the actors carry more of the story. Perfect for whiling away long journeys or for putting on at bedtime, transporting its listeners effortlessly to Narnia. Journey to the River Sea by Eva Ibbotson, read by Penelope Rawlins (Whole Story) Ibbotson\u2019s immersive, beautiful tale of orphaned Maya, sent to live with relatives hundreds of miles up the Amazon, is voiced with impressive range by Rawlins, evoking both the lush, colourful richness of the rainforest and the compelling awfulness of Maya\u2019s cousins. Skulduggery Pleasant and sequels by Derek Landy, read by Rupert Degas (HarperAudio) Conspiratorial and atmospheric, Degas\u2019s reading brings out the humour and the horror in the perilous adventures of skeletal detective Skulduggery and his youthful associate Stephanie, aka Valkyrie, on their quest to preserve the world from the forces of evil and find justice for Stephanie\u2019s murdered uncle. \u2026 and young adults The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas, read by Bahni Turpin (HarperAudio) Thomas\u2019 award-winning 2017 debut follows 16-year-old Starr as she moves between the disparate worlds of home and school, and tries to come to terms with her friend\u2019s death. It is voiced with great verve by Bahni Turpin. La Belle Sauvage by Philip Pullman, read by Michael Sheen (Random House) This atmospheric, enthralling return to the world of His Dark Materials, full of swollen floodwaters and desperate pursuit, is brought to thrilling life by Michael Sheen, whose howling hyena daemon is particularly terrifying. Winner of the British book awards\u2019 audiobook of the year 2018. The Gifted, the Talented and Me by William Sutcliffe, read by Ryan Watson (Audible) Ryan Watson brings a down-to-earth, gleefully comic sensibility to his performance as resolutely normal Sam, abruptly plonked into the North London Academy for the Gifted and Talented, and forced to commune with his artistic side instead of playing football. Gently dysfunctional, highly entertaining. Orangeboy by Patrice Lawrence, read by Ben Bailey Smith (Hodder Children\u2019s) After a date ends in tragedy, Marlon finds himself drawn into gang culture despite his best intentions.

      "body": "<p>Andrew Solomon, in his beautiful book <em>The Noonday Demon</em>, described depression as \u201cthe aloneness within us made manifest\u201d. Love, he wrote, though it is no prophylactic against depression, \u201ccushions the mind and protects it from itself\u201d. Solomon has spoken of his husband John as having been, in some ways, the \u201ccure\u201d for his depression.</p> <p>I thought of these ideas while reading <em>Starling Days</em>, Rowan Hisayo Buchanan\u2019s second novel, which explores the relationship between depression and love. Can love save us from our unhappiest selves? Is that something we can ask of another person? How do we even pose the question?</p> <p>Mina is a young classicist and associate professor in New York: \u201cbisexual, vegetarian and on meds\u201d. She is working, sort of, on a book about female survivors in Greco-Roman myths and legends (Penelope, Psyche, Leda), an obvious parallel to her own struggles for survival. When the novel opens, Mina is standing on the George Washington Bridge, trying to will herself to jump. A police officer gets to her first, and her dutiful husband Oscar comes to retrieve her. Oscar has been here before. On their wedding night six months ago, she tried to kill herself.</p> <p>Mina has struggled for years with depression, her arms tattooed with peonies to hide the \u201cfine trellis of scars\u201d. She was an infant when her mother died, supposedly by slipping in the bath, though Mina has her doubts. Left alone with a baby in a small apartment \u201cwith cockroaches that crawled up through the toilet\u201d, her mother may well have chosen to drown herself.</p> <p>Shortly after the incident on the bridge, Oscar and Mina decide to get out of New York for a while. His Japanese father, who imports sake and beer to the US, owns some old council flats in London that need sprucing up and has asked him to oversee their renovation. This is the first Oscar has heard of the flats. He and his father aren\u2019t close; Oscar was the result of a one-night stand, and family secrets come to light as the novel unfolds.</p> <p>Once in London, he obsesses over Mina\u2019s whereabouts and moods, insisting they download the \u201cstalking app\u201d so he can see where she is in the city. Despite her recent suicide attempt, Mina has come off her meds \u2013 \u201cshe wanted to learn the floor plan of this sadness\u201d \u2013 and there are countless conversations about whether Oscar can leave her alone in the flat. But they have hardly unpacked their suitcases when, for no good reason other than that it advances the plot, Oscar heads back to the US to do a job for his father, leaving his suicidal wife alone in a dreary flat in a strange city.</p> <p>Mina knows one person in London \u2013 Phoebe, the sister of Oscar\u2019s oldest friend. Phoebe is sleeping on her brother\u2019s sofa and writing an \u201cart as lifestyle\u201d blog: \u201cLike, for example, everyone knows Georgia O\u2019Keeffe was big on flowers and deer. So, for the post about her I found this flowery shower curtain, and an enamel pin of this cute deer skull.\u201d</p> <p>In Oscar\u2019s absence, Mina and Phoebe grow close, though it\u2019s not clear how seriously we are meant to take Mina\u2019s feelings for Phoebe. Is it really about Phoebe (apart from kisses that dissolve like marshmallows, she seems to have no attractive qualities), or is Phoebe merely a sign of Mina\u2019s desperation?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For readers looking for a 'relatable' tale of struggle and survival, this book offers consolation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More broadly, it feels as if we are being directed to read the book through a feminist lens \u2013 Mina\u2019s mother and her postpartum depression, the mythical women who did or didn\u2019t survive, the female lover as restorative agent \u2013 but Mina\u2019s problems don\u2019t stem, in any immediate way, from the patriarchy. Oscar is more long-suffering than repressive.</p> <p>Building a novel around a depressed character places enormous pressure on the author to compellingly evoke bleak and repetitive mind states. The problem with <em>Starling Days</em> is that Mina\u2019s inner life is fairly banal. She keeps a list of the reasons why her presence on Earth is pointless (\u201cCan\u2019t cope with jeans \u2026 \u201d). She compares her sorrows with those of children in war zones, and deems herself spoiled. She tells Oscar that life before meeting him had felt like wandering through a shopping mall: \u201cYou know, the kind which is so big it has more than one Starbucks \u2026 And then one day there you were, like a bench.\u201d</p> <p>There are indications that Buchanan is a better writer than this work would suggest: \u201ca bald man whose head gleamed like sucked candy\u201d, a scene in the supermarket when the body parts of animals assume their full horror, a landline that rings \u201cwith the shrill importance of a baby crying\u201d. But they are overshadowed by the novel\u2019s weaker elements.</p> <p>For readers looking for a \u201crelatable\u201d tale of struggle and survival \u2013 the author includes an encouraging note at the end for those fighting their own darkness \u2013 the book offers consolation. For those wishing to derive more literary pleasures, <em>Starling Days</em> may disappoint.</p> <p><em>\u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

But they have hardly unpacked their suitcases when, for no good reason other than that it advances the plot, Oscar heads back to the US to do a job for his father, leaving his suicidal wife alone in a dreary flat in a strange city. Mina knows one person in London \u2013 Phoebe, the sister of Oscar\u2019s oldest friend. Phoebe is sleeping on her brother\u2019s sofa and writing an \u201cart as lifestyle\u201d blog: \u201cLike, for example, everyone knows Georgia O\u2019Keeffe was big on flowers and deer. So, for the post about her I found this flowery shower curtain, and an enamel pin of this cute deer skull.\u201d In Oscar\u2019s absence, Mina and Phoebe grow close, though it\u2019s not clear how seriously we are meant to take Mina\u2019s feelings for Phoebe. Is it really about Phoebe (apart from kisses that dissolve like marshmallows, she seems to have no attractive qualities), or is Phoebe merely a sign of Mina\u2019s desperation? More broadly, it feels as if we are being directed to read the book through a feminist lens \u2013 Mina\u2019s mother and her postpartum depression, the mythical women who did or didn\u2019t survive, the female lover as restorative agent \u2013 but Mina\u2019s problems don\u2019t stem, in any immediate way, from the patriarchy. Oscar is more long-suffering than repressive. Building a novel around a depressed character places enormous pressure on the author to compellingly evoke bleak and repetitive mind states. The problem with Starling Days is that Mina\u2019s inner life is fairly banal. She keeps a list of the reasons why her presence on Earth is pointless (\u201cCan\u2019t cope with jeans \u2026 \u201d). She compares her sorrows with those of children in war zones, and deems herself spoiled. She tells Oscar that life before meeting him had felt like wandering through a shopping mall: \u201cYou know, the kind which is so big it has more than one Starbucks \u2026 And then one day there you were, like a bench.\u201d There are indications that Buchanan is a better writer than this work would suggest: \u201ca bald man whose head gleamed like sucked candy\u201d, a scene in the supermarket when the body parts of animals assume their full horror, a landline that rings \u201cwith the shrill importance of a baby crying\u201d. But they are overshadowed by the novel\u2019s weaker elements. For readers looking for a \u201crelatable\u201d tale of struggle and survival \u2013 the author includes an encouraging note at the end for those fighting their own darkness \u2013 the book offers consolation. For those wishing to derive more literary pleasures, Starling Days may disappoint. \u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

I\u2019ve had to do a lot of driving over the past few years and audiobooks have regularly kept me company. But I love to underline passages in the books I\u2019m enjoying so that I can return to them later, and there\u2019s no way of doing this when the passages are being spoken and your hands are on the wheel. So I memorise idiosyncratic words in the parts I want to underline, download the text from Gutenberg when I return home, use the memorised words to search for the passages, print them out and paste them into a scrapbook. It\u2019s borderline crazy and ridiculously inefficient.</p> <p>And, yes, of course, you can find yourself drifting off while listening to an audiobook, but who hasn\u2019t found themselves doing something similar while reading a paperback of Boswell\u2019s <em>Life of Samuel Johnson</em>? I am more likely to suffer from the opposite problem. I had to give up listening to Anton Lesser reading <em>Paradise Lost</em> while driving because I would lose myself in those serpentine, Latinate sentences and come round to find myself in the fast lane of the M40.</p> <p>One advantage audiobooks have over their physical counterparts \u2013 rarely mentioned either by fans or detractors \u2013 is that the reader doesn\u2019t speed up or slow down. They force us to devote the same amount of time to each page. It is all too easy when reading a physical book to separate it unconsciously into important and less important sections, to read the latter more quickly, with less attention or to skip them altogether. As long as you don\u2019t fast forward, Juliet Stevenson will make you pay equal attention to all sections of the text and there will be sentences of real beauty and insight in those supposedly less important sections that you will not have noticed before. I now deliberately listen to audiobooks of novels I love for precisely this reason. Indeed I\u2019m tempted to say that I simply haven\u2019t read a book properly until I\u2019ve had it read to me.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Porpoise </em>by Mark Haddon is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (\u00a318.99).

But I love to underline passages in the books I\u2019m enjoying so that I can return to them later, and there\u2019s no way of doing this when the passages are being spoken and your hands are on the wheel. So I memorise idiosyncratic words in the parts I want to underline, download the text from Gutenberg when I return home, use the memorised words to search for the passages, print them out and paste them into a scrapbook. It\u2019s borderline crazy and ridiculously inefficient. And, yes, of course, you can find yourself drifting off while listening to an audiobook, but who hasn\u2019t found themselves doing something similar while reading a paperback of Boswell\u2019s Life of Samuel Johnson? I am more likely to suffer from the opposite problem. I had to give up listening to Anton Lesser reading Paradise Lost while driving because I would lose myself in those serpentine, Latinate sentences and come round to find myself in the fast lane of the M40. One advantage audiobooks have over their physical counterparts \u2013 rarely mentioned either by fans or detractors \u2013 is that the reader doesn\u2019t speed up or slow down. They force us to devote the same amount of time to each page. It is all too easy when reading a physical book to separate it unconsciously into important and less important sections, to read the latter more quickly, with less attention or to skip them altogether. As long as you don\u2019t fast forward, Juliet Stevenson will make you pay equal attention to all sections of the text and there will be sentences of real beauty and insight in those supposedly less important sections that you will not have noticed before. I now deliberately listen to audiobooks of novels I love for precisely this reason. Indeed I\u2019m tempted to say that I simply haven\u2019t read a book properly until I\u2019ve had it read to me. \u2022 The Porpoise by Mark Haddon is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (\u00a318.99).

      "body": "<p>Croatian countertenor <a href=\"https://www.cencic.com/\">Max Emanuel Cen\u010di\u0107</a>\u2019s latest Wigmore recital, with the French period ensemble <a href=\"http://www.concert-hosteldieu.com/\">Le Concert de l\u2019Hostel Dieu</a> under their harpsichordist-conductor Franck-Emmanuel Comte, surveyed the influence of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Furioso\">Ludovico Ariosto\u2019s Orlando Furioso</a> on 18th-century composers. Ariosto\u2019s epic poem, published in 1532, was immensely popular at the time, and it is unsurprising, perhaps, that opera composers of the period were repeatedly drawn to its protagonist, a Christian warrior driven slowly mad by jealous, unrequited love for the pagan princess Angelica. Cen\u010di\u0107 explored responses to Ariosto\u2019s narrative by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/antonio-vivaldi\">Vivaldi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/george-frideric-handel\">Handel</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Porpora\">Porpora</a> with his customary intelligence and dramatic flair.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LAq1fjpD4U\">His voice</a>, dark, warm and wonderfully even throughout its range, remains remarkable. His coloratura is breathtaking yet carefully deployed for dramatic effect. Fammi Combattere from Handel\u2019s Orlando was a bravura statement of military ardour, spectacularly negotiated. In Cielo! Se Tu Il Consenti, from the same work, mood and tone darkened as Orlando\u2019s uncertainty and instability set in. Cen\u010di\u0107 is equally fine in slow, expansive arias, where his breath control is exemplary and his sense of line immaculate. Gi\u00e0 l\u2019Ebro Mio Ciglio, the lullaby that closes Orlando\u2019s mad scene from Handel\u2019s opera, was deeply touching in its sad, world-weary grace. Best of all, however, was the aria with which he opened, Sol da Te, Mio Dolce Amore from Vivaldi\u2019s Orlando, in which a flute obbligato weaves its way round the vocal line, subtly undermining its calm. Cen\u010di\u0107 sang with hushed beauty of tone, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyeZVjb8ROA\">Anna Besson</a> played the flute solo with finely understated virtuosity.</p> <p>Besson was also the gracious soloist in Vivaldi\u2019s Flute Concerto in D major \u201cIl Gardellino\u201d, one of several instrumental works performed by Le Concert de L\u2019Hostel Dieu when Cen\u010di\u0107 was away from the platform. They\u2019re an engaging ensemble, their playing for the most part tautly focused and admirably clear. A couple of slips in intonation intruded upon Porpora\u2019s Sinfonia da Camera in E minor. They were at their best, though, in Vivaldi\u2019s Concerto for Strings in G minor, combining an almost jazzy brilliance with admirable sensuousness of tone and line.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Croatian countertenor Max Emanuel Cen\u010di\u0107\u2019s latest Wigmore recital, with the French period ensemble Le Concert de l\u2019Hostel Dieu under their harpsichordist-conductor Franck-Emmanuel Comte, surveyed the influence of Ludovico Ariosto\u2019s Orlando Furioso on 18th-century composers. Ariosto\u2019s epic poem, published in 1532, was immensely popular at the time, and it is unsurprising, perhaps, that opera composers of the period were repeatedly drawn to its protagonist, a Christian warrior driven slowly mad by jealous, unrequited love for the pagan princess Angelica. Cen\u010di\u0107 explored responses to Ariosto\u2019s narrative by Vivaldi, Handel and Porpora with his customary intelligence and dramatic flair. His voice, dark, warm and wonderfully even throughout its range, remains remarkable. His coloratura is breathtaking yet carefully deployed for dramatic effect. Fammi Combattere from Handel\u2019s Orlando was a bravura statement of military ardour, spectacularly negotiated. In Cielo! Se Tu Il Consenti, from the same work, mood and tone darkened as Orlando\u2019s uncertainty and instability set in. Cen\u010di\u0107 is equally fine in slow, expansive arias, where his breath control is exemplary and his sense of line immaculate. Gi\u00e0 l\u2019Ebro Mio Ciglio, the lullaby that closes Orlando\u2019s mad scene from Handel\u2019s opera, was deeply touching in its sad, world-weary grace. Best of all, however, was the aria with which he opened, Sol da Te, Mio Dolce Amore from Vivaldi\u2019s Orlando, in which a flute obbligato weaves its way round the vocal line, subtly undermining its calm. Cen\u010di\u0107 sang with hushed beauty of tone, while Anna Besson played the flute solo with finely understated virtuosity. Besson was also the gracious soloist in Vivaldi\u2019s Flute Concerto in D major \u201cIl Gardellino\u201d, one of several instrumental works performed by Le Concert de L\u2019Hostel Dieu when Cen\u010di\u0107 was away from the platform. They\u2019re an engaging ensemble, their playing for the most part tautly focused and admirably clear. A couple of slips in intonation intruded upon Porpora\u2019s Sinfonia da Camera in E minor. They were at their best, though, in Vivaldi\u2019s Concerto for Strings in G minor, combining an almost jazzy brilliance with admirable sensuousness of tone and line.",

The UK has put British shipping in the Gulf on maximum alert as fears rise that the US is pushing Britain towards confrontation with Iran, despite the UK\u2019s continued participation in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. Disabled voter access under threat from 2020 security push Russian interference in the 2016 elections, and the fear of a repeat in 2020, have left many Americans suspicious of voting technology, which explains the growing campaign for a return to unhackable, hand-marked paper ballots. But in calling for more secure measures, cybersecurity experts have come up against disability rights advocates, who said electronic voting machines offer disabled people the best access, as Jordan Wilkie reports.

Whether she means to or not, her repeated insinuations that the squad are rabble-rousing upstarts who are undermining the Democratic party helps bolster the right\u2019s vitriolic narratives about the congresswomen.

The latest culinary obsession gripping Japanese people and cafes such as Galant, which has been sustaining Tokyoites for more than 40 years, is how to perfect the art of making toast. Bread became a regular part of the Japanese diet during the lean postwar years, when bakeries churned out long white loaves of shokupan that became a staple for generations of schoolchildren. In the home, too, people raised on traditional breakfasts of rice, grilled fish and miso soup started turning to the convenience of buttered toast and coffee to start the day. While eating bread has become an established practice, the act of making a simple slice of toast is an increasingly hi-tech affair. An online search from one chain brings up hundreds of options of toasters. Top of the range is Mitsubishi Electric\u2019s Bread Oven, with a price tag of 30,000 yen (\u00a3220). The appliance, which went on the market in April, toasts a single slice of bread at a time, sealing it inside a metal box and transferring heat at high temperatures via two plates. For those who prefer to eat out, Centre the Bakery, in Tokyo\u2019s upmarket Ginza district, provides a range of toasters that diners can choose from and use at their tables.

When the Sweden team returned from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/06/england-sweden-womens-world-cup-third-place-play-off-match-report\" title=\"\">victory over England</a> that secured a bronze medal they were greeted by 30,000 fans in Gothenburg.</p> <p>\u201cA sign of a nation that is proud of us,\u201d says Asllani, the midfielder who scored her country\u2019s opening goals against Chile and England. The staggering reception came as a pleasant surprise to a squad not wholly aware of the momentum building back home during their run to the semi-finals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/11/megan-rapinoe-hate-crime-new-york-police\">Police investigate possible hate crime after slurs aimed at Megan Rapinoe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always hard to know because you\u2019re kind of in your own world,\u201d Asllani says. \u201cYou\u2019re just preparing for the next training, next game. Obviously we heard a little bit that people are like going crazy in Sweden and really watching the football in all sports bars and outdoors and we just felt like the whole country was behind us. We had our prime minister at two of our games, our prince came.</p> <p>\u201cHaving 30,000 looking so happy and proud and just celebrating our medal \u2026 it\u2019s not only our medal, we feel like the medal belongs to the whole nation and the next generation, all the young girls that really, really looked up to us and have us as role models because that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about and hopefully will get more girls to start playing football.\u201d</p> <p>It is a similar narrative from almost ever player at the World Cup: the need to inspire and push the game forward. Yet while the bronze medal helps drive that growth in Sweden, and tempers their semi-final defeat by the Netherlands in extra time, the pain of that disappointment cannot be entirely shaken.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like we could have won that game; we hit the post a couple of times,\u201d the 29-year-old Asllani says. \u201cIf I compare our team with them, we\u2019re not far away. I mean, I feel like we can compete with them.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a weird feeling because it\u2019s horrible to lose a semi-final. You always dream of playing the biggest game. But we\u2019re a team that is going to improve all the time so chances are we will be at the top there again at the next World Cup or Olympics next year.</p> <p>\u201cSo the first feeling is disappointment, the next feeling is revenge. You\u2019re kind of just longing for the next tournament with the team, which is the Olympics.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9a3cef7f54547e10e02f7aade20cddf544b22976\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a3cef7f54547e10e02f7aade20cddf544b22976/0_171_5169_3275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crowds gather in Gothenburg to welcome home the Sweden team.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"634\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crowds gather in Gothenburg to welcome home the Sweden team.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Stiller via www.imago-images.de/Imago/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asllani\u2019s winning mentality is encapsulated by her response to the England manager\u2019s \u201cnonsense\u201d remark regarding the third-place match. \u201cEvery game is important,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it surprised me to hear that; if my coach had said that I would have been surprised.\u201d</p> <p>Taking third place, after a bruising semi-final, mattered. \u201cI think if you finish fourth that\u2019s probably the worst position you can come in. I mean, you\u2019re so close to the medals. If we had lost the last game, I would have a complete different feeling now. Because then I would feel like everything we had done so far didn\u2019t matter at all.</p> <p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why I\u2019m really proud that we could come back, even though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/03/netherlands-sweden-womens-world-cup-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">we played extra time</a>, had one less rest day and we had to travel. We didn\u2019t have all the conditions, but we made the best out of it as we could. So I\u2019m just proud that we could come back after that loss against Netherlands and show in the first half against England what kind of football we want to play and that Sweden is not just a team that wants to defend.</p> <p>\u201cWe like to play attacking football and we\u2019re still building the team and trying to improve all the time. We\u2019re a strong team and we showed that the Sweden is a team that you can count on and never count out.\u201d</p> <p>In 2015 England pipped Germany to third place and the significance of returning with a bronze medal was a world away from the views expressed by Neville. Perhaps he was protecting his team after a difficult defeat by dismissing the game\u2019s importance, but it is impossible to turn away from the fact that the Lionesses\u2019 medal in Canada was a game changer for the development of women\u2019s football in England.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4e3290cf9f4aec7a2e50087c99ab9845d49595b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4e3290cf9f4aec7a2e50087c99ab9845d49595b/0_64_3282_2108/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kosovare Asllani scores against England in the third-place play-off.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kosovare Asllani scores against England in the third-place play-off.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joosep Martinson/Fifa via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asllani, whose technical, skilful box-to-box play was at heart of her country\u2019s success, hopes their bronze can be similarly catalytic for women\u2019s football in Sweden, which has historically led the way but has been overtaken by a number of European leagues.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like we\u2019ve inspired the next generation in Sweden, not only girls, but also boys,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore this World Cup I knew it was going to be the biggest, when it comes to marketing and everything, in history.</p> <p>\u201cI felt like we reached out to a completely different and new audience in Sweden. I really felt like we had Sweden behind us. I mean, it was two and a half million that watched our semi-final and we only have like nine or 10 million people in Sweden \u2013 that\u2019s a huge number for women\u2019s football.\u201d</p> <p>Asllani, whose Kosovan parents mean she is a poster girl for Sweden\u2019s immigrant communities, has played in two Olympics: London 2012 and Rio 2016, where Sweden handed the USA a shock quarter-final defeat on the way to a silver medal. They lost to Germany in that final, a result they feel they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/29/germany-sweden-womens-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">avenged in France in the quarter-final</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The significance of being one of the top three European teams at the World Cup and earning the trip to Tokyo next year is not lost on Asllani. \u201cWe\u2019re ranked ninth in the world [now sixth]. So I feel like at the end of the day we should be proud of the Olympics and a bronze medal. Obviously we always want to win but I\u2019d rather have a medal than no medal at all.\u201d</p> <p>Now, there is no time to rest. The Swedish season begins imminently. \u201cI feel like the body just wants to rest and it\u2019s not really allowed to rest so much,\u201d says the Link\u00f6pings player. \u201cIt\u2019s a really technical schedule during the World Cup, so the body says I\u2019m going to lay down. I\u2019m just going to probably need three, four days just sleeping.</p> <p>\u201cBut at the same time you have a good feeling because you know that you gave everything and it was worth it because you came home with a medal.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sweden\u2019s Kosovare Asllani has a very different view of the Women\u2019s World Cup third-place match to Phil Neville, who labelled it a \u201cnonsense\u201d game, and it is fair to say that plenty of her compatriots agree with her. When the Sweden team returned from the victory over England that secured a bronze medal they were greeted by 30,000 fans in Gothenburg. \u201cA sign of a nation that is proud of us,\u201d says Asllani, the midfielder who scored her country\u2019s opening goals against Chile and England. The staggering reception came as a pleasant surprise to a squad not wholly aware of the momentum building back home during their run to the semi-finals. \u201cIt\u2019s always hard to know because you\u2019re kind of in your own world,\u201d Asllani says. \u201cYou\u2019re just preparing for the next training, next game. Obviously we heard a little bit that people are like going crazy in Sweden and really watching the football in all sports bars and outdoors and we just felt like the whole country was behind us. We had our prime minister at two of our games, our prince came. \u201cHaving 30,000 looking so happy and proud and just celebrating our medal \u2026 it\u2019s not only our medal, we feel like the medal belongs to the whole nation and the next generation, all the young girls that really, really looked up to us and have us as role models because that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about and hopefully will get more girls to start playing football.\u201d It is a similar narrative from almost ever player at the World Cup: the need to inspire and push the game forward. Yet while the bronze medal helps drive that growth in Sweden, and tempers their semi-final defeat by the Netherlands in extra time, the pain of that disappointment cannot be entirely shaken. \u201cI feel like we could have won that game; we hit the post a couple of times,\u201d the 29-year-old Asllani says. \u201cIf I compare our team with them, we\u2019re not far away. I mean, I feel like we can compete with them. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird feeling because it\u2019s horrible to lose a semi-final. You always dream of playing the biggest game. But we\u2019re a team that is going to improve all the time so chances are we will be at the top there again at the next World Cup or Olympics next year. \u201cSo the first feeling is disappointment, the next feeling is revenge. You\u2019re kind of just longing for the next tournament with the team, which is the Olympics.\u201d Asllani\u2019s winning mentality is encapsulated by her response to the England manager\u2019s \u201cnonsense\u201d remark regarding the third-place match. \u201cEvery game is important,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it surprised me to hear that; if my coach had said that I would have been surprised.\u201d Taking third place, after a bruising semi-final, mattered. \u201cI think if you finish fourth that\u2019s probably the worst position you can come in. I mean, you\u2019re so close to the medals. If we had lost the last game, I would have a complete different feeling now. Because then I would feel like everything we had done so far didn\u2019t matter at all. \u201cSo that\u2019s why I\u2019m really proud that we could come back, even though we played extra time, had one less rest day and we had to travel. We didn\u2019t have all the conditions, but we made the best out of it as we could. So I\u2019m just proud that we could come back after that loss against Netherlands and show in the first half against England what kind of football we want to play and that Sweden is not just a team that wants to defend. \u201cWe like to play attacking football and we\u2019re still building the team and trying to improve all the time. We\u2019re a strong team and we showed that the Sweden is a team that you can count on and never count out.\u201d In 2015 England pipped Germany to third place and the significance of returning with a bronze medal was a world away from the views expressed by Neville. Perhaps he was protecting his team after a difficult defeat by dismissing the game\u2019s importance, but it is impossible to turn away from the fact that the Lionesses\u2019 medal in Canada was a game changer for the development of women\u2019s football in England. Asllani, whose technical, skilful box-to-box play was at heart of her country\u2019s success, hopes their bronze can be similarly catalytic for women\u2019s football in Sweden, which has historically led the way but has been overtaken by a number of European leagues. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve inspired the next generation in Sweden, not only girls, but also boys,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore this World Cup I knew it was going to be the biggest, when it comes to marketing and everything, in history. \u201cI felt like we reached out to a completely different and new audience in Sweden. I really felt like we had Sweden behind us. I mean, it was two and a half million that watched our semi-final and we only have like nine or 10 million people in Sweden \u2013 that\u2019s a huge number for women\u2019s football.\u201d Asllani, whose Kosovan parents mean she is a poster girl for Sweden\u2019s immigrant communities, has played in two Olympics: London 2012 and Rio 2016, where Sweden handed the USA a shock quarter-final defeat on the way to a silver medal. They lost to Germany in that final, a result they feel they avenged in France in the quarter-final. The significance of being one of the top three European teams at the World Cup and earning the trip to Tokyo next year is not lost on Asllani. \u201cWe\u2019re ranked ninth in the world [now sixth]. So I feel like at the end of the day we should be proud of the Olympics and a bronze medal. Obviously we always want to win but I\u2019d rather have a medal than no medal at all.\u201d Now, there is no time to rest. The Swedish season begins imminently. \u201cI feel like the body just wants to rest and it\u2019s not really allowed to rest so much,\u201d says the Link\u00f6pings player. \u201cIt\u2019s a really technical schedule during the World Cup, so the body says I\u2019m going to lay down. I\u2019m just going to probably need three, four days just sleeping. \u201cBut at the same time you have a good feeling because you know that you gave everything and it was worth it because you came home with a medal.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The much-rumoured return of Christoph Waltz\u2019s Blofeld to the James Bond series appears to have been confirmed after the actor was spotted at the studio where the latest film is being shot. A visitor to Pinewood Studios tipped off the Daily Mail\u2019s entertainment reporter Baz Bamigboye to the sighting, reporting that Waltz urged them not to spread news of his involvement, saying: \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen me.\u201d Waltz\u2019s name was absent from the cast list unveiled in April when shooting began in Jamaica, but it had long been suspected that his cat-stroking supervillain \u2013 confirmed alive after a helicopter crash at the end of 2015\u2019s Spectre \u2013 would reappear in the new film, scheduled for release in April 2020. However, it would seem Blofeld takes more of a backseat in Cary Fukunaga\u2019s thriller, with Rami Malek\u2019s baddie taking centre stage. Last month Malek, whose parents are Egyptian, said he would have refused to take the role if his character was involved in any religiously motivated terrorism. The plot of the film is said to follow an arc first presented in Daniel Craig\u2019s debut as 007, Casino Royale (2006), and to involve genetic engineering. Waltz is also set to play the lead in the new Woody Allen film, for which principal photography is about to begin in Spain. The actor was absent from a pre-production press conference on Tuesday.",

A second woman in the group revealed that her dad was deported as well.</p> <p>\u201cIf you include me, those were three out of four brown women on a random corner in Tucson on a Tuesday night who had their families torn apart by these policies,\u201d Livier told the Guardian.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jul/2019-07-11T22:47:23.html\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jul/2019-07-11T22:47:23.html\">map</a> </figure>  <p>Livier\u2019s own family is \u201cmixed status\u201d, meaning some members are undocumented, and during the Obama administration her brother was deported to Quer\u00e9taro, their hometown in Mexico.

If successful, the law would make Tucson the state\u2019s first \u201csanctuary city\u201d, and the first in the US to gain that status through a public vote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/02/activist-helped-migrants-retrial-scott-warren\">Activist arrested for giving migrants food and shelter faces retrial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tucson, a blue dot in a deep red state, is a college town at heart but also Arizona\u2019s second largest city. Younger and more diverse than the state\u2019s \u201csunbelt\u201d communities that cater to retirees, its progressive leanings are apparent in the many yard signs outside adobe houses and California bungalows in downtown that state messages like \u201cNo Border Wall\u201d, or \u201cHumanitarian Aid Is <em>Never</em> a Crime\u201d. An estimated two-thirds of the residents vote Democrat, leading the Arizona Daily Star to call it a \u201ctrue Democratic oasis in a Republican led state\u201d.</p> <p>Some activists, including Livier, want to codify these sentiments into policy \u2013 while serving as an example for progressive activists in more conservative parts of the state. They hope Tucson\u2019s activist community will set an example for a broader regional effort, and are seizing on the current political moment, in which national and international attention are trained on the severe treatment of migrants at the border.</p> <p>\u201cWe would not have been able to pass the sanctuary city initiative four years ago when Obama was in office,\u201d Livier said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8702f4cd66a4a3d3010d4869da2f3f7eb105fd19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8702f4cd66a4a3d3010d4869da2f3f7eb105fd19/0_0_2800_3500/800.jpg\" alt=\"Signs in Tucson, Arizona, point to the city\u2019s progressive leanings.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Signs in Tucson, Arizona, point to the city\u2019s progressive leanings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cassidy Araiza/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDonald Trump has done something no other president has done. He basically took off the pretty face of what immigration policy actually is, and people cannot believe it. Most of the time when you\u2019re out there talking to people, you can\u2019t even finish saying the word \u2018sanctuary\u2019 before they take the pen away from you and start signing.\u201d</p> <p>When it passed in 2010, SB 1070 was the most fearsome anti-illegal immigration law in the US. It empowered police officers to consider an individual\u2019s language or clothing, and even aspects of their carload, as \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d to interrogate the person\u2019s immigration status during routine stops.</p> <p>When the person suspected of being undocumented failed to prove their lawful status in the country, police were required to turn the individual over to US Customs and Border Protection.</p> <p>Federal courts later found that some aspects of the law were unconstitutional, and in 2016 the so-called \u201cshow me your papers\u201d provision became optional to enforce. But Livier said the People\u2019s Defense Initiative still receives calls nearly every other day from people whose loved ones were pulled over and questioned regarding their immigration status because they spoke accented English, looked like laborers, or drove trucks full of gardening equipment, and ended up in custody of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).</p> <p>But Tucson\u2019s rich history of immigration activism far predates the current administration \u2013 notably as an outgrowth of its many social-justice oriented religious institutions. In 1982, for example, the leaders of Southside Presbyterian Church, in one of the city\u2019s oldest Latinx and Native American barrios, announced in a news conference that they would provide sanctuary to Central American migrants in open violation of US immigration law.</p> <p>At the time Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua were ravaged by civil wars and violent revolutions that the US military and American corporations played clandestine roles in, yet most refugees \u2013 including political dissidents \u2013 were being denied asylum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09d0508e02ad84cc953f93ba4d7027a478626264\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09d0508e02ad84cc953f93ba4d7027a478626264/0_0_3500_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"El Tiradato where a vigil was held for migrants crossing the border in Tucson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">El Tiradito where a vigil was held for migrants crossing the border in Tucson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cassidy Araiza/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The undercover stings, felony charges and court battles that ensued helped inspire more than 500 other congregations around the US to join what became known as the national \u201csanctuary movement\u201d.

At the bustling office of the Florence Project, dozens of lawyers and legal assistants work to provide free legal services to people in immigration custody in Arizona. The organization began in 1989, when one lawyer and a paralegal began conducting \u201cpro se\u201d legal clinics \u2013 teaching refugees to represent themselves in asylum hearings \u2013 at an immigrant detention center in a small prison town between Tucson and Phoenix. With a staff of more than 90 people now, the Florence Project offers direct representation to children in detention, in addition to the pro se workshops for adults threatened with deportation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e448b90f815b13b47660212e87c806dc673b1293\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e448b90f815b13b47660212e87c806dc673b1293/0_0_3500_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A volunteer stands outside the dining room at Casa Alitas, a center where asylum-seekers can get fresh clothes, meals and food for the journey ahead.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A volunteer stands outside the dining room at Casa Alitas, a center where asylum-seekers can get fresh clothes, meals and food for the journey ahead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cassidy Araiza/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Newer organizations are also cropping up, maintaining many of the same traditions.

      "bodyText": "On a recent evening, immigrants\u2019 rights activist Zaira Livier stood in Tucson\u2019s Historic Fourth Avenue district, clipboard in hand, as three women approached outside the popular bar, Che\u2019s Lounge. The women hesitated to stop at first, but as Livier explained her work, the mood shifted. One of them shared that her father had been deported. A second woman in the group revealed that her dad was deported as well. \u201cIf you include me, those were three out of four brown women on a random corner in Tucson on a Tuesday night who had their families torn apart by these policies,\u201d Livier told the Guardian. Livier\u2019s own family is \u201cmixed status\u201d, meaning some members are undocumented, and during the Obama administration her brother was deported to Quer\u00e9taro, their hometown in Mexico. He was murdered in the cartel-controlled city in June 2018, his body found dumped in the street. She works as the executive director of the People\u2019s Defense Initiative, a grassroots group in the Arizona city that has petitioned to add a referendum to city ballots in November that would ban local police from questioning a person\u2019s citizenship through racial profiling \u2013 a notorious, nearly 10-year-old state law known as the \u201cshow me your papers\u201d provision. To qualify for the November ballot, the petition needed just over 9,000 signatures, and on 3 July the group submitted more than 18,000 for verification. If successful, the law would make Tucson the state\u2019s first \u201csanctuary city\u201d, and the first in the US to gain that status through a public vote. Tucson, a blue dot in a deep red state, is a college town at heart but also Arizona\u2019s second largest city. Younger and more diverse than the state\u2019s \u201csunbelt\u201d communities that cater to retirees, its progressive leanings are apparent in the many yard signs outside adobe houses and California bungalows in downtown that state messages like \u201cNo Border Wall\u201d, or \u201cHumanitarian Aid Is Never a Crime\u201d. An estimated two-thirds of the residents vote Democrat, leading the Arizona Daily Star to call it a \u201ctrue Democratic oasis in a Republican led state\u201d. Some activists, including Livier, want to codify these sentiments into policy \u2013 while serving as an example for progressive activists in more conservative parts of the state. They hope Tucson\u2019s activist community will set an example for a broader regional effort, and are seizing on the current political moment, in which national and international attention are trained on the severe treatment of migrants at the border. \u201cWe would not have been able to pass the sanctuary city initiative four years ago when Obama was in office,\u201d Livier said. \u201cDonald Trump has done something no other president has done. He basically took off the pretty face of what immigration policy actually is, and people cannot believe it. Most of the time when you\u2019re out there talking to people, you can\u2019t even finish saying the word \u2018sanctuary\u2019 before they take the pen away from you and start signing.\u201d When it passed in 2010, SB 1070 was the most fearsome anti-illegal immigration law in the US. It empowered police officers to consider an individual\u2019s language or clothing, and even aspects of their carload, as \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d to interrogate the person\u2019s immigration status during routine stops. When the person suspected of being undocumented failed to prove their lawful status in the country, police were required to turn the individual over to US Customs and Border Protection. Federal courts later found that some aspects of the law were unconstitutional, and in 2016 the so-called \u201cshow me your papers\u201d provision became optional to enforce. But Livier said the People\u2019s Defense Initiative still receives calls nearly every other day from people whose loved ones were pulled over and questioned regarding their immigration status because they spoke accented English, looked like laborers, or drove trucks full of gardening equipment, and ended up in custody of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). But Tucson\u2019s rich history of immigration activism far predates the current administration \u2013 notably as an outgrowth of its many social-justice oriented religious institutions. In 1982, for example, the leaders of Southside Presbyterian Church, in one of the city\u2019s oldest Latinx and Native American barrios, announced in a news conference that they would provide sanctuary to Central American migrants in open violation of US immigration law. At the time Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua were ravaged by civil wars and violent revolutions that the US military and American corporations played clandestine roles in, yet most refugees \u2013 including political dissidents \u2013 were being denied asylum. The undercover stings, felony charges and court battles that ensued helped inspire more than 500 other congregations around the US to join what became known as the national \u201csanctuary movement\u201d. It lasted into the 1990s. Its legacy remains today: thousands of migrants have died crossing into Arizona through dangerously hot, arid terrain, to avoid border patrol checkpoints on highways; deaths which religious groups mourn once a month at a collective vigil with guitar playing, flowers and candles. Some of the groups that formed out of this original movement are still active. At the bustling office of the Florence Project, dozens of lawyers and legal assistants work to provide free legal services to people in immigration custody in Arizona. The organization began in 1989, when one lawyer and a paralegal began conducting \u201cpro se\u201d legal clinics \u2013 teaching refugees to represent themselves in asylum hearings \u2013 at an immigrant detention center in a small prison town between Tucson and Phoenix. With a staff of more than 90 people now, the Florence Project offers direct representation to children in detention, in addition to the pro se workshops for adults threatened with deportation. Newer organizations are also cropping up, maintaining many of the same traditions. In one high-profile case that has been a source of significant local political action, federal prosecutors charged Scott Warren, a volunteer with the faith-based humanitarian organization No More Deaths, which stashes water, food and other supplies in parts of the Sonoran desert, with \u201charboring illegal aliens\u201d. Warren allowed two undocumented men to recuperate in the small house the organization uses as a staging area. By allowing the men to rest, prosecutors argue, Warren shielded them from the border patrol. A trial last month that could have seen Warren sentenced to 20 years in prison ended in a mistrial. He is scheduled to be retried in November. Following the legal charges, the organization was flooded with volunteer applications, said Maria Rodriguez, a No More Deaths spokeswoman. \u201cBorder residents are dealing with violence and atrocities that are happening in their backyard, and they\u2019re having a really innate human response to it,\u201d Rodriguez added. \u201cHumanitarian aid is a commonly held community value in the borderlands, and if you\u2019ve ever gone out on a 110-degree day in the desert it\u2019s really easy to understand why.\u201d Casa Alitas, a Catholic Community Services program of volunteer-run \u201chospitality centers\u201d in Tucson that has hosted 20,000 asylum-seekers since 2014 \u2013 12,000 of whom have arrived since January \u2013 is another popular newcomer. In the sanctuary\u2019s pews, as people go through intake, volunteer doctors and nurses begin initial medical assessments. Fresh clothes are available, meals are served three times a day, and nonperishable food bags are provided for the journey ahead.

I think of it like an above-ground underground railroad, and I\u2019m really happy to be a part of it,\u201d said Mary Pat Sullivan, a volunteer cook, who was pushing a cart of food donated by Trader Joes. By providing food, free legal aid or policy proposals, activists in the borderland city are responding to the administration\u2019s hostility toward immigrants by emphasizing a sense of community and shared humanity. \u201cThe message we want to send is exactly the opposite of the message that SB 1070 sent to all of us who were undocumented and migrants,\u201d said Livier. \u201cIt\u2019s that we\u2019re here for you, we care for you, we value you, and we want you to be safe, and to belong, and to live your life like everyone else lives their lives in Tucson.\u201d",

The Squad doesn\u2019t just consist of four people, as Pelosi condescendingly told the Times; it represents the face of a new America. It represents a challenge to the traditional power structure. That doesn\u2019t just scare bigots like Tucker Carlson, it scares the neoliberal establishment. It scares people who would never call themselves racist (they\u2019d have voted for Obama for a third time if they could have!) but who clearly have a problem with young women of color speaking their mind.

What \u201ccivility\u201d really means, in all of these discussions, of course, is servility. What unity really means is uniform acceptance of the status quo.

In some places that outlaw livestock within city limits, officials have even changed local ordinances in order to unpave the way for goat grazers.

In California, where wildfires have long been a threat, goats have worked for decades to protect coastal communities from creeping conflagrations. But worsening, deadly fire seasons across western US have inspired more communities to try managing their lands not with machines and chemicals, but with hungry animals.

From early on in his TV career, the comedian poked fun at science. In his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSZsDZ0k5AE\">1981 HBO debut</a>, he said of weather forecasts: \u201cAnd then my favourite part, the satellite photo. This is really helpful.

In The Non-Fat Yogurt, Kramer has a romantic fling in a lab and inadvertently spoils an experiment testing whether the frozen snack is as healthy as it sounds.</p> <p>Academics have written volumes about the sociology and philosophy of Seinfeld, but the role of science has been left relatively unexplored.

In 2017, Seinfeld fan and freelance scientific editor John McCool <a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/critic-at-large/opinion-why-i-published-in-a-predatory-journal-31697\">exposed the murky practices of a predatory journal</a> \u2013 one that offers publication without proper peer review in exchange for payment.

Always interested in engineering and a fan of F1, she made up her mind to pursue a career in the sport when McLaren gave a talk and brought one of Hamilton\u2019s cars to the University of Bath where she was studying mechanical engineering. \u201cI remember being completely mesmerised by it,\u201d she says. \u201cThen I thought: \u2018Oh my God, I am in the perfect position to work in motorsport.\u2019 Before then it had been a far off dream, a fantasy.\u201d</p> <p>Taken on as part of the team\u2019s graduate scheme, she is now a full-time performance engineer, putting Norris and Sainz through their paces before every race. Her enthusiasm is obvious as is the sense that this is a team now pulling together.</p> <p>\u201cThe really nice thing about working in McLaren is that there is one clear goal that everybody is pushing for; you are always trying to make the car go faster,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is much more collaborative than anything else. People are just raring to go. It\u2019s really nice to see how there is always that passion and now it is amplified. At the moment we are keeping that momentum going, keeping focused and keeping moving forward. There is real optimism here. The drivers carry that with them as well.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/may/28/ferrari-mclaren-carlos-sainz-monaco-grand-prix-leclerc\">Ferrari face reality while McLaren\u2019s progress is starting to be noted | Giles Richards</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This momentum has translated into a solid fourth in the constructors\u2019 championship in front of the Renault team who supply their engine. Even their opponents\u2019 driver, Daniel Ricciardo, has recognised the achievement. \u201cLooking at the McLarens, they\u2019re the benchmark now,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve really come on, they\u2019re the ones with that kind of package that we\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p> <p>It is a package being wielded well by both drivers but Norris in his rookie season has been outstanding. He has out-qualified Sainz, who is now in his fifth season in F1, by six to three. As well as turning in some confident, impressive performances he has proved to have the makings of the full driver. He dealt well with compromising his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/26/lewis-hamilton-monaco-grand-prix-mercedes-f1-formula-one\" title=\"\">race in Monaco</a> to help Sainz; remained cheerful in adversity after mechanical failure in Canada and fought like a demon in France to try to hold his place with an ailing car. At the last meeting in Austria he was in the mix from the off and fearless. He took third from Hamilton on the opening corner at the Red Bull Ring. Then later battled valiantly with the race winner, Max Verstappen, and made a breathtaking pass on Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen through the hairpin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/30/max-verstappen-austrian-f1-gp-charles-leclerc\" title=\"\">to ensure sixth place</a>.</p> <p>Lewis has worked with him at McLaren since his season in F2 in 2018 and is not surprised by his performances. \u201cIt\u2019s impressive that somebody that young can be so mature in this sport,\u201d she says. \u201cThe way he acts, holds himself and interacts with engineers is not that of a typical 19-year-old at all. He is so mature beyond his years. It is only when he gets out of the car and he is joking round, you realise he is a teenager. He is a different guy when he puts on the helmet.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>McLaren have seen this before when Hamilton made such an impression in his opening season, demonstrating a fearlessness of the then world champion Alonso, and that feels familiar with Norris. \u201cIn Austria seeing him in third position going toe to toe with Hamilton is not something you expect from someone in their rookie year,\u201d says Lewis. \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t phased by it; he knew he was good enough to be there and that is really great to see.\u201d</p> <p>Norris\u2019s chances of taking it to the world champion this weekend are slim, Mercedes will expect to be strong at Silverstone again but McLaren will at least be able to take pleasure in their home grand prix for the first time in years.</p>",

For me it was a case of not if but when.\u201d The 26-year-old from Nottinghamshire is at the heart of McLaren\u2019s rebuilding process. Always interested in engineering and a fan of F1, she made up her mind to pursue a career in the sport when McLaren gave a talk and brought one of Hamilton\u2019s cars to the University of Bath where she was studying mechanical engineering. \u201cI remember being completely mesmerised by it,\u201d she says. \u201cThen I thought: \u2018Oh my God, I am in the perfect position to work in motorsport.\u2019 Before then it had been a far off dream, a fantasy.\u201d Taken on as part of the team\u2019s graduate scheme, she is now a full-time performance engineer, putting Norris and Sainz through their paces before every race. Her enthusiasm is obvious as is the sense that this is a team now pulling together. \u201cThe really nice thing about working in McLaren is that there is one clear goal that everybody is pushing for; you are always trying to make the car go faster,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is much more collaborative than anything else. People are just raring to go. It\u2019s really nice to see how there is always that passion and now it is amplified. At the moment we are keeping that momentum going, keeping focused and keeping moving forward. There is real optimism here. The drivers carry that with them as well.\u201d This momentum has translated into a solid fourth in the constructors\u2019 championship in front of the Renault team who supply their engine. Even their opponents\u2019 driver, Daniel Ricciardo, has recognised the achievement. \u201cLooking at the McLarens, they\u2019re the benchmark now,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve really come on, they\u2019re the ones with that kind of package that we\u2019re looking for.\u201d It is a package being wielded well by both drivers but Norris in his rookie season has been outstanding. He has out-qualified Sainz, who is now in his fifth season in F1, by six to three. As well as turning in some confident, impressive performances he has proved to have the makings of the full driver. He dealt well with compromising his race in Monaco to help Sainz; remained cheerful in adversity after mechanical failure in Canada and fought like a demon in France to try to hold his place with an ailing car. At the last meeting in Austria he was in the mix from the off and fearless. He took third from Hamilton on the opening corner at the Red Bull Ring. Then later battled valiantly with the race winner, Max Verstappen, and made a breathtaking pass on Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen through the hairpin to ensure sixth place. Lewis has worked with him at McLaren since his season in F2 in 2018 and is not surprised by his performances. \u201cIt\u2019s impressive that somebody that young can be so mature in this sport,\u201d she says. \u201cThe way he acts, holds himself and interacts with engineers is not that of a typical 19-year-old at all. He is so mature beyond his years. It is only when he gets out of the car and he is joking round, you realise he is a teenager. He is a different guy when he puts on the helmet.\u201d McLaren have seen this before when Hamilton made such an impression in his opening season, demonstrating a fearlessness of the then world champion Alonso, and that feels familiar with Norris. \u201cIn Austria seeing him in third position going toe to toe with Hamilton is not something you expect from someone in their rookie year,\u201d says Lewis. \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t phased by it; he knew he was good enough to be there and that is really great to see.\u201d Norris\u2019s chances of taking it to the world champion this weekend are slim, Mercedes will expect to be strong at Silverstone again but McLaren will at least be able to take pleasure in their home grand prix for the first time in years.",

      "body": "<p>In 1961, I was 21 and studying civil engineering in East Germany. I was desperate to escape to the west; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/berlinwall\" title=\"\">Berlin Wall</a>, which started going up in August 1961, was becoming more impregnable every week. By winter, scores of people had been killed there or while trying to swim across the River Spree. It felt as if we were penned in, with no future at all.</p> <p>I was lucky. I managed to cross into West Berlin using a smuggled Swiss passport. I had to leave my girlfriend, Christa, and family behind, thinking I would never see them again. I\u2019d told my parents of my plan, but not Christa: I thought our relationship would be over. When I arrived in West Berlin, I had nothing but the clothes I was wearing. I got some state support as a refugee, and enrolled at another university, but I missed Christa and my family.</p> <p>By now, border procedures had tightened up, and some school friends and I decided we would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/17/the-tunnels-greg-mitchell-jfk-cold-war-berlin-wall\" title=\"\">tunnel under the wall</a> to help others get out. A friend put us in touch with other tunnel-digging students in need of manpower. We were part of a few successful projects; I had the skills to survey the tunnels, but other diggers were medical or philosophy students.</p> <p>We would make a deep pit in the soil and, as a team, dig 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in 12-hour shifts over several months. Lying on our backs, we pushed the spade in 10cm each time, and used a wagon attached to a rope to remove the dirt. The tunnels were 140 metres long, 80cm high and 80cm wide \u2013 small enough to dig quickly but big enough to turn around in. While it was claustrophobic, my real fear was the border guards and Stasi, who were listening for movement beneath the ground and digging their own tunnels to intercept ours.</p> <p>Some diggers were shot by the Stasi as they emerged in the east; one tunnel was compromised when a girl who hoped to escape was overheard by an informant. About 20 people were sent to prison for planning to escape through it. Christa was among them. I felt guilty, and angry, but there was nothing I could do. </p> <p>Over the next few years, the diggers became anonymous heroes; we couldn\u2019t tell anybody what we were doing, not even family. The most successful tunnel \u2013 later named Tunnel 57, for the number of people who escaped through it \u2013 was dug in 1964. It began in the cellar of a disused bakery and ended, by accident, in a disused outhouse in the garden of an East Berlin apartment building.</p> <p>The day of the tunnel opening, I came home to find a letter from Christa telling me she had been released early, after 16 months in prison. I sent a courier to tell her about the tunnel, with a small teddy bear she\u2019d sent me years earlier, so she\u2019d know it was me.</p> <p>That night, my job was to crawl through to East Berlin and stand in the outhouse to watch for escapees coming across the yard. They were families, couples \u2013 people we knew. The mood was quietly euphoric. Soon, a digger arrived with a woman in his arms. \u201cBe careful with this girl,\u201d he whispered, \u201cshe is so nervous.\u201d It was Christa. We embraced, but I couldn\u2019t go with her: I had to finish the job.</p> <p>On the first night, 28 people escaped. By midnight on the second night, 29 others had come through. Then two unknown men appeared; they said they needed to collect their friend, waiting around the corner. They reappeared with a border guard. Shots were fired between a digger named Christian and the guard as we raced back through the tunnel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/guardianwitness-blog/2014/nov/07/-sp-berlin-wall-readers-memories-its-hard-to-remember-how-scary-the-wall-was\">Berlin Wall \u2013 readers' memories: 'It's hard to remember how scary the Wall was'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the morning, East Berlin radio claimed agents from the west had killed a border officer. We were shocked. It was a propaganda coup for the GDR and the young guard, <a href=\"http://www.chronik-der-mauer.de/en/victims/180610/schultz-egon\" title=\"\">Egon Schultz</a>, became a martyr. Christian went to his grave thinking he had killed a man; he never forgave himself. In the 90s, the truth emerged: Schultz had been killed by friendly fire from another guard.</p> <p>Christa and I married and had a family; we lived in Frankfurt for 35 years, but I was blacklisted and couldn\u2019t go with her and the children to visit their grandparents in the GDR. In 1971, I got a job with an international consulting company, responsible for transportation projects including the Channel tunnel. It\u2019s my proudest achievement, but even that wasn\u2019t without political difficulties: then, as now, some Brits wanted to remain an island.</p> <p>Through my job, I got to see a world I could have only dreamed of while in the GDR.

A friend put us in touch with other tunnel-digging students in need of manpower. We were part of a few successful projects; I had the skills to survey the tunnels, but other diggers were medical or philosophy students. We would make a deep pit in the soil and, as a team, dig 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in 12-hour shifts over several months. Lying on our backs, we pushed the spade in 10cm each time, and used a wagon attached to a rope to remove the dirt. The tunnels were 140 metres long, 80cm high and 80cm wide \u2013 small enough to dig quickly but big enough to turn around in. While it was claustrophobic, my real fear was the border guards and Stasi, who were listening for movement beneath the ground and digging their own tunnels to intercept ours. Some diggers were shot by the Stasi as they emerged in the east; one tunnel was compromised when a girl who hoped to escape was overheard by an informant. About 20 people were sent to prison for planning to escape through it. Christa was among them. I felt guilty, and angry, but there was nothing I could do. Over the next few years, the diggers became anonymous heroes; we couldn\u2019t tell anybody what we were doing, not even family. The most successful tunnel \u2013 later named Tunnel 57, for the number of people who escaped through it \u2013 was dug in 1964. It began in the cellar of a disused bakery and ended, by accident, in a disused outhouse in the garden of an East Berlin apartment building. The day of the tunnel opening, I came home to find a letter from Christa telling me she had been released early, after 16 months in prison. I sent a courier to tell her about the tunnel, with a small teddy bear she\u2019d sent me years earlier, so she\u2019d know it was me. That night, my job was to crawl through to East Berlin and stand in the outhouse to watch for escapees coming across the yard. They were families, couples \u2013 people we knew. The mood was quietly euphoric. Soon, a digger arrived with a woman in his arms. \u201cBe careful with this girl,\u201d he whispered, \u201cshe is so nervous.\u201d It was Christa. We embraced, but I couldn\u2019t go with her: I had to finish the job. On the first night, 28 people escaped. By midnight on the second night, 29 others had come through. Then two unknown men appeared; they said they needed to collect their friend, waiting around the corner. They reappeared with a border guard. Shots were fired between a digger named Christian and the guard as we raced back through the tunnel. In the morning, East Berlin radio claimed agents from the west had killed a border officer. We were shocked. It was a propaganda coup for the GDR and the young guard, Egon Schultz, became a martyr. Christian went to his grave thinking he had killed a man; he never forgave himself. In the 90s, the truth emerged: Schultz had been killed by friendly fire from another guard. Christa and I married and had a family; we lived in Frankfurt for 35 years, but I was blacklisted and couldn\u2019t go with her and the children to visit their grandparents in the GDR. In 1971, I got a job with an international consulting company, responsible for transportation projects including the Channel tunnel. It\u2019s my proudest achievement, but even that wasn\u2019t without political difficulties: then, as now, some Brits wanted to remain an island. Through my job, I got to see a world I could have only dreamed of while in the GDR. And thanks to the Berlin tunnels, many others did, too. \u2022 As told to Nick Thompson Do you have an experience to share? Email experience@theguardian.com",

Here\u2019s the utopia playbook in four simple steps:</p> \n<h2>One: Embrace equality</h2> \n<p>The society More imagined 500 years ago was communal, with no money or private property. All Utopians would take turns to work the land, with everyone\u2019s needs met by the group\u2019s combined productivity.

Still, at the ground level, the idea of New Africa echoes More\u2019s proto-communist model. The New Africans are self-sufficient, with everyone planting crops and tending livestock for the good of the community.

At night people sleep in identical tents provided to them by the city. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b080a9e2fcfbc7006d89f18125806596649b904a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b080a9e2fcfbc7006d89f18125806596649b904a/0_210_5508_3306/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Killer Mike with Bernie Sanders and another politician.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Killer Mike with Bernie Sanders and another politician.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Lott/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cEveryone was in New Africa,\u201d says Render over the phone from the Atlanta studio where he\u2019s recording a new album with his group Run the Jewels. \u201cGay people, straight people, black people, white people. For the days that they were there, they actually cooperated. They argued, they had to solve problems, but bigger than anything \u2013 religion, school, ideology \u2013 everyone cooperated.\u201d</p> \n<p>You can see why Render\u2019s acolytes might want to start anew: 21st-century Atlanta is far from utopian. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/oct/22/black-mecca-or-most-unequal-us-city-will-the-real-atlanta-please-stand-up\">The city known as the \u201cblack mecca\u201d</a> still struggles to shake a Confederate hangover and is still politically divided by race. Recently, some of Atlanta\u2019s utopian thinkers have dreamed of new communities that are segregated by more than just geography: <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/04/the-border-battles-of-atlanta/523884/\">the Cityhood Movement</a> \u2013 in which neighbourhoods (usually rich, usually white) have seceded from the Atlanta metro area to create their own tax pool \u2013 has been shown to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/business/in-climbing-income-ladder-location-matters.html?_r=1&amp;\">exacerbate racial inequality</a>. One person\u2019s vision of of freedom puts another in a cage.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou often get this dreaming of a new society in places where racism and white supremacy have created unprecedented levels of segregation,\u201d says Alex Zamalin, professor at the University of Detroit Mercy and the author of Black Utopia: The History of an Idea from Black Nationalism to Afrofuturism.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"291e8f76ffe559d0bfc316f2163840960eac2305\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/291e8f76ffe559d0bfc316f2163840960eac2305/0_561_4852_2911/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seventh Avenue in Harlem, New York City, 1932, just after the Harlem Renaissance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seventh Avenue in Harlem, New York City, 1932, just after the Harlem Renaissance.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Zamalin compares Atlanta today to New York in the 1920s, when the Harlem Renaissance saw radical black creativity sparked partly because of segregation. Render doesn\u2019t describe New Africa as a black utopia \u2013 \u201cAll life comes from Africa. Because it started there, everyone was welcome,\u201d he says \u2013 but he\u2019s following in the tradition of black utopians who saw removing themselves as the only route to improvement.</p> \n<h2>Two: \u2026 but then worship the king</h2> \n<p>The only named Utopian character in More\u2019s book was King Utopus. Utopus, according to More, conquered the land that would bear his name and brought its \u201crude, uncouth inhabitants to such a high level of culture and humanity that they now excel in that regard almost every other people\u201d. Utopus even domineered land and sea, instructing his people to cut across the peninsula connecting Utopia to its nearest neighbour, thereby isolating his nation forever. He then dropped \u2013 quietly, gracefully, unrealistically \u2013 out of the picture.</p> \n<p>Render\u2019s separation of New Africa from America is less dramatic, but he holds a powerful sway over his subjects and becomes similarly removed. This is where things start to fall apart. Render is the nation\u2019s head, heart and soul. But New Africa\u2019s success is bound up in his status as a celebrity. His face is on the flag; his subjects make art in his honour. On their nation\u2019s first evening, the citizens gather to tell each other The Story of New Africa, a puppet show starring a sport sock version of Render, and unveil the first item in their nation\u2019s art collection: a giant portrait of the rapper, crowned with a halo of cannabis leaves. Gradually Render becomes something we all recognise: a celebrity leader, venerated for his perceived wealth and power.</p> \n<p>You can guess where this is heading. Just as the power of Render\u2019s personality built New Africa, the same thing threatens to tear it apart. From early on in the experiment, Render is frequently absent. After addressing his subjects from the balcony of the plantation house (how\u2019s that for bad optics?), he disappears, leaving the citizens to dig and sweat without him.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e678e2b60bb0485601d21147351f322c9464919\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e678e2b60bb0485601d21147351f322c9464919/0_139_5671_3402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Freetown Christiania in Copenhagen, Denmark, in the 1970s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freetown Christiania in Copenhagen, Denmark, in the 1970s.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ritzau Scanpix Denmark/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Instead, he turns to issues that have sunk many a utopia before: security, the economy, and law and order \u2013 issues that More, by abolishing money and gifting Utopia a mercenary army, removed. Render, repeating what he knows, builds barbed-wire borders, sells advertising space on New Africa\u2019s flag, and hands responsibility for policing the state to a Black Lives Matter activist who, charged with this sudden jolt of power, takes to bullying his fellow citizens into toeing the line.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery single thing that you can point to and say, \u2018This is an oppressive institution that coalesces with racism: capitalism, national security, law and order,\u2019 he basically mirrors in this utopia,\u201d says Zamalin. He argues that Render should have known better.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe western utopians \u2013 like Thomas More \u2013 were so blinded by the possibility of a new beginning. What\u2019s striking about the black utopian tradition in America is that they were incredibly mindful of those kind of contradictions in a way that the western utopians weren\u2019t, precisely because they\u2019d experienced racial inequality.</p> \n<p>\u201cMike, as a black American, and as someone who is drawing on black American traditions when he\u2019s creating this flag and talking about it being a New Africa, doesn\u2019t fully appreciate the heritage of critical thinking on utopia that comes from black Americans.\u201d</p> \n<p>Render\u2019s utopia, says Zamalin, is half-baked. \u201cI wondered what the bold vision would be,\u201d he says. \u201cThe bold vision was escape, but everything else remained the same.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1fa12d37d19693d28a1cba70a51ba18e2b88a30b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fa12d37d19693d28a1cba70a51ba18e2b88a30b/0_201_5942_3565/1000.jpg\" alt=\"House and garden in Freetown Christiania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">House and garden in Freetown Christiania.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bjanka Kadic/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Stock Photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It is partly a question of a leader holding their nerve, says Rachel Cooper, chair in design at Lancaster University and a contributor to Liveable Cities, a UK engineering project designed to aid research and development of low carbon, resource-efficient communities.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou have to have a vision and take people along with you,\u201d she says. \u201cLeadership, vision and communication. And some bravery as well.\u201d</p> \n<p>She says Render fundamentally lacked the ability to properly connect with his subjects: \u201cLeadership is about being empathetic to the breadth of the community you\u2019re engaging with, having a vision and having them go forward with you. He wasn\u2019t very convincing in that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Render agrees. \u201cBuilding a utopia is difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cIt made me a lot more respectful of the processes that hold this thing we call society together.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Three: Watch as all individuality is crushed</h2> \n<p>New Africa\u2019s nadir comes at the end of its inaugural dinner, some 18 hours into its time as an independent state. Mario, a back-talking firebrand Render clashes with earlier in the series, composes New Africa\u2019s national anthem and sings it to the nation. The song is a droning repetition of their new homeland\u2019s name. Render, sat on the biggest, comfiest chair at the head of the table, yells at Mario: \u201cI didn\u2019t think someone could make me hate the word \u2018Africa\u2019!\u201d</p> \n<p>The group take their cue from their leader. They turn on the insurgent, then on each other. Mario\u2019s individuality, the thing that New Africa was supposed to prize, becomes the thing that fractures their community. The state falls into the disrepair its citizens were trying to leave behind.</p> \n<p>Render attempts to fix New Africa by calling for a democratic election, which he wins then desecrates by swapping out the votes so the victory goes to a New African with better leadership skills. He is a tyrant to the end.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f3967b61b290e4250928e345cbd0b692e6ab6f3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f3967b61b290e4250928e345cbd0b692e6ab6f3/0_54_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People protest against the Minnesota Experimental City project, an attempt to create a full-size city from scratch in the isolated woods of northern Minnesota in the 1960s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People protest against the Minnesota Experimental City project, an attempt to create a full-size city from scratch in the isolated woods of northern Minnesota in the 1960s.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Unicorn Stencil Doc Films</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cEven when we try to do better, we end up repeating the same cycle,\u201d says Render. \u201cYou become out of necessity what you think you despise. Did I become a totalitarian leader? Of course I did, but it\u2019s by proxy of, \u2018If I\u2019m using my money, then this is going to go my way.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>(As for Mario, Render now calls him \u201ca hero of the republic, because he asserted his individualism\u201d.)</p> \n<p>It takes guts to go it alone, even in a society designed to celebrate your individuality. More, for his part, left little room for free-thinkers in Utopia. He described a process by which those who didn\u2019t agree with the structure of Utopian society were treated to the missionary zeal of those who did. Continued refusal to sign up to the system led to banishment or even slavery. Yes, More\u2019s Utopia, the society that gave its name to our dreams of ideal statehood, was big on slavery.</p> \n<h2>Four: Claim it was satire all along</h2> \n<p>There\u2019s a final similarity between More and Render. Historians still debate whether More \u2013 a devout Catholic, who refused to refute his faith \u2013 wrote his book as a moon-eyed treatise or a satire of 16th-century European excess. Ultimately, his anti-establishment stance saw him arrested, tried for treason and beheaded during the Reformation.</p> \n<p>No one\u2019s going to cut Killer Mike\u2019s head off any time soon, but New Africa \u2013 like all of Trigger Warning \u2013 is also part satire and part idealism. </p> \n<p>Unlike More, Render had to at least try to make his ideal society work, if only for long enough to make a Netflix show. His experiment may have been more satire than genuine attempt as a result, but it was born of a genuine impulse: to build a place where today\u2019s polarising political discourse couldn\u2019t suffocate cooperation.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see us go out and help each other,\u201d says Render. \u201cI\u2019d like to see us work together to look after our elderly, our sick and our poor. And I know that can be done, because I grew up in a neighbourhood where people cooperated.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we do that as individual households and neighbourhoods and communities, then that, like any gossip, will spread and spread positive intentions. Society turns a corner that way.\u201d</p> \n<p>As he ends the show: \u201cAs long as everyone had a voice, this country would remain united, which is more than I can say for those partisan fuckboys in the USA.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Trigger Warning With Killer Mike is on Netflix</em></p> \n<p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardiancities/?hl=en\">Instagram</a> to join the discussion, catch up on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities\">our best stories</a> or sign up for our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/03/sign-up-for-the-cityscape-the-best-of-guardian-cities-every-week\">weekly newsletter</a></em></p>",

On their nation\u2019s first evening, the citizens gather to tell each other The Story of New Africa, a puppet show starring a sport sock version of Render, and unveil the first item in their nation\u2019s art collection: a giant portrait of the rapper, crowned with a halo of cannabis leaves. Gradually Render becomes something we all recognise: a celebrity leader, venerated for his perceived wealth and power. You can guess where this is heading. Just as the power of Render\u2019s personality built New Africa, the same thing threatens to tear it apart. From early on in the experiment, Render is frequently absent. After addressing his subjects from the balcony of the plantation house (how\u2019s that for bad optics?), he disappears, leaving the citizens to dig and sweat without him. Instead, he turns to issues that have sunk many a utopia before: security, the economy, and law and order \u2013 issues that More, by abolishing money and gifting Utopia a mercenary army, removed. Render, repeating what he knows, builds barbed-wire borders, sells advertising space on New Africa\u2019s flag, and hands responsibility for policing the state to a Black Lives Matter activist who, charged with this sudden jolt of power, takes to bullying his fellow citizens into toeing the line. \u201cEvery single thing that you can point to and say, \u2018This is an oppressive institution that coalesces with racism: capitalism, national security, law and order,\u2019 he basically mirrors in this utopia,\u201d says Zamalin. He argues that Render should have known better. \u201cThe western utopians \u2013 like Thomas More \u2013 were so blinded by the possibility of a new beginning. What\u2019s striking about the black utopian tradition in America is that they were incredibly mindful of those kind of contradictions in a way that the western utopians weren\u2019t, precisely because they\u2019d experienced racial inequality. \u201cMike, as a black American, and as someone who is drawing on black American traditions when he\u2019s creating this flag and talking about it being a New Africa, doesn\u2019t fully appreciate the heritage of critical thinking on utopia that comes from black Americans.\u201d Render\u2019s utopia, says Zamalin, is half-baked. \u201cI wondered what the bold vision would be,\u201d he says. \u201cThe bold vision was escape, but everything else remained the same.\u201d It is partly a question of a leader holding their nerve, says Rachel Cooper, chair in design at Lancaster University and a contributor to Liveable Cities, a UK engineering project designed to aid research and development of low carbon, resource-efficient communities. \u201cYou have to have a vision and take people along with you,\u201d she says. \u201cLeadership, vision and communication. And some bravery as well.\u201d She says Render fundamentally lacked the ability to properly connect with his subjects: \u201cLeadership is about being empathetic to the breadth of the community you\u2019re engaging with, having a vision and having them go forward with you. He wasn\u2019t very convincing in that.\u201d Render agrees. \u201cBuilding a utopia is difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cIt made me a lot more respectful of the processes that hold this thing we call society together.\u201d Three: Watch as all individuality is crushed New Africa\u2019s nadir comes at the end of its inaugural dinner, some 18 hours into its time as an independent state. Mario, a back-talking firebrand Render clashes with earlier in the series, composes New Africa\u2019s national anthem and sings it to the nation. The song is a droning repetition of their new homeland\u2019s name. Render, sat on the biggest, comfiest chair at the head of the table, yells at Mario: \u201cI didn\u2019t think someone could make me hate the word \u2018Africa\u2019!\u201d The group take their cue from their leader. They turn on the insurgent, then on each other. Mario\u2019s individuality, the thing that New Africa was supposed to prize, becomes the thing that fractures their community. The state falls into the disrepair its citizens were trying to leave behind. Render attempts to fix New Africa by calling for a democratic election, which he wins then desecrates by swapping out the votes so the victory goes to a New African with better leadership skills. He is a tyrant to the end. \u201cEven when we try to do better, we end up repeating the same cycle,\u201d says Render. \u201cYou become out of necessity what you think you despise. Did I become a totalitarian leader? Of course I did, but it\u2019s by proxy of, \u2018If I\u2019m using my money, then this is going to go my way.\u2019\u201d (As for Mario, Render now calls him \u201ca hero of the republic, because he asserted his individualism\u201d.) It takes guts to go it alone, even in a society designed to celebrate your individuality. More, for his part, left little room for free-thinkers in Utopia. He described a process by which those who didn\u2019t agree with the structure of Utopian society were treated to the missionary zeal of those who did. Continued refusal to sign up to the system led to banishment or even slavery. Yes, More\u2019s Utopia, the society that gave its name to our dreams of ideal statehood, was big on slavery. Four: Claim it was satire all along There\u2019s a final similarity between More and Render. Historians still debate whether More \u2013 a devout Catholic, who refused to refute his faith \u2013 wrote his book as a moon-eyed treatise or a satire of 16th-century European excess. Ultimately, his anti-establishment stance saw him arrested, tried for treason and beheaded during the Reformation. No one\u2019s going to cut Killer Mike\u2019s head off any time soon, but New Africa \u2013 like all of Trigger Warning \u2013 is also part satire and part idealism. Unlike More, Render had to at least try to make his ideal society work, if only for long enough to make a Netflix show. His experiment may have been more satire than genuine attempt as a result, but it was born of a genuine impulse: to build a place where today\u2019s polarising political discourse couldn\u2019t suffocate cooperation. \u201cI\u2019d like to see us go out and help each other,\u201d says Render. \u201cI\u2019d like to see us work together to look after our elderly, our sick and our poor. And I know that can be done, because I grew up in a neighbourhood where people cooperated. \u201cIf we do that as individual households and neighbourhoods and communities, then that, like any gossip, will spread and spread positive intentions. Society turns a corner that way.\u201d As he ends the show: \u201cAs long as everyone had a voice, this country would remain united, which is more than I can say for those partisan fuckboys in the USA.\u201d Trigger Warning With Killer Mike is on Netflix Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

      "bodyText": "In a \u00a34.3m paella restaurant in Fitzrovia, I\u2019m on a chair that wobbles, far from the open kitchen, at a window overlooking filthy concrete bollards outside, and feeling oddly shortchanged. According to months of social media froth, Arros QD is a hot, new, glamorous, unmissable palace of paella. Artful, strategically placed prawns, expensive rugs, blazing pans and three-Michelin-starred Quique Dacosta with his very tidy beard have bombarded the London foodie ether. Before the doors opened to the paying public, the welcome mat was unfurled to noisemakers who matter, which meant that soon even partially sighted Trafalgar Square pigeons knew Dacosta had come to transform forever the way Britain understands the one-pan comfort food often called \u201cthe Spanish Sunday roast\u201d. \u201cFor people to understand us, they need to look into the fire,\u201d Dacosta told one interviewer, channelling that type of quasi-spiritual, peak-chef earnestness that puts me in mind of the time David Blaine entered a Perspex box dangling over the Thames and London began pelting it with golf balls. But some way through a small plate of \u201ccheese stones\u201d \u2013 lumps of parmesan, manchego cream and cocoa butter that look, in a Heston Blumenthal way, eerily like coal and taste exactly like charcoal-covered mini Babybels \u2013 I thought, this is not the place I was sold. It was Arros QD\u2019s first official Saturday evening service, and Dacosta was disappointingly not in town, although I very much enjoyed asking staff where he was, if only to see their eyes bulge like Mr Bean taking a maths exam. His absence or my terrible table, next to the smoke alarm test panel in the least interesting room, may seem moot points, but to sell these two-person paellas that start at \u00a338 for a standard Valencian rabbit and chicken, and quickly leap up to \u00a350 for cuttlefish and prawn and \u00a390 for lobster, one really must buy into the excitement of wide pans bubbling over open fires and world-class chefs shaking them. That\u2019s shaking, not stirring \u2013 these thin, flat, meagrely topped, taupe-coloured paellas are not supposed to be stirred; they\u2019re too delicate. Furthermore, the rice here is cooked until its main thrust is a crisp core on the bottom of the pan with blackened parts at the edge. This may challenge anyone who has eaten a thousand paellas, and while accepting that the crunchy bottom, or socarrat, is certainly the best bit, it nevertheless feels to me that the rest of the paella should be plentiful, voluminous, perhaps fluffy, potentially saffron-coloured and certainly brimming generously with seafood. To those people, this may feel like a blackened, very stingy version. \u201cCan I let you into a secret?\u201d our waitress asks in a way that aims to be bantery but is scripted. \u201cThe flavour is here underneath the rice where it\u2019s stuck to the pan. You have to scrape. May I?\u201d \u201cPlease do!\u201d I say, brightly. It\u2019s pleasant enough: oily, white carb, slightly dry beans, decent chicken and rabbit lying atop the rice, and garlicky from the accompanying a\u00efoli. The \u201ccontemporary\u201d paella is a small, rectangular pan, as thin as a kitchen tile and about 30cm long by 2cm deep, and the smoked dashi eel version derives most of its flavour from wisps of katsuobushi \u2013 dried, fermented tuna flakes \u2013 scattered on top. There\u2019s so little eel, though, that one can remove it in three forkfuls and in the time it takes you to say, \u201cJesus Christ, that was \u00a332.\u201d On reflection, I feel my mistake at Arros QD was having the paella, which one feels thoroughly obliged to do, because in truth the menu is vast and features the likes of skate wing in chilli miso cooked on charcoal, whole brill with lemon and parsley, and stonebass ceviche with tiger milk. A starter I ordered mainly to be polite \u2013 a fresh kale citrus salad with cashew nuts \u2013 was an actual zinging marvel with a delightful and accomplished tomato dressing. Another starter of beef tartare, on what was essentially a large poppadom festooned with cured egg yolk and mustard seeds, was less enticing, but it was still better than those damned paellas. I\u2019d had a good pre-dinner Pedro Fizz cocktail (PX, amaretto, black walnut bitters and Mo\u00ebt) in the bar that lives on an upstairs landing and shared a bottle of Finca Calvestra with our food, but by now I sensed the bill hovering close to \u00a3150 and felt thoroughly disinclined to stay for pudding. Obviously, come the next morning, I bitterly regretted not having the giant cookie with araguani chocolate, macadamia nuts and vanilla ice-cream. But then, it was Instagram that told me this was unmissable, so that, too, could just be a bunch of arros. \u2022 Arros QD 64 Eastcastle Street, London W1, 020-3883 3525. Open lunch all week, noon-2.30pm (3.30pm Fri &amp; Sat, 4pm Sun), dinner Mon-Sat, 6-10.30pm (11pm Fri &amp; Sat). From about \u00a360 a head \u00e0 la carte, plus drinks and service.

      "bodyText": "A no-deal Brexit would lead to the loss of \u201cmany thousands\u201d of jobs, the business secretary has warned. Greg Clark urged Tory MPs to \u201cstrain every sinew to avoid\u201d crashing out of the EU under the next prime minister, with leadership rivals Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt both saying they would be prepared to leave the bloc on 31 October without a deal. They face a battle to force through their commitments, however, as MPs and peers launch tactical bids to block any attempt to prorogue parliament in order to force through a no-deal Brexit. Clark told Sky News on Friday that the disruption of a no-deal departure would lead to job losses. \u201cIt\u2019s evident that if you have the disruption that comes from a no-deal Brexit there will be people that will lose their jobs. It\u2019s many thousands of jobs. Everyone knows that.\u201d Asked about claims the UK could weather a no-deal exit on World Trade Organization terms, Clark said: \u201cI think every person that considers the evidence that companies have given \u2013 whether it\u2019s in the automotive sector, whether it\u2019s in the food sector, whether it\u2019s in aerospace, in industries up and down the country \u2013 you know if you become less efficient and your ability to trade is impeded, then of course losing your competitiveness means there will be jobs lost.\u201d Clark\u2019s comments came as peers launched a fresh bid on Friday to block any plans by a future Conservative prime minister to suspend or prorogue parliament in order to force through a no-deal exit from the EU. A cross-party group has laid down amendments to the Northern Ireland bill that seek to build on a similar measure introduced by Dominic Grieve in the Commons on Tuesday. Lady Hayter, Labour\u2019s deputy leader in the Lords and the shadow Brexit minister, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme the amendments \u201cwould force the government, in September and October, to meet to discuss reports about Northern Ireland, and by doing that parliament would have to be meeting and could not be prorogued\u201d. She said the amendments stood a high chance of success. \u201cClearly in the House of Lords we tend to take our responsibility to look after the constitution quite seriously, and a part of this is in making sure that on an enormously important issue like Brexit, parliament is taking the decisions and not just government.\u201d Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendment passed by only one vote, but Hayter felt that there would be enough support for it in the Lords. She dismissed the suggestion such a move by unelected Lords was undemocratic. \u201cIf the next PM wants to take us out, then all he needs to do is take it to parliament and get their agreement.

Cops Bill Murray and Adam Driver are on the case, with Tilda Swinton, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny and Iggy Pop putting in appearances.</p> <h2>Jaws (12A)</h2> <p><em>(Steven Spielberg, 1975, US) 124 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1fu_sA7XhE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/U1fu_sA7XhE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The summer movie to end them all \u2013 and very much not one to watch just before heading to the beach.

Shaftesbury Theatre, WC2, to 1 September The Bridges of Madison County Remember the heart-breaking film with Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood? This is the UK premiere of the musical version and stars the stupendous Jenna Russell as 1960s Italian immigrant housewife Francesca, whose life is upended by visiting photographer Robert. Trevor Nunn directs. Menier Chocolate Factory, SE1, Sat to 14 September Whitewash You never know what will come next from talented polymath Gabriel Bisset-Smith: standup comedy, interactive TV show, film or music video? His latest play draws on his own life and is the story of Mary and Lysander, a mixed-race woman and her very white son. It\u2019s a love letter to London that explores race, family and gentrification (where the hell have all the good nightclubs gone?). The playwright himself acts in it alongside Rebekah Murrell. Soho Theatre: Upstairs, W1, to 27 July Tao of Glass Composer Philip Glass and Improbable\u2019s Phelim McDermott join forces once again, following cracking collaborations including the Gandhi opera Satyagraha. This is their most personal project yet: inspired by a dream and all about the source of creative inspiration. Combining storytelling, puppetry and music, it will explore McDermott\u2019s artistic debt to the American minimalist Glass. Sounds heavy but could be amazing. Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, to 20 July The Same Enda Walsh\u2019s plays are always mind-bending, heart-stopping stuff. When The Same premiered to brilliant reviews in 2017 it took place in a decommissioned prison in Cork. Now it\u2019s playing in Galway airport with the same creative team, including director Pat Kiernan and actors and sisters Catherine and Eileen Walsh. It\u2019s about two women who have a mysterious connection, which slowly reveals itself through this eerily provocative drama. Galway Airport, Thursday 18 to 27 July MG Three of the best ... dance shows Thank You Very Much Claire Cunningham took performance advice from some of the country\u2019s best Elvis impersonators for her latest piece, inspired by the world of the tribute artist. Cunningham examines the performance of identity and the expectations around who society expects us to be, in a work that draws on her experiences as a disabled artist. Ukrainian Cultural Centre, Manchester, Wednesday 17 to 20 July Hive City Legacy A riotous mix of aerial acrobatics, street dance, spoken word and beatboxing from an energetic cast, all women of colour, all with sass, spunk and something to say. There\u2019s a revolutionary feel afoot as the multitalented performers address gender, race, sexuality and mental health. Roundhouse, NW1, Monday 15 to 30 July Patricia Guerrero: Catedral An award-winning work by young flamenco dancer Patricia Guerrero, Catedral\u2019s simmering theme is the staunch grip of Catholicism on Spanish society. From the shadows, Guerrero and her small cast make a bid for freedom from authoritarianism.

Even more staggeringly, one in three children worldwide was found to be multidimensionally poor, compared with one in six adults. That means that nearly half of the people living in multidimensional poverty \u2013 663 million \u2013 are children, with the youngest children bearing the greatest burden.",

The heat from the day had not cooled and the temperature was 118F (48C), even though the sun had long since gone down. To make matters worse, it was abnormally humid for the California desert. Sixty-two-year-old Pamela Chapman-Markle looked down the line of racers, recognizing about half the competitors from previous years. On a normal day she would be heading to bed in a half hour, and although her heart was racing with anticipation, she was already tired, acutely aware that she was about to miss two nights of sleep.</p> <p>The starting gun fired and the runners set off on an incline. There would be 14,600ft of cumulative elevation for the runners to climb over the course of the 135-mile race ahead.</p> <p>Chapman-Markle tried to calm her emotions and steady her heart rate. Five miles in, her throat was already sore from the still drier air, a drastic shift from the 90% humidity she trained in. With no light pollution, she could see the stars clearly, but at 62, her vision at night wasn\u2019t as good as it used to be, so she relied on a waist belt to light her path. For the first 20 miles, she passed runners, while others passed by her. Soon though, she wouldn\u2019t see anyone for long stretches.</p> <p>Chapman-Markle would have to run the first 42 miles by herself before her crew could pace her just before daybreak. And even then, her pacers would follow behind her single file and switch off every five miles, returning to the cool air conditioning of the car Chapman-Markle\u2019s husband drove up ahead. Chapman-Markle would have to do with ice. Ice she put down her sports bra, ice she chewed, ice water she drank as she tried to contend with the overwhelming heat.</p> <p>Last year, Chapman-Markle finished the Badwater 135 Ultramarathon in 34hr 30min, setting a record in the women\u2019s 60-plus age group for a third year in a row. Now 63, Chapman-Markle is the oldest female competitor in the race with designs on beating her record yet again. She is one of 95 competitors from 21 countries and 30 states accepted to run the ultramarathon this year.</p> <p>The 135-mile race, which takes place this year from 15-17 July starting in Death Valley and and ending at Whitney Portal, 8,300ft above sea level, is often referred to as \u201cthe world\u2019s toughest footrace\u201d. Badwater 135 is considered by many ultrarunners to be the crown jewel of ultramarathons, which are defined as anything longer than a marathon. Temperatures climbed as high as 127F (53C) last year, and the asphalt road can get even hotter, causing the road to burn to runners\u2019 feet. Chapman-Markle had the soles on three pairs of shoes melt last year. The race traverses three valleys and three mountain ranges, and after 122 grueling miles, runners face a steep final ascent to Whitney Portal at an elevation of 8360ft.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b7cfe7099036278d0483e6209e4aee3883c70d41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7cfe7099036278d0483e6209e4aee3883c70d41/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Badwater 135 Ultramarathon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Runners pass a heat danger warning sign during the Badwater 135 Ultramarathon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David McNew/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cRisk of very, very serious medical issues in a race like Badwater is high,\u201d Shawn Bearden, a professor of physiology at Idaho State University and ultrarunner himself, said. \u201cWe\u2019re not built to go 50 miles, 100 miles, or Badwater 135 miles.</p> <p>\u201cBut we are capable of it.\u201d</p> <p>The biggest challenge running Badwater is the heat. Bearden, who has crewed and paced for the Badwater race once and studied the physiology of ultrarunning, notes that the reason competitors are able to complete it is the human ability to thermoregulate and cool down by sweating. But Badwater puts a massive strain on one\u2019s thermoregulation and therefore on one\u2019s gastrointestinal system. \u201cThe only way you\u2019re going to survive Badwater is by consuming enough fluids and getting fluids and nutrients back in,\u201d Bearden explained. \u201cThat means we\u2019ve got to be able to sweat a lot and send blood to our skin to cool off, while sending blood to our muscles to keep us moving, while sending blood to our gut to absorb water and nutrients. So there\u2019s a massive strain on all of those tissues and systems.\u201d</p> <p>And if a runner attempted to just drink water and not eat?</p> <p>\u201cYou have a good chance of dying by the end from a condition called hyponatremia,\u201d Bearden said, \u201cwhere you effectively dilute the salts in your blood because you\u2019re losing some of your sweat and you\u2019re only replacing water.\u201d That\u2019s not to mention the muscle breakdown, which Bearden describes on a molecular level looking \u201clike a blender went through it,\u201d and takes months to repair, even if a runner feels good enough to run a week later.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Matt Collins had just left the 100-kilometer mark at Forest Park in Queens and his pacer, a cross country buddy from college, along with it. His feet padded the ground in the fresh shoes that he had changed into at the stop, where he had taped the blisters on the outside of his big and pinkie toes, and for a moment, his calloused and reddened feet were dry. He attempted to get down some pizza as he walked and readied himself for running another marathon and a half.</p> <p>With each stride, his hamstrings and quads screamed. His legs had been cramping for miles, and he knew the pain wouldn\u2019t go away. It\u2019s not going to get any worse, he told himself.</p> <p>Collins had been looking to the 100-kilometer marker since the beginning of the Great New York 100-miler, as he cut through Central Park heading North, ran along the Hudson and through the Bronx, and crossed the bridge into Queens with his pacer, where they laughed at Collins\u2019 poor form reflected in store windows \u2013 his heel strike too hard, hitting the pavement like a heavy man. They sang country songs as they ran along the water in Queens and passed picnics and soccer games. When they reached the Unisphere fountains at Flushing Meadows Corona Park, the two jumped in and let the water fall down on them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"56b0779c8232598df4d5d262e8962a5de6e30b80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56b0779c8232598df4d5d262e8962a5de6e30b80/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Badwater 135\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A runner cools off during the Badwater 135.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Jones/Badwater.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now that the 62 miles were behind him, as well as the highs of the last 15, Collins was exhausted, daunted by the 38 miles ahead he had to face alone. He picked up his legs.</p> <p>Collins also had Badwater, a mere three weeks away, on his mind. At 28, he would be the youngest competitor in the race, and the 100-miler he was currently running was in part in preparation for Badwater. Could he keep his hydration at a high enough level? He would need it for Badwater\u2019s heat. Aware of his tendency to go out too strong, he had begun today\u2019s race at a moderate pace. At Alley Pond Park in Queens, around 51 miles into the race, he took down four Dixie cups of pickle juice, savoring the salty brine of electrolytes and greedy for more.</p> <p>Collins had been behind on training. \u201cIntramural hockey games probably don\u2019t get you ready for the hardest race in the world,\u201d Collins said, laughing at his attempts to stay fit as he finished up his MBA at Wharton Business School in Philadelphia. At times, he would come home from a night out with classmates and head out on a run at 5am. \u201cMaybe because we\u2019re a little younger, we definitely have more of a cowboy attitude,\u201d Collins said about running ultramarathons with his pacer for Badwater, another college cross country buddy.</p> <p>But Badwater is the first race he\u2019s pored over online resources for information on how to run the course, even sparing a few minutes during the Great New York 100-miler to talk to the race director, who ran Badwater, for tips.</p> <p>Since then, he has run two to three 20-mile runs a week in his parents\u2019 basement, with the space heaters cranked up until he blew a fuse and had to rearrange the outlets. On the other days of the week, he runs up to six miles, and will sit in the sauna set at 160F for as long he can handle. \u201cThe heat impacts everything else,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not keeping cool, keeping smart, then you fall behind on electrolytes, which means your body can\u2019t take in food, which means you can\u2019t really move forward, and you\u2019re cramping.\u201d</p> <p>Collins\u2019 training is in sharp contrast with Chapman-Markle. After her first ultramarathon (or marathon for that matter), a 100-miler through the woods in Texas aged 55 that left her hypothermic, dangerously dehydrated, and with a stress fracture in right tibia, her grown children drove her to the hospital, where she had IV fluids hooked up to her arm. \u201cNo more, Mom,\u201d they told her. \u201cTry something else.\u201d</p> <p>Chapman-Markle instead decided to do more research on how to properly train for an ultramarathon. Forty-five ultramarathons later, six this year alone, and after two years focusing on proper form, Chapman-Markle has a strenuous, consistent training schedule and strict recovery routine. She has not only remained healthy, but has been breaking USA Track &amp; Field records for her age group and is pursuing the world records now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d6df6c5636cef381473aaa7b197088b50e0eed72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6df6c5636cef381473aaa7b197088b50e0eed72/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Badwater 135\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Billed as the toughest footrace in the world, the 36th annual Badwater 135 starts at Badwater Basin in Death Valley, 28ft below sea level, where athletes begin a 135-mile non-stop run over three mountain ranges in extreme mid-summer desert heat to finish at 8,350-foot near Mount Whitney for a total cumulative vertical ascent of 13,000ft.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David McNew/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Based in Galveston, Texas, Chapman-Markle runs in 38C weather with 90% humidity regularly, hitting the roads around 2 or 3pm on the weekdays while the sun is still high in the sky when she gets home from her job as a nurse anesthetist. Every other weekend, Chapman-Markle and her husband, who has crewed her since her second race, head to her condo 30 minutes north of Austin in the hills. There he will hop on a bike as she runs the hills for two to four hours. \u201cThe closer I get to Badwater, the more mileage I\u2019ll add on, so sometimes, I do two-a-day trains, I might go out for two and a half hours in the morning and an hour and a half at night.\u201d To prep for the 13-mile hike at the end of Badwater, she\u2019ll put on a 10-pound weighted vest and hike her running route. \u201cI think you can walk it faster than you can run it, because it\u2019s an 8% to 10% grade,\u201d she said of the final push.</p> <p>And on the recovery side of her preparation, Chapman-Markle is just as thorough: She sits in the sauna built into her house every night for 30 to 40 minutes to help her heat train before heading to bed for seven to eight hours.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Consistency is key to ultrarunning and completing Badwater 135, Shawn Bearden said.</p> <p>\u201cConsistency is several fold,\u201d he notes, pointing to consistency in one\u2019s day-to-day training and being consistent in one\u2019s training over years, and keeping one\u2019s diet \u2013 whether high-carb, high-fat, or otherwise \u2013 consistent. \u201cIt takes years for people to build up really to being able to comfortably handle these very long distances.\u201d</p> <p>This is also one reason runners in Badwater are, on average, older. The average age for Badwater 135 participants is 47 years old, with the oldest at 72. There are a few other reasons Bearden points to: as we age, we develop more of slow-twitch muscles that help on long runs. Psychological maturity comes with age. \u201cOlder people have a better understanding that the sun will come up tomorrow,\u201d Bearden said. And it takes years for people to develop what he calls \u201ccraft\u201d: the skills of ultrarunning and understanding the limits and needs of one\u2019s body.</p> <p>For 51-year-old Filipino Tess Bibal Leono, the biggest challenge to her training is the stray dogs. An analyst for the Asian Development Bank in the Philippines, Leono\u2019s work brings her to islands throughout the Pacific, where many hotels don\u2019t have gyms and she will have to run on the road. Packs of stray dogs will begin to follow her and chase her if she continues running. \u201cIf I see a dog, I try to stop running. So it kind of limits your training,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Leono ran the Badwater 135 in 2016 and 2018, quitting in 2018 after 80 miles due to acid reflux. Too excited for the race, she hadn\u2019t slept the night before, and with record heat and unusual humidity, the event had the <a href=\"http://www.badwater.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Death-Valley-press-release-Badwater-135.pdf\">lowest completion rate</a> in its 41-year history, with many of those disqualified by the time limit or quitting the race having finished the race in previous years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7e51a426df6dfad02b30defda1dbd9bfa5849926\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e51a426df6dfad02b30defda1dbd9bfa5849926/0_0_1710_982/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pam Reed\" width=\"1000\" height=\"574\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Badwater Ultramarathon winner Pam Reed collapses in exhaustion while talking to the media just after finishing the race on the shoulder of Mt Whitney in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Hartog/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t prepare,\u201d Leono said. \u201cI thought I prepared well.\u201d Her training for the 2018 Badwater had been disrupted at times by her busy travel schedule. This year, she made a commitment to get in at least 30 minutes a day if traveling, and she will often get back to the hotel after work and nap, waking at 9pm or 12am to get a run in the hotel\u2019s gym even if it\u2019s just five kilometers. She has been running marathons on the weekends and tack on an extra 10 kilometers as the rest of the marathoners head home.</p> <p>The final hurdle for competitors is the psychological aspect. \u201cI really think that most people who are capable of running a full marathon really could step up and run 100 miles,\u201d Bearden said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about your mindset and how you can handle every cell your body screaming and telling you, this is stupid. You should stop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s part of being an ultrarunner, you always get extremely depressed because you\u2019re sleep-deprived, and fluids and sodium aren\u2019t proper, and your brain will want you to stop, to quit, or [ask] why are you doing this? I know why I\u2019m doing this,\u201d Chapman-Markle said. \u201cThe one thing I do have is mental strength. And I think that\u2019s probably 65% of running a race like this.\u201d Chapman-Markle tries to stay positive and think nothing but grateful thoughts. \u201cIf bad thoughts do come in, I think my body needs something so I just try to figure out what it needs, give it to it, and get back to my happy thoughts,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s obviously very physically hard. Mentally it is probably harder,\u201d Collins said. He recalled his first ultramarathon, a 50-miler he participated in to raise money for Roswell Park Cancer Institute, where his brother was battling leukemia. \u201cFor me, I had a reason to be out there so that eliminated a lot of the temptation of dropping out and seeing there\u2019s an escape valve. For me, there was just the finish line,\u201d he said.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>For Collins, the 100-mile Great New York Running Exposition didn\u2019t prompt the usual roller coaster of emotion he normally experiences during an ultramarathon. Collins finished first, crossing the finish line at 16hr 11min, jubilant to sit down and cheer on his friend who had closed in on his lead and finished first for the women.</p> <p>\u201cI felt really excited for what we\u2019re going to do in three weeks [at Badwater],\u201d he said. \u201cIt was exactly the test I wanted it to be.\u201d</p> <p>Collins was clear that the race was an exception. \u201cIt was the first one ever I haven\u2019t cried,\u201d he said. He had run the Great New York 100-miler before, the terrain was relatively flat, and the weather, at 80F, mild. Badwater would be another beast.</p> <p>But Collins has learned a lot since his first ultramarathon at 24 and about what his body can handle. He tried to drive home by himself from that first 50-miler and, in sheer exhaustion, put the car into an embankment. This time, he booked himself a hotel in Times Square where the race ended, so he wouldn\u2019t have to walk too far.</p> <p>\u201cYou just go to such insane lows, and that bring you to such amazing highs,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI\u2019m not usually good at race specific training, which this race is a bit of an aberration from that.\u201d</p> <p>Before heading off to the desert this weekend, Collins flew to Puerto Rico for the Fourth of July weekend, taking the week before Badwater off from any strenuous runs. When asked what he\u2019d do with his week off, he said with a smile: \u201cProbably nothing productive.\u201d<br></p>",

His feet padded the ground in the fresh shoes that he had changed into at the stop, where he had taped the blisters on the outside of his big and pinkie toes, and for a moment, his calloused and reddened feet were dry. He attempted to get down some pizza as he walked and readied himself for running another marathon and a half. With each stride, his hamstrings and quads screamed. His legs had been cramping for miles, and he knew the pain wouldn\u2019t go away. It\u2019s not going to get any worse, he told himself. Collins had been looking to the 100-kilometer marker since the beginning of the Great New York 100-miler, as he cut through Central Park heading North, ran along the Hudson and through the Bronx, and crossed the bridge into Queens with his pacer, where they laughed at Collins\u2019 poor form reflected in store windows \u2013 his heel strike too hard, hitting the pavement like a heavy man. They sang country songs as they ran along the water in Queens and passed picnics and soccer games. When they reached the Unisphere fountains at Flushing Meadows Corona Park, the two jumped in and let the water fall down on them. Now that the 62 miles were behind him, as well as the highs of the last 15, Collins was exhausted, daunted by the 38 miles ahead he had to face alone. He picked up his legs. Collins also had Badwater, a mere three weeks away, on his mind. At 28, he would be the youngest competitor in the race, and the 100-miler he was currently running was in part in preparation for Badwater. Could he keep his hydration at a high enough level? He would need it for Badwater\u2019s heat. Aware of his tendency to go out too strong, he had begun today\u2019s race at a moderate pace. At Alley Pond Park in Queens, around 51 miles into the race, he took down four Dixie cups of pickle juice, savoring the salty brine of electrolytes and greedy for more. Collins had been behind on training. \u201cIntramural hockey games probably don\u2019t get you ready for the hardest race in the world,\u201d Collins said, laughing at his attempts to stay fit as he finished up his MBA at Wharton Business School in Philadelphia. At times, he would come home from a night out with classmates and head out on a run at 5am. \u201cMaybe because we\u2019re a little younger, we definitely have more of a cowboy attitude,\u201d Collins said about running ultramarathons with his pacer for Badwater, another college cross country buddy. But Badwater is the first race he\u2019s pored over online resources for information on how to run the course, even sparing a few minutes during the Great New York 100-miler to talk to the race director, who ran Badwater, for tips. Since then, he has run two to three 20-mile runs a week in his parents\u2019 basement, with the space heaters cranked up until he blew a fuse and had to rearrange the outlets. On the other days of the week, he runs up to six miles, and will sit in the sauna set at 160F for as long he can handle. \u201cThe heat impacts everything else,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not keeping cool, keeping smart, then you fall behind on electrolytes, which means your body can\u2019t take in food, which means you can\u2019t really move forward, and you\u2019re cramping.\u201d Collins\u2019 training is in sharp contrast with Chapman-Markle. After her first ultramarathon (or marathon for that matter), a 100-miler through the woods in Texas aged 55 that left her hypothermic, dangerously dehydrated, and with a stress fracture in right tibia, her grown children drove her to the hospital, where she had IV fluids hooked up to her arm. \u201cNo more, Mom,\u201d they told her. \u201cTry something else.\u201d Chapman-Markle instead decided to do more research on how to properly train for an ultramarathon. Forty-five ultramarathons later, six this year alone, and after two years focusing on proper form, Chapman-Markle has a strenuous, consistent training schedule and strict recovery routine. She has not only remained healthy, but has been breaking USA Track &amp; Field records for her age group and is pursuing the world records now. Based in Galveston, Texas, Chapman-Markle runs in 38C weather with 90% humidity regularly, hitting the roads around 2 or 3pm on the weekdays while the sun is still high in the sky when she gets home from her job as a nurse anesthetist. Every other weekend, Chapman-Markle and her husband, who has crewed her since her second race, head to her condo 30 minutes north of Austin in the hills. There he will hop on a bike as she runs the hills for two to four hours. \u201cThe closer I get to Badwater, the more mileage I\u2019ll add on, so sometimes, I do two-a-day trains, I might go out for two and a half hours in the morning and an hour and a half at night.\u201d To prep for the 13-mile hike at the end of Badwater, she\u2019ll put on a 10-pound weighted vest and hike her running route. \u201cI think you can walk it faster than you can run it, because it\u2019s an 8% to 10% grade,\u201d she said of the final push. And on the recovery side of her preparation, Chapman-Markle is just as thorough: She sits in the sauna built into her house every night for 30 to 40 minutes to help her heat train before heading to bed for seven to eight hours. ***** Consistency is key to ultrarunning and completing Badwater 135, Shawn Bearden said. \u201cConsistency is several fold,\u201d he notes, pointing to consistency in one\u2019s day-to-day training and being consistent in one\u2019s training over years, and keeping one\u2019s diet \u2013 whether high-carb, high-fat, or otherwise \u2013 consistent. \u201cIt takes years for people to build up really to being able to comfortably handle these very long distances.\u201d This is also one reason runners in Badwater are, on average, older. The average age for Badwater 135 participants is 47 years old, with the oldest at 72. There are a few other reasons Bearden points to: as we age, we develop more of slow-twitch muscles that help on long runs. Psychological maturity comes with age. \u201cOlder people have a better understanding that the sun will come up tomorrow,\u201d Bearden said. And it takes years for people to develop what he calls \u201ccraft\u201d: the skills of ultrarunning and understanding the limits and needs of one\u2019s body. For 51-year-old Filipino Tess Bibal Leono, the biggest challenge to her training is the stray dogs. An analyst for the Asian Development Bank in the Philippines, Leono\u2019s work brings her to islands throughout the Pacific, where many hotels don\u2019t have gyms and she will have to run on the road. Packs of stray dogs will begin to follow her and chase her if she continues running. \u201cIf I see a dog, I try to stop running. So it kind of limits your training,\u201d she said. Leono ran the Badwater 135 in 2016 and 2018, quitting in 2018 after 80 miles due to acid reflux. Too excited for the race, she hadn\u2019t slept the night before, and with record heat and unusual humidity, the event had the lowest completion rate in its 41-year history, with many of those disqualified by the time limit or quitting the race having finished the race in previous years. \u201cI didn\u2019t prepare,\u201d Leono said. \u201cI thought I prepared well.\u201d Her training for the 2018 Badwater had been disrupted at times by her busy travel schedule. This year, she made a commitment to get in at least 30 minutes a day if traveling, and she will often get back to the hotel after work and nap, waking at 9pm or 12am to get a run in the hotel\u2019s gym even if it\u2019s just five kilometers. She has been running marathons on the weekends and tack on an extra 10 kilometers as the rest of the marathoners head home. The final hurdle for competitors is the psychological aspect. \u201cI really think that most people who are capable of running a full marathon really could step up and run 100 miles,\u201d Bearden said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about your mindset and how you can handle every cell your body screaming and telling you, this is stupid. You should stop.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s part of being an ultrarunner, you always get extremely depressed because you\u2019re sleep-deprived, and fluids and sodium aren\u2019t proper, and your brain will want you to stop, to quit, or [ask] why are you doing this? I know why I\u2019m doing this,\u201d Chapman-Markle said. \u201cThe one thing I do have is mental strength. And I think that\u2019s probably 65% of running a race like this.\u201d Chapman-Markle tries to stay positive and think nothing but grateful thoughts. \u201cIf bad thoughts do come in, I think my body needs something so I just try to figure out what it needs, give it to it, and get back to my happy thoughts,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously very physically hard. Mentally it is probably harder,\u201d Collins said. He recalled his first ultramarathon, a 50-miler he participated in to raise money for Roswell Park Cancer Institute, where his brother was battling leukemia. \u201cFor me, I had a reason to be out there so that eliminated a lot of the temptation of dropping out and seeing there\u2019s an escape valve. For me, there was just the finish line,\u201d he said. ***** For Collins, the 100-mile Great New York Running Exposition didn\u2019t prompt the usual roller coaster of emotion he normally experiences during an ultramarathon. Collins finished first, crossing the finish line at 16hr 11min, jubilant to sit down and cheer on his friend who had closed in on his lead and finished first for the women. \u201cI felt really excited for what we\u2019re going to do in three weeks [at Badwater],\u201d he said. \u201cIt was exactly the test I wanted it to be.\u201d Collins was clear that the race was an exception. \u201cIt was the first one ever I haven\u2019t cried,\u201d he said. He had run the Great New York 100-miler before, the terrain was relatively flat, and the weather, at 80F, mild. Badwater would be another beast. But Collins has learned a lot since his first ultramarathon at 24 and about what his body can handle. He tried to drive home by himself from that first 50-miler and, in sheer exhaustion, put the car into an embankment. This time, he booked himself a hotel in Times Square where the race ended, so he wouldn\u2019t have to walk too far. \u201cYou just go to such insane lows, and that bring you to such amazing highs,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI\u2019m not usually good at race specific training, which this race is a bit of an aberration from that.\u201d Before heading off to the desert this weekend, Collins flew to Puerto Rico for the Fourth of July weekend, taking the week before Badwater off from any strenuous runs. When asked what he\u2019d do with his week off, he said with a smile: \u201cProbably nothing productive.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Senator Malcolm Roberts has been forced to pay a $6,000 penalty and legal costs to a blogger who sued him for sitting while ineligible at the height of the constitutional eligibility crisis of the 45th parliament. On 24 June the high court ordered Roberts to pay Sunshine Coast blogger Tony Magrathea the penalty for breaching section 44 of the constitution by continuing to serve as a senator while ineligible due to dual citizenship. Magrathea sued the One Nation senator under the Common Informers (Parliamentary Disqualifications) Act, a law allowing private citizens to blow the whistle on parliamentarians who are ineligible for their public office. The law sets the penalty at $200 plus $200 \u201cfor every day, subsequent to that day, on which he or she is proved in the suit\u201d to have sat while ineligible. Magrathea filed his suit on 28 September, 2017, one month before the high court ruled Roberts ineligible due to having been a British citizen when nominating for the 2016 election. Section 44(1) of the Australian constitution disqualifies a \u201ccitizen or subject of a foreign power\u201d from sitting in parliament. In the 45th parliament 14 MPs or senators resigning or being ruled ineligible due to dual citizenship. Magrathea told 10 Daily he had contacted several politicians with concerns about dual citizenship as early as 2014, and attempted to alert Roberts to his potential British citizenship in 2016. \u201cI wrote to him, saying \u2018make sure you\u2019ve got rid of your British citizenship\u2019. He ignored and blocked me on social media,\u201d Magrathea reportedly said. \u201cThe cash doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s a first for the Common Informers Act. It\u2019s a little bit of history being written by what we\u2019ve done.\u201d Roberts\u2019s disqualification brought One Nation candidate Fraser Anning into the Senate, before Anning was dumped by voters at the 2019 election and Roberts was re-elected at the head of the One Nation ticket. Common informers actions are difficult to pursue because applying to the court for a penalty does not require the court to decide on the eligibility of the parliamentarian in question unless a challenge is brought within 40 days of writs being returned or the question is referred by parliament. The act also has a 12-month time limit to bring suits, meaning that Nationals Barnaby Joyce and Fiona Nash, and Greens Scott Ludlam and Larissa Water \u2013 who were found ineligible alongside Roberts \u2013 cannot be pursued for a penalty.",

Yeah then I\u2019d think about it.\u201d Counterintuitively, the fact that his neighborhood was utterly decimated by flooding during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 only steeled Moore\u2019s attitude. During that storm \u2013 a category four \u2013 Moore did leave. Not this time, though. \u201cWe just gonna get a little water in the streets. We used to a little water,\u201d Moore continued. The last part is certainly true. Torrential downpours on Wednesday morning overwhelmed the city\u2019s rainwater pumping system so quickly that most city streets became virtually impassible. In one social media post making the rounds, a man appeared to be swimming down Canal Street like a pool lane. But after a few hours in the Thursday morning sun, most of those same streets were bone dry once again. City officials encouraged residents to make use of the window for storm preparation before Barry\u2019s predicted landfall on Saturday. \u201cGather your supplies, secure your property and make preparations to shelter in place,\u201d said the city mayor, Latoya Cantrell, in a statement late on Thursday. \u201cWhile it is uncertain what the impact will be, we will be affected and we need to be prepared.\u201d Lashawna Green took that warning to heart, tugging at loose leaves and trash in a storm drain in the city\u2019s seventh ward in the midday heat. \u201cWhen that there clogs up, the water will just sit,\u201d she said, while her husband unloaded supplies from a Costco run into the house. The storm brings two primary concerns to the region. One is rainfall at a rate that outpaces the city\u2019s pump stations, which officials concede is virtually guaranteed. \u201cDepending on where the heavy rainfall takes place, residents should expect flooding,\u201d the city said in a statement. The other concern is the system of levees that protect the city from the river, lake and industrial canal which encircle and pass through it. It was this system\u2019s failure that triggered the most catastrophic aftermath in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. In the ensuing decade, the US army corps of engineers embarked on a $14.5bn levee redesign and reconstruction process intended to ensure that the devastation of Katrina would not be repeated. However, those levees are already under strain due to high river levels that have persisted all summer, and the National Weather Service is predicting that the excess rainwater and storm surge from Barry will have the Mississippi cresting at or near the height of the lowest levee walls. Officials said on Thursday they did not expect levees to be topped. Neither did Moore. \u201cI gotta believe those levees hold up to a [category] one, after they spent how much?\u201d Moore said. \u201cI gotta.\u201d",

The age of the crowd varied between 18 and 94 \u2013 and nobody so much as sniggered or blushed, but I smiled to myself. I don\u2019t suppose the film would have had the same reaction when Freddie was alive, and even when I was first elected in 2001, the statute book still had criminal offences that applied exclusively to gay men. Amazingly, under ancient laws, men were still being prosecuted for meeting someone in a bar and taking them home. Since then \u2013 and in remarkably short order \u2013 we\u2019ve introduced civil partnerships, same-sex marriage, gay adoption, gay people in the military and we\u2019ve outlawed discrimination on the basis of someone\u2019s sexuality in the workforce or in providing goods and services. Who says voting never makes any difference?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/11/acceptance-gay-sex-decline-uk-first-time-since-aids-crisis\">Acceptance of gay sex in decline in UK for first time since Aids crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the latest edition of the British Social Attitudes survey shows, views have changed as well. Yes, there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/11/acceptance-gay-sex-decline-uk-first-time-since-aids-crisis\" title=\"\">been a tiny dip</a> in the percentage of people in the UK who think it\u2019s OK to be gay \u2013 more or less within the margin of error \u2013 but still the vast majority are cool with gays. It seems that changing the law has helped change attitudes, and politicians have led where others were at first reluctant to follow. And when it came to Northern Ireland legislation this week the Commons delivered the largest majority ever <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/09/mps-vote-to-extend-same-sex-marriage-to-northern-ireland\" title=\"\">in favour of gay equality</a> \u2013 383 to 73 \u2013 even though some fellow gay MPs and our allies felt it more important to leave it to Northern Ireland\u2019s own politicians to introduce equal marriage.</p> <p>So far so good. But there\u2019s a danger in this euphoria of acceptance if we forget our history. The truth is, homosexuality did not burst on the scene in the UK with Elton and Freddie strutting their stuff with gay abandon. Both of them had to live in the shadows of shame and denial for many years. The law was still hideously repressive.</p> <p>When I was young and coming to terms with being ever so slightly gay, the unacknowledged secret gay anthem was not a brave upbeat torch song like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHcDnqIz0jg\" title=\"\">I </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHcDnqIz0jg\" title=\"\">Am </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHcDnqIz0jg\" title=\"\">What I </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHcDnqIz0jg\" title=\"\">Am</a> or I Will Survive. True, Tom Robinson had already come out with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLc-bh_DrKw\" title=\"\">Glad to </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLc-bh_DrKw\" title=\"\">Be </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLc-bh_DrKw\" title=\"\">Gay</a> in 1978, but my memory of early Pride marches was of people furtively holding hands as they listened to the much darker, more wistful lyrics of Somewhere, which Maria sings over Tony\u2019s dead body at the end of West Side Story. Somewhere, surely, we hoped, we might be accepted.</p> <p>The trouble was that having been branded and bullied as queer for so many years we had inherited a love of tortured frailty. We were half in love with furtive glances, stolen looks and the terror of misunderstanding someone else\u2019s come-on. Shame came naturally, without so much as a priest\u2019s sermon or a parent\u2019s condemnation. So it was no surprise that <a href=\"https://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=103\" title=\"\">St Sebastian</a>, his beautifully buff body shot through with arrows, was our patron saint \u2013 and we delighted that nobody else seemed to have worked out that the tortured soul in Brideshead Revisited was called Sebastian Flyte for a very precise coded reason.</p> <p>From 1880 to 2001 we had tough anti-homosexuality laws. Men were sent to prison for seven years with hard labour. They were arrested, convicted and flogged for \u201cimportuning\u201d, that is to say, chatting up a stranger. They were convicted on the flimsiest of evidence \u2013 a touch of mascara or a powder puff in their pocket. They were subjected to intimidation, abuse and blackmail. They never dared report a queer-bashing lest they be the subject of the police investigation.</p> <p>But that would never happen again, I hear you cry. We\u2019ve turned the page. All I say is let\u2019s not forget that the most liberal city in the world in the 20th century was Berlin, during the Weimar Republic. Rich gay men travelled from England to enjoy the pleasures of dozens of bars and clubs that catered for every purse and every preference. But in 1934 Hitler killed off gay Nazis such as Edmund Heines and Ernst R\u00f6hm in the Night of the Long Knives, and started sending gay men to Dachau and other concentration camps. Thousands were murdered without a memorial.</p> <p>Progress is never a one-way street. Some of us look at the increase in hate crimes, the homophobic demands to stop teachers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/09/protests-against-lgbt-lessons-in-birmingham-primary-school-resume\" title=\"\">referring to homosexuality in schools</a>, the increasing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/14/chechnya-two-dead-and-dozens-held-in-lgbt-purge-reports\" title=\"\">violence in Russia</a> and elsewhere as signs that the battle is not yet won. Gay youngsters still face abuse. Shame still forces many to self-harm or take their own lives. And as long as that continues we\u2019ll still need to sing the tender ballads.</p> <p>\u2022 Chris Bryant is Labour MP for Rhondda</p>",

Amazingly, under ancient laws, men were still being prosecuted for meeting someone in a bar and taking them home. Since then \u2013 and in remarkably short order \u2013 we\u2019ve introduced civil partnerships, same-sex marriage, gay adoption, gay people in the military and we\u2019ve outlawed discrimination on the basis of someone\u2019s sexuality in the workforce or in providing goods and services. Who says voting never makes any difference? As the latest edition of the British Social Attitudes survey shows, views have changed as well. Yes, there\u2019s been a tiny dip in the percentage of people in the UK who think it\u2019s OK to be gay \u2013 more or less within the margin of error \u2013 but still the vast majority are cool with gays. It seems that changing the law has helped change attitudes, and politicians have led where others were at first reluctant to follow. And when it came to Northern Ireland legislation this week the Commons delivered the largest majority ever in favour of gay equality \u2013 383 to 73 \u2013 even though some fellow gay MPs and our allies felt it more important to leave it to Northern Ireland\u2019s own politicians to introduce equal marriage. So far so good. But there\u2019s a danger in this euphoria of acceptance if we forget our history. The truth is, homosexuality did not burst on the scene in the UK with Elton and Freddie strutting their stuff with gay abandon. Both of them had to live in the shadows of shame and denial for many years. The law was still hideously repressive. When I was young and coming to terms with being ever so slightly gay, the unacknowledged secret gay anthem was not a brave upbeat torch song like I Am What I Am or I Will Survive. True, Tom Robinson had already come out with Glad to Be Gay in 1978, but my memory of early Pride marches was of people furtively holding hands as they listened to the much darker, more wistful lyrics of Somewhere, which Maria sings over Tony\u2019s dead body at the end of West Side Story. Somewhere, surely, we hoped, we might be accepted. The trouble was that having been branded and bullied as queer for so many years we had inherited a love of tortured frailty. We were half in love with furtive glances, stolen looks and the terror of misunderstanding someone else\u2019s come-on. Shame came naturally, without so much as a priest\u2019s sermon or a parent\u2019s condemnation. So it was no surprise that St Sebastian, his beautifully buff body shot through with arrows, was our patron saint \u2013 and we delighted that nobody else seemed to have worked out that the tortured soul in Brideshead Revisited was called Sebastian Flyte for a very precise coded reason. From 1880 to 2001 we had tough anti-homosexuality laws. Men were sent to prison for seven years with hard labour. They were arrested, convicted and flogged for \u201cimportuning\u201d, that is to say, chatting up a stranger. They were convicted on the flimsiest of evidence \u2013 a touch of mascara or a powder puff in their pocket. They were subjected to intimidation, abuse and blackmail. They never dared report a queer-bashing lest they be the subject of the police investigation. But that would never happen again, I hear you cry. We\u2019ve turned the page. All I say is let\u2019s not forget that the most liberal city in the world in the 20th century was Berlin, during the Weimar Republic. Rich gay men travelled from England to enjoy the pleasures of dozens of bars and clubs that catered for every purse and every preference. But in 1934 Hitler killed off gay Nazis such as Edmund Heines and Ernst R\u00f6hm in the Night of the Long Knives, and started sending gay men to Dachau and other concentration camps. Thousands were murdered without a memorial. Progress is never a one-way street. Some of us look at the increase in hate crimes, the homophobic demands to stop teachers referring to homosexuality in schools, the increasing violence in Russia and elsewhere as signs that the battle is not yet won. Gay youngsters still face abuse. Shame still forces many to self-harm or take their own lives. And as long as that continues we\u2019ll still need to sing the tender ballads. \u2022 Chris Bryant is Labour MP for Rhondda",

      "body": "<p>Holliday Grainger turned 30 last year in Dublin, while shooting her new film. In Animals, she plays Laura, a 32-year-old writer trying to balance the odd pressure of how she feels she should be behaving, and how she wants to behave. \u201cI think there is a pressure on people,\u201d Grainger says about reaching that age. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 what are you doing with your life?\u201d Though the film is set against the sort of dedicated partying that is outrageously fun, until it isn\u2019t, Animals is also a subtle, unsettling look at the expectations placed on women by themselves, their friends, their families and lovers, as well as the world around them.</p> <p>\u201cIt was this weird day,\u201d Grainger recalls of her 30th. She and her co-star Alia Shawkat, who plays the more hedonistic Tyler, were filming a scene in which they visit Laura\u2019s baby niece for the first time, nursing bone-crushing hangovers. \u201cAnd they have an argument about joining the baby club or not.\u201d Two of Grainger\u2019s best friends, and their own babies, had flown out to visit her. \u201cSo on set were my best friends, their babies, and we were filming a scene about the choice between having a baby or not, and turning 30.\u201d The director, she says, was excited about the synchronicity.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FN_zr4rQzY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_FN_zr4rQzY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Grainger, who grew up in Manchester, started acting when she was five, in the BBC\u2019s All Quiet on the Preston Front. \u201cI\u2019m still in touch with people from that first job. I loved it. I was in the adult world,\u201d she says. She is composed yet slightly reserved, and has the air of someone suited to being in the company of adults from an early age. </p> <p>Recently, she has been playing the private-investigator-in-training Robin Ellacott in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/26/why-jk-rowlings-tv-series-strikes-the-right-note\" title=\"\">BBC\u2019s wildly popular Strike series</a>, which has adapted the Robert Galbraith (AKA JK Rowling) thrillers for Sunday-night primetime, and she is also starring as Anna Paquin\u2019s lover in Tell It to the Bees, a 1950s-set slice of magical realism. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing now how all of the scripts I\u2019m being sent are contemporary TV or independent film, it\u2019s not period drama. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just the fashion of the industry right now, or how people see me.\u201d For a long time, Grainger was the go-to girl for a corset or a bonnet: she was Lady Chatterley; she did The Borgias; she appeared in Anna Karenina, Bel Ami and Jane Eyre.</p> <p>\u201cFor most of my teenage years I was the northern best friend.

      "bodyText": "Holliday Grainger turned 30 last year in Dublin, while shooting her new film. In Animals, she plays Laura, a 32-year-old writer trying to balance the odd pressure of how she feels she should be behaving, and how she wants to behave. \u201cI think there is a pressure on people,\u201d Grainger says about reaching that age. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 what are you doing with your life?\u201d Though the film is set against the sort of dedicated partying that is outrageously fun, until it isn\u2019t, Animals is also a subtle, unsettling look at the expectations placed on women by themselves, their friends, their families and lovers, as well as the world around them. \u201cIt was this weird day,\u201d Grainger recalls of her 30th. She and her co-star Alia Shawkat, who plays the more hedonistic Tyler, were filming a scene in which they visit Laura\u2019s baby niece for the first time, nursing bone-crushing hangovers. \u201cAnd they have an argument about joining the baby club or not.\u201d Two of Grainger\u2019s best friends, and their own babies, had flown out to visit her. \u201cSo on set were my best friends, their babies, and we were filming a scene about the choice between having a baby or not, and turning 30.\u201d The director, she says, was excited about the synchronicity. Grainger, who grew up in Manchester, started acting when she was five, in the BBC\u2019s All Quiet on the Preston Front. \u201cI\u2019m still in touch with people from that first job. I loved it. I was in the adult world,\u201d she says. She is composed yet slightly reserved, and has the air of someone suited to being in the company of adults from an early age. Recently, she has been playing the private-investigator-in-training Robin Ellacott in the BBC\u2019s wildly popular Strike series, which has adapted the Robert Galbraith (AKA JK Rowling) thrillers for Sunday-night primetime, and she is also starring as Anna Paquin\u2019s lover in Tell It to the Bees, a 1950s-set slice of magical realism. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing now how all of the scripts I\u2019m being sent are contemporary TV or independent film, it\u2019s not period drama. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just the fashion of the industry right now, or how people see me.\u201d For a long time, Grainger was the go-to girl for a corset or a bonnet: she was Lady Chatterley; she did The Borgias; she appeared in Anna Karenina, Bel Ami and Jane Eyre. \u201cFor most of my teenage years I was the northern best friend. And then someone was like: \u2018Oh, she can do RP!\u2019\u201d She says this in a fancy accent. \u201cThen it was like, you can be the posh lead. Then it was the posh lead in a corset. I remember a Skype meeting once, with some director, and he asked: \u2018Can you do contemporary?\u2019 I was like: I\u2019m not speaking to you from the 1900s right now.\u201d She gestures towards her outfit \u2013 jeans and an off-the-shoulder top.

The campaign to repeal the eighth amendment was at its peak and the vote on legalising abortion in Ireland was about to take place. \u201cIt\u2019s this story about women\u2019s life choices, and you\u2019re getting to an age where you\u2019re [wondering], am I having to make them because society tells me to or because I want to, because I\u2019m ready for the next stage, whatever that is?\u201d Playing Laura had its own particular demands.

Reading is a medium we cannot lose. I love films and telly [but] they get magically beamed into kids\u2019 heads, whereas with books it\u2019s much more of an effort.

With a film, things happen out there, in a book it\u2019s happening inside your head, so that\u2019s empathy. Creativity \u2013 a book is partly what I say and partly what a reader imagines, whereas films are very bossy, they tell you how things would look and how they would sound. Intelligence is words. Those are the three magical powers, that\u2019s why books have to survive \u2013 because, my goodness, we need empathetic intelligent creative people today.\u201d</p> <p>Cowell says she \u201calways had stories I wanted to tell\u201d. She grew up in London, daughter of the environmentalist and hereditary peer Michael Blakenham, and the family spent holidays on a small, uninhabited island off the west coast of Scotland. There was no television, \u201cso I was writing a lot, reading a lot, we were making up our own entertainment,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019d be dropped off by a local boat and picked up again two weeks later \u2026 we\u2019d spend the whole summer on the island once my dad had a house built. It was the first place the Vikings came to in Britain and the last place they left, so real Vikings lived on the island. We\u2019d play and look for dragons in the caves, because Vikings believed dragons really existed.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I wasn\u2019t an instant success.

It was published in 1998, \u201cwhen my daughter was born; it was a race as to what would come first, the book or the baby,\u201d she says. \u201cI think picture books are fascinating, they\u2019re like writing haikus for aliens.\u201d She wrote a handful more picture books, including the first Hiccup story, <em>The Viking Who Was Seasick</em>, drawing on her childhood games on the Scottish island. She still has the handwritten original, pieced together from torn-up pieces of paper.</p> <p>\u201cFor about five years, I was writing these picture books which people weren\u2019t jumping up and down about. I wasn\u2019t an instant success. I go in and talk about that a lot in schools, because children are not necessarily always getting that message,\u201d Cowell says. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason Hiccup\u2019s sword is known as Endeavour.\u201d</p> <p>She moved into chapter books for intermediate readers because she had \u201cmore stories to tell\u201d about Hiccup\u2019s world, and picture books weren\u2019t quite big enough. It was an easy transition. \u201cMy problem generally is I have too much to say and not enough time to say it, so actually I relished the space.\u201d She knew from the start where the 12-book series was going to end. The first novel opens with a note from Hiccup: \u201cThere were dragons when I was a boy \u2026 You will have to take my word for it, for the dragons are disappearing so fast they may soon become extinct.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fe6a2802416674078be03ebc6e306e71c53b71f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe6a2802416674078be03ebc6e306e71c53b71f6/0_0_3600_1493/1000.jpg\" alt=\"How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World\" width=\"1000\" height=\"415\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The films help pull in new readers\u2019 \u2026 <em>How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Dreamworks Animation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI had written a lot of the last book really early on,\u201d she says. \u201cHiccup\u2019s story is that of a hero going on a journey without realising it, so I had factored in that it would be a long series and not a direct line. I had this massive thing on the wall in my shed with all the plot lines, it was very complicated.\u201d</p> <p>Part of the reason she wanted to write a long series was because \u201cyou start a quite good reader, and by the end you\u2019re a really good reader\u201d. \u201cAll the spelling tests in the world can\u2019t teach you what you learn from reading the whole of How to Train Your Dragon or Harry Potter or Artemis Fowl. Without having to learn word lists, you just absorb all this.\u201d</p> <p>Children love the magic in the books, she believes, because \u201cthey do get bossed around all the time and magic makes you powerful\u201d. And they also respond to the parents in her stories needing to learn from the children, as well as the other way round. \u201cIt could have been How To Train Your Mum. There\u2019s a lot of thinking about what we need to learn from children and what the experience of parenting teaches you, because children are really interested in the essential things in life, and often adults get lost along the way.\u201d</p> <p>In her books, she says, \u201cthe story is told in a get-you-through-the-story kind of way. These are clever mass-market books \u2026 So they are visual, because kids are more visual nowadays, but they\u2019re not dumbed down, because kids are smart.\u201d What becomes clear is that Cowell writes not only for the joy of the stories, but because she is so passionate about getting children reading; she\u2019s already an ambassador for the National Literacy Trust and a trustee for World Book Day, and she fizzes with advice and energy. \u201cListen to your kid read in the morning before breakfast rather than making it a big fight,\u201d she advises. And, \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re reading picture books beyond the age they \u2018should\u2019 be. That\u2019s often the way in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much competition for children\u2019s time and attention,\u201d Cowell says. \u201cPart of the whole way I write has always been to get children reading.\u201d But writing for a young audience hasn\u2019t held her back. \u201cI don\u2019t feel inhibited. What am I missing out on, in writing books for children? I\u2019m writing about heroism, about love, about what kind of leader we deserve.\u201d</p> <p>Film rights were acquired for the series in 2004, when she had just published the second book, but she \u201cnever thought they were going to make it, because they normally don\u2019t\u201d. When the first film was released in 2010, it brought an avalanche of new readers. \u201cOne of the big advantages of having your books turned into films is that you do reach children who don\u2019t necessarily get that books are great, and you pull them in. The books and the films have really helped create new readers, so that\u2019s what I hope will happen [with the laureateship], that I\u2019ll be able to reach kids who don\u2019t realise it\u2019s the <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em> lady.\u201d</p> <p>The two areas she will be focusing on as laureate are libraries and creativity. She will be campaigning for libraries to be statutory in every school, and for public libraries to be properly funded, as well as expanding her Freewriting Friday campaign, which she launched with the National Literacy Trust last year. This asks schools to give each child a blank book, and for 15 minutes every Friday they can write what they want and teachers can\u2019t mark it.</p> <p>She shows me her own notebook from when she was eight; she\u2019s spelled her name Crissida, but there are pages and pages of writing and drawings of elves. \u201cMy lovely teacher allowed me to just do this and that\u2019s where I discovered the joys of writing, having some space where my spelling and my handwriting didn\u2019t matter,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing here may just feel like mucking about, but it ended up being something concrete that has turned into books being published, films being made.\u201d</p> <p>As for libraries, they have for Cowell always been key. \u201cIf your parents can\u2019t afford books and your primary school doesn\u2019t have a library because they\u2019ve been shutting over the last 10 years and you don\u2019t go to the public library, how do you become a reader? How is that supposed to happen? Nobody has been able to answer that question effectively for me. At the very least primary schools have to have libraries.\u201d</p> <p>But most of all, she wants her laureateship \u201cto be about joy\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m going to make my laureateship all about magic, about the magic of reading, of writing. As soon as it becomes something you\u2019ve got to finish, it\u2019s a task,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be joyful.\u201d</p>",

It is seeing a copse of trees in a cluster of freckles. It is looking at a sweeping staircase and envisioning the wave of your lover\u2019s hair. Everything is art. Everything is tangible. It\u2019s odd, really, that the heart is the organ so associated with love. Of course it beats faster in the presence of the object of our affection \u2013 or even when they are in our thoughts. But that\u2019s thanks to hormones rushing the brain: adrenaline makes the heart hammer; oxytocin encourages bonding (\u201cthe love hormone\u201d); dopamine (the pleasure hormone); the surge of sex hormones that are\u2026 how shall we say? Distracting. Very distracting. But perhaps you feel love most powerfully in the gut. It also makes one giddy, perhaps not entirely sane. \u201cRomantic love is an obsession, it possesses you,\u201d as Dr Helen Fisher has said, an anthropologist who wrote the book on love (it\u2019s called Why We Love). Newton\u2019s third law is that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When it comes to falling in love, this can go one of two ways. One results in hours and hours discovering things about each other and finding each insight endlessly fascinating. The other, of course, is a lot of solo Netflix and junk food and terrifying near-misses liking old Instagram pics. They say falling in love is like walking on air.. But it isn\u2019t, really. It\u2019s flying.",

      "body": "<p>In many ways, Superhuman is your archetypal Silicon Valley darling. It was founded by a brilliant Cambridge graduate who sold his first company to LinkedIn in 2012 then quit to start another one. It has attracted a cult following among early users, whose lives it promises to revolutionise (and who often insist it really has done so). And now <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/06/27/superhuman/\">it has scored a $33m investment from Andreessen Horowitz</a>, the influential venture capital outfit that was an early backer of Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and almost every other major startup going since it was formed in 2009.</p> <p>But, in other ways, Superhuman is nothing like its peers. For one thing, it charges for what it makes: an eye-watering $30 a month. For another, it\u2019s taking the opposite route to the growth-at-all-costs mindset of so many startups: the Guardian first tried to sign up in 2016, and sat on the waiting list for almost three years before giving up and pulling strings to get VIP access. Oh, and it isn\u2019t building an AI blockchain for using augmented reality to run your biotech, or anything trendy like that. No, it makes an email client.</p> <p>\u201cFrom a customer\u2019s perspective the pitch is really simple,\u201d says Rahul Vohra, Superhuman\u2019s founder and chief executive. \u201cWe\u2019ve built the fastest email experience in the world. Our customers get through their inbox twice as fast as before, get to the emails that matter faster, and many of them see inbox zero for the first time in years \u2013 which, as you can imagine, is pretty life changing.\u201d</p> <p>That speed comes from two places, Vohra says. Well, actually it comes from \u201cmany hundreds of product decisions that have come together to make people go faster\u201d, but they can be lumped into two categories: firstly, there\u2019s the technology.</p> <p>\u201cEverything, even search, happens in 100ms or less,\u201d Vohra says. Superhuman uses canny tricks on Chrome to make the most of all the processing power a modern computer has, he explains, and to ensure that every email is available, and searchable, offline.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s the design. The whole service is built from the ground up for people who live their life in the inbox, and it shows. \u201cIt\u2019s aggressively keyboard-shortcut focused,\u201d Vohra says, as he talks through the client. \u201cYou do everything from the keyboard.\u201d</p> <p>Keyboard shortcuts are nothing new, but Superhuman practically shouts at you if you touch your mouse. Want to compose an email? Hit C. Need to CC someone in? Cmd-Shift-C will do that. Need to jump to a labelled email? Cmd-K will bring up a prompt, then just type the label name and hit enter. If you ever think you need to move your mouse to do something, a tooltip will pop up at the bottom explaining how to do it quicker from the keyboard.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s a third reason: that $30 price-tag, and the focus it brings. It\u2019s certainly an eye-catching promise. \u201cEmail goes 24-Karat\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/technology/superhuman-email.html\">the New York Times recently proclaimed</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIn the software industry, we have let ourselves fall into the trap of bad business models: of everything being ad supported,\u201d Vohra says, when I ask him whether a $360-a-year service can really \u201cdemocratise productivity,\u201d as he argues. \u201cI believe in the most honest and successful business model in the world, and that is: if you value something, you should pay for it. And for our users, it\u2019s incredibly good value. You spend $30 for hours back a week.\u201d</p> <p>Focusing only on those who care about email enough to spend hundreds of pounds improving it helps. It lets the company require a moderately new laptop, for instance, to free it from the need to support slower machines. It also enables one of its more eye-catching requirements: a one-on-one introductory session with all its users, who must demonstrate their workflow to an expert at Superhuman over a video call, before receiving personalised advice on how best to use the email app.</p> <p>But the weakness of focus is tunnel vision. As Vohra explained some of the more niche features in Superhuman, one was particularly eye-catching: extremely detailed \u201cread receipts\u201d for emails, created using a \u201ctracking pixel\u201d silently embedded in the emails.</p> <p>The email standard doesn\u2019t allow for WhatsApp-style read-receipts, so instead companies that offer them \u2013 not just Superhuman but mostly powerful B2B services rather than consumer email clients \u2013 embed an invisible, transparent one-pixel image in every sent email, and track when that image is downloaded from their servers.</p> <p>Superhuman does this too, but Vohra explained that the company\u2019s implementation was characteristically more powerful than its competition: the pixel could distinguish different recipients opening the same email, differentiate mobile and desktop openings, and even report the approximate (state or country-level) location.</p> <p>Vohra explained the positives of the approach, describing sending an email to an investor and holding off spamming them with follow-up missives after spotting that they were opening it from a mobile device in Hawaii \u2013 presumably on holiday.</p> <p>But others spotted the negatives. \u201cThey\u2019ve identified a feature that provides value to some of their customers (ie, seeing if someone has opened your email yet) and they\u2019ve trampled the privacy of every single person they send email to in order to achieve that,\u201d <a href=\"https://mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2019/06/superhuman-is-spying-on-you\">wrote fomer Twitter executive Mike Davidson</a>, in a widely shared post. \u201cSuperhuman never asks the person on the other end if they are OK with sending a read receipt (complete with timestamp and geolocation). Superhuman never offers a way to opt out.\u201d</p> <p>Too much time thinking about what its hardworking power-users demand from email left the company blind to the wider ramifications of what it was making, Vohra now accepts. \u201cI have come to understand that there are indeed nightmare scenarios involving location tracking. I should note that we deliberately do not show cities \u2014 we only show states or countries \u2014 but a determined attacker could still misuse this information,\u201d <a href=\"https://blog.superhuman.com/read-statuses-bdf0cc34b6a5\">he wrote in a chastened blogpost</a>, the day after our last call.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we built Superhuman, we focused only on the needs of our customers. We did not consider potential bad actors. I wholeheartedly apologise for not thinking through this more fully.\u201d The company no longer tracks location data at all, turns off the read receipts for all users by default, and is \u201cprioritising\u201d work to let Superhuman users opt out of loading images by default \u2013 the only practical way to protect against tracking pixels. (Tracking pixels are not limited to emails, and are common across the web. The Guardian\u2019s website hosts one from Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/08/readers-guardian-facebook-revelations-personal-data\">used to help advertise on the social network</a>.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2019/apr/08/how-many-work-emails-is-too-many\">How many work emails is too many? </a> </p> </aside>  <p>The company has not removed the feature entirely, however. \u201cWe are still keeping the feature, as Superhuman is business software for email power users,\u201d Vohra says. \u201cIn the \u2018<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosumer\">prosumer</a>\u2019 email market, read statuses have been \u2018must have\u2019 for many years \u2026 Before Superhuman had read statuses, it was both our most requested feature and also one of the most common reasons not to buy. In our market, the demand for read statuses is so high that it has now become table-stakes.\u201d Vohra did not address another of Davidson\u2019s suggestions: that the company disclose its use of tracking pixels to email recipients.</p> <p>In a market where its main competitor is the vast surveillance machine of Google, Superhuman\u2019s apology, and rapid decision to change its product, suggests there may be substance to its claim to be different. Still: feted by insiders, raising millions from the kings of venture capital, and plunging immediately into a crisis over personal data. Maybe Superhuman really is your archetypal Silicon Valley darling after all?</p>",

The company has not removed the feature entirely, however. \u201cWe are still keeping the feature, as Superhuman is business software for email power users,\u201d Vohra says. \u201cIn the \u2018prosumer\u2019 email market, read statuses have been \u2018must have\u2019 for many years \u2026 Before Superhuman had read statuses, it was both our most requested feature and also one of the most common reasons not to buy. In our market, the demand for read statuses is so high that it has now become table-stakes.\u201d Vohra did not address another of Davidson\u2019s suggestions: that the company disclose its use of tracking pixels to email recipients. In a market where its main competitor is the vast surveillance machine of Google, Superhuman\u2019s apology, and rapid decision to change its product, suggests there may be substance to its claim to be different. Still: feted by insiders, raising millions from the kings of venture capital, and plunging immediately into a crisis over personal data. Maybe Superhuman really is your archetypal Silicon Valley darling after all?",

      "bodyText": "Peter Dutton says the Coalition\u2019s policy is to achieve Indigenous recognition without enshrining a voice to parliament in the constitution, seemingly ruling out a key demand by the authors of the Uluru statement from the heart. The home affairs minister\u2019s comments follow an anonymously sourced story in the Australian newspaper, which said Scott Morrison would \u201cveto\u201d any attempt to insert an Indigenous voice into the constitution. Dutton said the government was not in favour of a \u201cthird chamber\u201d of parliament, a misleading characterisation of the voice to parliament, given that it would not have any veto powers and could not introduce legislation or change it. Indigenous leaders included the voice as part of the Uluru statement, proposing an advisory board on Indigenous issues and legislation affecting First Nations peoples, which could not be abolished. An Essential poll published on Friday found a majority of voters were in favour of both recognition and a voice to parliament. Dutton said the Coalition had been consistent in its views. \u201cWe went to the last election with a policy,\u201d he told the Nine Network on Friday. \u201cWe have been clear that we want to work with the people to provide that recognition.

It is great Ken Wyatt is the first Indigenous affairs minister. He has a process under way. Let him conduct the consultation. Then we will make an announcement about the next step.\u201d In laying out his roadmap for a reconciliation plan, Wyatt counselled fellow Indigenous leaders to be \u201cpragmatic\u201d about what could be achieved. He said he would pursue some model of the voice to parliament as set out in the Uluru statement, but said it could be legislated rather than enshrined in the constitution. Wyatt has also reserved the right to call a halt to the process if he does not believe a future referendum would succeed. Labor, which is working with the government to achieve reconciliation after decades of failures by successive parliaments, has \u201cendorsed and embraced\u201d the Uluru statement in full. \u201cWhat the Uluru statement clearly said is that the aspiration was absolutely for an entrenched voice in the constitution,\u201d the shadow Indigenous affairs minister, Linda Burney, told Sky on Thursday. \u201cAnd what people are forgetting is that the reason for that is that there would not be the capacity for any particular government with a particular view to be able to get rid of that voice in the way in which we saw Atsic be gotten rid of.\u201d Atsic, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, was abolished by the Howard government in 2005. \u201cWhat we need to think about,\u201d Burney said, \u201cis on every single social rung \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s health outcomes, education outcomes, overcrowding, domestic violence, life expectancy \u2013 Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders are on the bottom rung. \u201cAnd that is because there has not been Aboriginal people at the table helping design the legislation and advise on legislation and programs.

      "bodyText": "An experienced paramedic who treated a dying New South Wales festivalgoer has told an inquest the lack of leadership inside the event\u2019s medical tent was \u201ccompletely abhorrent\u201d. Melbourne retail assistant Diana Nguyen, 21, and Sydney student Joseph Pham, 23, died after overdosing on MDMA at the Sydney music festival Defqon.1 on 15 September 2018. They are among six people whose recent drug-related deaths at NSW music festivals are being scrutinised at a coronial inquest. NSW Ambulance intensive care paramedic Timothy Mascorella said it was clear the instant he saw Pham he was showing signs of MDMA toxicity and needed to be transported to hospital immediately. But he said the private contractor managing the medical tent was overwhelmed by the number of patients and lack of medical equipment available. \u201cI found it extremely difficult to deliver care to [Pham] as there was no team leader established,\u201d Mascorella told the inquest on Friday. \u201cThe doctors were giving the patient medication during [his cardiac arrest] that we weren\u2019t aware of. \u201cI found the lack of leadership and crew resource management of the Event Medical Services crew to be completely abhorrent.\u201d Mascorella said EMS had earlier explicitly assured him NSW Ambulance paramedics would only be needed for transport as the private contractor was capable of providing initial treatment to those falling ill in the festival\u2019s 30,000-strong crowd. But the paramedics agreed that, by the evening of the event, the medical tent was overwhelmed. He said it was located in the centre of the festival grounds, which was \u201cprobably good for the patrons but it wasn\u2019t good for us\u201d. \u201cThere was no right of passage,\u201d Mascorella said, adding festivalgoers banged on the ambulance and became excited by the lights as it drove through the crowd. Nathan Tran, Callum Brosnan, Joshua Tam and Alexandra Ross-King \u2013 all aged between 18 and 23 \u2013 also died from MDMA toxicity or complications of MDMA use after attending festivals between December 2017 and January 2019. Traces of potent stimulant PMMA was detected in the blood of Tran, concerning Canberra emergency doctor David Caldicott. \u201cThis is the sort of information that needs to be released to the general public \u2013 particularly the consuming public \u2013 immediately,\u201d Caldicott told the inquest on Friday. The drug, nicknamed \u201cDr. Death\u201d for its link to dozens of overdose deaths in Australia and overseas, did not initially show up in Tran\u2019s toxicology report but appeared in specialist testing done in Western Australia for the purposes of the inquest. While the result is only preliminary, and revealed only a trace amount of the drug in Tran\u2019s system, Guardian Australia understands the inquest intends to ask the WA lab to investigate whether it can determine what the level of the drug may have been at the time of his death. Caldicott said the drugs were \u201cquite different\u201d to MDMA in that they do not provide the same euphoric and connected feeling that users of the drug seek. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of those exposed to PMA or PMMA are exposed accidentally while pursuing an MDMA like experience,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are far, far more dangerous. The problem is of course is that it doesn\u2019t have that euphoric effect so when a young consumer [takes] it they might be left with the idea that it\u2019s not as good a pill as they intended, so therefore they will re-dose or re-consume and they\u2019re obviously rapidly increasing their dose.\u201d The Calvary hospital specialist pointed to a 2016 example in the Netherlands when 172mg of PMMA \u2013 a \u201cclearly dangerous dose\u201d \u2013 was detected in a batch of pills and a major public warning was issued. No deaths attributable to the pills were recorded. The inquest continues. \u2022 Australian Associated Press contributed to this report",

      "bodyText": "Candy-striped Eilean Glas lighthouse stands picture perfect on a rocky outcrop on the eastern tip of Scalpay island in the Outer Hebrides. The path that leads here over peaty ground feels bouncy, crossing grass left luminous by recent rain, with patchwork heather and scattered lochans reflecting a cloud-scudded sky. Wild-looking shaggy sheep graze, undeterred. My attention though, is not focused on this enchanting landscape, but on the shimmering ocean beyond: turquoise near the shore, a deeper blue-black towards the horizon. I find a spot on the rocks and sit quietly, scanning the waves again and again for signs of life. I\u2019m here to follow part of a new Whale Trail, an initiative launched by marine conservation charity the Hebridean Whale &amp; Dolphin Trust (HWDT), financed by the Coastal Communities Fund. The waters of the Hebridean archipelago off Scotland\u2019s west coast are incredibly cetacean-rich; a quarter of the world\u2019s whale and dolphin species have been recorded here.

      "body": "<p>Two years ago, Mo Gilligan was selling jeans in the Levi\u2019s store in Covent Garden. This month, he\u2019s fronting \u2013 as creator, writer and host \u2013 his own Friday night entertainment spectacular on Channel 4. There are meteoric rises, and then there\u2019s Gilligan\u2019s, which has propelled him from DIY comedy videos via a sell-out tour to the bright new hope of weekend TV in the time it takes to wear out the knees on a pair of 501s.</p> <p>No effort is being made to conceal that The Lateish Show \u2013 the Gilligan vehicle in question \u2013 aspires to be a TFI Friday for the Snapchat generation. And you can see why the south Londoner might be just the man to host it. His fast-track success was triggered by a series of character-comedy shorts filmed in his bedroom and posted online. He made them before his retail shift started at 4pm, snuck into the workplace loo to upload them, then logged on after work to gauge the reaction.</p> <p>He says one of his first videos \u2013 a rundown of \u201cdifferent types of grime MC\u201d \u2013 got over a million views. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my gosh\u2019,\u201d says the 31-year-old Gilligan. \u201cThat never happens!\u201d His childhood heroes \u2013 Ian Wright, So Solid Crew \u2013 were suddenly his fans. Later videos found Gilligan in character as a mouthy white man forever requesting \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ9hMbi6HDA\">a coupla cans</a>\u201d from his off-screen wife, Julie. The catchphrase was parroted by Canadian hip-hop megastar Drake, and Gilligan\u2019s profile skyrocketed.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZzVlXCgCCA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZZzVlXCgCCA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cI had no idea what would happen with [the videos],\u201d says Gilligan now. \u201cI just put up some silly films and hoped people would like them. And then it was like \u2018oh my gosh \u2013 this is really happening!\u2019\u201d Prior to the videos, he was a performing arts graduate and part-time comic who gigged regularly if not lucratively, mapping a different route to the usual comics\u2019 career path via the Edinburgh fringe. (\u201cI couldn\u2019t afford it. I was working in retail: I couldn\u2019t get a month off.\u201d) He also compered mixed-bill events at which pre-fame Stormzy and Ed Sheeran used to gig. \u201cAnd when those people went on to huge success, it inspired me,\u201d says Gilligan. Last year, he joined Stormzy as a brand ambassador for Adidas.</p> <p>Soon, his standup gigs started selling out, prompting Gilligan to book his first UK tour. Its London dates sold out within two minutes. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018It\u2019s probably a glitch, or they only put 10 tickets on sale \u2026 \u2019\u201d He kept adding dates; they kept selling out, with no promotion whatsoever. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when I realised,\u201d he says: \u201cthis is bigger than I thought it was.\u201d</p> <p>I saw one of his 22 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/16/mo-gilligan-review-newfound-star-flexes-his-character-comedy-chops-leicester-square-theatre\">performances at Leicester Square theatre</a>, where his ease and charisma marked him out as a likely star.

      "bodyText": "Two years ago, Mo Gilligan was selling jeans in the Levi\u2019s store in Covent Garden. This month, he\u2019s fronting \u2013 as creator, writer and host \u2013 his own Friday night entertainment spectacular on Channel 4. There are meteoric rises, and then there\u2019s Gilligan\u2019s, which has propelled him from DIY comedy videos via a sell-out tour to the bright new hope of weekend TV in the time it takes to wear out the knees on a pair of 501s. No effort is being made to conceal that The Lateish Show \u2013 the Gilligan vehicle in question \u2013 aspires to be a TFI Friday for the Snapchat generation. And you can see why the south Londoner might be just the man to host it. His fast-track success was triggered by a series of character-comedy shorts filmed in his bedroom and posted online. He made them before his retail shift started at 4pm, snuck into the workplace loo to upload them, then logged on after work to gauge the reaction. He says one of his first videos \u2013 a rundown of \u201cdifferent types of grime MC\u201d \u2013 got over a million views. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my gosh\u2019,\u201d says the 31-year-old Gilligan. \u201cThat never happens!\u201d His childhood heroes \u2013 Ian Wright, So Solid Crew \u2013 were suddenly his fans. Later videos found Gilligan in character as a mouthy white man forever requesting \u201ca coupla cans\u201d from his off-screen wife, Julie. The catchphrase was parroted by Canadian hip-hop megastar Drake, and Gilligan\u2019s profile skyrocketed. \u201cI had no idea what would happen with [the videos],\u201d says Gilligan now. \u201cI just put up some silly films and hoped people would like them. And then it was like \u2018oh my gosh \u2013 this is really happening!\u2019\u201d Prior to the videos, he was a performing arts graduate and part-time comic who gigged regularly if not lucratively, mapping a different route to the usual comics\u2019 career path via the Edinburgh fringe. (\u201cI couldn\u2019t afford it. I was working in retail: I couldn\u2019t get a month off.\u201d) He also compered mixed-bill events at which pre-fame Stormzy and Ed Sheeran used to gig. \u201cAnd when those people went on to huge success, it inspired me,\u201d says Gilligan. Last year, he joined Stormzy as a brand ambassador for Adidas. Soon, his standup gigs started selling out, prompting Gilligan to book his first UK tour. Its London dates sold out within two minutes. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018It\u2019s probably a glitch, or they only put 10 tickets on sale \u2026 \u2019\u201d He kept adding dates; they kept selling out, with no promotion whatsoever. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when I realised,\u201d he says: \u201cthis is bigger than I thought it was.\u201d I saw one of his 22 performances at Leicester Square theatre, where his ease and charisma marked him out as a likely star. The \u201ccoupla cans\u201d alter ego was there, so too the grime MCs and a routine, derived from his videos, about different types of girls in nightclubs. This was comedy \u2013 from the nostalgic childhood stories to the feelgood jokes about male mating rituals \u2013 that (as per his ambition for The Lateish Show) \u201cyour little brother can watch and your nan can watch, and they both feel included.\u201d On the strength of his tour, Channel 4 invited Gilligan to co-host The Big Narstie Show with the eponymous grime and social media star and to develop his own TV vehicle. The Lateish Show has been over a year in utero, rather longer than it takes to post a video to Instagram. \u201cIf I had a show,\u201d Gilligan had to ask himself, \u201cwhat would I want it to be?\u201d The answer closely resembles the network\u2019s biggest ever Friday night hit, which Gilligan remembers watching \u2013 and loving \u2013 in its 1990s heyday. \u201cTFI Friday was a show where, if you\u2019re watching it at home, you want to be there. And that stuck with me. But how about that for the modern era, where you watch TV and tweet about it at the same time?\u201d Like its Chris Evans-hosted forebear, The Lateish Show promises games, music and celebs \u2013 including, in its opening episode, Steve Coogan. (Other confirmed guests include Jessie J, Lee Mack and People Just Do Nothing star Asim Chaudhry.) There\u2019ll be Gilligan\u2019s trademark character-comedy too: \u201cBut I did those videos on my iPhone in my bedroom.

      "body": "<p>Invariably, queer pop stars worship David Bowie, and Dorian Electra is no different. \u201cMy dad got me into Bowie from a really young age,\u201d they say. \u201cI looked up to androgynous rock stars.\u201d What\u2019s less common is worshipping Bono. \u201cHe was one of my heroes as a kid. I know, funny: everyone hates him. But I really loved him, and used to dress up as him. That was one of my first experiences in what I guess you could call drag, but I would call dressing up. I performed the song Vertigo, just for my family \u2013 I drew on a little beard with my stepmom\u2019s eyeliner.\u201d</p> <p>And so, with a home performance of a U2 song, Electra set off on the way to becoming the most lively and witty new pop star of 2019. Assigned female at birth but now defining as gender-fluid, they are about to release their debut album: a brilliant collection of ultra-synthetic, cartoonishly masculine pop, delivered wearing a perfect pencil moustache.</p> <p>Dorian and Electra are the first two names on their birth certificate, along with two more that they ask me not to divulge (along with their age). \u201cI\u2019ll tell all about everything else!\u201d And boy, do they \u2013 their diagnosed attention deficit disorder triggers more than 10,000 words down the phone during our conversation, sentences constantly interrupted with a newer, even more interesting thought.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDDukLyXY-M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MDDukLyXY-M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Electra grew up in Houston to an artist mother and a father who performed covers in a rock band after work: \u201cHe\u2019s not the best singer, but he\u2019s got the moves.\u201d The couple split when Electra was five; after that, their mother dated women. \u201cWhen I was eight, I was like: \u2018So this friend of yours is always staying over, are you a lesbian?\u2019 She was like: \u2018Yeah, honey, I am.\u2019 And I was like: \u2018That\u2019s OK.\u2019 I knew those other options were open to me.\u201d</p> <p>As a kid, they felt \u201creally androgynous: I wasn\u2019t into the things girls were into, but I hated sports, or playing with GI Joe. I always identified with the word kid more than girl or boy.\u201d In high school, they would have crushes on boys, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t feel like a girl liking a guy. Love stories in movies were very alienating to me.\u201d </p> <p>One of their teachers, an out, \u201cOscar Wilde type figure\u201d who also worked as the coach of the debating team, beguiled Dorian and the group of \u201cnerdy boys\u201d they fell in with. \u201cWe were \u2026 I\u2019m hesitant to say the word brainwashed, because that takes away my agency, and he did come from a good place. But basically I was brainwashed to think the state was evil, that you can\u2019t use government to do anything good, because it is an institution of force.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"23bcbb5a3d986c4b02eeec56097cd03c9aac84dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23bcbb5a3d986c4b02eeec56097cd03c9aac84dd/0_284_2396_2395/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I wonder how much of me loving dressing up like a knight or a cowboy maybe a product of my own internalised misogyny\u2019 \u2026 Electra.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I wonder how much of me loving dressing up like a knight or a cowboy maybe a product of my own internalised misogyny\u2019 \u2026 Electra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lance Williams/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The teacher was a libertarian, and his politics shaped Electra\u2019s whole youth: one of their earliest viral hits was a song called <a href=\"https://mises.org/files/im-love-friedrich-hayek-dorian-electra-official-music-video\" title=\"\">I\u2019m In Love With Friedrich Hayek</a>, a ballad to the economist who influenced Reagan and Thatcher\u2019s free-market ideology. \u201cI watch a lot of documentaries about people coming out of cults, because I really relate to that,\u201d Electra says. \u201cWhere it\u2019s a charismatic leader, of young impressionable people, who are all very passionate and want to change the world. And then being led by this charisma into these ideas that now I\u2019m really embarrassed by.\u201d</p> <p>It took going to university in Chicago in 2010 to wake Electra up. \u201cAs a product of human thought, libertarianism is a very interesting thing to study, but it is really poisonous. First, I thought I could change libertarians\u2019 minds and make them more aware of stuff like feminism, and then I was like: no, this isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d One positive takeaway, though, was realising the power of culture to influence thought, and thought to influence culture \u2013 and so they began using music to try and expand minds.</p> <p>\u201cI wrote songs about Descartes,\u201d they say. \u201cAnd I did this little collection of songs all about thought experiments. One was a hair metal song called Brain in a Vat.\u201d Electra also created a web series, playing car salesman Don Bogman \u2013 a grotesque male character they honed while in real life being quite the opposite: a stripper working in a club near Chicago\u2019s airport. Performing their feminine side to the extreme, they served up \u201cbooby shots\u201d dressed in \u201cthe most insane push-up bra ever, this tiny fishnet dress and two thongs. You would put this test tube of tequila and orange juice between your boobs, and the person would have to fish it out with their mouth, and that cost $5. Selling shots was just a vehicle to get talking to people. I would also do topless private lap dances. That\u2019s how you really made money. Sometimes I would tell people about Don Bogman, and they would ask me to do the voice. I\u2019m essentially in drag as a woman \u2013 that\u2019s how I\u2019m feeling \u2013 but I\u2019m telling them I\u2019m this nasty used-car salesman. Some people were not very interested. But the people who were interested, they\u2019d tip me nicely.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0d3b2317eb9c125b6d1dd2d93ab4d8721991dcc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d3b2317eb9c125b6d1dd2d93ab4d8721991dcc5/0_0_5422_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dorian Electra in concert at Elsewhere, New York, May 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"605\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dorian Electra in concert at Elsewhere, New York, May 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adela Loconte/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It all fed into their next job at women\u2019s lifestyle website <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us\" title=\"\">Refinery29</a>, when bosses came across some of Electra\u2019s music and suggested they make songs about sex education. This was their real breakthrough: a series of hilarious high-production pop videos that told the history of feminism, drag, vibrators, the clitoris and high-heeled shoes respectively. In the last song, the rejection of high heels following the French revolution is explained thus: \u201cMonarchy is so last season / The feet of the elite smell like treason.\u201d In another, a dismayed Electra sings of a vaping Dr Freud: \u201cHe couldn\u2019t see / all stimulation happens clitorally.\u201d It\u2019s like the comedy trio The Lonely Island, if they read up on intersectionality.</p> <p>\u201cI wrote them like an essay: the thesis becomes the chorus,\u201d they explain. \u201cI love geometry and formal logic, I\u2019m really analytical. So it\u2019s easier for me to make a song like that than it is for me to be like: let\u2019s dig deep into myself, and pull out some subconscious association and poetry. I\u2019m not romantic at all.\u201d</p> <p>Writing the songs also set Electra on a path to defining their gender identity. After wearing their trademark moustache in a photoshoot for the first time, \u201cI had never felt more like myself than I did in that picture. It communicates man, masculine, within these two little symbols. Putting it on, all of a sudden it makes me feel grounded.\u201d</p> <p>They don\u2019t define as a drag king though \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not a woman dressing as a man, it\u2019s so much more complex than that\u201d \u2013 nor do they feel like a man all the time. \u201cWhen I came across \u2018gender fluid\u2019, I was like: that term actually really resonates with me,\u201d they say. \u201cBut the core of my being is not gendered at all \u2013 even \u2018gender fluid\u2019 is a form of identity that can put somebody in a box.\u201d They say culture is currently at a moment of admitting: \u201cHey, there are many boxes. And then eventually, if humanity survives, it\u2019ll be like: actually, we don\u2019t need these boxes any more. I do think that the labels are incredibly empowering though, and for people to fight just to be in the other box as male and female, as a trans person, is still enormous.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9619e8936461fa12629ce9d8783442f82ecd876\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9619e8936461fa12629ce9d8783442f82ecd876/0_0_3072_3348/918.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Flamboyant is a word that\u2019s been used in a very derogatory way\u2019: Dorian Electra.\" width=\"918\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Flamboyant is a word that\u2019s been used in a very derogatory way\u2019: Dorian Electra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Weston Allen/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The songs on their album \u2013 made collaboratively with a team of songwriters and producers who have ridiculously hip names such as <a href=\"http://www.michaelzarowny.com/about\" title=\"\">Mood Killer</a> and <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/absrdst\" title=\"\">Absrdst</a> \u2013 poke holes in society\u2019s boxes and make faces through them. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDDukLyXY-M\" title=\"\">Career Boy</a> casts Electra as an office drone finding an erotic allure in overwork; the video has them shackled bondage-style to filing cabinets and stapling themselves, before burning out, dying and being revived by a coffee IV. It lampoons the obsessional \u201clet\u2019s get this bread\u201d mindset in the US, but also sympathises with it.

      "bodyText": "Invariably, queer pop stars worship David Bowie, and Dorian Electra is no different. \u201cMy dad got me into Bowie from a really young age,\u201d they say. \u201cI looked up to androgynous rock stars.\u201d What\u2019s less common is worshipping Bono. \u201cHe was one of my heroes as a kid. I know, funny: everyone hates him. But I really loved him, and used to dress up as him. That was one of my first experiences in what I guess you could call drag, but I would call dressing up. I performed the song Vertigo, just for my family \u2013 I drew on a little beard with my stepmom\u2019s eyeliner.\u201d And so, with a home performance of a U2 song, Electra set off on the way to becoming the most lively and witty new pop star of 2019. Assigned female at birth but now defining as gender-fluid, they are about to release their debut album: a brilliant collection of ultra-synthetic, cartoonishly masculine pop, delivered wearing a perfect pencil moustache. Dorian and Electra are the first two names on their birth certificate, along with two more that they ask me not to divulge (along with their age). \u201cI\u2019ll tell all about everything else!\u201d And boy, do they \u2013 their diagnosed attention deficit disorder triggers more than 10,000 words down the phone during our conversation, sentences constantly interrupted with a newer, even more interesting thought. Electra grew up in Houston to an artist mother and a father who performed covers in a rock band after work: \u201cHe\u2019s not the best singer, but he\u2019s got the moves.\u201d The couple split when Electra was five; after that, their mother dated women. \u201cWhen I was eight, I was like: \u2018So this friend of yours is always staying over, are you a lesbian?\u2019 She was like: \u2018Yeah, honey, I am.\u2019 And I was like: \u2018That\u2019s OK.\u2019 I knew those other options were open to me.\u201d As a kid, they felt \u201creally androgynous: I wasn\u2019t into the things girls were into, but I hated sports, or playing with GI Joe. I always identified with the word kid more than girl or boy.\u201d In high school, they would have crushes on boys, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t feel like a girl liking a guy. Love stories in movies were very alienating to me.\u201d One of their teachers, an out, \u201cOscar Wilde type figure\u201d who also worked as the coach of the debating team, beguiled Dorian and the group of \u201cnerdy boys\u201d they fell in with. \u201cWe were \u2026 I\u2019m hesitant to say the word brainwashed, because that takes away my agency, and he did come from a good place. But basically I was brainwashed to think the state was evil, that you can\u2019t use government to do anything good, because it is an institution of force.\u201d The teacher was a libertarian, and his politics shaped Electra\u2019s whole youth: one of their earliest viral hits was a song called I\u2019m In Love With Friedrich Hayek, a ballad to the economist who influenced Reagan and Thatcher\u2019s free-market ideology. \u201cI watch a lot of documentaries about people coming out of cults, because I really relate to that,\u201d Electra says. \u201cWhere it\u2019s a charismatic leader, of young impressionable people, who are all very passionate and want to change the world. And then being led by this charisma into these ideas that now I\u2019m really embarrassed by.\u201d It took going to university in Chicago in 2010 to wake Electra up. \u201cAs a product of human thought, libertarianism is a very interesting thing to study, but it is really poisonous. First, I thought I could change libertarians\u2019 minds and make them more aware of stuff like feminism, and then I was like: no, this isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d One positive takeaway, though, was realising the power of culture to influence thought, and thought to influence culture \u2013 and so they began using music to try and expand minds. \u201cI wrote songs about Descartes,\u201d they say. \u201cAnd I did this little collection of songs all about thought experiments. One was a hair metal song called Brain in a Vat.\u201d Electra also created a web series, playing car salesman Don Bogman \u2013 a grotesque male character they honed while in real life being quite the opposite: a stripper working in a club near Chicago\u2019s airport. Performing their feminine side to the extreme, they served up \u201cbooby shots\u201d dressed in \u201cthe most insane push-up bra ever, this tiny fishnet dress and two thongs. You would put this test tube of tequila and orange juice between your boobs, and the person would have to fish it out with their mouth, and that cost $5. Selling shots was just a vehicle to get talking to people. I would also do topless private lap dances. That\u2019s how you really made money. Sometimes I would tell people about Don Bogman, and they would ask me to do the voice. I\u2019m essentially in drag as a woman \u2013 that\u2019s how I\u2019m feeling \u2013 but I\u2019m telling them I\u2019m this nasty used-car salesman. Some people were not very interested. But the people who were interested, they\u2019d tip me nicely.\u201d It all fed into their next job at women\u2019s lifestyle website Refinery29, when bosses came across some of Electra\u2019s music and suggested they make songs about sex education. This was their real breakthrough: a series of hilarious high-production pop videos that told the history of feminism, drag, vibrators, the clitoris and high-heeled shoes respectively. In the last song, the rejection of high heels following the French revolution is explained thus: \u201cMonarchy is so last season / The feet of the elite smell like treason.\u201d In another, a dismayed Electra sings of a vaping Dr Freud: \u201cHe couldn\u2019t see / all stimulation happens clitorally.\u201d It\u2019s like the comedy trio The Lonely Island, if they read up on intersectionality. \u201cI wrote them like an essay: the thesis becomes the chorus,\u201d they explain. \u201cI love geometry and formal logic, I\u2019m really analytical. So it\u2019s easier for me to make a song like that than it is for me to be like: let\u2019s dig deep into myself, and pull out some subconscious association and poetry. I\u2019m not romantic at all.\u201d Writing the songs also set Electra on a path to defining their gender identity. After wearing their trademark moustache in a photoshoot for the first time, \u201cI had never felt more like myself than I did in that picture. It communicates man, masculine, within these two little symbols. Putting it on, all of a sudden it makes me feel grounded.\u201d They don\u2019t define as a drag king though \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not a woman dressing as a man, it\u2019s so much more complex than that\u201d \u2013 nor do they feel like a man all the time. \u201cWhen I came across \u2018gender fluid\u2019, I was like: that term actually really resonates with me,\u201d they say. \u201cBut the core of my being is not gendered at all \u2013 even \u2018gender fluid\u2019 is a form of identity that can put somebody in a box.\u201d They say culture is currently at a moment of admitting: \u201cHey, there are many boxes. And then eventually, if humanity survives, it\u2019ll be like: actually, we don\u2019t need these boxes any more. I do think that the labels are incredibly empowering though, and for people to fight just to be in the other box as male and female, as a trans person, is still enormous.\u201d The songs on their album \u2013 made collaboratively with a team of songwriters and producers who have ridiculously hip names such as Mood Killer and Absrdst \u2013 poke holes in society\u2019s boxes and make faces through them. Career Boy casts Electra as an office drone finding an erotic allure in overwork; the video has them shackled bondage-style to filing cabinets and stapling themselves, before burning out, dying and being revived by a coffee IV. It lampoons the obsessional \u201clet\u2019s get this bread\u201d mindset in the US, but also sympathises with it. Electra says the song \u201ctries to take a little piece of Wall Street and make it queer\u201d, and queer people tell them that the song helps motivate them through their 9 to 5 \u2013 indeed, wearing the business clothes of the establishment can be a kind of enforced drag. \u201cIt\u2019s how you survive in any capitalist or governmental structure,\u201d Electra says. \u201cTrying to be aware of it and how it\u2019s bad, but in order to cope with living, being able to embrace some of the irony of it.\u201d In Daddy Like, Electra appears as a sugar daddy \u2013 a rich person who funds someone\u2019s lifestyle in exchange for intimacy. They say there are too many songs \u201cthat play into that dynamic without challenging it\u201d, but doesn\u2019t want to tear the daddies down, either. \u201cIt can be sweet. I have a lot of friends who do sex work and have sugar daddies, to fund their prolific, amazing art careers, and would not be able to do that if they didn\u2019t have that support. So it was also about getting rid of some of the shame and stigma around that.\u201d The staggeringly good, utterly OTT Flamboyant, meanwhile, is a celebration of foppishness. \u201cFlamboyant is a word that\u2019s been used in a very derogatory way, like \u2018flagrant\u2019: an obvious gay, effeminate person,\u201d they say. So Electra took the term back to its origins in French gothic architecture, to describe flames in stained glass. \u201cAnything colourful that\u2019s begging to be looked at and is out there and bright \u2013 those meanings all came together.

Not falling into feminine pop tropes, but still being able to take a bit of the Britney Spears vibe in what I do, and the polish of the sound and the visuals. And being like: hey, I\u2019m just me.\u201d For Electra, flamboyance is a symptom of camp, an \u201cinherently queer\u201d state. \u201cCamp sees outside of the status quo, and also has a sense of humour, to cope with it, that\u2019s knowing but also sincere.\u201d No wonder they are about to go on tour with Charli XCX, another pop star who walks that line.

Additionally, 62% of land is \u201clocked up\u201d or \u201csemi-locked up\u201d by law or regulatory constraints due to environmental reasons in terms of land development, according to the thinktank Our Hong Kong Foundation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2019/jul/09/cities-from-scratch-100-and-counting-new-cities-rise-from-the-desert-jungle-and-sea\">Cities from scratch: watch new cities rise from the desert, jungle and sea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt is crucial that we look for a new source of land supply by building new towns with newly created lands,\u201d says Stephen Wong, the thinktank\u2019s deputy executive director.</p> <p>The city, which has been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/jun/10/hong-kong-protests-in-pictures\">scene of mass protests and clashes</a> against the government\u2019s controversial extradition bill, is pushing ahead with plans to build one of the world\u2019s largest manmade islands. Called Lantau Tomorrow Vision, the project will cost upwards of HK$624bn (\u00a360bn) and involve reclaiming 1,700 hectares (4,200 acres) of land out at sea to house up to 1.1 million people on artificial islands.</p> <p>Reclamation work is scheduled to begin in 2025, with the first residents moving in by 2032. The initial phase consists of creating 1,000 hectares of land around the island of Kau Yi Chau in the central waterway east of Lantau \u2013 the city\u2019s biggest outlying island.</p> <p>A further 700-hectare reclamation will follow in a second phase. Once completed, the reclaimed land will house 700,000 to 1.1 million people in up to 400,000 homes. Seventy per cent will be public housing and 30% private. It will also be home to Hong Kong\u2019s third central business district and a cross-sea transport network.</p> <h2>\u2018Worse to come\u2019</h2> <p>Hong Kong\u2019s land shortage has fuelled property prices, leaving the city burdened with the world\u2019s most unaffordable property market. The average household needs to spend 19 years\u2019 worth of income to purchase an apartment.</p> <p>Meanwhile, population density has reached 27,400 persons per square km of developed land, even outranking Mumbai evenfor overcrowding. More than 200,000 people live in sub-divided flats in Hong Kong, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2017/jun/07/boxed-life-inside-hong-kong-coffin-cubicles-cage-homes-in-pictures\">including 20-sq</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2017/jun/07/boxed-life-inside-hong-kong-coffin-cubicles-cage-homes-in-pictures\">-foot \u201ccoffin homes\u201d</a>. The average waiting time for public housing has risen to 5.5 years, an 18-year peak. In the five years to 2017 alone, the cumulative shortfall of Hong Kong\u2019s public and private housing supply reached 99,000 units.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c5778e95995d7b16da0c58d7051adc37988dceb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c5778e95995d7b16da0c58d7051adc37988dceb/22_0_4585_2751/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lantau island.

In the next 30 years, Our Hong Kong Foundation predicts the city will need an additional 9,000 hectares of land to increase per capita living space, reduce population density and provide enough land for the essential supporting facilities.</p> <p>Hong Kong is no stranger to reclamation. Approximately 6% of the city\u2019s land is reclaimed and is home to 27% of its population. Since the 1970s, Hong Kong has built nine towns including Shatin, Tuen Mun and Tseung Kwan O. Most involved substantial reclamation.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just Hong Kong. Increasingly, artificial islands are being floated as solutions to some of the pressing challenges that cities face around overcrowding and rising land prices. Singapore has used reclamation to expand its land mass by 25%, helping it stay more competitive than Hong Kong in terms of commercial and residential property prices. Meanwhile, Dubai\u2019s Palm Islands were built to increase the amount of premium waterfront land available, elevating the city\u2019s tourism economy to attract luxury hotels and resorts, and the very wealthy.</p> <h2>\u2018Pouring money into the sea\u2019</h2> <p>Critics claim building artificial islands is \u201cpouring money into the sea\u201d and will wipe out the city\u2019s fiscal reserves.

      "bodyText": "\u201cReclamation is unavoidable,\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, told journalists in a Q&amp;A session on land supply last year. \u201cIn the long term, many developing cities have to adopt this choice.\u201d Hong Kong suffers from chronic overcrowding and housing shortages \u2013 a situation made worse by the 150 residence permits a day that have been issued to mainland Chinese citizens since 1997. Additionally, 62% of land is \u201clocked up\u201d or \u201csemi-locked up\u201d by law or regulatory constraints due to environmental reasons in terms of land development, according to the thinktank Our Hong Kong Foundation. \u201cIt is crucial that we look for a new source of land supply by building new towns with newly created lands,\u201d says Stephen Wong, the thinktank\u2019s deputy executive director. The city, which has been the scene of mass protests and clashes against the government\u2019s controversial extradition bill, is pushing ahead with plans to build one of the world\u2019s largest manmade islands. Called Lantau Tomorrow Vision, the project will cost upwards of HK$624bn (\u00a360bn) and involve reclaiming 1,700 hectares (4,200 acres) of land out at sea to house up to 1.1 million people on artificial islands. Reclamation work is scheduled to begin in 2025, with the first residents moving in by 2032. The initial phase consists of creating 1,000 hectares of land around the island of Kau Yi Chau in the central waterway east of Lantau \u2013 the city\u2019s biggest outlying island. A further 700-hectare reclamation will follow in a second phase. Once completed, the reclaimed land will house 700,000 to 1.1 million people in up to 400,000 homes. Seventy per cent will be public housing and 30% private. It will also be home to Hong Kong\u2019s third central business district and a cross-sea transport network. \u2018Worse to come\u2019 Hong Kong\u2019s land shortage has fuelled property prices, leaving the city burdened with the world\u2019s most unaffordable property market. The average household needs to spend 19 years\u2019 worth of income to purchase an apartment. Meanwhile, population density has reached 27,400 persons per square km of developed land, even outranking Mumbai evenfor overcrowding. More than 200,000 people live in sub-divided flats in Hong Kong, including 20-sq-foot \u201ccoffin homes\u201d. The average waiting time for public housing has risen to 5.5 years, an 18-year peak. In the five years to 2017 alone, the cumulative shortfall of Hong Kong\u2019s public and private housing supply reached 99,000 units. \u201cThe housing crisis has deepened and the worst is yet to come,\u201d says Wong. In the next 30 years, Our Hong Kong Foundation predicts the city will need an additional 9,000 hectares of land to increase per capita living space, reduce population density and provide enough land for the essential supporting facilities. Hong Kong is no stranger to reclamation. Approximately 6% of the city\u2019s land is reclaimed and is home to 27% of its population. Since the 1970s, Hong Kong has built nine towns including Shatin, Tuen Mun and Tseung Kwan O. Most involved substantial reclamation. It\u2019s not just Hong Kong. Increasingly, artificial islands are being floated as solutions to some of the pressing challenges that cities face around overcrowding and rising land prices. Singapore has used reclamation to expand its land mass by 25%, helping it stay more competitive than Hong Kong in terms of commercial and residential property prices. Meanwhile, Dubai\u2019s Palm Islands were built to increase the amount of premium waterfront land available, elevating the city\u2019s tourism economy to attract luxury hotels and resorts, and the very wealthy. \u2018Pouring money into the sea\u2019 Critics claim building artificial islands is \u201cpouring money into the sea\u201d and will wipe out the city\u2019s fiscal reserves. Several major infrastructure projects have suffered delays and budget overruns in recent years, which has diminished public confidence. Then there\u2019s the environmental damage. \u201cThe project will cause permanent loss of habitat and change of hydrology, and have a significant negative impact on marine ecology and the livelihoods of Hong Kong fishermen,\u201d says Angel Lam, senior conservation officer at WWF-Hong Kong. Environmentalists such as Angel Lam are urging the government to adopt a \u201cbrownfield first\u201d policy instead. This would involve developing more than 1,000 hectares of existing brownfield land in the city\u2019s New Territories area. \u201cWhy does the government have to do all the destructive reclamation to create 1,000 hectares of land when there is already a 1,000 hectares of land waiting in the New Territories,\u201d says Greenpeace senior campaigner Andy Chu Kong. \u201cThe issue is that we are not lacking land in Hong Kong, we are lacking the lack of government\u2019s proper planning on the existing land that we already have.\u201d Tom Yam, a member of the Citizen Task Force on Land Resources, questions the conceptual viability of building artificial islands, given the climate emergency and rising sea levels. \u201cNo other government plans a city with up to one million people in the middle of the sea when other countries are taking steps to anticipate rising sea levels,\u201d says Yam. \u201cWhy build a city in harm\u2019s way?

That\u2019s because they inevitably put the costs of cleaning the air on to individual drivers \u2013 who must pay fees or buy better vehicles \u2013 rather than on to the car manufacturers whose cheating is the real cause of our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/28/dieselgate-33m-polluting-cars-still-on-eu-roads\" title=\"\">toxic pollution</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s not hard to imagine a similar reversal happening in London.

And if Sadiq Khan wins and extends it to the North and South Circular roads in 2021 as he intends, it is sure to spark intense opposition from the far larger number of motorists who will then be affected.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that measures such as London\u2019s Ulez are useless. Far from it. Local officials are using the levers that are available to them to safeguard residents\u2019 health in the face of a serious threat. The zones do deliver some improvements to air quality, and the science tells us that means real health benefits \u2013 fewer heart attacks, strokes and premature births, less cancer, dementia and asthma. <a href=\"https://www.who.int/airpollution/ambient/health-impacts/en/\" title=\"\">Fewer untimely deaths</a>. </p> <p>But mayors and councillors can only do so much about a problem that is far bigger than any one city or town.

And of course all their old cars, which violate the rules even more egregiously, are still on our roads too.</p> <p>In addition to stunning corporate malfeasance, the diesel cheating revelations also laid bare the profound shortcomings of regulators who failed for years to stop it.</p> <p>In the US, authorities required Volkswagen to spend billions of dollars to compensate customers and buy back cheating cars, or fix them so they would run cleaner. There are many more diesels in Europe, so the harm to health has been far greater \u2013 more than 11,000 deaths annually from nitrogen dioxide emitted beyond legal limits, according to <a href=\"https://www.theicct.org/sites/default/files/NOx%20Health%20Fact%20Sheet%20global%202post.pdf\" title=\"\">one study</a>.

We must move to electric vehicles, and away from car-centric cities, toward better public transport and infrastructure that makes cycling and walking easier.</p> <p>But even so, our air would be so much cleaner if the cars on our roads right now met the pollution limits that already exist on paper.

      "bodyText": "Madrid was hailed as a public health beacon last November when it rolled out ambitious restrictions on the most polluting cars. Seven months and one election day later, a new conservative city council suspended enforcement of the clean air zone, a first step toward its possible demise. Mayor Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida made opposition to the zone a centrepiece of his election campaign, despite its success in improving air quality. A judge has now overruled the city\u2019s decision to stop levying fines, ordering them reinstated. But with legal battles ahead, the zone\u2019s future looks uncertain at best. Madrid\u2019s back and forth on clean air is a pointed reminder of the limits to the patchwork, city-by-city approach that characterises efforts on air pollution across Europe, Britain very much included. Among other weaknesses, the measures cities must employ when left to tackle dirty air on their own are politically contentious, and therefore vulnerable. That\u2019s because they inevitably put the costs of cleaning the air on to individual drivers \u2013 who must pay fees or buy better vehicles \u2013 rather than on to the car manufacturers whose cheating is the real cause of our toxic pollution. It\u2019s not hard to imagine a similar reversal happening in London. The new ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) is likely to be a big issue in next year\u2019s mayoral election. And if Sadiq Khan wins and extends it to the North and South Circular roads in 2021 as he intends, it is sure to spark intense opposition from the far larger number of motorists who will then be affected. It\u2019s not that measures such as London\u2019s Ulez are useless. Far from it. Local officials are using the levers that are available to them to safeguard residents\u2019 health in the face of a serious threat. The zones do deliver some improvements to air quality, and the science tells us that means real health benefits \u2013 fewer heart attacks, strokes and premature births, less cancer, dementia and asthma. Fewer untimely deaths. But mayors and councillors can only do so much about a problem that is far bigger than any one city or town. They are acting because national governments \u2013 Britain\u2019s and others across Europe \u2013 have failed to do so. Restrictions that keep highly polluting cars out of certain areas \u2013 city centres, \u201cschool streets\u201d, even individual roads \u2013 are a response to the absence of a larger effort to properly enforce existing regulations and require auto companies to bring their vehicles into compliance. Wales has introduced special low speed limits to minimise pollution. We\u2019re doing everything but insist that manufacturers clean up their cars. Nearly four years after the Volkswagen scandal exposed rampant rule-breaking and bending across the industry, car makers are still selling diesels whose nitrogen dioxide emissions are many times over the legal limit. And of course all their old cars, which violate the rules even more egregiously, are still on our roads too. In addition to stunning corporate malfeasance, the diesel cheating revelations also laid bare the profound shortcomings of regulators who failed for years to stop it. In the US, authorities required Volkswagen to spend billions of dollars to compensate customers and buy back cheating cars, or fix them so they would run cleaner. There are many more diesels in Europe, so the harm to health has been far greater \u2013 more than 11,000 deaths annually from nitrogen dioxide emitted beyond legal limits, according to one study. But VW and its peers have mostly been able to get away with cheaper software tweaks that haven\u2019t solved the problem. Of course, we\u2019ll never have truly healthy air \u2013 or hope of stabilising the climate \u2013 while cars run on fossil fuels. We must move to electric vehicles, and away from car-centric cities, toward better public transport and infrastructure that makes cycling and walking easier. But even so, our air would be so much cleaner if the cars on our roads right now met the pollution limits that already exist on paper. Insisting manufacturers make those cars cleaner would be far more effective than policing exactly where they can go. Last month, equipment problems forced Birmingham and Leeds to delay implementation of their planned clean air zones. That was about logistics, not public opposition \u2013 although there is that too \u2013 but it highlights the inevitable difficulties when each city and town must fend for itself. Diesel owners, like all of us who breathe the foul fumes their cars pump out, are not perpetrators, but victims of one the biggest corporate scandals ever. We are all paying a steep price, a cost exacted in health harmed and lives lost, as well as pounds and pence. The question is who will pay to clean up. No local official has the power to require a vast corporation to rectify its misdeeds. Only national governments, and European authorities, can do that. In April, German prosecutors charged former Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn with fraud, adding to the US indictment he already faced. European regulators have moved towards on-road testing to remedy the weaknesses VW exploited with \u201cdefeat device\u201d software designed to cheat in-the-lab checks. But other loopholes remain. And instead of pushing to upgrade or retire the millions of cars still shattering pollution limits, governments seem to be waiting for changes in consumer tastes \u2013 spurred by local clampdowns \u2013 to get the dirtiest diesels parked for good. Even short of making the companies pay, a national scrappage scheme that helps owners junk the dirtiest diesels would shift the financial burden of a cleanup from individuals to the public purse. For now, mayors and councils are doing their best with the tools they have. While Madrid backs away from action, Paris is pushing ahead, tightening its clean air zone this week and planning to ban diesels altogether by 2024. Unless, of course, a future mayor decides not to. \u2022 Beth Gardiner is an environmental journalist and author of Choked: The Age of Air Pollution and the Fight for a Cleaner Future",

That was made explicitly clear to Greece more than once in a European context. \u201cElections cannot be allowed to change an economic programme of a member state,\u201d the former German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble told Varoufakis. \u201cThere can be no democratic choice against the European treaties,\u201d said the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. That\u2019s not necessarily a reason for the left to eschew electoral politics. But it should frame expectations about what can be achieved and where power lies. Finally, and consequently, the left cannot limit itself to an electoral strategy alone. Many major social and political advances, from civil rights, workers\u2019 rights, feminism and even democracy itself, started as social movements to distribute and democratise power. Professional politicians signed them into law. But it took a coalition between the electoral and the social to make them happen. In power, more than ever, it needs social movements to sustain these advances. In just four years, the left has created electoral and political space it had not imagined possible. Whether it can hold that space depends very much on what it builds on it. \u2022 Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Investigative website Bellingcat is getting into the podcast game with a series looking at Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, the plane that was shot down over eastern Ukraine in 2014, killing 294 people. The podcast will provide the inside story, tracking down the source of the weapon that downed the plane and the extent of Russian involvement in the attack. Meanwhile, anyone wanting to learn more about Bellingcat should check out the episode of the Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus podcast with founder Eliot Higgins from earlier this year. Picks of the week The Two Shot Podcast Craig \u201cDot Cottan\u201d Parkinson\u2019s luvvie-free podcast about acting is back after a break, and the new season is off to a cracking start. Last week, he and Morven Christie shared genuine outrage as she talked about moments when she witnessed bullying and harassment on set, but there were plenty of laughs too. In the latest episode, Parkinson turns to music with Joan As Police Woman as his guest. The chats often go on for an hour-and-a-half but there\u2019s not a minute wasted with warmth, humour and a whole lot of honesty. Hannah Verdier After: Surviving Sexual Assault Catriona Morton survived sexual abuse in childhood and assault in adulthood and is now helping other survivors tell their stories in this new podcast. It\u2019s in two parts, so if hearing details of assault or court cases is triggering for listeners during \u201cThen\u201d, you can skip it and go straight to \u201cNow\u201d, where survivors give advice and reveal what helped them in their recovery. Morton is sensitive, thoughtful and brave: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that what happened to us defined us, but I do believe that the fact that we survived does.\u201d HV Guardian Pick: Today in Focus When asked about \u201cdoing your bit\u201d for the environment, many people will point to recycling. And despite it making us all feel a little better about our own footprint, Monday\u2019s episode of Today in Focus uncovers what really happens to the waste in our recycling bins. Word of warning; it ain\u2019t pretty. And it certainly won\u2019t make you feel any better!

But who\u2019s buying it?</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s the type of girl who\u2019s fun and outgoing and has a sense of humor whilst also being really pretty,\u201d one fan told the Guardian via Instagram DM. \u201cI can\u2019t really explain the bath water. I think it\u2019s more of a talking piece. For the vast majority I think it\u2019s just merchandise.\u201d</p> <p>But although her stunt received much media attention, the idea was inspired by a running joke among her fans.</p> <p>Delphine told the Guardian: \u201cLots of people would comment on my photos saying they would drink my bath water. I was thinking of ideas one day, and it just popped into my head. What if I actually bottled and sold my bath water?\u201d</p> <p>The bath water sale comes in the wake of an array of strange stunts. Delphine has <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BytIxQ6pzm9/\">stuck googly eyes</a> on a dead octopus, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyOtMtG3jUY\">eaten photographs</a> of her followers and other internet personalities, and filmed herself eating <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv2YhSVFi6j/?hl=en\">raw eggs</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/belle-delphine-makes-a-pornhub-account-but-makes-troll-videos-instead-of-porn/?europe=true\">Delphine once</a> trolled her followers by promising to create a Pornhub account \u2013 only to then upload non-explicit videos of herself performing everyday activities, each a pun playing off common tropes found in pornography. One video \u2013 \u201cBelle Delphine gets SCISSORED\u201d \u2013 showed Delphine demurely cutting up paper with a pair of scissors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"insta\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

      "bodyText": "Belle Delphine, the social media star and so-called \u201cgamer girl\u201d, made headlines this week for selling her used bath water online. Delphine, 19, who has a global following (4.2 million on Instagram), announced she would be selling $30 bottles of \u201cbath water for all you thirsty gamer boys\u201d in an Instagram post that garnered more than 500,000 likes. Although the sale was widely mocked, the bottles of bath water sold out immediately. But who\u2019s buying it? \u201cShe\u2019s the type of girl who\u2019s fun and outgoing and has a sense of humor whilst also being really pretty,\u201d one fan told the Guardian via Instagram DM. \u201cI can\u2019t really explain the bath water. I think it\u2019s more of a talking piece. For the vast majority I think it\u2019s just merchandise.\u201d But although her stunt received much media attention, the idea was inspired by a running joke among her fans. Delphine told the Guardian: \u201cLots of people would comment on my photos saying they would drink my bath water. I was thinking of ideas one day, and it just popped into my head. What if I actually bottled and sold my bath water?\u201d The bath water sale comes in the wake of an array of strange stunts. Delphine has stuck googly eyes on a dead octopus, eaten photographs of her followers and other internet personalities, and filmed herself eating raw eggs. Delphine once trolled her followers by promising to create a Pornhub account \u2013 only to then upload non-explicit videos of herself performing everyday activities, each a pun playing off common tropes found in pornography. One video \u2013 \u201cBelle Delphine gets SCISSORED\u201d \u2013 showed Delphine demurely cutting up paper with a pair of scissors. She said: \u201cI\u2019m lucky. I can do crazy things and get to see the world react to it, and there\u2019s definitely enjoyment in that, even if it\u2019s sometimes a little scary. I get a bigger reaction to my weirder content but I think that\u2019s only possible because I also make risqu\u00e9 content.\u201d Delphine\u2019s actions may seem dubious or nonsensical, but her porn-lite style exists on the cusp of an adult industry foundering in the face of freely available content. Her tongue-in-cheek approach to the world of NSFW content has allowed her to carve out a niche and collect a colossal social media following. And all without going outside the parameters she\u2019s comfortable with. \u201cI think for most the appeal is that she\u2019s so out there,\u201d one of Delphine\u2019s Instagram followers said. \u201cHer stuff is really kooky with lots of gimmicks.

A magpie rasps from a silver birch. Sparrows keep up a continual chatter in an ash tree or perch on the top bars of a fence painted traditional Falu red.

      "bodyText": "Indigenous elders whose childhoods were torn apart as part of the stolen generation are now facing a second round of heartbreaking separation from loved ones in their old age, the aged care royal commission heard this week. . As aged care and health systems are failing to adequately look after them in remote outback communities, many are medically evacuated to cities and die hundreds of kilometres from their homes. Aboriginal elder Mildred Numamurdirdi is from Numbulwar in the Northern Territory \u2013 a small community on the Gulf of Carpentaria. Since March last year, she has been 800 kilometres away at the Royal Darwin Hospital and remains unable to return home because of ongoing ill health. \u201cI am myself sad, far away from my family,\u201d she said from her portable hospital bed. \u201cMy heart is crying. We can hardly stand to be away from our children and grandchildren. \u201cIf I pass away here, it is far for me to get to my spirit, my culture, my ceremony.\u201d Central Australian Aboriginal congress chief medical officer John Boffa was damning of the health and aged care systems\u2019 lack of reach. \u201cWe have had 28 years of sustained economic growth and we can\u2019t even make sure that old people can be cared for close to home in communities of very considerable size,\u201d Dr Boffa said. The commission was told of the huge scope to train Indigenous people to be aged care workers in remote communities. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Failing on wounds The commission, which held hearings in Darwin this week, also heard stories of multiple failures across the sector and the rest of the country. The late Italian migrant Annunziata \u201cNancy\u201d Santoro was a hard-working seamstress and a keen gardener. A foot infection contributed to her death at the age of 94 last October. Santoro had dementia and a year earlier had entered the Assisi nursing home at Rosanna in Melbourne which cares for Italian-speaking elderly people. On Wednesday, her daughter, Anamaria Ng, cried as she told the commission her mother would still be alive if she had received proper treatment for the wound on her foot, which became infected and had maggots. For two months, the wound deteriorated, and weight-bearing exercise recommended by a physiotherapist made the pain worse. The ward manager, Jumuna Jacob, had tried to stop Santoro\u2019s GP, Eric Tay, telling Ng and her brothers about the maggots, according to the doctor. Tay told the hearing Jacob was \u201ctense\u201d and \u201canxious\u201d about disclosing the maggots to the family and was worried about getting into trouble. The hearing was told a fly would have had to have landed on the wound to lay eggs for a maggot infestation to occur. Ng said Jacob told her that \u201cmaggots are used in modern medicine\u201d and was \u201ctrying to downplay the significance of the whole thing\u201d. The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission had investigated Ng\u2019s complaint and found significant gaps in Santoro\u2019s care. The hearing was told that within a month of Santoro\u2019s death, the former agency responsible for nursing home audits had assessed that Assisi had met all 44 quality standards. No sanctions were imposed on the nursing home. Assisi\u2019s interim chief executive officer Paul Cohen told the hearing a \u201croot cause analysis\u201d was being undertaken into the case and that the former chief executive, who cannot be legally named, had recently been sacked. Cohen agreed there had been \u201csystemic failures\u201d around Santoro\u2019s care. In a separate case, examined on Tuesday, the commission heard about feet pressure ulcers on a elderly Wollongong woman which were missed by poorly trained staff. One foot was so damaged that bone was exposed. Shirley Fowler, 92, had dementia but had been physically mobile when she moved into residential care at the IRT William Beach Gardens nursing home south of Wollongong in 2013. Fowler developed contractures in her leg, which resulted in the \u201cfreezing\u201d of a limb in a crooked position due to the atrophy of muscles. A lack of exercise had contributed to this condition. Contractures cannot be reversed. Her daughter, Lyndall Fowler, a former nurse, said her mother could no longer move any part of her body except for her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s very stressful to not only have to witness her deterioration and loss of independence and dignity but to have to time and again bring things up that shouldn\u2019t have been my role,\u201d her daughter said. Her mother required hand-feeding and a lactose-free diet but this wasn\u2019t always available, and the hearing was told that Fowler often had food spilled all over her clothes. Lyndall Fowler called for increased pay for aged care staff to improve quality. \u201cIf the pay of people doing the important and challenging work of caring for the most vulnerable people in society like my mother ... is less than someone serving hamburgers at McDonald\u2019s, what does that say about our society?\u201d Kristy Taylor, the IRT William Beach Gardens care manager, rejected claims of inadequate staff training. Counsel assisting Peter Gray QC asked her if staff had \u201cslipped back into mistakes from time to time\u201d. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say \u2018slipped back into\u2019. We get different staff, new staff, that then require education and training, and then we provide that to them, to make sure they\u2019re up to date with the requirements of residents,\u201d Taylor said. Failing on safety and comfort Lisa Backhouse told the commission on Thursday she was forced to install video surveillance in her mother Christine Weightman\u2019s nursing home room following a series of unwitnessed falls and two reported assaults. \u201cI can watch my mum on my phone from anywhere at any time of day and I can be involved in her care doing that, \u201d Backhouse said. \u201cShort of moving in and sleeping by her bedside, I don\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d Weightman, who has dementia, had been left undiscovered for hours with a broken leg which resembled a \u201csnapped tree branch\u201d in 2017 the commission heard. The commission heard that after three months at a new Brisbane nursing home, the centre manager phoned Backhouse to say that her mother had been hit by one of the carers. The worker was stood down but the investigation concluded there were \u201cmitigating circumstances\u201d. Backhouse told the hearing few weeks later, the manager phoned her again to say: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to have to call you about another incident. I\u2019m afraid your mum has been hit again\u201d. The second carer had \u201chit with intent and force, twice on her upper leg\u201d. She was sacked and police have charged her with one count of serious assault. The hearing was told the surveillance camera revealed neglect, including Weightman being left waiting on a floor for 43 minutes after a fall in May as she tried to get up to go to the toilet. Backhouse believes low staff ratios and a lack of resources devoted to regularly toileting her mother contributed to her falls. Weightman, a former nurse, was also left shivering without blankets for 10 hours during a cold winter\u2019s night after they fell off her bed. \u201cWe need a strong policeman on the beat,\u201d Backhouse said. \u201cA regulator must be given punitive powers in order to be able to fine and penalise nursing homes that fail in their duty of care.\u201d Hearings continue next week in Cairns. Sudden closure Meanwhile, families and authorities in Queensland are grappling with the sudden closure of a Gold Coast nursing home. Seventy residents were evacuated on Thursday night from Earle Haven Retirement Village, following a commercial dispute between the owner and medical contractor. The residents have been transferred to a nearby facility. The federal government has vowed to investigate. Leading Age Services Australia, the peak aged care industry body, described the situation as appalling. \u201cOur first concern is for the welfare of the residents and our thoughts are with them and their loved ones,\u201d chief executive Sean Rooney said. Aged care minister Richard Colbeck says it appeared the subcontractor withdrew all services without notice. \u201cI will be looking to bring the full force possible of action onto those who put residents of Earle Haven in such a terrible position \u2013 it is simply unacceptable,\u201d Colbeck said on Friday.",

      "bodyText": "Indigenous traditional owners opposed to the Adani Carmichael coalmine have lost a full-bench appeal to the federal court, which has upheld a land-use agreement and ordered a group of elders to pay the miner\u2019s costs. The minority group of five Wangan and Jagalingou (W&amp;J) people had sought to invalidate an Indigenous land-use agreement (ILUA) approved by seven of 12 native title applicants. In a 44-page judgment, the three judges unanimously dismissed arguments that the agreement did not meet the legal requirements of the Native Title Act, partly because of the process and composition of an authorisation meeting that voted 294-1 in favour. Justice Melissa Perry reasoned that this was the case \u201cnotwithstanding any deficiencies which might have tainted the validity of the certification\u201d. The Queensland government has been waiting for the outcome of the court case, and can act at any time to formally extinguish the native title of the W&amp;J people at the Carmichael mine site. The minority W&amp;J group is likely to make a direct appeal to the government to not extinguish the native title, and that the legal decision should not invalidate its arguments that the process was flawed. \u201cThe decision [hinged] only on the question of whether the certification and registration of the Adani ILUA were administered according to the legal requirements of the Native Title Act,\u201d the W&amp;J family council senior spokesman Adrian Burragubba said. \u201cIt will not pull back the veil on the \u2026 process leading up to and after the authorisation meeting.

How the art world is rewriting history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She was admired for her honesty (the Brisbane gallery owner Philip Bacon, who exhibited Olley\u2019s works extensively, told Hawley: \u201cOll is a saint, but not an easy woman \u2026 She\u2019ll tell you what is wrong with you, your pictures, your attitude, your gallery. She\u2019ll say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry dear, but ... \u2019\u201d); she nurtured countless Australian artists (Quilty, whose major retrospective is running alongside Olley\u2019s at Goma, refers to himself as one of the many \u201cducklings\u201d she had under her wing); and she was paid well for her art (in 1962, the Courier-Mail recorded that Olley was the most highly paid female artist in Australia).</p> <p>It\u2019s unusual \u2013 and difficult \u2013 for female artists to be celebrated in this country. The artist Elvis Richardson\u2019s <a href=\"http://thecountessreport.com.au/\">Countess Report</a> has been publishing the stats on gender representation in Australian contemporary visual arts since 2008.

The Australian artist Tai Snaith, shortlisted in this year\u2019s World Illustration awards, says it comes down to traditional sexism. \u201cThere\u2019s no support for us once you get out there,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to maintain a practice in the dark \u2013 to just keep bashing away at this idea of being a professional artist but without anyone giving you opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>Which makes it all the more interesting that Olley achieved the acclaim and popularity she did during her lifetime. The curator of Goma\u2019s exhibition, Michael Hawker, speculates that her commercial success was \u2013 and is \u2013 due to the likability of the works. \u201cAnyone could live very easily with an Olley painting,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing aggressive. It\u2019s all about beauty, flora \u2013 it\u2019s all the good things.\u201d</p> <p>And while this may seem like a far less powerful proposition than, say, Quilty\u2019s big, brooding and aggressive works that hang in <a href=\"https://www.qagoma.qld.gov.au/whats-on/exhibitions/quilty\">the rooms adjacent</a> \u2013 <em>what\u2019s such a big deal about a bunch of cornflowers? </em>\u2013 they are transformative.

She bought up real estate in Paddington and Newcastle in the 1960s and resold it, making herself independently wealthy. She then used this money, in conjunction with her increasing social capital, to fund the arts, lobby for arts funding and mentor young artists. As Snaith points out: \u201cBen Quilty wouldn\u2019t exist without Margaret Olley.\u201d</p> <p>But what about her paintings of Indigenous Australians? Several of these hang in Goma\u2019s exhibition, including some of nude women \u2013 all painted in a style that instantly reminds one of male western artists (comparisons were made to Gauguin at the time of their first exhibition in 1962). The models are reclined or otherwise positioned for the viewer to gaze upon their naked forms.</p> <p>Today it\u2019s hard not to find these works fetishistic. Olley was, after all, fascinated by their skin tones. She did pay her models, but Glenn Cooke, a former curator of decorative arts at the Queensland Art Gallery, <a href=\"https://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=592814648383788;res=IELNZC;type=pdf\">has noted that</a>, as far as Olley knew, they never even attended her 1962 show.</p> <p>The exhibition won Olley accolades (the Bulletin at the time described these works as \u201cliterally colossal in power, skill and colour \u2026 Margaret Olley has reached the flood tide of her art and has stepped up to the top ranks of our artists\u201d). It was also the show that made her the best-paid female artist in Australia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0c585111fa732c837ba0c37b95507f088896509f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c585111fa732c837ba0c37b95507f088896509f/0_0_2000_1273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Five of the paintings on show at Goma\" width=\"1000\" height=\"637\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Five of the paintings on show at Goma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Natasha Harth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Olley makes for a fascinating portrait of power: a woman who became a powerful figure in the fine art world, in spite of sexism; empowered herself financially; paved the way for other artists and made it her mission to leverage government support for the arts; painted artworks of Indigenous Australians that reflect a white, fetishistic, traditional male gaze \u2013 and won money and acclaim for doing so. Our understanding of her legacy goes beyond the irrepressible joy her paintings still bring \u2013 and it\u2019s only just beginning.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Margaret Olley: A Generous Life and Quilty are both on show at Goma until 13 October</em></p>",

In this sense, Olley was also a muse, albeit a bewildered one: according to Janet Hawley\u2019s book of essays Artists in Conversation, she would often say: \u201cI have no idea why they all want to paint me \u2013 I think I look like a pudding.\u201d These works, some of which form Goma\u2019s exhibition Margaret Olley: A Generous Life, reflect the incredible reputation she enjoyed during her lifetime. She was admired for her honesty (the Brisbane gallery owner Philip Bacon, who exhibited Olley\u2019s works extensively, told Hawley: \u201cOll is a saint, but not an easy woman \u2026 She\u2019ll tell you what is wrong with you, your pictures, your attitude, your gallery. She\u2019ll say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry dear, but ... \u2019\u201d); she nurtured countless Australian artists (Quilty, whose major retrospective is running alongside Olley\u2019s at Goma, refers to himself as one of the many \u201cducklings\u201d she had under her wing); and she was paid well for her art (in 1962, the Courier-Mail recorded that Olley was the most highly paid female artist in Australia). It\u2019s unusual \u2013 and difficult \u2013 for female artists to be celebrated in this country. The artist Elvis Richardson\u2019s Countess Report has been publishing the stats on gender representation in Australian contemporary visual arts since 2008. Data from 2014 shows that more than 74% of local art school graduates are female but, if you look in our state museums \u2013 spaces dedicated to the pinnacle of artistic achievement \u2013 you\u2019ll find that just 34% of works on show are by women. Why the gap? The Australian artist Tai Snaith, shortlisted in this year\u2019s World Illustration awards, says it comes down to traditional sexism. \u201cThere\u2019s no support for us once you get out there,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to maintain a practice in the dark \u2013 to just keep bashing away at this idea of being a professional artist but without anyone giving you opportunities.\u201d Which makes it all the more interesting that Olley achieved the acclaim and popularity she did during her lifetime. The curator of Goma\u2019s exhibition, Michael Hawker, speculates that her commercial success was \u2013 and is \u2013 due to the likability of the works. \u201cAnyone could live very easily with an Olley painting,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing aggressive. It\u2019s all about beauty, flora \u2013 it\u2019s all the good things.\u201d And while this may seem like a far less powerful proposition than, say, Quilty\u2019s big, brooding and aggressive works that hang in the rooms adjacent \u2013 what\u2019s such a big deal about a bunch of cornflowers? \u2013 they are transformative. Olleys\u2019 paintings lift people\u2019s moods \u2013 and this is a form of great power, too. In many ways, Olley\u2019s legacy is that of a powerful and empowering woman. She bought up real estate in Paddington and Newcastle in the 1960s and resold it, making herself independently wealthy. She then used this money, in conjunction with her increasing social capital, to fund the arts, lobby for arts funding and mentor young artists. As Snaith points out: \u201cBen Quilty wouldn\u2019t exist without Margaret Olley.\u201d But what about her paintings of Indigenous Australians? Several of these hang in Goma\u2019s exhibition, including some of nude women \u2013 all painted in a style that instantly reminds one of male western artists (comparisons were made to Gauguin at the time of their first exhibition in 1962). The models are reclined or otherwise positioned for the viewer to gaze upon their naked forms. Today it\u2019s hard not to find these works fetishistic. Olley was, after all, fascinated by their skin tones. She did pay her models, but Glenn Cooke, a former curator of decorative arts at the Queensland Art Gallery, has noted that, as far as Olley knew, they never even attended her 1962 show. The exhibition won Olley accolades (the Bulletin at the time described these works as \u201cliterally colossal in power, skill and colour \u2026 Margaret Olley has reached the flood tide of her art and has stepped up to the top ranks of our artists\u201d). It was also the show that made her the best-paid female artist in Australia. Olley makes for a fascinating portrait of power: a woman who became a powerful figure in the fine art world, in spite of sexism; empowered herself financially; paved the way for other artists and made it her mission to leverage government support for the arts; painted artworks of Indigenous Australians that reflect a white, fetishistic, traditional male gaze \u2013 and won money and acclaim for doing so. Our understanding of her legacy goes beyond the irrepressible joy her paintings still bring \u2013 and it\u2019s only just beginning. \u2022 Margaret Olley: A Generous Life and Quilty are both on show at Goma until 13 October",

Police have offered few details of what happened before the shooting or why the officer opened fire, and are still investigating the incident. The Orange county district attorney\u2019s office said that the policeman was a local officer with the Fullerton department and was driving on the freeway when he observed the 17-year-old driving at a \u201chigh rate of speed\u201d, adding that the two vehicles \u201cmade physical contact\u201d at some point. Authorities also claim a \u201creplica gun\u201d was \u201crecovered at the scene\u201d. Fullerton police said in a statement on Thursday that the department was still investigating the shooting, but that the incident was caught on body-camera footage and that the agency would release the video in the coming days. A local highway was closed for hours after the shooting. Anaheim police said in a statement following the incident a \u201cfemale suspect\u201d had died at the hospital. Learning to save lives: \u2018She was so proud\u2019 Originally from Arizona, the Williams family moved to Orange county about a year ago, after Hannah\u2019s mother got a new job at a health insurance company.

Ahead of the start of her senior year in the fall, she was overjoyed to get her first real paying job this summer as a lifeguard at Knott\u2019s Berry Farm, a popular theme park near Disneyland. \u201cShe bought notecards so she could write down the different ways to do CPR \u2026 She loved this job,\u201d her father said.

She recently bought a small electric keyboard and was teaching herself piano by watching YouTube videos \u2013 and teaching her father and younger sister how to play at the same time.

On Tuesday, the family demanded answers at a press conference outside Anaheim city hall. Shortly before the news event began, the Orange county district attorney\u2019s office, which is responsible for investigating whether the shooting was justified, released a vague statement about the killing \u2013 claiming that a \u201creplica handgun\u201d was found.

The family said on Thursday afternoon it had not seen the body-camera footage authorities plan to release, and had not had a chance to view Hannah\u2019s body. The Orange county prosecutor\u2019s office told the Guardian on Thursday the replica gun was \u201cfound near her\u201d, but declined to comment further on what led to the shooting. \u2018She\u2019s an angel now\u2019 At the family\u2019s house in Anaheim, there has been ongoing \u201cwailing\u201d and \u201cscreaming\u201d as everyone comes to terms with the loss, said Lynn Williams, Hannah\u2019s grandmother. She said her granddaughter was supposed to visit her later this summer back in Arizona, and that she had talked about wanting to follow in her older sister\u2019s footsteps and join the air force: \u201cShe was a real hard worker.\u201d Looney said she was having a hard time explaining the death to Hannah\u2019s youngest siblings, ages five and nine. Zoe, the nine-year-old, has struggled to accept that her older sister is gone, the mother said: \u201cShe was telling me, \u2018Well, just bring back Hannah. Why can\u2019t you bring her back?\u2019 And I was telling her, \u2018Baby, I can\u2019t bring her back.\u2019 And she was like, \u2018Why not? Just bring her home.\u2019\u201d Hannah\u2019s youngest sibling, her five-year-old brother, is still coming to terms with the fact that Hannah is an \u201cangel\u201d now. But he doesn\u2019t yet know how she died, said Looney. The mother said she kept thinking about a recent conversation they had on Mother\u2019s Day. At church, there was a moment where everyone was told to pray and think about what they want. Looney later asked her daughter what she had prayed for. \u201cShe was like, \u2018I asked for a boyfriend, or a girlfriend. Either!\u2019\u201d the mother recalled, with a smile. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Oh good. It\u2019s gonna come soon.\u2019\u201d",

It is nothing that I expected in my time when first signing a very small contract but it makes a huge difference that we have been all on this amazing professionalism journey together over in such a short space of time. I\u2019ll have more to say about women\u2019s Test cricket next week ahead of our standalone four-day match against England in this Ashes series at Taunton but needless to say, I can\u2019t wait. Because we don\u2019t get the chance to play any other than during these multi-format series, they mean that much more. So, even though we are well ahead in the series and a draw would allow us to retain the trophy before the T20s, we won\u2019t be approaching it that way. We will be playing very positive cricket in an effort to win. Being able to play an important role in our win in Canterbury four years ago is a big thrill of my career so far and I think that the way I can swing the ball will be a major asset. In saying that, I don\u2019t think of my position as completely cemented for it. If I do get the chance to play, a format I loved so much growing up, sharing that new ball with Pez, it will be very special week.",

Clearly, if you are an individual on $88,000 your standard of living is very much better than if you are a family of four getting by on that same amount.</p> <p>That is why the ABS calculates the equivalised disposable income. This sets each household at a single-person level and allows us to compare the standard of living of different sized households on a like for like basis.</p> <p>On this basis the median equivalised disposable income for a single person in 2017-18 was $46,748, and the 90th percentile (the point at which you earn more than 89% of households) was $92,404.</p> <p>To compare household sizes we use an international standard of adding 50% for each adult and 30% for each child under 15.</p> <p>This means the median standard of living for a family of four is $98,171, and similar sized household with an income of $194,048 is in the top 10%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Equivalised household disposable income by income decile and household type 2017-18\">  <iframe title=\"Equivalised household disposable income by income decile and household type 2017-18\" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8zmzq/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But that amount is disposable income \u2013 after tax. It is a bit tricky to work out what this means for gross income, but if we assume the standard 70:30 split of household incomes it means that a median income family of four would have the primary earner on $89,300 and the secondary earner on $31,500.</p> <p>This also highlights that a family of four with total income above $200,000 is in the top 20% and that, should the primary earner in that household be earning more than $200,000, they are most likely in the top 10%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Gross household income by income decile for a family of four\">  <iframe title=\"Gross household income by income decile for a family of four\" aria-label=\"Grouped Column Chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/tIVg4/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Now, maybe the top 10% is not the top end of town, but if it is not, then we really are being rather dismissive of those getting by on much less.

Whether or not the ALP was correct to support the package, it is clear the cause of equality is not helped by Anthony Albanese saying that he does not \u201cregard someone who\u2019s earning $200,000 dollars a year as being from the top end of town\u201d. The latest Survey of Housing and Income, released by the ABS today, shows that belief is complete bollocks. Not only are individuals on $200,000 very much at the top but even households earning that much are. If we just look at all households in Australia we find that the median annual income in 2017-18 was $88,764: But that doesn\u2019t tell us very much about standards of living. Clearly, if you are an individual on $88,000 your standard of living is very much better than if you are a family of four getting by on that same amount. That is why the ABS calculates the equivalised disposable income. This sets each household at a single-person level and allows us to compare the standard of living of different sized households on a like for like basis. On this basis the median equivalised disposable income for a single person in 2017-18 was $46,748, and the 90th percentile (the point at which you earn more than 89% of households) was $92,404. To compare household sizes we use an international standard of adding 50% for each adult and 30% for each child under 15. This means the median standard of living for a family of four is $98,171, and similar sized household with an income of $194,048 is in the top 10%: But that amount is disposable income \u2013 after tax. It is a bit tricky to work out what this means for gross income, but if we assume the standard 70:30 split of household incomes it means that a median income family of four would have the primary earner on $89,300 and the secondary earner on $31,500. This also highlights that a family of four with total income above $200,000 is in the top 20% and that, should the primary earner in that household be earning more than $200,000, they are most likely in the top 10%. Now, maybe the top 10% is not the top end of town, but if it is not, then we really are being rather dismissive of those getting by on much less. That seems to me to be a rather extraordinary position for the leader of a progressive party to be taking. The survey also shows that over the past two years the incomes of the richest 25% have increased by the most of any income quintile. Their 2.8% growth is well ahead of the 1.6% increase of the median quintile: It means that the Gini coefficient, which measures inequality, has risen since 2015-16. While the level is below the peak achieved at the height of the mining boom, it remains well above the level in place during the 1990s: The top 25% now have a greater share of national income than at any time prior to 2007-08: The survey also reveals that fewer Australian households are relying on government welfare than ever this century. Fifty six per cent of households receive 0 to less than 1% of their income from government benefits \u2013 well above the 45% in 2000: It is pretty clear that talk of welfare bludgers is as silly as saying $200,000 is not rich. The survey also highlights that wealth remains very much unequal in Australia. The top 25% saw their wealth increase in the two years to 2017-18 by 17.7% to $1.8m compared to a 15% increase by median households to $320,200. Wealth for the bottom 20% actually went backwards: One area where we are seeing changes in wealth is home ownership. The figures highlight the growing number of people still paying off a mortgage and the decline of those who own their house outright: Thirty two per cent of households are now renters, compared with 27% at the turn of the century. And what we are seeing is that homeownership is declining for median to low-income households, while staying steady for the richest. In 2000-01, 73% of median income households either owned a home outright or were paying a mortgage\u2013 now it is just 65%: This remains the major issue for Australia\u2019s economy, given how much of our retirement system assumes home ownership. The survey reveals inequality remains a key problem across both income and wealth. And while income inequality gets most of the coverage, wealth inequality is where the biggest divergences are occurring. Right now politicians are getting away with stupid statements about what incomes constitute the top end of town. Let us hope we don\u2019t soon see equally dumb statements about $1m being median wealth. Because unless we are able to acknowledge reality \u2013 regardless of the political blowback \u2013 we will never be able to solve the problems of inequality that are only going to get worse due to the government\u2019s tax policy. You might have noticed some commentary around this report that \u201cwe are a nation of millionaires\u201d becase the average wealth of households is now over $1m. The graph of wealth I have shown above is the equivalised wealth \u2013 which like for equivalised income \u2013 treats all households as an individual and allows us to compare like for like. Using this measure, were a family of four to have $1m of wealth they would be in roughly the top 65%. The median wealth for a family of 4 is $731,000. The $1m average comes from the average of every household not accouting for size of those households. It is a rather pointless statistic as it is massively skewed by the wealthiest. Yes if you totalled up all our wealth and divided it by the number of housholds the average (or mean) would be $1.022m, but only 30% of all households in Australia have more than $1m in wealth. But if you had a room with seven people with wealth of $100,000 and 3 people with $4m each in wealth you would not say it was a room of millionaires even if the average was $1.27m The median household wealth is just $558,900. As many households have less than $223,500 in wealth as do have over $1m, but I suspect we won\u2019t see any headlines saying we are a nation of quarter millionaires. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "The ABC published not one but two lengthy public statements in defence of Monday\u2019s Four Corners program Cash Splash this week amid accusations of bias from lobby groups. ABC communications pumped out no fewer than 1,500 words of rebuttal to complaints from groups including Cotton Australia, National Irrigators\u2019 Council, NSW Farmers, NSW Irrigators and Webster\u2019s Chris Corrigan. \u201cIt is highly disappointing to watch the ABC once again wilfully disregard its own Charter requiring journalistic accuracy, balance and fairness, in order to satisfy its hunger for producing sensationalist television stories,\u201d Cotton Australia said. \u201cWe condemn the continued unbalanced reporting from the national broadcaster and call on them to do their job \u2013 report balanced, fair and factual pieces of journalism. This is a call we will not back down on.\u201d The Australian, which published an opinion piece by the National Farmers\u2019 Federation president, Fiona Simson, gleefully reported all the criticism. But the \u201cbacklash\u201d to the program actually began weeks before the story made it to air. Weekly Beast has seen emails which indicate the industry lobby was denouncing Four Corners well before it saw a single frame of the program, and was also instructing members how to complain about it. More than a month before Monday night\u2019s broadcast, the chief executive of the National Irrigators\u2019 Council, Steve Whan, wrote to the ABC news chiefs Sally Neighbour, Gaven Morris and John Lyons complaining that he\u2019d heard on the grapevine that the program wasn\u2019t going to be balanced. Then there was the NSW Irrigators\u2019 Council who wrote to parliamentarians to \u201cprovide some balance to the ABC Four Corners\u2019 Show last night\u201d \u2013 but sent the email days before the show was aired. \u201cFrom the start I would tell you that it was a biased and one sided agenda,\u201d the council said of a show it hadn\u2019t seen. \u201cAs elected representatives I know that at various times you have been subjected to unbalanced reporting yourselves and so I ask you to not draw conclusions from what was presented. \u201cI will try to be concise, but firstly I can tell you that we were not consulted nor interviewed, and more telling, neither were scores of small family business irrigation farmers that have benefitted from these programs.\u201d Again, before the program was seen, Cotton Australia handed out \u201ctips for being effective advocates\u201d including information to share on social media, hashtags like #ISupportAussieCotton and Facebook pages to comment on. Plate-throwing falls flat The Sky News presenter Rowan Dean and his cronies chose to celebrate the election of Kyriakos Mitsotakis\u2019 centre-right New Democracy party in Greece by dancing to Greek music and throwing plates. But Sky\u2019s production values are so low the attempt at humour fell flat. It was embarrassing television, as the plastic plates bounced in front of the desk and Dean struggled to catch his breath after a few seconds of dancing to introduce the show. Maybe hire a producer and lift your standards above bad community TV, guys. Church leader showers PM in love The Sydney Morning Herald published an opinion piece by a professor, Stephen Fogarty, on Thursday which argued that Scott Morrison\u2019s public acknowledgment of his faith should be welcomed. Fogarty said he sensed in the prime minister a \u201cpersonal humility and intense determination to lead the nation well\u201d in an article that could reasonably be described as a puff piece. \u201cAt the Hillsong conference he said that what the country really needed was the love of God, and the best advice he could give was to love each other, and reach out and love those around you,\u201d he wrote. The SMH said only that Fogarty was the president of Alphacrucis College, the significance of which was surely lost on most readers. As was pointed out on Twitter, the institution the good professor heads is the national training college of Australian Christian Churches, known as Assemblies of God in Australia \u2013 none other than Morrison\u2019s church. It would have been nice to have given readers that context. #MeToo backlash brigade on the attack The actor John Jarratt\u2019s acquittal on the charge of raping his housemate more than 40 years ago has sparked a backlash against the #MeToo movement in some sections of the media. The jury found the 66-year-old Wolf Creek star not guilty after he testified he was seduced into having consensual sex with the woman in 1976 at the Sydney house they shared with his wife, Rosa Miano. In the Australian the columnist Janet Albrechtsen argued that the Jarratt case proved the social media movement had spiralled out of control. \u201cAll along, Jarratt said it was consensual sex,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has been reported that the woman was contacted by journalist Tracey Spicer, who has led the #MeToo movement in Australia. \u201cIt was inevitable that this social media movement would spiral out of control. It is premised on one fatal flaw. We were told that women must be believed, a claim that heaves with bogus morality and defies reality.\u201d On Sunday Jarratt and Miano will appear on Nine\u2019s 60 Minutes, which promises to tell \u201cevery shocking detail\u201d and take you \u201cinside the rape trial\u201d that destroyed the actor\u2019s career. \u201cReading her statement presents like a dark sexual fantasy,\u201d Miano says of the woman who accused Jarratt of rape. The program\u2019s cameras followed Jarratt and his family both before the verdict and as they celebrated the court victory. Whelan steps up The ABC has appointed the former newspaper journalist and editor Judith Whelan to replace the veteran broadcasting manager Michael Mason, who announced his resignation more than nine months ago. Whelan, who has been acting in the role of director of local and regional, is a former editor of the Sydney Morning Herald who joined the broadcaster three years ago as head of spoken content, which included Radio National and local radio. Her new responsibilities include eight capital city radio stations, 48 rural and regional teams, regional and local screen content including Gardening Australia, Backroads and Landline, Grandstand sport, live events such as New Year\u2019s Eve, Australia Day and Anzac Day, and emergency broadcasting. Mason\u2019s was just one of the roles at the top of Aunty to be left vacant in the vacuum that followed the dramatic departures of Michelle Guthrie and Justin Milne. Two key positions remain unfilled: director of entertainment and specialist, which was David Anderson\u2019s role before he was appointed managing director, and chief financial officer. Mastermind studio pays up We are pleased to report that the Mastermind writer who was significantly out of pocket \u2013 after BBC Studios in Australia terminated the services of a company which recruited writers for the SBS show \u2013 has now been paid in full. Despite BBC Studios insisting last week it was not responsible for the outstanding fees, after Weekly Beast highlighted the problem the production studio coughed up. ABC to screen Attenborough doco In happier news for the BBC in Australia, the rights to David Attenborough\u2019s landmark documentary Climate Change: The Facts have been secured by the ABC and will be broadcast next month. It\u2019s been described as TV\u2019s most comprehensive guide to the climate emergency yet, and given that Attenborough just this week highlighted Australia as an \u201cextraordinary\u201d example of a country where people in power remained climate change deniers, we can imagine it may have quite an impact locally.",

      "bodyText": "US immigration officials have said immigration raids targeting thousands of families will take place in major cities across the United States starting on Sunday \u2013 less than a month after delaying a similar operation. Such a move could see parents separated from US citizen children, more detained families and has already sparked a legal challenge. Department of Homeland Security officials from the Trump administration, speaking anonymously, told newspapers that details of the raids had not been finalized, but would probably begin on Sunday in at least 10 major cities. The raids would target at least 2,000 immigrants who have been ordered deported and crossed the border recently, though other undocumented people could also be arrested if the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency intercepts them, according to the New York Times. The operation was first announced by Donald Trump on Twitter last month \u2013 prompting immigrant advocates to increase education for migrants on their rights, including that they don\u2019t have to open their door to Ice agents without a court warrant. Among the myriad concerns raised by advocates is that some people ordered deported may never have received notices to appear in court. Trump often accuses migrants of deliberately ignoring notices, but in the past year, attorneys have complained that documents were sent to incorrect addresses or listed incorrect hearing dates and times, including midnight, when court is not in session, and 31 November, which doesn\u2019t exist. The US government could therefore arrest migrants who didn\u2019t know they were due in court, which would allow the arrested to reopen their cases, if they found an attorney. Matthew Bourke, an Ice spokesman, told the Guardian the agency could not provide specific details related to enforcement operations, to protect the safety and security of agents. \u201cAll of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and \u2013 if found removable by final order \u2013 removal from the United States,\u201d Bourke said. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a pre-emptive lawsuit on Thursday arguing that targeted families should be allowed a day in court, in part because of the immigration enforcement agencies\u2019 documented bureaucratic errors. The New York ACLU and ACLU of Southern California filed the 44-page lawsuit on behalf of four not-for-profits. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s threats against immigrants run roughshod over basic fairness and due process,\u201d Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. \u201cFor the many families who came here as refugees fleeing violence, deportation is a death threat.\u201d Activists on Thursday ramped up efforts to prepare by bolstering know-your-rights pocket guides, circulating information about hotlines and planning public demonstrations. Vigils outside of detention centers and hundreds of other locations nationwide were set for Friday evening, to be followed by protests Saturday in Miami and Chicago. Phil Murphy, the governor of New Jersey, said in a statement his government was reaching out to immigrant communities, highlighting legal aid and other resources. Hillary Clinton criticized the plan on Thursday, when news of the raids emerged alongside reports that the president may try to force the US census process to include a question asking people if they are citizens. Trump\u2019s own immigration agencies were reportedly blindsided by the president\u2019s stunning decision in late June to tweet about a law enforcement operation before it occurred. Five days later, he announced the raids would be delayed. The Trump administration\u2019s aggressive anti-immigration policies have not yet resulted in the level of deportations seen under Barack Obama. In the last fiscal year, Ice removed 250,000 undocumented migrants, compared with 410,000 removed in 2012. Trump, however, has done away with deportation priorities Obama put in place in his second term, and used anti-migrant rhetoric, which has created fear and instability in migrant communities.

But the hours-long occupation of the tax office and immigration buildings last month proved to be unpopular with citizens. \u201cOnly when the messages are everywhere would people know we are still here,\u201d said a young man who had helped create a Lennon wall on a footbridge in downtown Causeway Bay. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of expressing ourselves under an authoritarian regime.\u201d The wave of protests which started on 9 June forced the government to suspend the bill and Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, said this week that the legislation was effectively \u201cdead\u201d. But the protesters were not reassured by her personal promise, which they said was no guarantee that the bill would not be revived later. They continue to demand that the government fully withdraws the bill, releases all those arrested in protests and launches an independent investigation into police use of teargas, rubber bullets and truncheons on largely peaceful crowds. The emergence of Lennon walls across the city came a week after the storming and vandalising of the parliament building on 1 July, also the anniversary of Hong Kong\u2019s 1997 return to Chinese rule. The government has strongly condemned the protesters\u2019 actions. Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker, said the Lennon walls, which she viewed as installation art, were \u201cthe best outlets for our young to vent the anger and resentment in a peaceful manner\u201d and were \u201ceffective reminders of the governance crisis\u201d. But even this mild form of protest has attracted the ire of government supporters and stirred unease among the authorities. Local media reported that on Wednesday morning more than 200 police officers, some armed with shields, descended on a Lennon wall in Tai Po, where some messages supposedly exposed some police officers\u2019 personal details. Around the same time a man punched two people guarding a Lennon wall in a pedestrian walkway in Kowloon Bay , and later that night hundreds staged a noisy rally outside the Yau Tong underground station in Kowloon late after several students guarding a local Lennon wall were assaulted by unknown attackers. At one point during the impromptu rally people swiftly passed round sticky labels, wrote on them and stuck them on to nearby pillars.",

      "bodyText": "Animals including koalas and kangaroos could be culled in parts of South Australia, where high population numbers are damaging the landscape. A report from a parliamentary inquiry has recommended the state\u2019s environment minister make an immediate decision to declare koalas, western grey kangaroos, long-nosed fur seals and little corellas overabundant in some areas. Culling is an option that could be suggested, although the report acknowledges there is reluctance to communicate publicly the need for culling because \u201csome community stakeholders find the concept of culling an abhorrent approach in managing overabundant species\u201d. The inquiry, by the parliament\u2019s natural resources committee, investigated the impact and management of certain overabundant and pest animals and the effectiveness of current measures to keep numbers under control. If the recommendation is adopted to declare population numbers of certain species too high, it would trigger ministerial powers to order control options. In relation to koalas, the committee took evidence from Kangaroo Island\u2019s natural resource management board urging culling of populations on the island. \u201cThe board is concerned that the koala population will continue to increase to a point where irreparable habitat damage occurs,\u201d the report said. The committee heard that sterilisation of the Kangaroo Island koala population had had little success. \u201cPopulation numbers on the Island continue to rise and their impacts are threatening its biodiversity,\u201d the report says. Little corellas were identified through the inquiry as a species requiring statewide management because the species \u201chas become so prolific that isolated management actions are ineffective\u201d. In the case of long-nosed fur seals, the committee heard that the species was affecting the Coorong fishery. But the report says culling is only one of several options that could be considered and there were numerous tools that would not involve culling such as habitat modification and acoustic repellent devices. In the committee\u2019s report, the presiding member, Josh Teague, said overabundant species were causing an \u201cimminent threat\u201d to wildlife and habitats. \u201cThe overabundance of several species was caused by changes to the landscape, including by the clearing of native vegetation,\u201d he said. \u201cFurther, the committee heard that unless we act to manage the problem by culling abundant animals, there will not be a lot of other biodiversity in the state.\u201d with Australian Associated Press",

      "bodyText": "Maanvi Singh and Lois Beckett, here -- with an updated summary to close out our political news day. In a Rose Garden press conference, Trump announced he was abandoning plans to add a citizenship question to the US census. A dozen former Trump administration officials or supporters of the president have been subpoenaed by the Democrat-led House judiciary committee, including Trump\u2019s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner. The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a preliminary lawsuit in anticipation of immigration raids this weekend. At a \u201csocial media summit\u201d, Trump claimed social media platforms were guilty of bias against conservatives. The Washington Post is reporting that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will attempt to finalize a deal to raise the debt ceiling within the coming weeks, rather than waiting until September, as many lawmakers had expected. Here\u2019s more from The Post: Pelosi, the California Democrat, told reporters she wants to raise the debt ceiling as part of a deal that would set spending levels for the next two years. Many lawmakers on Capitol Hill had expected a vote on a spending and debt package wouldn\u2019t occur until September, but Pelosi indicated for the first time Thursday they needed to act more swiftly... White House officials want to avoid another chaotic shutdown if Congress doesn\u2019t approve a funding bill by the end of September, and many agencies had been caught unprepared during the 35-day shutdown that began in December 2018. The White House has been trying to broker a budget deal with lawmakers for more than a month, but the Trump administration and lawmakers remain far apart on how much money they want to authorize for the federal budget. Also announcing new policies today was Democratic primary contender Pete Buttigieg, who rolled out his \u201cDouglass Plan\u201d today on NPR\u2019s Morning Edition program. Here are the details, from NPR: His \u201cDouglass Plan\u201d aims to establish a $10 billion fund for black entrepreneurs over five years, invest $25 billion in historically black colleges, legalize marijuana, expunge past drug convictions, reduce the prison population by half and pass a new Voting Rights Act to further empower the federal government to ensure voting access. His campaign says it is equal in scale to the Marshall Plan, which used the equivalent of approximately $100 billion at current value to rebuild Europe after World War II. Buttigieg says the program would be enacted alongside potential direct reparations for slavery, not in place of it. Turning back to the Democratic primary race... Kamala Harris announced her goal of ending the nationwide rape kit backlog. If elected president, she vows to dedicate a total of $100 million in annual federal assistance to states that agree to improve their testing procedures. Here\u2019s a full report on Trump\u2019s press conference on the citizenship question, and his executive order from The Guardian\u2019s Sabrina Siddiqui and Tom McCarthy. Here\u2019s another view from the Rose Garden. Katie Rogers of The New York Times has this video taken at the Rose Garden, featuring former Whitehouse advisor Sebastian Gorka. Ari Berman, of Mother Jones, explains that though there will be no citizenship question, Trump\u2019s press conference still included \u201cdisturbing points.\u201d David Shepardson of Reuters has shared a statement from the justice department, confirming that it will remove the citizenship question from the census questionnaire. New York Civil Liberties Union executive director Donna Lieberman said, of Trump\u2019s executive order on the census: \u201cAfter losing in the highest court in the land last month, President Trump\u2019s executive order is nothing more than flailing in defeat. The president has finally given up the ghost of a citizenship question on the 2020 census, meaning all New Yorkers can participate and be counted without the distraction of his increasingly empty threats. With our partners, the NYCLU will continue to fight \u2013 and win \u2013 in court against any attempt to implement his cruel anti-immigrant agenda.\u201d NPR\u2019s census correspondent Hansi Lo Wang points out that Trump\u2019s executive order may be redundant. Journalists are fact-checking attorney general\u2019s claim that Trump never hoped or planned to defy the supreme court\u2019s ruling against printing a citizenship question on the census. https://twitter.com/jonathanvswan/status/1149439150283771904 As the Trump administration backs away from a legal battle over voting rights and the 2020 census, evacuations have been ordered in New Orleans as the city anticipates a possible hurricane. The Guardian\u2019s Jamiles Lartey reports from New Orleans that Tropical Storm Barry could have winds of about 75mph (120km/h) and bring could have winds of about 75mph (120km/h) of rain. Read more: Trump\u2019s announcement that he would use his executive authority to direct federal agencies to share existing data about the number of citizens and non-citizens in the United States, rather than trying to add a citizenship question to the census, was greeted as a victory by voting rights activists. Some conservatives, including members of Trump\u2019s own administration, saw the news as a defeat, Axios\u2019 Jonathan Swan reported. President Trump backed away from an attempt to force a question about US citizenship onto the US census, announcing in a press conference that he was instead directing federal agencies to share government records in order to assemble an estimate of the number of citizens and non-citizens living in the United States. The announcement comes weeks after the supreme court blocked the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to add a question about citizenship to the United States\u2019 once-a-decade count of all residents, a move that civil rights groups and the Census Bureau\u2019s own research suggested would lead to an undercount of immigrants of color. Civil rights advocates greeted Trump\u2019s announcement of the alternate data collection effort as a victory. \u201cIt\u2019s over. We won,\u201d Dale Ho, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Voting Rights Project, wrote on Twitter. Both Trump and Attorney General William Barr called the decision a logistical one, saying that there was simply not enough time to resolve the lawsuits over adding a citizenship question to the census itself. Trump had previously pledged to use his executive power to find a new way to ask the citizenship question, raising concerns that he might try to defy or work around the supreme court\u2019s ruling. Speaking after the president, the attorney general insisted that concerns that the President would defy the court and print the citizenship question by \u201cexecutive fiat\u201d were nothing but \u201crank speculation.\u201d In a ruling last month, the supreme court upheld a lower court decision against Trump, saying that the commerce department\u2019s stated rationale for adding the citizenship question \u2013 to protect voting rights \u2013 \u201cseems to have been contrived\u201d and was a \u201cdistraction\u201d. Citing the US Census Bureau\u2019s own research, plaintiffs in the case had argued that the unprecedented inclusion of such a question was likely to lead to a significant undercount in the American population. Such an undercount, which would mostly affect minority immigrant communities, could benefit Republicans at the ballot box, according to political research unearthed during the case. This is Lois Beckett and Maanvi Singh, taking over live politics coverage from our West Coast bureau. President Trump is expected to hold a press conference momentarily on his plan for getting around a Supreme Court ruling blocking his administration from asking about US citizenship on the once-a-decade census count of all Americans. Multiple media outlets have reported that he\u2019s planning to announce an alternate route for collecting citizenship data that does not involve the 2020 census. Civil rights advocates have argued that adding a citizenship question would likely result in an undercount of immigrants of color, which could benefit Republicans electorally. If so, Dale Ho, the director of the ACLU\u2019s voting rights project argued earlier today, that will mean a \u201ctotal defeat\u201d for the Trump administration on this issue. \u201cAn \u2018action\u2019 is likely little more than a press release,\u201d Michael Waldman, the head of the progressive Brennan Center, wrote earlier today. The latest update on the day\u2019s events from Jessica Glenza, signing off coverage in New York. A dozen former Trump administration officials or supporters have been subpoenaed by the Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee, including his advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner. The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a preliminary lawsuit in anticipation of immigration raids this weekend. It remains unclear what Trump may announce at the White House Rose Garden press conference called to address the citizenship question on the decennial US Census, although Trump said he had a solution that would be, \u201creally good.\u201d At a \u201csocial media summit,\u201d where no representatives of social media companies were present, Trump derided the media and claimed social media platforms were guilty of conservative bias. He also said he would invite social media executives to the White House. Before the White House livestream of Trump\u2019s \u201csocial media summit\u201d ended, he had just announced intentions to invite representatives of the \u201cbig social media platforms,\u201d to the White House. He also said his administration would use \u201call regulatory and legislative solutions\u201d to protect \u201cfree speech,\u201d and provide \u201cmore freedom\u201d. I am not speaking for our side, I don\u2019t even know if you\u2019re on our side,\u201d said Trump. He continued, \u201cBig tech must not censor the voices of the American people.\u201d Trump said the media is in \u201ca collusion\u201d with social media companies. He has also used the summit to continue to allege social media platforms are biased against conservatives and \u201cour party\u201d. He also acknowledged how some members of the invited audience may have violated terms of service with their content. When social media banned some people, he said, \u201cIn all fairness some of you I can understand... Some of you are out there.\u201d Trump also said he might invite some of the same audience members to meetings with representatives of tech platforms. You\u2019re very special people, you\u2019re very brilliant people in many cases... This new technology is so powerful and so important and is has to be used fairly,\u201d said Trump. The livestream for the \u201csocial media summit\u201d abruptly ended as Trump was about to take questions. Trump had just taken the first question. Trump has just teased his upcoming press conference in the Rose Garden about a citizenship question on the US Census: \u201cWe have a solution that will be really good for a lot of people.\u201d There have been conflicting reports about what Trump will announce at the Rose Garden. President Trump\u2019s so-called social media summit is happening now, and you can watch a livestream here. No representatives of the actual platforms being discussed \u2013 namely Facebook, Twitter and Google \u2013 are at the summit. Instead, Trump invited \u201cfriends\u201d and social media supporters, described by one of our reporters as an event to, \u201cas a platform for rightwing conspiracy theorists, bigots and the professionally aggrieved.\u201d Trump used the planned speech to berate the media and brag about his own social media prowess. \u201cCan you imagine if we were covered fairly?\u201d said Trump, claiming his poll numbers were at an all-time high. The American Civil Liberties Union and other immigration legal aid groups have filed a preemptive lawsuit in federal court in New York, anticipating immigration raids over the weekend. The Trump administration said raids would start on Sunday (they have announced, and then postponed, these raids in the past). The ACLU aims to protect refugee families from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and others, who fled violence. Here is more from a statement: The Trump Administration\u2019s plan to arrest and deport thousands of Central American families and children without giving them a fair day in court is both illegal and immoral,\u201d said Ahilan Arulanantham, senior counsel at the ACLU Southern California. \u201cMore than one hundred years ago, the Supreme Court decided that immigrants could not be deported without due process. These vulnerable refugees deserve that basic protection.\u201d The Associated Press has developed an estimate of the cost of President Trump\u2019s Independence Day \u201cextravaganza\u201d: $5.4m. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt provided the latest share of costs, $2.45 million for his agency, in a letter to lawmakers, saying his agency pulled money from operating funds for national parks, recreation fees, and another source to help fund Trump\u2019s Salute to America. .... In addition, the Department of Defense says its costs came to $1.2 million. Despite repeated requests, the Pentagon as of Thursday refused to provide a precise breakdown. The military\u2019s efforts included positioning tanks on flat-bed trailers around the capital, meeting Trump\u2019s desire for tanks while minimizing damage to district roads from the heavy armor. ... The District of Columbia estimates it spent about $1.7 million not including police expenses for related demonstrations. The Associated Press also notes that President Trump\u2019s inauguration, despite being the most expensive in history, did not reimburse Washington DC for $7.3m in expenses. Here is more from Elizabeth Warren\u2019s new plan to fix the American immigration system, which she released on Medium earlier today. We need expanded legal immigration that will grow our economy, reunite families, and meet our labor market demands. We need real reform that provides cost-effective security at our borders, addresses the root causes of migration, and provides a path to status and citizenship so that our neighbors don\u2019t have to live in fear. That\u2019s why today I\u2019m announcing my plan for immigration reform \u2014 to create a rules-based system that is fair, humane, and that reflects our values. She goes on to lay out detailed policies on establishing new immigration courts, reducing immigration detection, and reforming Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Under Warren\u2019s plan, ICE would become an agency devoted to, \u201cscreening cargo, identifying counterfeit goods, and preventing smuggling and trafficking.\u201d ABC News just reported President Trump \u201cis backing down\u201d from his fight over the citizenship question on the US Census. This appears to conflict with earlier reports that he would try to issue an executive order supporting a citizenship question. From ABC News: The expected announcement will bring to a close weeks of escalating confusion within the government over his demands that the controversial question be included despite a Supreme Court order that had blocked the move. The White House declined to comment about what exactly the president plans to announce. Including a citizenship question on the US Census is a vital political issue, because the decennial count of Americans determines the number of Congressional representatives allotted to each state. For close watchers of the White House, this build up is nothing new. Just today we had a new account of how Trump likes to use confusion and social media to build \u201csuspense\u201d of upcoming announcements, a lot like reality television. The most recent example was published in a Washington Post excerpt of Tim Alberta\u2019s forthcoming book American Carnage. From the Washington Post\u2019s story: Alberta reports that Trump berated [former House Speaker Paul] Ryan over a 2018 spending bill because it didn\u2019t include funding for his border wall but then said he would sign it if Ryan were to give him time to build suspense on Twitter. Ryan agreed and then publicly sang the president\u2019s praises after the meeting.\u201d Trump has previewed his speech already today on Twitter. He said he would make an announcement in the White House Rose Garden at 5pm ET. The so-called domestic gag rule mirrors the \u201cMexico City policy,\u201d sometimes called the \u201cglobal gag rule\u201d. The Mexico City policy was first introduced by President Ronald Reagan in 1984, and barred clinics which received US international aide from referring women to abortion services. In every presidential term since, Democratic presidents have rolled back the policy and Republicans have reinstated it. However, the Title X funding at issue in the Ninth Circuit today differs because it goes to domestic clinics. This represents a significant tightening of abortion access, and will be viewed as a victory by the conservative Christians who the Trump-Pence administration has courted. A federal court has refused to block the Trump administration\u2019s domestic gag rule, which bars federally funded health clinics from referring women to abortion services. The ruling is yet another blow to abortion services providers, who have been threatened across the United States this year. From our earlier reporting on the \u201cgag rule\u201d: Under the rule, clinics that receive federal family planning funding are prohibited from operating in facilities that also provide abortions, imposing what it described as \u201cfinancial and physical\u201d separation. Though US law prohibits the use of federal family planning funds to pay for abortions, conservative anti-abortion activists argue that groups that provide the procedure are supported indirectly. Planned Parenthood, which provides a range of reproductive health services including abortions, said the new rule amounts to a \u201cgag rule\u201d because it forces doctors to withhold medical information from patients. \u201cNo country, even one as powerful as ours, can go it alone,\u201d in the 21st century, Biden said at his foreign policy speech at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. Former Vice President Joe Biden is speaking now about his \u201cplan for leading the Democratic world\u201d. Here is a livestream of the speech. We are coming in at the tail end, and Biden is now speaking about use of force, and ending \u201cforever wars\u201d. \u201cWe should bring home the vast majority of our combat troops,\u201d and \u201cnarrowly focus\u201d on terror groups, he said. Biden also said America should end support for Saudi-led war in Yemen. Biden says he would \u201creinvest\u201d in diplomacy, which the Trump administration \u201chollowed out.\u201d In response to the subpoenas, Trump tweeted Democrats should \u201cgo back to work.\u201d Here are all 12 people subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee: White House advisor and the president\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner Former White House chief of staff John Kelley Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions Former deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein Former Trump campaign manager and political commentator Corey Lewandowski Former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rick A Dearborn Former White House National Security Advisor Michael Flynn Chief of staff for former Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jody Hunt Former White House aide accused of domestic violence Rob Porter Beverly Hills attorney Keith M Davidson, who helped negotiate payments from President Trump to adult film star Stormy Daniels Chief content officer for the National Enquirer\u2019s parent company Dylan Howard The CEO of the National Enquirer\u2019s parent company David Pecker The Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee Democrats has just subpoenaed a dozen more witnesses involved in the Mueller investigation and Trump\u2019s immigration policies. Among the high-profile names on the list are his son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. The subpoenas are part of an investigation in discussions of potential presidential pardons and the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, which separated children from their families at the Mexico-US. Ahead of a speech on foreign policy, Former Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has released a video condemning President Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d diplomacy. Biden is expected to give a speech today at the Graduate Center of City University of New York, where he plans to say he will convene world leaders to, \u201crefocus on our common purpose, to strengthen our common resilience and to work more effectively together,\u201d the Wall Street Journal reports. Critics say Trump\u2019s diplomacy has focused on courting authoritarians to the detriment of established allies. The most recent example of comes today, as Trump\u2019s administration announced it will examine a new French tax on tech giants. Progressive Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren looks to be rolling out another of the policy plans she\u2019s become known for, this one on immigration. More from the Associated Press: Elizabeth Warren is rolling out a far-reaching immigration agenda that envisions a significant leftward shift in U.S. policy. Warren\u2019s plan includes the remodeling of immigration enforcement agencies \u201cfrom top to bottom\u201d and new limits on the detention of migrants who enter the country. The new platform was released Thursday ahead of Warren\u2019s appearance alongside four Democratic presidential rivals at a forum hosted by the League of United Latin American Citizens. It comes as President Donald Trump\u2019s detention policies continue to spark fierce Democratic pushback and stoke public debate. Warren would also dent the Trump administration\u2019s detention practices by creating \u201ca Justice Department task force to investigate accusations of serious violations\u201d in facilities that house migrants, giving that effort \u201cindependent authority to pursue any substantiated criminal allegations.\u201d Here is Pelosi\u2019s response to an article on her relationship with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Here is a livestream of Pelosi\u2019s weekly news conference, in the event reader\u2019s would like to listen along. She is now responding to a Washington Post story this morning, which reported members of \u201cthe squad\u201d, a group of four progressive House members, are feeling put out by Pelosi. \u201cWhat I said in the caucus yesterday got an overwhelming response form my members,\u201d said Pelosi. She continued: We respect the value of every member of our caucus.... Diversity is our strength.\u201d We\u2019re now watching House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s weekly news conference. Let\u2019s return briefly to the guest list of the social media summit. Among the invitees are some of the right\u2019s \u201cloudest voices \u2013 and worst trolls,\u201d writes our reporter Julia Carrie Wong. The summit was announced in June amid persistent claims from President Trump that social media platforms are biased against conservatives. Social media companies deny this, as many people banned from platforms have violated terms of service. In light of the summit, the Guardian US made a wish list of guests for a social media summit, including the photographer of \u201cNapalm girl,\u201d whose iconic image of the Vietnam War was deleted from Facebook because it featured a naked child; survivors of mass shootings harassed online; and contemporary artists who have struggled to depict the nude human body while also attempting to draw visitors to galleries and museums. Also, a reminder the Trump administration is trying to put political appointees in charge of approving US Environmental Protection Agency documents for release. The White House has just clarified the press will be invited to cover the social media summit. In Mississippi, a Republican candidate for governor denied a female reporter\u2019s request for a ride along unless she brought a male colleague. Now, Mississippi Today reporter Larrison Campbell responds to Republican Representative Robert Foster in real-time in an interview with CNN. \u201cFirst of all, like you said it\u2019s your truck, it\u2019s your rules \u2013 why is it my responsibility to make you feel comfortable?\u201d Campbell asked. Then she followed on, and says he is effectively arguing, \u201cA woman is a sexual object first and a reporter second.\u201d Foster defends himself by saying he made \u201ca vow\u201d to his wife never to be in a room alone with a person of the opposite sex. On the left, the Washington Post is noting this morning how \u201cthe squad\u201d of four progressive women in the Democratic caucus feel left out in the cold by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful woman in politics. Fractures within the Democratic party have left Pelosi trying to defend their House majority and protect the reelection prospects of more moderate members, Pelosi\u2019s defenders said. The four representatives, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley, are \u201cconvinced it is Pelosi who is being the bully,\u201d according to the Post. Here is more from the story: Now, half a year later, virtually all communication between the two women [Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez] has ceased. The two have not spoken one-on-one since February when Ocasio-Cortez declined Pelosi\u2019s personal request that she join her select committee on climate change, according to individuals who know both lawmakers. Trump has been very active on Twitter this morning. In the same tweet, he previewed the White House social media summit and possible executive action on the US census. Here is a digest of what else he said: He (again) called himself a \u201cStable Genius\u201d and praised himself as \u201cgreat looking\u201d. He said he would \u201cultimately leave office in six years, \u201cor maybe 10 or 14,\u201d and added he was \u201cjust kidding\u201d. He also said the \u201cfake news media\u201d will likely \u201cgo out of business\u201d during this long tenure, because the industry lacks credibility. He criticized a Minnesota town for scrapping the Pledge of Allegiance before meetings. There is no requirement Minnesota towns say the Pledge before a meeting, and several others already do not. Here\u2019s a short list. Trump\u2019s social media summit this afternoon is not open to the press, but we have some ideas based on who is bragging online. Here\u2019s more from our story: The White House has released few details about Thursday\u2019s event, but the meeting is the latest move from the Trump administration in response to its claims of bias against conservative voices on social media platforms. In May, the White House launched a tool to allow users to report if they felt they had been censored on websites such as Facebook and Twitter. But the Trump administration did not include any representatives from major social media firms \u2013 including Facebook, Twitter, or Google \u2013 to the event Thursday, instead inviting a mix of inflammatory internet personalities including rightwing Project Veritas founder James O\u2019Keefe, pro-Trump activist Bill Mitchell, college Republican activist Charlie Kirk, and Ben Garrison, a rightwing cartoonist who agreed not to attend amid widespread criticism from one of his virulently antisemitic cartoons. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian US politics liveblog. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re expecting this morning: Executive action on the US Census: After a loss in court, President Trump is expected to announce executive action on the US census. His administration attempted to add a question about citizenship. The census is a key political battle because the government\u2019s official count of Americans determines how many representatives each state receives. White House social media summit: Rightwing social media figures have been invited to the White House for what appears to be a venting session with the President. Nationwide immigration raids: The government could begin immigration raids on Sunday, a strong arm tactic against immigrants that the administration delayed earlier this summer.",
