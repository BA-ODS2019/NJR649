Literary director of the Booker prize foundation Gaby Wood revealed that they had also called in young adult novels, and \u201cbooks that are sometimes dismissed as \u2018commercial\u2019\u201d in their search for the year\u2019s best fiction. The longlist, she said, \u201cshows the incredible range of what\u2019s being written today\u201d. \u201cThere are familiar names here writing at the height of their powers, there are young writers of exceptional imagination and daring, there is wit, incisive political thought, stillness and thrill. And there is a plurality that shows the making of literature in English to be a global endeavour.\u201d The prize is supported for the first time this year by Michael Moritz and Harriet Heyman\u2019s charitable foundation Crankstart, rather than the Man Group. The shortlist will be announced on 3 September and the winner revealed at a ceremony in London on 14 October.",

      "bodyText": "Urgent intervention is needed at Feltham young offender institution, the chief inspector of prisons has warned, after a review uncovered rocketing levels of violence and self-harm. Peter Clarke said the inspection of Feltham A, the west London unit for boys aged 15 to 18, had identified an \u201cextraordinary\u201d decline in safety and care for inmates. As a result he has invoked the rarely-used urgent notification process, which requires the justice secretary, David Gauke, to respond publicly within 28 days with action to improve conditions. In a letter to Gauke, published on Wednesday, among the problems Clarke highlighted were: 40% of teenagers said they had felt unsafe at some point during their stay. The number of violent incidents had risen by 45% since January, despite the number of inmates falling. The number of assaults against staff had risen by around 150% since January. The level of self-harm had tripled since the previous inspection and was 14 times higher than in January 2017. 74% of teenagers reported they had been physically restrained by staff, with more than 700 incidents in the last six months. Clarke wrote to Gauke that there had been a collapse of \u201cany reasonable regime\u201d which \u201chas prevented many children from getting to education or training, delayed their access to healthcare, isolated them from meaningful human interaction and frustrated them to the point where violence and self-harm have become the means to express themselves or gain attention\u201d. He said the problems stemmed from over-reliance on \u201ckeep apart\u201d policies, designed to prevent clashes, particularly between children from rival gangs. Feltham has long been notorious for high levels of violence but an inspection last year found the situation had improved. However, an inspection in January this year found safety and care to have deteriorated once again and as a result the unusual step was taken of scheduling an additional review for July. It was the latter review that led to the urgent notification being issued. Feltham A is on the same site as Feltham B, which holds young adults aged 18 to 21. The urgent notification was issued solely with respect to Feltham A, which holds up to 180 teenagers. In April, after an outbreak of violence that resulted in more a dozen prison officers being treated in hospital, campaigners called for the institution to be closed.",

A terminally ill patient was granted a permit in recent weeks but hasn\u2019t used it yet, according to the ABC. Under the laws the patient can access a medically approved, lethal dose of drugs and end their life at a time of their choosing. In comments to the Guardian, the Victorian Department of Health said it couldn\u2019t confirm any details about patients accessing the assisted dying laws or their doctors. \u201cThe Victorian model for the voluntary assisted dying system is working,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe know that doctors are talking to patients about voluntary assisted dying and are carrying out assessments. \u201cIt is giving people at the end of their life a genuine and compassionate choice over the manner and timing of their death.\u201d The laws were passed by the Andrews government in 2017 and came into effect in June. Patients must be over 18 and there are strict conditions, including that terminally ill patients have fewer than six months to live, or 12 months in the case of neurodegenerative illness such as motor neurone disease. Patients must give their informed consent and make three requests via their GP and specialist doctors. Once a permit is granted, the drugs are dispensed by pharmacists at the Alfred hospital. The scheme has received criticism it is difficult to access, and some patients have had trouble finding doctors with the necessary training to conduct voluntary assisted dying assessments. \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

Turnout was 87.4% among 159,320 party members. In a characteristically lighthearted acceptance speech, Johnson conceded that even some of his own supporters may \u201cwonder quite what they have done\u201d. He claimed the Tory party had historically demonstrated it could \u201cmanage the jostling instincts in the human heart\u201d \u2013 such as those of owning a home and helping the poorest in society. \u201cToday, at this pivotal moment in our history, we again have to reconcile two noble sets of instincts \u2013 between the deep desire for friendship and free trade and mutual support and security and defence between Britain and our European partners; and the simultaneous desire, equally heartfelt, for democratic self-government in this country.\u201d So why has the clown of the Tory party been crowned leader \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/23/boris-johnson-clown-crowned-country-london-dude\">and has Britain arrived in Hell</a>? asks Hannah Jane Parkinson. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/jul/23/brexit-under-boris-johnson-the-scenarios\">How will his leadership play out</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/23/trump-boris-johnson-britain-trump-uk-prime-minister\">is Johnson really the UKs Trump equivalent?</a></p> <p><strong>Two teenagers who were previously feared missing<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/23/canada-teens-missing-suspects-double-murder\"> have been named as suspects</a></strong> in the double murder of Australian Lucas Fowler, 23, and US citizen Chynna Deese, 24, who were shot dead on a remote highway in northern Canada. Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18 were initially considered missing persons after their burning truck was discovered on Friday near the the town of Dease Lake in British Columbia, 500km south on the same road. But the two men have since been spotted in northern Saskatchewan. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police now consider the two teenagers to be suspects in the murders of Fowler and Deese \u2013 as well as that of a second unidentified man whose body was found several miles away from McLeod and Schmegelsky\u2019s burning truck.</p> <p><strong>A confidential plagiarism investigation found a report co-written by Liberal senator James Paterson breached research integrity standards, </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/24/plagarism-complaint-liberal-senator-james-paterson-breached-integrity-standards-ipa-report\">the Guardian can reveal</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/24/plagarism-complaint-liberal-senator-james-paterson-breached-integrity-standards-ipa-report\">.</a> In 2015 Paterson helped write a paper critical of high pay rates, \u201cgenerous\u201d perks and union influence in the public service. Paterson, then deputy executive director of the Institute of Public Affairs, wrote the report with Aaron Lane, a lawyer and then PhD candidate at RMIT University. In small parts the paper is almost word-for-word the same as an internal document prepared by the Australian Public Service Commission and supplied to the IPA eight months earlier.

The children had either entered the US alone or been separated from the adults who accompanied them across the border, and they had all been transferred from other facilities.</p> <p>The total number of children had been expected to grow to 1,300 over the coming weeks, all housed in what the government terms a \u201ctemporary emergency influx facility\u201d, which was expected to be kept open into 2020.</p> <p>But the closure was abruptly confirmed on Tuesday, as <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/qv77j7/exclusive-dhs-is-shutting-down-the-model-facility-for-migrant-kids-it-showed-off-to-journalists?utm_source=vicenewstwitter\">first reported</a> by Vice.</p> <p>The US Department of Health and Human Services opened the facility just a month ago.</p> <p>In response to a request for comment, the office of communications for the Health Department\u2019s Administration for Children and Families (ACF) agency said: \u201cWe have no update on Carrizo Springs at this time.\u201d</p> <p>Carrizo Springs opened at the site of a former oil field camp and was supposed to help HHS take in children who were otherwise detained by the US border patrol in sometimes squalid conditions.</p> <p>But the facility opened just as border crossings have fallen, after crackdowns by the US and Mexico on migrants traveling through Mexico and applying for asylum in the US. HHS has also sped up its processing of legal cases, in order to release children from detention faster, so they can join sponsoring families in the US while their cases proceed through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration\">immigration</a> system.</p> <p>News of the closure was welcomed on Tuesday by Amnesty International USA, which believes the border crisis has been \u201cmanufactured\u201d by the Trump administration and that detention facilities should be shut down and only utilized as the last resort.</p> <p>\u201cThe closure of the Carrizo Springs facility makes clear the crisis is of the government\u2019s own making. These temporary emergency facilities arose because of the government\u2019s deliberate policy to punish children, resulting in the prolonged and indefinite detention of thousands of children,\u201d said Denise Bell, researcher for refugee and migrant rights with the organization.</p> <p>She added: \u201cTemporary emergency shelters are never a home for children, and Carrizo and other detention facilities like it only demonstrate that these disastrous policies only endanger children and are never, ever in the best interests of the child.\u201d</p> <p>She said children should be with their families and the government\u2019s policies of taking children seeking safety into custody were \u201cunnecessarily cruel and shameful\u201d.</p> <p>The organization\u2019s executive director, Margaret Huang, is <a href=\"https://appropriations.house.gov/events/hearings/oversight-of-the-unaccompanied-children-program-ensuring-the-safety-of-children-in\">testifying today</a> on Capitol Hill about Carrizo Springs and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/06/immigration-migrant-children-homestead-florida\">child detention center at Homestead</a>, Florida, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/11/immigration-migrant-children-tornillo-camp-closing\">now</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/11/immigration-migrant-children-tornillo-camp-closing\"> closed</a> camp<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/02/texas-detention-camp-swells-fivefold-with-migrant-children\"> at Tornillo</a>, near El Paso, which was also run by BCFS.</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed reporting</em></p>",

It is less than two weeks since the Guardian was given a lengthy tour of the center, with the government keen to demonstrate its safe, clean facilities. This was in contrast to appalling conditions for babies, children and adults being detained in border patrol stations after crossing the US-Mexico border unlawfully, which shocked visiting experts so much they went public. At the time of that visit, just under 200 teens between 13 and 17 were held at the new Carrizo Springs secure facility, most having arrived from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. The children had either entered the US alone or been separated from the adults who accompanied them across the border, and they had all been transferred from other facilities. The total number of children had been expected to grow to 1,300 over the coming weeks, all housed in what the government terms a \u201ctemporary emergency influx facility\u201d, which was expected to be kept open into 2020. But the closure was abruptly confirmed on Tuesday, as first reported by Vice. The US Department of Health and Human Services opened the facility just a month ago. In response to a request for comment, the office of communications for the Health Department\u2019s Administration for Children and Families (ACF) agency said: \u201cWe have no update on Carrizo Springs at this time.\u201d Carrizo Springs opened at the site of a former oil field camp and was supposed to help HHS take in children who were otherwise detained by the US border patrol in sometimes squalid conditions. But the facility opened just as border crossings have fallen, after crackdowns by the US and Mexico on migrants traveling through Mexico and applying for asylum in the US. HHS has also sped up its processing of legal cases, in order to release children from detention faster, so they can join sponsoring families in the US while their cases proceed through the immigration system. News of the closure was welcomed on Tuesday by Amnesty International USA, which believes the border crisis has been \u201cmanufactured\u201d by the Trump administration and that detention facilities should be shut down and only utilized as the last resort. \u201cThe closure of the Carrizo Springs facility makes clear the crisis is of the government\u2019s own making. These temporary emergency facilities arose because of the government\u2019s deliberate policy to punish children, resulting in the prolonged and indefinite detention of thousands of children,\u201d said Denise Bell, researcher for refugee and migrant rights with the organization. She added: \u201cTemporary emergency shelters are never a home for children, and Carrizo and other detention facilities like it only demonstrate that these disastrous policies only endanger children and are never, ever in the best interests of the child.\u201d She said children should be with their families and the government\u2019s policies of taking children seeking safety into custody were \u201cunnecessarily cruel and shameful\u201d. The organization\u2019s executive director, Margaret Huang, is testifying today on Capitol Hill about Carrizo Springs and the child detention center at Homestead, Florida, and the now closed camp at Tornillo, near El Paso, which was also run by BCFS.

Thank you. </p> \n   <p>And I want to thank all of you. All of you here today and obviously I want [to thank] everybody in the Conservative party for your hard work, for your campaigning, for your public spirit and obviously for the extraordinary honour and privilege you have just conferred on me. </p> \n   <p>And I know that there will be people around the place who will question the wisdom of your decision. </p> \n   <p>And there may even be some people here who still wonder quite what they have done. </p> \n   <p>I would just point out to you of course nobody, no one party, no one person has a monopoly of wisdom. But if you look at the history of the last 200 years of this party\u2019s existence you will see that it is we Conservatives who have had the best insights, I think, into human nature. </p> \n   <p>And the best insights into how to manage the jostling sets of instincts in the human heart. And time and again it is to us that the people of this country have turned to get that balance right. </p> \n   <p>Between the instincts to own your own house, your own home, to earn and spend your own money, to look after your own family. Good instincts, proper instincts, noble instincts. </p> \n   <p>And the equally noble instinct to share. And to give everyone a fair chance in life. And to look after the poorest and the neediest and to build a great society. </p> \n   <p>And on the whole in the last 200 years it is we Conservatives who have understood best how to encourage those instincts, to work together in harmony to promote the good of the whole country. </p> \n   <p>And today at this pivotal moment in our history we again have to reconcile two sets of instincts, two noble sets of instincts. </p> \n   <p>Between the deep desire of friendship and free trade and mutual support in security and defence between Britain and our European partners. </p> \n   <p>And the simultaneous desire, equally deep and heartfelt, for democratic self-government in this country. </p> \n   <p>And of course, there are some people who say that they\u2019re irreconcilable and it just can\u2019t be done. </p> \n   <p>And indeed I read in my Financial Times this morning, devoted reader that I am - seriously, it is a great, great, great British brand. </p> \n   <p>I read in my Financial Times this morning that there is no incoming leader, no incoming leader has ever faced such a set of daunting circumstances, it said. </p> \n   <p>Well, I look at you this morning and I ask myself, do you look daunted?

It was also rather thin for someone who has spent the last four weeks certain almost beyond doubt that they would become the next prime minister. But Johnson will be giving a speech in Downing Street tomorrow, which will receive more attention, he is expected to make a statement to MPs on Thursday, and he is scheduled to give a major speech at the end of this week. Now was not really the time for a major statement of intent. </p> \n  <p>Still, in an extract buried in the middle of the speech, there were two clues as to where he intends to go. Here is key passage.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If you look at the history of the last 200 years of this party\u2019s existence, you will see that it is we Conservatives who have had the best insights, I think, into human nature, and the best insights into how to manage the jostling sets of instincts in the human heart. </p> \n   <p>And time again it is to us that the people of this country have turned to get that balance right, between the instincts to own your own home, to earn and spend your own money, to look after your own family \u2013 good instincts, proper instincts, noble instincts \u2013 and the equally noble instinct to share and to give everyone a fair chance in life. And to look out to the poorest and the neediest, and to build a great society. </p> \n   <p>And on the whole, in the last 200 years, it is we Conservatives who have understood best how to encourage those instincts to work together in harmony, to promote the good of the whole country. </p> \n   <p>And today, at this pivotal moment in our history, we again have to reconcile two sets of instincts, two noble sets of instincts, between the deep desire for friendship and free trade and mutual support in security and defence between Britain and our European partners, and the simultaneous desire \u2013 equally deep and heartfelt \u2013 for democratic self-government in this country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>What does this mean? Here are two thoughts.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson stressed his desire for a partnership with the EU, not confrontation, in his first public comments as prime minister-elect.</strong> He could have gone for a reprise of his \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/brexit-boris-johnson-britain-will-leave-eu-31-october-do-or-die\">Brexit by 31 October, do or die</a>\u201d campaign message, but instead he stressed the importance of having a close and friendly relationship with the EU. That final sentence could have come from a David Cameron speech. This does not necessarily tell you much \u2013 the Tory Brexiters think they have Johnson hostage, and so his room for manoeuvre may be limited \u2013 but it is interesting nonetheless.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson adopted the language of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/18/one-nation-conservatives-launch-declaration-values\">one nation Conservatism</a>, stressing the importance of caring for the \u201cpoorest and the neediest\u201d. </strong>Johnson\u2019s supporters claim that, on all issues other than Brexit, he is at heart a mainstream, one nation Conservative. That is hard to square with his enthusiasm for Brexit and Donald Trump, but it was a common assessment of Johnson when he was London mayor. The real question, perhaps, is whether one nation Conservatism is compatible with hardline Brexitism (which takes you towards Nigel Farage-style nativism), but it is worth noting that Johnson still wants to use this language.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80ad628dcace540122fb6c95bb16d55852ee62fd\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80ad628dcace540122fb6c95bb16d55852ee62fd/0_55_4837_2903/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson giving his victory speech.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson giving his victory speech.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-23T11:52:50.043Z\">at 12.52pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d36dc0e8f0845f89e3128bd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-23T11:21:46.826Z\">12.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">How Boris Johnson's majority compares with other party leaders'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Boris Johnson received 66% of the vote, on an 87% turnout.</p> \n  <p>In percentage terms, that is better than Jeremy Corbyn achieved in the last Labour leadership election, in 2016, when he got 62% of the vote on a 78% turnout (although the electorate in that contest was much larger).

Here\u2019s an excerpt.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Almost ironically, without comparing the UK itself with the USSR because it is not comparable, I can\u2019t think of a better golden standard than the USSR in terms of fact distortion, reality falsification and blunt oblivions of reality.</p> \n   <p>Then there were the heroes of the perestroika era swearing that they would create a market economy in post-Soviet Russia within 500 days! \u2018500 Day Programme\u2019 is history. Like the other the most unrealistic promises at the time, this never became a reality. People paid for these empty and broken promises with impoverishment, inequality and much more. The programme also left one infamous quote: \u2018Boris, ti ne prav\u2019 (\u2018Boris, you are wrong\u2019)!</p> \n   <p>It is a different Boris, of course, but there was something in the way of doing politics that was similar: many unrealistic promises, ignoring economic rationales and rational decisions. These decisions led to a new autocratic constitution and finally paved the way to Vladimir Putin. Today in Russia we have oligarchs, a pseudo-market economy, a regulated, governed pseudo-democracy. And, Putin\u2019s authoritarianism. For Boris Yeltsin, the warning came true: \u201cBoris, you are wrong\u201d. Hopefully, it will not be the case for Boris Johnson if he is elected today.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d36e21a8f08d0b6ca536032\" class=\"block\"

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us for this evening. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s developments: Boris Johnson will be the UK\u2019s next prime minister after being elected to lead the Conservative party by its membership. Johnson beat his rival, Jeremy Hunt, by 92,153 votes to 46,656. In his victory speech, Johnson stressed his desire for a partnership with the EU. On the campaign trail, he had vowed to leave the bloc \u2013 \u201cdo or die\u201d \u2013 on 31 October. He also attempted to set out a more mainstream, one nation conservative vision for the party. Senior political figures congratulated Johnson on his victory but he was also warned that difficulties lay ahead in his dealings with the EU. The outgoing prime minister, Theresa May, vowed to back him from the back benches but, while EU leaders were careful to be welcoming in their tone, they made clear their longstanding rejection of his Brexit plans remained. The US president, Donald Trump, also congratulated Johnson and claimed the latter\u2019s popularity was linked to his own. Johnson\u2019s domestic rivals were explicit in their disapproval. Labour asked: \u201cHow did our country sink so low?\u201d, though its leader would not say when he would table a motion of no confidence. Jo Swinson, the new Liberal Democrat leader, said Johnson was unfit to be prime minister. The SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Scottish people would be concerned by his election and Plaid Cymru called it a \u201cgift\u201d to the Welsh independence movement. The incoming prime minister was hit by another ministerial resignation. Anne Milton stepped down as skills minister, saying she had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about his Brexit stance. But he was given a rapturous welcome by backbench Tory MPs when he addressed them later on Tuesday afternoon. Conservative MPs put on a show for reporters outside the meeting of the 1922 Committee, banging on desks and walls to acclaim their new leader. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Heather Stewart and Jessica Elgot have the full story: Speaking to the LBC radio station, Andrea Leadsom has made it clear she\u2019s angling for a Treasury position, citing her long career experience as evidence of her suitability. There have, of course, been serious questions about the exact nature of that experience. A former ambassador to Denmark and Foreign and Commonwealth Office official is being tipped to be named as Boris Johnson\u2019s new Brexit negotiator, replacing Olly Robbins. David Frost is a career diplomat who was head of Europe at the Foreign Office and served as a special adviser to Boris Johnson during the incoming prime minister\u2019s time there. He is currently the chief executive of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry and has years of experience working with the EU. Those who know him say he supports Brexit, ticking a key box for the incoming prime minister. \u201cHe believes there is a deal to be done and will pursue that,\u201d one source has said. However, there are also concerns that, if his appointment is confirmed, the key \u201csherpa\u201d role is going to someone who is not a full-time member of the civil service. One source has said: David is good, he knows Europe inside out. But Johnson will need someone at a senior level in the civil service who will be in charge of the day to day work. There has also been speculation Johnson will appoint a Brexiter MP to oversee negotiations in order to satisfy the Eurosceptic MPs who criticised the secrecy of May\u2019s negotiations and the \u201ctunnel\u201d in which Robbins, her Brexit negotiator operated in the latter stages. The Campaign Against Antisemitism is giving Corbyn\u2019s antisemitism plans short shrift. Its chief executive, Gideon Falter, has said: Years too late, Jeremy Corbyn has finally agreed that those who hate Jews should be expelled from the Labour party quickly. What has been lacking all of this time is willpower, not procedures. When the Labour party wants to expel a member, they already have the procedures they need: we have seen lightning-fast action, even against senior party figures, such as Alastair Campbell and Hilary Armstrong, just not for antisemitism. We have no confidence whatsoever in these proposed procedures since it has been so clearly proven that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s allies and staff have systematically perverted the course of disciplinary processes in order to protect antisemites. Previous rule changes similar to this proved entirely cosmetic because the Labour party is institutionally antisemitic and its internal disciplinary process has been corrupted. Sinn F\u00e9in will work to protect the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, including the commitment to calling a referendum on Irish Unity, the party\u2019s deputy leader Michelle O\u2019Neill has said. The British government has responsibilities and commitments under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement and we will hold them to account. We will continue to stand up for Irish interests, for the majority of citizens in the North who voted on a cross-community basis to remain within the EU. We will continue to work with the Dublin government and the EU27 to protect Ireland from the catastrophic impact of the reckless Brexit being pursued by Boris Johnson and the hard Brexiteers. Labour\u2019s ruling body has accepted Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s plans for dealing with antisemitism complaints. The national executive committee (NEC) agreed to endorse the proposal to allow fast-track expulsions in the most serious cases, a party spokesman has said. It is understood the agreement came after the withdrawal of a motion calling for a fully independent process for dealing with such cases \u2013 an idea backed by the Labour MP Ruth Smeeth among others. There had been criticism of Corbyn\u2019s plan because of the proposed involvement of the party\u2019s general secretary, Jennie Formby, who has been accused of interfering in antisemitism complaints. The spokesman said the proposal would be further developed to enable the NEC to finalise a \u201cfair and legally robust\u201d rule change that could be put to the party\u2019s annual conference in September. The vast majority of Labour members are motivated by equality, justice and fairness, and despise antisemitism. The party is taking decisive and robust action against antisemitism and the rate at which antisemitism cases are dealt with has increased more than four-fold since Jennie Formby became general secretary. Under the proposed changes, the most serious allegations will be referred to a special panel, including Formby and NEC officers. The Financial Times has reported this evening that Johnson has hired the Sky executive, Andrew Griffith, to be his chief business adviser in Downing Street. This comes after Griffith loaned Johnson his \u00a39.5m Westminster townhouse from which to run his campaign. Reacting to the news, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, Jon Trickett, has said: Before he is even appointed prime minister, one of Boris Johnson\u2019s first acts is to dish out a powerful job in No 10 to his super-rich pal who lent him his luxurious house in Westminster for the Tory leadership campaign. The public would be forgiven for coming to the conclusion that Johnson\u2019s friends can buy influence within the new administration. It\u2019s blindingly obvious \u2013 Boris Johnson and his government will act only in the interest of the wealthy elite. The Democratic Unionist party MP, Sammy Wilson, has claimed the \u201cproblem along the [Irish] border is an illusionary one\u201d, despite both UK government and EU officials having made clear they believe it to be very real indeed. Asked how he felt Boris Johnson would sort the Irish border issue and whether people were needlessly worried, Wilson said: I think that the Irish border is sorted anyhow, because the problem along the border is an illusionary one ... I think they are worried for no reason. If you look at the Irish border at present, we have to collect taxes across the Irish border every day. And we do that unobtrusively. We have to ensure animal welfare standards are met and animals have to be checked. We do that away from the border. Wilson said illegal trade was stopped by intelligence-led checks and stopping vehicles along country roads. The mechanism for dealing with all of the things that need to be dealt with unobtrusively is already there. Here is some more international reaction to Boris Johnson\u2019s election. From the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau From the former Danish PM Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen From the Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. This is from the BBC\u2019s Steve Rosenberg, on how Russian TV is covering this story. Following her muted congratulations statement earlier, the Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has told BBC Scotland that she will judge Boris Johnson on his actions in office, pointing out that he was not her first choice and that she did not vote for him. She added that he would have to \u201cmake a pretty good fist of it pretty early\u201d because of the challenges he faces. During the interview in Newcastle this afternoon, Davidson reportedly missed a call from Johnson, which she returned. As my colleague Joan E Greve writes on US Politics Live, my Washington equivalent, in his speech to Turning Point USA President Trump also said that Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, who was in the audience, would work well with Boris Johnson. This is from the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Vivian Salama. This is not what Boris Johnson has been saying in the campaign, where he has ruled out electoral pacts with Farage, or giving him a role in the Brexit talks. The Telegraph\u2019s Ben Riley-Smith has the full quote from Donald Trump. This is from CBS\u2019s Mark Knoller. President Trump has got this half right. Boris Johnson is often compared to Trump. But that is because they both have blond hair and say lots of things that are untrue. Outside Tory/Brexit/Telegraph circles, the comparison is not generally viewed as a compliment. This is from Newt Gingrich, the US Republican who was Speaker of the House of Representatives in the late 1990s. Gingrich specialised in hardline, adversarial tactics (his refusal to pass budgets led to several government shutdowns) and he is seen as someone who in some respects paved the way for the politics of Donald Trump. This is probably not the endorsement Boris Johnson wants if he is keen to be seen as a one nation Tory. On a good day to slip out written ministerial statements: the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has revealed that the cost of the troubled Crossrail programme has risen again. Works on track and stations on the overground section to the west of London, carried out by Network Rail, have run another \u00a3210m over budget since an update in 2018, bringing the total cost to date to more than \u00a317.8bn. Grayling said the cost would be met from internal Network Rail budgets \u2013 although it remains in effect taxpayers\u2019 money as it is a state-owned body. News of the confirmed cost overruns in Network Rail\u2019s relatively small portion of Crossrail work \u2013 now more than 20% over its own allotted \u00a32.3bn Crossrail budget \u2013 will fuel fears aired by the public accounts committee that the delayed rail line could end up costing substantially more yet. Network Rail said the additional time taken to deliver the project was to blame. In an interview with the BBC, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said that he expected Boris Johnson to make a statement to MPs on Thursday, the final day before the summer recess starts. Corbyn also refused to say when Labour would table a vote of no confidence in Johnson\u2019s government. Asked about this, Corbyn just said Labour would go for a no confidence vote when it was \u201cappropriate to do so\u201d. This is from Ulrike Demmer, deputy spokeswoman from the German government. It says: Chancellor #Merkel on the selection of Boris #Johnson: I congratulate Boris Johnson and am looking forward to good cooperation. Our countries should also be close friends in future. Boris Johnson has now finished speaking to Tory MPs at the 1922 Committee. Here are more tweets about what he said. From my colleague Jessica Elgot From the Evening Standard\u2019s Kate Proctor From the Daily Mail\u2019s John Stevens From Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti From Politico\u2019s Emilio Casalicchio HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh has a better version of the Keith Simpson quote. More on Boris Johnson at the 1922 Committee. Boris Johnson arrived at the 1922 Committee with Sajid Javid, the home secretary, at his side, increasing speculating that Javid could be appointed chancellor tomorrow. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart. But there is also a lot of talk about Liz Truss getting the Treasury. This is from the Evening Standard\u2019s Joe Murphy. It is worth pointing out that the Tory Brexiters are also very happy with the appointment of Mark Spencer as the new chief whip. (See 4.10pm.) This is from the New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire. It quotes Steve Baker, the deputy chairman of the European Research Group, which represents Tories pushing for a harder Brexit. The \u201cSpartans\u201d is the nickname given to the ERG hardliners who refused to give in and vote for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. And this is from Stewart Jackson, who was David Davis\u2019s chief of staff when Davis was Brexit secretary. This is from Jean-Claude Juncker, the outgoing president of the European commission. Boris Johnson is now addressing the 1922 Committee. These are from Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti, HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh and my colleague Jessica Elgot. Mark Spencer will be Boris Johnson\u2019s chief whip. Spencer is not exactly well known to the Westminster press corps - there has been a lot of Googling going on this afternoon - but his appointment has been welcomed by MPs from the mainstream of the party. From Sir Nicholas Soames From George Freeman From Caroline Nokes This is from Nick Boles, who was a centrist Tory until he left the party to sit as an independent. And here is some comment on the appointment from journalists. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the Times\u2019 Francis Elliott From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn YouGov has released some more polling on Boris Johnson, the results of a snap survey conducted in the last few hours. Almost half of voters are either dismayed or disappointed by his election as next PM, the survey suggests. And here is Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, congratulating Boris Johnson on his election. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s long-serving prime minister, has congratulated Boris Johnson. Boris Johnson is shortly to address Tory MPs at the 1922 Committee. This is from Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti. From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has praised Theresa May for not trying to obstruct the workings of the EU, in words that seem aimed at Boris Johnson, the Express\u2019s Joe Barnes reports. The incoming European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has congratulated Boris Johnson on his election as Tory leader and next PM. \u201cWe have the duty to deliver something which is good for the people of Europe and the United Kingdom,\u201d she told reporters during a visit to France. Scottish Conservatives remain anxious about Boris Johnson\u2019s impact on support for independence, but rather more optimistic after a campaign that gave prominence to the union. After a meeting between Johnson and most of the Scottish Tory MPs at Westminster last week, there is a belief that he is willing to listen to those who know more about the nuances of politics north of the border, and well aware of the importance of this baker\u2019s dozen to parliamentary arithmetic. But Scottish Tory MSPs \u2013 the majority of whom supported Hunt \u2013 believe they will struggle to sell Johnson on the doorstep, given that Ruth Davidson\u2019s electoral success has been based on a modern, anti-elitist version of Conservatism which many (especially the SNP) will argue that Johnson does not represent. Read the full story here. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has released this statement about a conversation she had with Boris Johnson after his election as Tory leader and next PM. Foster implies Johnson is planning an early visit to Northern Ireland. She says: I have spoken with Boris Johnson and congratulated him on becoming leader of the Conservative party. We discussed our shared objectives of strengthening every part of the union, ensuring the 2016 referendum result is implemented and seeing devolution restored in Northern Ireland. The confidence and supply agreement between the Conservative party and the Democratic Unionist party remains. That agreement included a review between each parliamentary session. This will take place over the coming weeks and will explore the policy priorities of both parties for the next parliamentary session. I also look forward to welcoming Mr Johnson back to Northern Ireland shortly after becomes prime minister. And, on the subject of Hormuz, this is from Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif. This is from Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the German Bundestag. This is from Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (prime minister). From my colleague Jessica Elgot YouGov has published some polling showing what people think about having Boris Johnson as prime minister. It suggests he is significantly less popular than Theresa May was when she became prime minister. The polling also suggests that half of voters think Johnson will be poor or terrible as PM, and only one person in five thinks he will be great or good. But YouGov\u2019s Chris Curtis, in his write-up, also suggests these popularity figures may not matter too much. Here\u2019s an extract. Firstly, while his own numbers aren\u2019t good, his opponents\u2019 are generally worse. The 31% who have a favourable view of Johnson is higher than the 27% who have a favourable view of Nigel Farage, the 9% who have a favourable view of Jo Swinson (because most people still haven\u2019t heard of her) and the 18% who have a favourable view of Jeremy Corbyn. In a head-to-head fight against the leader of the opposition over who would make the best prime minister, Boris leads Jeremy Corbyn by 34% to 20% (although they are both behind \u201cnot sure\u201d on 42%). Secondly, whilst Boris\u2019s overall numbers aren\u2019t particularly positive, he does well among the key voters he needs to bring back into the Conservative fold. They key challenge to the Conservative party is to win back the third of their voters that they have lost to the Brexit party over the past few months. And among these voters Boris is incredibly popular, with 71% of those who say they would currently vote for Nigel Farage\u2019s insurgent party saying they have a favourable view of him. In fact, he has about the same levels of popularity amongst Brexit party voters than amongst current Conservatives. Finally, these numbers still have time to change before a general election takes place, and a lot depends on how he handles Brexit over the coming months. This is from Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, on Boris Johnson. I wish Boris Johnson well as prime minister with his \u2018do or die\u2019 pledge to deliver Brexit on October 31. It is \u2018do or die\u2019 not just for Brexit, but for the future of the Conservative party too. Does he have the courage to deliver for the country? Moody\u2019s, the credit rating agency, has issued a report today saying it thinks Boris Johnson\u2019s ascent to become prime minister has made a no-deal Brexit more likely. Here is an extract from its news release. Mr Johnson, who will replace Theresa May as prime minister this week, was a figurehead of the Vote Leave campaign in 2016 and has said he wants the UK to leave the EU by the deadline of 31 October 2019, regardless of whether the EU agrees to a revised deal. \u201cWith the election of Mr Johnson, the likelihood of a sustainable compromise appears lower than before,\u201d said Colin Ellis, Moody\u2019s managing director for credit strategy. \u201cOur view remains that a no-deal Brexit would have significantly negative credit effects for the UK sovereign and related issuers. \u201cSince the outcome of the Brexit referendum, Moody\u2019s central expectation has been that the UK and the EU would reach a withdrawal agreement that preserves many of the features of current trading arrangements, particularly for goods. Although this would be credit-negative compared with staying in the EU, it would be significantly less damaging than a no-deal Brexit. \u201cAlthough a no-deal scenario is now more likely, there is still no majority support in parliament for such an outcome.\u201d Labour has sent an email to supporters about Boris Johnson. Here\u2019s an excerpt. Today, Boris Johnson became leader of the Conservatives. Tomorrow, he\u2019ll be prime minister. How did our country sink so low? Whether you think he\u2019s a scruffy Etonian buffoon or a cold, calculating liar, what\u2019s clear is his terrifying support of a damaging no-deal Brexit and his stunningly out-of-touch policy of tax cuts for the wealthy. We have to stop him. It starts with revealing the real Boris Johnson: out of touch elitist. Untrustworthy. Incompetent. And this is what the party is saying on Twitter. Jeremy Corbyn has issued this statement about Boris Johnson\u2019s election as Tory leader and next PM. After almost a decade of austerity, we need a prime minister on the side of the many, not the few. Boris Johnson has won the support of fewer than 100,000 unrepresentative Conservative party members by promising tax cuts for the richest, presenting himself as the bankers\u2019 best friend, and pushing for a damaging no-deal Brexit. But he hasn\u2019t won the support of our country. Johnson\u2019s no deal would mean job cuts, higher prices in the shops, and risk our NHS being sold off to US corporations in a sweetheart deal with Donald Trump. The people of our country should decide who becomes prime minister. We need a Labour government for the many, not a Boris Johnson Conservative government for the few. Labour is holding a rally in Parliament Square on Thursday demanding a general election. This is from Andrew Fisher, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policy adviser. Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, always said he could not serve in cabinet under Boris Johnson because of Johnson\u2019s support for a no-deal Brexit. He has posted a tweet to confirm he will resign tomorrow. Here is my colleague Jessica Elgot\u2019s take on Boris Johnson\u2019s victory speech. Ivanka Trump\u2019s original tweet congratulated Boris Johnson on becoming prime minister of the United Kingston. My colleague Patrick Wintour is disappointed. UPDATE: Here is the original. This is from Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the president of Turkey. And this is how Google translates Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Turkish. I congratulate @BorisJohnson, the UK\u2019s 77th prime minister, and wish him success in his new role. I believe this develop further the Turkey-United Kingdom relations in the new era. Erdo\u011fan seems willing to forget Johnson\u2019s limerick about him having sex with a goat. By describing Johnson as the 77th prime minister, Erdo\u011fan is using the counting system on the Downing Street website. But this is the figure for the number of times someone has been appointed PM from Sir Robert Walpole onwards, and counts some of them twice, or more than twice. A better figure would be to say Johnson will be the 55th person to serve as prime minister. This is from Philip Hammond, who is going to resign as chancellor tomorrow because he does not want to serve under Boris Johnson. Hammond is in favour of a Brexit deal, but is strongly opposed to leaving the EU without one \u2013 a prospect Johnson is willing to contemplate. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg Theresa May says she will give Boris Johnson her \u201cfull support\u201d from the backbenches. From Ivanka Trump, the US president\u2019s daughter This is from Arlene Foster, the DUP leader. Boris Johnson will be the fifth prime minister since the second world war to have been educated at Eton College, the Press Association reports. The other four to attend the independent, fee-paying boarding school were David Cameron (prime minister from 2010-16), Alec Douglas-Home (1963-64), Harold Macmillan (1957-63) and Anthony Eden (1955-57). Like Boris Johnson, all of them were Conservative prime ministers. It means one-third of the UK\u2019s 15 prime ministers since 1945 are Old Etonians \u2013 the name given to former pupils of the college, PA reports. Three other postwar PMs attended independent schools: Clement Attlee (Haileybury), Winston Churchill (Harrow) and Tony Blair (Fettes). The rest, including the outgoing prime minister, Theresa May, attended grammar schools. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, found Boris Johnson\u2019s victory speech (see 12.48pm and 1.28pm) \u201cembarrassingly underwhelming\u201d. From Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader A source close to Boris Johnson said cabinet appointments would not be made until Wednesday evening, the Press Association reports. He is expected to spend this afternoon finalising the top ministerial team and preparing his speech for Wednesday. Johnson will also address the 1922 Committee of Conservative MPs at 4pm today and visit CCHQ. This is from Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru\u2019s leader at Westminster. The Conservative party has just thrown the UK out of the frying pan and into the fire. During the most serious political crisis in decades, a clown is set to become prime minister. But this is no joke. People will soon realise, this isn\u2019t as good as it gets. By electing Boris Johnson, the Conservative party has given the Welsh independence movement a gift. With the election of Mr Johnson, the question of Welsh independence is not of \u2018if\u2019, but \u2018when\u2019. Here is the full text of Boris Johnson\u2019s victory speech. I want to begin by thanking my opponent, Jeremy, by common consent an absolutely formidable campaigner and a great leader and a great politician. Jeremy, in the course of 20 hustings, more, 20 hustings or hustings-style events, it was more than 3,000 miles by the way, it was about 7,000 miles that we did criss-crossing the country, you\u2019ve been friendly, you\u2019ve been good natured, you\u2019ve been a font of excellent ideas, all of which I intend to steal forthwith. And above all I want to thank our outgoing leader, Theresa May for her extraordinary service to this party and to this country. It was a privilege. It was a privilege to serve in her Cabinet and to see the passion and determination that she brought to the many causes that are her legacy - from equal pay for men and women, to tackling the problems of mental health and racial discrimination in the criminal justice system. Thank you, Theresa. Thank you. And I want to thank all of you. All of you here today and obviously I want [to thank] everybody in the Conservative party for your hard work, for your campaigning, for your public spirit and obviously for the extraordinary honour and privilege you have just conferred on me. And I know that there will be people around the place who will question the wisdom of your decision. And there may even be some people here who still wonder quite what they have done. I would just point out to you of course nobody, no one party, no one person has a monopoly of wisdom. But if you look at the history of the last 200 years of this party\u2019s existence you will see that it is we Conservatives who have had the best insights, I think, into human nature. And the best insights into how to manage the jostling sets of instincts in the human heart. And time and again it is to us that the people of this country have turned to get that balance right. Between the instincts to own your own house, your own home, to earn and spend your own money, to look after your own family. Good instincts, proper instincts, noble instincts. And the equally noble instinct to share. And to give everyone a fair chance in life. And to look after the poorest and the neediest and to build a great society. And on the whole in the last 200 years it is we Conservatives who have understood best how to encourage those instincts, to work together in harmony to promote the good of the whole country. And today at this pivotal moment in our history we again have to reconcile two sets of instincts, two noble sets of instincts. Between the deep desire of friendship and free trade and mutual support in security and defence between Britain and our European partners. And the simultaneous desire, equally deep and heartfelt, for democratic self-government in this country. And of course, there are some people who say that they\u2019re irreconcilable and it just can\u2019t be done. And indeed I read in my Financial Times this morning, devoted reader that I am - seriously, it is a great, great, great British brand. I read in my Financial Times this morning that there is no incoming leader, no incoming leader has ever faced such a set of daunting circumstances, it said. Well, I look at you this morning and I ask myself, do you look daunted? Do you feel daunted? I don\u2019t think you look remotely daunted to me. And I think that we know we can do it and that the people of this country are trusting in us to do it and we know that we will do it. And we know the mantra of the campaign that has just gone by, in case you have forgotten it and you probably have, it is deliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn - and that is what we are going to do. We are all going to defeat Jeremy Corbyn. I know that some wag has already pointed out that deliver, unite and defeat was not the perfect acronym for an election campaign, since unfortunately it spells dud - but they forgot the final \u2018e\u2019 my friends, \u2018e\u2019 for energise. And I say to all the doubters, dude, we are going to energise the country. We are going to get Brexit done on October 31. We are going to take advantage of all the opportunities that it will bring in a new spirit of can-do. And we are once again going to believe in ourselves and what we can achieve. And like some slumbering giant, we are going to rise and ping off the guy ropes of self-doubt and negativity, with better education, better infrastructure, more police, fantastic full-fibre broadband sprouting in every household - we are going to unite this amazing country and we are going to take it forward. I thank you all very much for the incredible honour that you have just done me. I will work flat out from now on with my team that I will build, I hope in the next few days, to repay your confidence, but in the meantime the campaign is over and the work begins. Thank you all very much. Jo Swinson, the new Lib Dem leader, says Boris Johnson is not fit to be PM. And here is Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, on Boris Johnson\u2019s election. Unfortunately Barnier will find that ratifying the withdrawal agreement is not high on Johnson\u2019s list of priorities. Johnson says the withdrawal agreement as it currently exists, with the backstop, is unacceptable. The European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group will hold a meeting tomorrow with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, to discuss the implications of Boris Johnson\u2019s election, Guy Verhofstadt, the parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman, says. Tobias Ellwood, the defence minister who has been very critical of the idea of accepting a no-deal Brexit as an acceptable outcome, is not planning to resign, and has urged colleagues to support Boris Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s a duty of every MP to support the prime minister right now,\u201d he told the Press Association. Boris Johnson has tweeted this message following his election as Tory leader. And Jeremy Hunt has sent this message to the man who beat him. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, says she has \u201cprofound concerns\u201d about Boris Johnson\u2019s election, and demands that he take the threat of a no-deal Brexit off the table immediately. I congratulate Boris Johnson on his election as Tory leader and I will do everything possible to ensure that he respects Scotland\u2019s views and interests. However, I have profound concerns about the prospect of his premiership and it would be hypocritical not to be frank about these. These are concerns that I am certain will be shared by the vast majority of people in Scotland who, had they been given any say, would not have chosen to hand the keys of No 10 to someone with his views and track record. Brexit of any kind would be deeply damaging to Scotland and the rest of the UK, but his public pledge to leave the EU by 31 October \u2013 \u2018come what may\u2019 and \u2018do or die\u2019 \u2013 flies in the face of logic, common sense or any basic regard for the wellbeing of the people and nations of the UK. It is a deeply irresponsible threat, and not one that should be contemplated by any serious political leader. It should now be taken off the table without delay or equivocation. Sturgeon pledged that her Scottish government would be \u201cat the forefront of all and any moves to stop Brexit and block a no-deal Brexit, as will SNP MPs in the House of Commons\u201d, adding that these efforts were supported across the political spectrum. Theresa May has chaired her last cabinet, and from the sound of things it was a very much an end-of-term affair, focused on praising her record and then handing over parting gifts. The meeting discussed funding for the NHS and how to tackle May\u2019s much-mentioned \u201cburning injustices\u201d, such as access to mental health treatment, her spokesman said, and generally agreed that she had done a great job on housebuilding, employment and the economy. \u201cThe PM thanked the cabinet for all they had done during her premiership, which she said had done much to improve people\u2019s lives,\u201d her spokesman said. She also thanked No 10 advisers and the civil service. Then May\u2019s de facto deputy, David Lidington, thanked her \u201cfor her great dedicated to public service, and her commitment to the union\u201d, the spokesman said. Finally, it was over to Michael Gove, the environment secretary, who handed over presents paid for by a cabinet whip-round \u2013 a black Liberty handbag and a crystal necklace by the French company Lalique. May\u2019s spokesman was pressed on precisely what bag it was, and gamely spent some time looking at the Liberty website on his phone to see if he could recognise it, but that detail will have to come later. Outside the Queen Elizabeth II centre in Westminster, about 100 pro-Brexit and pro-EU protesters were gathered alongside members of the press waiting for the future prime minister to emerge from the building. Some campaigners shouted: \u201cBollocks to Brexit\u201d and \u201cYou can shove your Brexit up Farage\u201d while waving EU flags. Others were holding: \u201cWe voted leave\u201d placards over the temporary barriers outside the centre. Ruth Bradshaw, 76, who lives in London, was among the pro-EU demonstrators disappointed by the news of Boris Johnson\u2019s victory. \u201cI\u2019m here to stop Brexit,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very displeased by the news Boris will be the next PM, but I have to say I\u2019m not shocked. I think of the two remaining candidates, the one with more common sense was Mr Hunt \u2013 who was prepared to extend the deadline after Halloween.\u201d President Trump has congratulated Boris Johnson. Boris Johnson\u2019s speech was very short, and probably a disappointment to anyone expecting some trademark Johnson jokes. It was also rather thin for someone who has spent the last four weeks certain almost beyond doubt that they would become the next prime minister. But Johnson will be giving a speech in Downing Street tomorrow, which will receive more attention, he is expected to make a statement to MPs on Thursday, and he is scheduled to give a major speech at the end of this week. Now was not really the time for a major statement of intent. Still, in an extract buried in the middle of the speech, there were two clues as to where he intends to go. Here is key passage. If you look at the history of the last 200 years of this party\u2019s existence, you will see that it is we Conservatives who have had the best insights, I think, into human nature, and the best insights into how to manage the jostling sets of instincts in the human heart. And time again it is to us that the people of this country have turned to get that balance right, between the instincts to own your own home, to earn and spend your own money, to look after your own family \u2013 good instincts, proper instincts, noble instincts \u2013 and the equally noble instinct to share and to give everyone a fair chance in life. And to look out to the poorest and the neediest, and to build a great society. And on the whole, in the last 200 years, it is we Conservatives who have understood best how to encourage those instincts to work together in harmony, to promote the good of the whole country. And today, at this pivotal moment in our history, we again have to reconcile two sets of instincts, two noble sets of instincts, between the deep desire for friendship and free trade and mutual support in security and defence between Britain and our European partners, and the simultaneous desire \u2013 equally deep and heartfelt \u2013 for democratic self-government in this country. What does this mean? Here are two thoughts. Johnson stressed his desire for a partnership with the EU, not confrontation, in his first public comments as prime minister-elect. He could have gone for a reprise of his \u201cBrexit by 31 October, do or die\u201d campaign message, but instead he stressed the importance of having a close and friendly relationship with the EU. That final sentence could have come from a David Cameron speech. This does not necessarily tell you much \u2013 the Tory Brexiters think they have Johnson hostage, and so his room for manoeuvre may be limited \u2013 but it is interesting nonetheless. Johnson adopted the language of one nation Conservatism, stressing the importance of caring for the \u201cpoorest and the neediest\u201d. Johnson\u2019s supporters claim that, on all issues other than Brexit, he is at heart a mainstream, one nation Conservative. That is hard to square with his enthusiasm for Brexit and Donald Trump, but it was a common assessment of Johnson when he was London mayor. The real question, perhaps, is whether one nation Conservatism is compatible with hardline Brexitism (which takes you towards Nigel Farage-style nativism), but it is worth noting that Johnson still wants to use this language. Boris Johnson received 66% of the vote, on an 87% turnout. In percentage terms, that is better than Jeremy Corbyn achieved in the last Labour leadership election, in 2016, when he got 62% of the vote on a 78% turnout (although the electorate in that contest was much larger). It is also better than Jo Swinson achieved yesterday, when she was elected Lib Dem leader with 63% of the vote on a 72% turnout. Johnson has also done better than Iain Duncan Smith, the first Conservative leader elected by members, not just MPs. In 2001 Duncan Smith got 61% of the vote on a 78% turnout. But Johnson has not managed to beat his old rival, David Cameron. Cameron had 68% of the vote when he won in 2005, on a turnout that was also 78%. He says his three priorities \u2013 deliver, unite and defeat \u2013 form the acronym Dud. But that is to leave out the final plan: \u201cenergise\u201d. So his acronym is Dude, he jokes. He says he is now going to get on with the job. And that\u2019s it. Boris Johnson says the party has to reconcile two conflicting instincts again: the instinct to work with others, and the instinct for self-government. He says in the Financial Times this morning someone said no incoming leader had ever faced such a daunting set of circumstances. But do you look daunted, he asks the audience. They don\u2019t look or feel daunted he says. He says the mantra of his campaign was to deliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn. (He used to include unite the party too, but with all the resignations, that might not have sounded such a good line.) Boris Johnson says there will be people who question the wisdom of the decision to elect him. No one person or party has a monopoly of wisdom, he says. But he says over time the Conservatives have had the best instincts, and the best way of balancing instincts, like the instinct to own your own home and keep your own money, and the instinct to share. The Conservatives have encouraged those instincts to work together, he says. Boris Johnson is giving his victory speech. He starts by saying Jeremy Hunt was a formidable opponent. He was a fount of excellent ideas, all of which Johnson says he proposes to steal forthwith. And he thanks Theresa May for her service. Boris Johnson won with 66% of the vote. Gillan said there were 159,320 people eligible to vote. Turnout was 87.4%. And there were 509 rejected ballot papers. Gillan is now announcing the results. Boris Johnson: 92,153 Jeremy Hunt: 46,656 Dame Cheryl Gillan is explaining the election process. She also thanks party staff, and the party\u2019s board. And she thanks the ERS for conducting a professional election. And she thanks the 1922 executive too. She also thanks everyone who voted in the election, and the candidates who stood. Both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt emerged as worthy candidates, she said. Dame Cheryl Gillan and Charles Walker from the 1922 Committee come on stage to announce the results. Walker thanks the party staff. He says he has a plea as a backbencher. Can we be kinder to the next prime minister than we have been to the current prime minister? Lewis invites Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt into the hall. Lewis thanks Theresa May for her service. It is now paramount that they come together, he says. He says the party will deliver best for the country when it is united. Lewis says Tory members have undertaken a solemn duty in choosing the next leader. They have engaged constructively and thoughtfully in the process. He says he thinks the party has risen to the task. Brandon Lewis, the party chairman, is speaking now. He says he is proud of the way the election has been conducted. The candidates have travelled the country and taken hundreds of questions. He says the online live hustings, open to everyone in the country, was a first for a political party. He thanks party staff for their work. Now we\u2019ve got a clip from John Major \u2013 but not the statement about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit he made yesterday. David Cameron and Theresa May have also been featured. Now an extract from Margaret Thatcher\u2019s final speech in the Commons. At the QEII centre some audio is now being played. It is Winston Churchill, followed by Harold Macmillan (I think) talking about how great it is to be made prime minister. Then Margaret Thatcher\u2019s \u201cYou turn if you want to, the lady\u2019s not for turning\u201d soundbite. The announcement seems imminent. Here is Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, checking his watch. As are many people. The event is running late. From my colleague Daniel Boffey in Brussels Here is Jeremy Hunt and his wife Lucia arriving at the QEII centre a few minutes ago. This is from Arlene Foster, the DUP leader. From BuzzFeed\u2019s Matthew Champion From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Harry Cole Mark Spencer is currently a whip. From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar In an extraordinary blog Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European commissioner for health and food safety, who is from Lithuania, suggests that Boris Johnson and his fellow Brexiters are just as dishonest as Boris Yeltsin and other politicians were in post-Soviet Russia. Here\u2019s an excerpt. Almost ironically, without comparing the UK itself with the USSR because it is not comparable, I can\u2019t think of a better golden standard than the USSR in terms of fact distortion, reality falsification and blunt oblivions of reality. Then there were the heroes of the perestroika era swearing that they would create a market economy in post-Soviet Russia within 500 days! \u2018500 Day Programme\u2019 is history. Like the other the most unrealistic promises at the time, this never became a reality. People paid for these empty and broken promises with impoverishment, inequality and much more. The programme also left one infamous quote: \u2018Boris, ti ne prav\u2019 (\u2018Boris, you are wrong\u2019)! It is a different Boris, of course, but there was something in the way of doing politics that was similar: many unrealistic promises, ignoring economic rationales and rational decisions. These decisions led to a new autocratic constitution and finally paved the way to Vladimir Putin. Today in Russia we have oligarchs, a pseudo-market economy, a regulated, governed pseudo-democracy. And, Putin\u2019s authoritarianism. For Boris Yeltsin, the warning came true: \u201cBoris, you are wrong\u201d. Hopefully, it will not be the case for Boris Johnson if he is elected today. The cabinet bought Theresa May a handbag and some jewellery as a leaving present, the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford reports. From the Independent\u2019s Andrew Woodcock This is from my colleague Heather Stewart, who is at the QEII centre. Here are some other senior Tories arriving at the QEII centre. Boris Johnson is arriving at the QEII centre shortly. This is from Anna Soubry, the former Tory MP who now leads the Independent Group for Change. Anne Milton has resigned as skills minister, saying she has \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the prospect of leaving the EU without a deal (something that Boris Johnson says ministers must accept as an option if they want to serve in his cabinet). She also points out that she abstained last week (ie defying the government whip, which was to vote against) when MPs backed a move intended to stop Boris Johnson proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. Downing Street has just announced that the Labour MP John Mann has been appointed to the government as an independent adviser to the government on antisemitism. Mann, a Brexiter who has been critical of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership of Labour, chairs the all-party parliamentary group against antisemitism. He will provide advice to the the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG). Commenting on the appointment, Theresa May said: Antisemitism is racism. It has absolutely no place in our society and we must fight its bitter scourge wherever it rears its head. I\u2019ve been proud to lead a government that is tackling such discrimination in all its forms \u2013 from making sure courts have the powers they need to deal with those who peddle hatred, to asking the Law Commission to undertake a full review of hate crime legislation. But there is yet more to do. John Mann is, without exception, a key voice on this matter. He has frequently campaigned in the House of Commons on this issue and has tirelessly used his role as a politician to speak out on behalf of victims of anti-Jewish racism. I am confident he will bring the level of cross-party independent advice needed to advise government and to ensure we see progress on this very important issue. Sky\u2019s Sam Coates has the timetable for the announcement. We will have a live feed at the top of the blog. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over Nadeem Badshah. Sorry not to be in earlier. I was held up at home. Here is video of Boris Johnson\u2019s brother Jo and father Stanley arriving at the QEII centre in Westminster for the announcement of the results of the Tory leadership contest. Nigel Evans, the Conservative backbench MP, told the BBC: The only thing that\u2019s certain is that Larry the Cat is going to stay in place as the Downing Street cat. Prime ministers come and go, Larry remains in place. When asked if he believes Boris Johnson could be persuaded that a third runway should be built at Heathrow, the airport\u2019s chief executive John Holland-Kaye told the PA news agency: It\u2019s actually a fait accompli now. The vote in parliament with nearly a four-to-one majority means this is now happening. The judicial review process was a resounding success for the Department for Transport at the first stage, so this is now a reality and things have moved on. We\u2019re now making it happen. There are jobs now that we have created up and down the country that would be at risk if anything else was to happen, and hundreds of thousands more that we\u2019ll create as we expand. So I don\u2019t think any prime minister would not want to see the benefits that come with Heathrow expansion. The new Conservative leader will be announced at the QEII centre in London at around 11:45am with campaigners for a People\u2019s Vote protesting outside the venue in Westminster. New Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson says her door is open to members of rival parties who want to join her and the prospect of a Boris Johnson-led Conservative Party pushing for a no-deal Brexit could increase the chances of a second referendum. She said she was involved in talks with MPs from other parties, including the Conservatives, about defecting. \u201cOur door is absolutely open to people who share our values,\u201d Swinson, who was appointed Lib Dem leader yesterday, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. I am talking to people in different parties, including Conservatives. There is a reason why thousands of people are joining the Liberal Democrats, when the Conservatives have gone off to the right and Labour have gone off to the left and people who want to see a better politics, a better alternative than the - frankly depressing - choice of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, they can join us because there is a better way. She admitted there might not yet be a majority in parliament for a so-called people\u2019s vote on Brexit but the numbers in favour of another referendum would be bolstered by disaffected Tories under Johnson. When asked if he would serve under Boris Johnson, international development secretary Rory Stewart replied: \u201cNo.\u201d Stewart is among the ministers who have arrived at Number 10 along with Matt Hancock, Jeremy Hunt, Liz Truss, Karen Bradley and Jeremy Wright for a cabinet meeting. It will be Theresa May\u2019s final cabinet meeting as prime minister. Green MEP Philippe Lamberts, a member of the European Parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group, said if Boris Johnson wins the Tory leadership race he \u201cwill be confronting the exact same situation as Theresa May\u201d. The Belgian MEP told the Today programme: Boris Johnson is known to want many things and often contradictory things like having your cake and eating it, he is on record saying that. So indeed he wants good relations with the European Union and he wants to be able to cut off all ties and not have the Irish backstop and all the rest of it. He suggested Johnson should seek to pass a Brexit deal with a Northern Ireland-only backstop, something which would lose the support of the DUP but could pick up support from elsewhere in the Commons. Former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon has claimed Boris Johnson\u2019s optimism and fresh mandate would help shift Brussels towards a deal. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: Nobody is aiming for no-deal, that is not the strategy. We want a better deal, parliament wants a better deal, and Boris Johnson has made clear throughout that he wants a better deal. But the way to get a better deal is to be very firm that that date is there in law. There are three months now before the end of October and it is perfectly possible, with plenty of goodwill on both sides, to improve the agreement so that parliament does, in the end, support it. Justice secretary David Gauke, who said on Sunday he would not serve in Cabinet under Boris Johnson, believes there were \u201cparliamentary mechanisms\u201d which could prevent a no-deal Brexit. That would \u201cnot necessarily\u201d involve bringing down a Johnson administration, he said. Gauke stressed that he would not vote against a Tory government in a motion of no confidence if it was heading towards a no-deal Brexit, but does not think \u201cit will come to that.\u201d He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I think that there will be parliamentary mechanisms, if you like. There is a clear majority in the House of Commons that doesn\u2019t want to leave the EU without a deal, I think that will become very clear in the autumn. He added there was the possibility of a \u201cperiod of huge uncertainty\u201d in Westminster as the October 31 deadline approaches. Are there circumstances where there is a risk of a government losing a confidence motion? Yes, clearly there are circumstances where there is a risk that that might happen. I think that the new prime minister would be wise to avoid getting into those circumstances. The outcome of the ballot of about 160,000 Tory members will be revealed at just before midday in London with the victor officially becoming prime minister on Wednesday. Jeremy Hunt was in a positive mood when he arrived home from a run this morning despite Boris Johnson remaining the clear favourite to take over from Theresa May. The foreign secretary said it was still \u201call to play for\u201d, a comment echoed by his rival as he entered his campaign headquarters. A Johnson win could spark more government resignations after Sir Alan Duncan quit as Foreign Office minister on Monday in protest at his expected victory, predicting a \u201ccrisis of government\u201d. Chancellor Philip Hammond and justice secretary David Gauke have given notice that they will resign rather than serve under Johnson. Moving away from the white smoke to confirm the next prime minister, Ruth Smeeth, parliamentary chairwoman of the Jewish Labour Movement, has called for a completely independent process for dealing with anti-Semitism cases in the party. The MP told the Today programme: The proposals that were sanctioned by the shadow cabinet and will be discussed today at the NEC just simply aren\u2019t good enough. There is still no independence, in fact arguably political power over anti-Semitism cases is going to be consolidated by political supporters of Jeremy Corbyn. I think we need a completely independent process that could restore faith for everybody. Boris Johnson entered his campaign headquarters in Westminster at around 8am. Asked if he agreed with his rival Jeremy Hunt that it was still all to play for, he said: \u201cAll to play for.\u201d Good morning. There is a momentous day ahead with Boris Johnson expected to be announced as the choice of the Conservative party to be the next prime minister. Theresa May is set to chair her final cabinet meeting as prime minister. At around 4pm, Gina Miller, Sir John Curtice and Henry Newman are scheduled give evidence on the impact of a no-deal Brexit to the Lords EU Committee",

      "bodyText": "Senator Kamala Harris attended a fundraiser over the weekend that placed her in the middle of the feud between Taylor Swift and music manager Scooter Braun. The question now is if attending a fundraiser hosted by Braun is enough to lose Harris the Taylor Swift voting bloc, which is actually a thing and isn\u2019t insignificant. Swift has accused Braun of \u201cincessant, manipulative bullying\u201d. Last month, Braun purchased Swift\u2019s master recordings from her first label, Big Machine Label Group, and Swift wrote a Tumblr post expressing her dismay that her \u201cmusical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it\u201d. Her avid fanbase and much of the music world rallied behind her, and Braun, who represents artists like Justin Bieber and Demi Lovato, had his backers as well. The lines of loyalty were a little unclear this weekend at the Harris fundraiser, when Harris\u2019 husband, Doug Emhoff, tweeted a photo of Harris with Lovato, Ariana Grande and Katy Perry \u2013 with whom Swift had just made up \u2013 all at the Braun event.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has heaped praise on the UK\u2019s new prime minister, Boris Johnson, describing him as \u201cBritain Trump\u201d during a speech to hundreds of teenage fans in Washington on Tuesday. \u201cWe have a really good man who\u2019s going to be the prime minister of the UK now,\u201d the US president said. \u201cHe\u2019s tough and he\u2019s smart. They\u2019re saying, \u2018Britain Trump\u2019. They call him \u2018Britain Trump\u2019 and people are saying that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Despite polls and protests to the contrary, he insisted: \u201cThey like me over there. That\u2019s what they wanted. That\u2019s what they need. He\u2019ll get it done. Boris is good. He\u2019s gonna do a good job.\u201d Trump also praised Nigel Farage, the leader of the Brexit party, and looked for him in the audience without success. He said he is confident Johnson and Farage can work together well, he said. Johnson has previously ruled out pacts with Farage. The president has expressed support for Johnson in recent days, while repeating claims that out former British prime minister Theresa May did not succeed in winning support for her Brexit plan because she ignored his advice on how to handle it. Trump was speaking to an audience of nearly 1,500 teenagers at Turning Point USA\u2019s Teen Student Action Summit in an upmarket Washington hotel. Before he walked in there were fervent chants of \u201cUSA! USA! USA!\u201d and \u201cTrump! Trump!

When footage from the 2016 presidential debates flashed up on the screens, Hillary Clinton was roundly booed. And when a clip quoted Trump saying to her, \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail,\u201d there were more cheers. The president delivered a characteristically populist speech that sometimes circled back on itself as it railed against socialism, the \u201cfake news\u201d media, the Russia investigation and political correctness. There was a rousing cheer when he mentioned his daughter, Ivanka Trump, and protecting gun rights. He went on the offensive against another member of \u201cthe Squad\u201d of Democratic congresswomen of color, following his racist attacks last week. Trump insulted Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, who has called for him to be impeached.

Several Johnson loyalists have had their eye on the post of chancellor, but only one can do it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/24/boris-johnson-takes-his-revenge-and-sacks-over-half-the-cabinet\">A complete clearout of May\u2019s remain-minded ministers</a> provided plenty of opportunity to reward the Brexit believers though.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The issue that will define a Johnson premiership. He has promised to rapidly renegotiate almost all of May\u2019s departure deal, ditching the Irish backstop border guarantee policy \u2013 something that would seem a huge task over any timescale, let alone little more than 12 weeks, a fair proportion of which is taken up by a summer break. If this fails, he will be set on a no-deal departure for 31 October, and a likely huge clash with MPs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Iran</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>&nbsp;wasn\u2019t enough, a new Johnson government must immediately take steps to make sure he doesn\u2019t begin his time in No 10 with a slide into war. The situation in the gulf is complex, fast-moving and hugely dangerous. Johnson did not cover himself in glory as foreign secretary, especially over Iran. It will be his task to prove he has learned.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Managing parliament and Tory MPs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Johnson will start as PM with a working Commons majority of four, thanks to the DUP, but within weeks it is likely to be down to three if as expected the Liberal Democrats win in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. If this wasn\u2019t tricky enough, a small but significant section of Tory MPs openly detest Johnson, and will not want to help him out - and with his cabinet sackings, the \u2018Gaukward squad\u2019 of former senior cabinet members set on blocking a no-deal Brexit swelled in ranks.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Loosening the purse strings</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Such was the fiscal largesse on display from both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt during the hustings process that much as he will seek to kick any decisions towards an autumn budget, voters \u2013 especially Tory members \u2013 will be expecting both tax cuts and more spending on areas such as education and the police.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Everything non-Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This might sound glib, but there is a lot to consider \u2013 during the three-plus years of Brexit introversion May\u2019s government failed to properly grasp any of a series of long-term, pressing national problems: the crisis in social care; the future of the NHS; a climate emergency; the increasingly insecure future of work; a broken housing market; rampant poverty, including among many working people. This is a huge workload for any new administration.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Being prime ministerial</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Critics might say this is Johnson\u2019s single biggest challenge. The leadership process has shown that while he endlessly harked back to supposed successes as London mayor \u2013 an often ceremonial role with relatively few powers \u2013 Johnson was notably quieter about his period as foreign secretary.</p>\n    <p>Being prime minister is like the latter, to a factor of 10 \u2013 a never-ending succession of red boxes containing vital documents, of urgent briefings, of a whole system hanging on your decisions. Johnson has a tendency to ignore advice, pluck statistics out of the air and rely on sudden, cheap glibness. Curbing these long habits will be a daily struggle - his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/24/meet-the-new-dude-at-no-10-papers-greet-boris-johnsons-victory\">adopting the acronym 'Dude' in his victory speech</a> shows just how hard it is for him.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterwalker\"><b>Peter Walker</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Political correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The disclosures followed a frenetic day of rumours over who would be chosen by Johnson to advise the new Tory administration following his victory over Jeremy Hunt.</p> \n<p>Griffith\u2019s role will be to help Johnson rebuild ties with the business world amid fears that the new Conservative leader is happy to embrace a no-deal Brexit if he cannot come to an agreement with the EU before the 31 October deadline.</p> \n<p>He will be based full-time in 10 Downing Street from Wednesday, the first day of Johnson\u2019s premiership, Sky\u2019s chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, said in an email to staff.</p> \n<p>Griffith is expected to stand down from Sky while working for Johnson.

      "bodyText": "A Sky executive who lent a townhouse to Boris Johnson\u2019s leadership campaign and an academic who accused politicians of exaggerating racial prejudice were among Downing Street\u2019s controversial first appointments on Tuesday. Andrew Griffith, the chief financial officer and chief operating officer at the pay-TV group, has been appointed as the chief business adviser to Number 10. He will work closely with the new prime minister who reputedly said \u201cfuck business\u201d when confronted with companies\u2019 concerns over Brexit. Munira Mirza, who was a deputy mayor for Johnson throughout his time at City Hall, has been recruited to be head of Number 10\u2019s policy unit, Tory sources said. She was a prominent critic of Theresa May\u2019s racial disparities audit for public services, saying the \u201cscene was being set for another bout of political self-flagellation regarding the subject of race in Britain\u201d. The disclosures followed a frenetic day of rumours over who would be chosen by Johnson to advise the new Tory administration following his victory over Jeremy Hunt. Griffith\u2019s role will be to help Johnson rebuild ties with the business world amid fears that the new Conservative leader is happy to embrace a no-deal Brexit if he cannot come to an agreement with the EU before the 31 October deadline. He will be based full-time in 10 Downing Street from Wednesday, the first day of Johnson\u2019s premiership, Sky\u2019s chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, said in an email to staff. Griffith is expected to stand down from Sky while working for Johnson. The former Rothschild investment banker joined Sky in 1999, and became finance chief for the group in 2008. He was a key part of the team during the attempted takeover of Sky by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox, when Murdoch\u2019s son James was chairman of the broadcaster. Johnson, who is expected to enter No 10 next week, has been spending up to 13 hours a day at Griffith\u2019s lavish \u00a39.5m townhouse, with sources on his team saying he has switched his focus towards strategy for government. A Johnson campaign source said Griffith had kindly opened up his home to let members of the transition team meet there, but the businessman was not part of that operation. Griffith received about \u00a317m after Sky was acquired by Comcast, which needed to buy out some of the stakes and share schemes held by Griffith and other staff in the group. He ran as a Tory parliamentary candidate for Corby in 2001 and 2005. He lost both times to Labour. Mirza, whose family came to the UK from Pakistan, criticised the Labour MP David Lammy\u2019s 2017 review of racism in the criminal justice system, which was commissioned by David Cameron and supported by May. She said it was an example of how \u201castonishingly, it seems that a lot of people in politics think it\u2019s a good idea to exaggerate the problem of racism\u201d. She disputed his view, and that of May, that the criminal justice system treats black people more harshly than white people, arguing that social and economic reasons lie behind the higher proportions of BAME people in prison \u2013 not institutional racism. Mirza wrote: \u201cParadoxically, just at the point when racist attitudes were declining in society and many ethnic groups were integrating successfully, our political leaders became obsessed with racism \u2026 The tragedy is that accusations of institutional racism \u2014 and their official endorsement \u2014 have corroded BAME communities\u2019 trust in public services, thereby making things worse.\u201d Last summer, Mirza defended Johnson\u2019s controversial article that likened women in burqas to letterboxes and has been a long-term critic of multiculturalism as a policy choice. \u201cThere are many people in this country who are uncomfortable about the burqa. When people argue we should use more sensitive language what they are really saying is let\u2019s not be critical at all, let\u2019s not offend, let\u2019s not criticise this practice because it upsets Muslims,\u201d she said. Mark Spencer, the 49-year-old MP for Sherwood, will become Johnson\u2019s chief whip. This is a key position as the new premier attempts to govern with a working Tory-DUP majority of just two. His appointment was praised by MPs across the party. Long-serving Conservative Sir Nicholas Soames said he was a \u201creally excellent sane and wise choice\u201d. The business minister Andrew Stephenson said: \u201cCongratulations to the new chief whip - the man who taught me how to \u2018put a bit of stick about\u2019.\u201d Meanwhile, a former ambassador to Denmark and Foreign Office official is being tipped as Johnson\u2019s new Brexit negotiator. David Frost is a career diplomat and was head of Europe at the Foreign and Commonwealth office and and a former special adviser to Boris Johnson when he was foreign secretary. He is currently chief executive of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry but has years of experience working with the EU. \u201cHe believes there is a deal to be done and will pursue that,\u201d said one source who knows Frost. However there are also concerns, if his appointment is confirmed, that the key \u201csherpa\u201d role is going to someone who is not a full-time member of the civil service. \u201cDavid is good, he knows Europe inside out, but Johnson will need someone at a senior level in the civil service who will be in charge of the day-to-day work,\u201d said the source.",

He was there as a go-between, doing a favour to ex-colleagues; an unofficial channel, trying to convey the Met\u2019s new thinking about investigations into historic sexual abuse, in light of their failings over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/26/jimmy-savile-sexual-abuse-timeline\" title=\"\">Jimmy Savile</a>. I asked him about his general approach when he came across allegations like the ones being made by the man we knew then as Nick, and now as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/22/carl-beech-vip-paedophile-ring-claims-guilty\" title=\"\">Carl Beech</a>. The officer spoke plainly: as a principle, he told me, he tended to assume in cases like this that there was no smoke without fire.</p> <p>There ought to be a general rule that a celestial alarm bell will ring every time a police officer says that. But none rang, neither in Scotland Yard nor in enough newsrooms around the country. Operation Midland continued for more than another year.</p> <p>With hindsight, Midland can look like a moment of institutional madness. How was it possible that a set of allegations as fantastical, as grotesque, as Beech\u2019s could be believed? That Ted Heath, Leon Brittan, Lord Bramall, the heads of MI5 and MI6 and other powerful men, in rooms in London, all had taken their clothes off and tortured, raped and murdered boys, every trace of their crimes covered up?</p> <p>Now that the last, slender threads of that story have unravelled, the police need to understand \u2013 as do we \u2013 how they came to take a decision to believe Beech: the decision, in effect, to abandon evidence-based policing.</p> <p>Under immense pressure after the truth about Savile was revealed, the police came to think that the old ways of investigating didn\u2019t work any more. In many respects they were right; lots of them hadn\u2019t worked. Genuine victims had been deterred from coming forward, and crimes which might have been solved had gone unpunished. But the right diagnosis was followed by a spectacularly wrong prescription. Determined to do nothing to undermine their witness, Operation Midland closed its eyes to facts that might turn out to be inconvenient.</p> <p>There were places to start an inquiry that might have seemed obvious: the alleged murder of a boy \u2013 a schoolfriend of Beech\u2019s named Scott \u2013 which Beech claimed had taken place in plain sight on a public road at a busy time; or talking to Beech\u2019s wife of many years. For months, the police failed to investigate either. The Panorama team was astonished to find we were ahead of the police in contacting both Scott and Dawn Beech. There was the school attendance record that categorically undermined Carl Beech\u2019s claim to have been repeatedly absent from school while he was being abused. It was Northumbria police\u2019s investigation into Operation Midland which uncovered that, not Midland itself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb9a1948bed8c392876d5883e8f35c24883fcb6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb9a1948bed8c392876d5883e8f35c24883fcb6e/0_42_3121_1873/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Scotland Yard headquarters in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Under immense pressure after the truth about Savile was revealed, the police came to think that the old ways of investigating didn\u2019t work any more.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the case of Scott and the school records, no deep intrusion into Carl Beech\u2019s life would have been needed to corroborate or disprove his story. There would have been no serious risk of victim shaming. But by now the police were operating from a different playbook, one that relied on publicity rather than diligence to encourage witnesses to come forward. It had worked in Operation Yewtree, the investigation into high-profile sexual offences by Savile and others. In Operation Midland it should quickly have become obvious it wasn\u2019t working. No credible witnessescame forward to support Beech\u2019s story, but the police persisted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/22/how-nick-the-serial-child-abuse-accuser-became-the-accused\">Revealed: how Carl Beech, the serial child abuse accuser, became the accused</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What to make now of the way Midland was conducted? Fundamentally this: if you think the police have a steady compass, they don\u2019t. They\u2019re twitchy, obsessively concerned with public opinion, easily moved by political pressure. In overcompensating for their failings over Savile they drove a steamroller over the rights of innocent men.</p> <p>If you worry about one consequence of Operation Midland, it should be this: it put the public in danger.

I asked him about his general approach when he came across allegations like the ones being made by the man we knew then as Nick, and now as Carl Beech. The officer spoke plainly: as a principle, he told me, he tended to assume in cases like this that there was no smoke without fire. There ought to be a general rule that a celestial alarm bell will ring every time a police officer says that. But none rang, neither in Scotland Yard nor in enough newsrooms around the country. Operation Midland continued for more than another year. With hindsight, Midland can look like a moment of institutional madness. How was it possible that a set of allegations as fantastical, as grotesque, as Beech\u2019s could be believed? That Ted Heath, Leon Brittan, Lord Bramall, the heads of MI5 and MI6 and other powerful men, in rooms in London, all had taken their clothes off and tortured, raped and murdered boys, every trace of their crimes covered up? Now that the last, slender threads of that story have unravelled, the police need to understand \u2013 as do we \u2013 how they came to take a decision to believe Beech: the decision, in effect, to abandon evidence-based policing. Under immense pressure after the truth about Savile was revealed, the police came to think that the old ways of investigating didn\u2019t work any more. In many respects they were right; lots of them hadn\u2019t worked. Genuine victims had been deterred from coming forward, and crimes which might have been solved had gone unpunished. But the right diagnosis was followed by a spectacularly wrong prescription. Determined to do nothing to undermine their witness, Operation Midland closed its eyes to facts that might turn out to be inconvenient. There were places to start an inquiry that might have seemed obvious: the alleged murder of a boy \u2013 a schoolfriend of Beech\u2019s named Scott \u2013 which Beech claimed had taken place in plain sight on a public road at a busy time; or talking to Beech\u2019s wife of many years. For months, the police failed to investigate either. The Panorama team was astonished to find we were ahead of the police in contacting both Scott and Dawn Beech. There was the school attendance record that categorically undermined Carl Beech\u2019s claim to have been repeatedly absent from school while he was being abused. It was Northumbria police\u2019s investigation into Operation Midland which uncovered that, not Midland itself. In the case of Scott and the school records, no deep intrusion into Carl Beech\u2019s life would have been needed to corroborate or disprove his story. There would have been no serious risk of victim shaming. But by now the police were operating from a different playbook, one that relied on publicity rather than diligence to encourage witnesses to come forward. It had worked in Operation Yewtree, the investigation into high-profile sexual offences by Savile and others. In Operation Midland it should quickly have become obvious it wasn\u2019t working. No credible witnessescame forward to support Beech\u2019s story, but the police persisted. What to make now of the way Midland was conducted? Fundamentally this: if you think the police have a steady compass, they don\u2019t. They\u2019re twitchy, obsessively concerned with public opinion, easily moved by political pressure. In overcompensating for their failings over Savile they drove a steamroller over the rights of innocent men. If you worry about one consequence of Operation Midland, it should be this: it put the public in danger. Carl Beech, a paedophile and a risk to children, remained at large for years longer than necessary because the police failed to investigate him fully. \u2022 Ceri Thomas is editor at news startup Tortoise and a former editor of Panorama and the Today programme",

This uptick is most visible in Oakland where homicides have increased by 31%. Oakland has seen 34 murders during the first six months of this year compared to 26 over the same period of time last year. It could just be a random spike, but the latest numbers do show how fragile hard-won gains are in public safety. It\u2019s also a reminder of how many Bay Area communities still don\u2019t feel safe. A child\u2019s guide to avoiding bullets Aben\u00e9 Clayton spent a day with Elana Bolds, a local activist in Richmond, California, teaching children how to avoid being caught in a crossfire. In Oakland, the work of violence prevention, often coordinated through grassroots community organizations and churches, feels as vital as it did in the 1990s, when the city\u2019s gun violence epidemic peaked. Many of the city\u2019s neighborhoods are still stricken by shootings, despite a sharp decline over the past five years, which has been attributed to Oakland\u2019s Operation Ceasefire violence prevention initiative. In future stories, we will be examining the role that social media plays in the dynamics of gun violence. Read more here. Stories we\u2019re reading Untraceable \u201cghost guns\u201d are proliferating in California and are increasingly being used by criminals. Read the full story over at The Trace. Sactown Magazine has a lengthy profile on Dr Garen Wintemute, a physician who has spearheaded gun control legislation over several decades backed by science. Wintemute helped put southern California\u2019s infamous \u201cRing of Fire\u201d gun companies out of business back in the 1990s. Finally, we\u2019d love to hear from you. If you have suggestions for what you\u2019d like us to cover, trends or stories you\u2019d like to tell us about, or other questions or feedback, contact us here.",

Approval for the new Labor leader has also gone up four points in the past month from 35% in May to 39% in the latest poll. Two months after replacing Bill Shorten, Albanese\u2019s standing is equivalent to Shorten\u2019s prior to the federal election.

Thirty-one per cent of the sample are not sure. There has been controversy post-election about the reliability of opinion polling because none of the major surveys \u2013 Newspoll, Ipsos, Galaxy or Essential \u2013 correctly predicted a Coalition win on 18 May, projecting Labor in front on a two-party preferred vote of 51-49 and 52-48. The lack of precision in the polling has prompted public reflection at Essential, as has been flagged by its executive director, Peter Lewis. Guardian Australia is not currently publishing measurements of primary votes or a two-party preferred calculation, but is continuing to publish survey results of responses to questions about the leaders and policy issues.

The Queensland government and opposition have both committed to freezing mining royalties at their current level. The new report details how the staggered system in Queensland, where low-value coal under $100 a tonne is taxed at a lower rate, acts to incentivise thermal coalmines such as Adani\u2019s Carmichael project. At both current and long-term predicted coal prices, thermal coalminers will pay the lowest 7% royalties rate. Those producing metallurgical coal will pay royalties in the higher brackets \u2013 12.5% and 15%. \u201cWhat the staggered rate is supposed to do is mimic the mining tax and take more from coalmines when prices are high or when they\u2019re mining particularly high-quality coal,\u201d said Australia Institute research director Roderick Campbell. \u201cThe effect is, however, that the lowest-quality coalmines \u2013 thermal mines like Adani\u2019s \u2013 pay the least, while high-quality coking coalmines pay more. \u201cFrom an economic and climate perspective this is a pretty bad result, particularly without widespread carbon prices to reflect the damage costs of burning more low-quality coal.\u201d The report comes amid a push for authorities to better recognise the nuance between thermal coal, used to produce energy, and metallurgical (coking) coal, which is used in steelmaking and where alternatives have not yet been commercialised.

      "bodyText": "One million more homes in England could be in line for help to cut their energy bills under the government\u2019s latest strategy to tackle fuel poverty. Ministers plan to change the way the government calculates whether a household is fuel poor, after admitting that much more needs to be done to reach its own fuel poverty targets. Under the government\u2019s current definition, 2.55m households live in fuel poverty because they have low income relative to high energy bills. Under the new definition about 3.66m households will be considered fuel poor because they meet the existing criteria and also live in draughty homes with low energy efficiency ratings. Chris Skidmore, the energy minister, said: \u201cThe best long-term solution to addressing fuel poverty is to improve household energy efficiency. \u201cThat is why we have set the fuel poverty target for England, and committed in our manifesto, to improve the energy efficiency of as many fuel poor households as we can,\u201d he said. The government plans to increase the energy efficiency standards of all fuel-poor homes to a C-banding on the energy performance certificate rating scale by 2030. Only between 11% and 12% of fuel-poor households live in homes which reach this energy efficiency grade. \u201cSteady progress is being made, but much more needs to be done [to] end the blight of cold homes,\u201d Skidmore said. The government opened a consultation on its fuel poverty strategy after finding that the number of children living in fuel-poor homes has climbed by 12% from 2010. National Energy Action, the fuel poverty charity, said it plans to use the consultation to urge the government to increase its public spending to meet its fuel poverty targets. It estimates that the government will need to spend an extra \u00a315.8bn to bridge the gap between the current standards of household energy efficiency and its targets. The fuel poverty committee, the government\u2019s official advisers, has suggested near-term proposals to help reduce the funding shortfall to just under \u00a39bn. But about \u00a33bn of extra public spending will still be needed over the next six years if government hopes to meet its interim 2025 fuel poverty target. Adam Scorer, NEA\u2019s chief executive, said efforts to tackle energy efficiency are \u201cflatlining\u201d. \u201cIt is important that government recognises that we are off track. Unless it commits greater, central investment to improve the homes of the fuel poor, fuel poverty targets will be meaningless and ambitions to achieve net zero carbon will be fanciful,\u201d he said. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy is putting \u00a36bn into energy efficiency and \u00a3300m to reduce winter energy bills for 2m low-income households every year. It has also capped the price of standard energy tariffs. But the NEA said that at this rate it would take 96 years for the government to reach its own targets to reduce fuel poverty. Government figures published last week revealed that efforts to end fuel poverty and energy waste by making the UK\u2019s draughty homes more efficient have collapsed by almost 85%. The report revealed that the number of energy efficiency upgrades has fallen to an average of 10,000 a month for the six months to the end of May, less than a sixth of the upgrades undertaken in 2014.",

Demonstrators have filed for a permit to hold a rally on Saturday in Yuen Long, the district on the outskirts of Hong Kong where dozens of masked men chased and beat commuters and protesters with wooden poles and metal rods, leaving at least 45 people in hospital. Police arrived after the assailants left. Footage of the attack, which included a pregnant woman being hit, protesters being punched and kneed, and commuters screaming and crying while trying to shield themselves, emerged on Sunday night, fuelling further political unrest as demonstrators, opposition lawmakers and others demanded answers from authorities for failing to stop the violence. Max Chung, who delivered the application for a letter of no objection from the police, that is required to hold a rally, said: \u201cWe want to show to the public and international community that Hong Kongers, we will never surrender in front of terrorism \u2026 To show our solidarity and say no to terrorism, we have to stand up.\u201d Chung said: \u201cYuen Long was under terrorist attack and we have no choice but to take it back.\u201d The protests, principally over a controversial bill that would allow suspects to be extradited from Hong Kong to mainland China, have taken on new demands, including an investigation into police use of rubber bullets, teargas and physical violence against protesters. Protesters are angry at the police\u2019s slow response to the attack in Yuen Long and their pursuit of the case. Six people have been arrested for \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d. The violence in Yuen Long has heightened tensions and fears of further attacks. On Tuesday evening, unverified footage showed men in white gathering in Tuen Mun, another city near Yuen Long in the New Territories. One video circulating online showed two men in white dragging a man in a black shirt across the road, but there were no reports of major disturbances. Protesters and residents are also angry at the government\u2019s weak condemnation of the violence. Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, said the \u201cshocking violence\u201d in Yuen Long would be investigated, but devoted most of her comments to criticising protesters, who surrounded Beijing\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong and defaced the national emblem of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Sunday. \u201cMy team and I are here to show that while some of our work was not done properly \u2026 my colleagues and I have been making efforts to identify the root causes of this discontent,\u201d she said. Lam\u2019s remarks failed to placate residents. On Tuesday, a group of aviation staff called for a protest at Hong Kong airport on Friday to condemn the government and police for \u201cignoring the random attacks on citizens in Yuen Long\u201d. Other activists called for a strike from classes and work the following Monday if Lam does not respond to their demands. A group of medical workers has also called for a sit-in on Friday. In Yuen Long, Chung and other protesters are demanding the government conducts an independent investigation and officially characterises the violence as a \u201ccross-border terrorist attack\u201d. Demonstrators believe some of the assailants were from mainland China. As demonstrators circulated calls for the rally on Saturday, rumours of impending violence from residents or men wearing white spread, giving protesters pause. Organisers said they had mapped out the safest route possible along main roads, from a playground in the centre of the district to the railway station where the attack took place. The violence in Yuen Long marks a sinister turn for the demonstrations, which had been largely peaceful. Hailey Leung, a university student who has been attending the protests this summer, said: \u201cThe fear of the gangs is definitely stronger than the fear of the use of violence of the police.\u201d Her parents have been supportive of the protests but, since the violence in Yuen Long, they have asked her not to attend. \u201cI believe some if not most of the young people will continue to fight for what they want, even if they know it is going to be dangerous,\u201d she said. But Leung may not attend the rally on Saturday, saying: \u201cIt is one thing to run away from teargas and another thing to fight against the gangsters.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Evening Standard and the Independent have been explicitly accused by the British government of being part-owned by the Saudi Arabian state, with a series of \u201cunconventional, complex and clandestine\u201d deals used to hide the sale of stakes in the London-based news outlets to a Saudi government bank.</p> <p>Evgeny Lebedev, who controls both publications, sold 30% stakes in them to offshore companies fronted by a Saudi businessman, Sultan Mohamed Abuljadayel, in 2017 and 2018. The Standard and the Independent say they are unsure who ultimately employs the businessman.</p> <p>David Scannell, the government\u2019s legal representative, told a court on Tuesday that the Saudi Arabian government could now potentially exert editorial influence over the news outlets, said the sale of the shares has \u201cpublic interest considerations\u201d, citing \u201cfreedom of expression and accurate news reporting\u201d as \u201crelevant to this merger\u2019\u2019. He also accused Lebedev of going out of his way to avoid answering questions about the deals.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is of concern to Her Majesty\u2019s government is that a foreign state could be acquiring a substantial stake in Lebedev Holdings [owner of the Evening Standard] and the Independent simultaneously,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jun/13/evening-standard-could-face-inquiry-over-saudi-investment\">l</a>ast month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jun/13/evening-standard-could-face-inquiry-over-saudi-investment\">announced an investigation into the sales</a>, warning that the ultimate investor may have \u201cstrong links to the Saudi Arabian state\u201d and raising fears that a foreign government may have gained influence over the news direction of two major British publications.</p> <p>The decision to intervene is highly political. The heavily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jun/26/evening-standard-reports-loss-amid-ad-struggles-george-osborne\">lossmaking free London newspaper</a> is edited by the former Conservative chancellor, George Osborne, who has let it be known that he would consider a return to frontline politics.</p> <p>In addition, the incoming Conservative prime minister, Boris Johnson \u2013 who could influence the direction of the inquiry \u2013 has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/18/boris-johnson-refuses-to-answer-questions-over-party-in-lebedev-mansion\">refused to answer questions</a> from the Guardian about his attendance at parties held at Lebedev\u2019s Italian castle.</p> <p>Wright previously said the Saudi investment deals \u201cmay have an effect on the Evening Standard and the Independent\u2019s news agendas\u201d. The Independent has already launched a series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/oct/19/independent-deal-with-saudi-publisher-back-under-spotlight\">foreign-language websites</a> run and staffed by Saudi journalists and aimed at audiences in some of the nation\u2019s regional rivals.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia has a poor record on press freedom and the sale of the stake in the Evening Standard\u2019s parent company took place in the aftermath of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, widely considered to have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/19/jamal-khashoggi-killing-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-evidence-un-report\">carried out by by Saudi officials</a>.</p> <p>Both the Independent and Evening Standard insist concerns about editorial independence are unfounded and they are not influenced by financial backers.</p> <p>Lebedev\u2019s lawyers are fighting to stop the government investigating the Saudi investment on a technicality, arguing that the government waited too long and missed the deadline to intervene.</p> <p>In response, the government says its decision was delayed, in part, because both Lebedev and the Saudi investors refused to provide key information. But the tribunal chair noted that Lebedev had provided answers, though there was some delay \u201cbecause of having to get information from Saudi Arabia\u201d.</p> <p>A hearing of the competition appeal tribunal also heard that the Evening Standard and Independent investments had been made through two separate Cayman Islands-registered companies called Scalable Inc and International Media Company, a process that helped obscure the true investor.</p> <p>Each of these two companies was in turn 50% owned by Abuljadayel and 50% by Wondrous Investments, itself ultimately controlled by Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-controlled National Commercial Bank.</p> <p>\u201cThese brass-plaque companies were incorporated for the express purpose of obscuring the true acquirers,\u201d said Scannell, acting for the government. \u201cOur understanding is that the bank is owned and controlled by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u201d</p> <p>Asked whether Abuljadayel was employed by the Saudi investment bank, lawyers for the Evening Standard and Independent referred to previous news articles and said: \u201cIt\u2019s certainly been reported as such.\u201d</p> <p>When pressed further on the Saudi individual\u2019s ultimate employer, the lawyers said: \u201cWe\u2019re not really in a position to assist on that.\u201d</p> <p>Lebedev\u2019s lawyers also argued that the government should have started investigating earlier because the investment had been covered in the Financial Times and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/30/mystery-offshore-investor-takes-20-share-in-evening-standard-evgeny-lebedev\">Guardian</a>.</p> <p>Lebedev has close ties to Saudi Arabia, posing on his Instagram with Saudi-backed militias in Yemen.

      "bodyText": "The Evening Standard and the Independent have been explicitly accused by the British government of being part-owned by the Saudi Arabian state, with a series of \u201cunconventional, complex and clandestine\u201d deals used to hide the sale of stakes in the London-based news outlets to a Saudi government bank. Evgeny Lebedev, who controls both publications, sold 30% stakes in them to offshore companies fronted by a Saudi businessman, Sultan Mohamed Abuljadayel, in 2017 and 2018. The Standard and the Independent say they are unsure who ultimately employs the businessman. David Scannell, the government\u2019s legal representative, told a court on Tuesday that the Saudi Arabian government could now potentially exert editorial influence over the news outlets, said the sale of the shares has \u201cpublic interest considerations\u201d, citing \u201cfreedom of expression and accurate news reporting\u201d as \u201crelevant to this merger\u2019\u2019. He also accused Lebedev of going out of his way to avoid answering questions about the deals. \u201cWhat is of concern to Her Majesty\u2019s government is that a foreign state could be acquiring a substantial stake in Lebedev Holdings [owner of the Evening Standard] and the Independent simultaneously,\u201d he said. The culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, last month announced an investigation into the sales, warning that the ultimate investor may have \u201cstrong links to the Saudi Arabian state\u201d and raising fears that a foreign government may have gained influence over the news direction of two major British publications. The decision to intervene is highly political. The heavily lossmaking free London newspaper is edited by the former Conservative chancellor, George Osborne, who has let it be known that he would consider a return to frontline politics. In addition, the incoming Conservative prime minister, Boris Johnson \u2013 who could influence the direction of the inquiry \u2013 has refused to answer questions from the Guardian about his attendance at parties held at Lebedev\u2019s Italian castle. Wright previously said the Saudi investment deals \u201cmay have an effect on the Evening Standard and the Independent\u2019s news agendas\u201d. The Independent has already launched a series of foreign-language websites run and staffed by Saudi journalists and aimed at audiences in some of the nation\u2019s regional rivals. Saudi Arabia has a poor record on press freedom and the sale of the stake in the Evening Standard\u2019s parent company took place in the aftermath of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, widely considered to have been carried out by by Saudi officials. Both the Independent and Evening Standard insist concerns about editorial independence are unfounded and they are not influenced by financial backers. Lebedev\u2019s lawyers are fighting to stop the government investigating the Saudi investment on a technicality, arguing that the government waited too long and missed the deadline to intervene. In response, the government says its decision was delayed, in part, because both Lebedev and the Saudi investors refused to provide key information. But the tribunal chair noted that Lebedev had provided answers, though there was some delay \u201cbecause of having to get information from Saudi Arabia\u201d. A hearing of the competition appeal tribunal also heard that the Evening Standard and Independent investments had been made through two separate Cayman Islands-registered companies called Scalable Inc and International Media Company, a process that helped obscure the true investor. Each of these two companies was in turn 50% owned by Abuljadayel and 50% by Wondrous Investments, itself ultimately controlled by Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-controlled National Commercial Bank. \u201cThese brass-plaque companies were incorporated for the express purpose of obscuring the true acquirers,\u201d said Scannell, acting for the government. \u201cOur understanding is that the bank is owned and controlled by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u201d Asked whether Abuljadayel was employed by the Saudi investment bank, lawyers for the Evening Standard and Independent referred to previous news articles and said: \u201cIt\u2019s certainly been reported as such.\u201d When pressed further on the Saudi individual\u2019s ultimate employer, the lawyers said: \u201cWe\u2019re not really in a position to assist on that.\u201d Lebedev\u2019s lawyers also argued that the government should have started investigating earlier because the investment had been covered in the Financial Times and the Guardian. Lebedev has close ties to Saudi Arabia, posing on his Instagram with Saudi-backed militias in Yemen. The Independent editor, Christian Broughton, has visited the Saudi capital to meet business partners. The legal challenge was only against the decision to refer the Saudi investment to the Competition Commission on merger grounds. The culture secretary has separately asked the media regulator, Ofcom, to investigate any public interest concerns and report back by mid-August. The Guardian understands this report will be produced regardless of the court ruling. \u2022 This article was amended on 31 July 2019 because while general references were made at the hearing to \u201cnational security\u201d, these were not in relation to this case as an earlier version said. In addition, a reference to the chair\u2019s remarks in response to the government\u2019s delay argument has been included to better reflect the court proceedings.",

If temperatures reach at least 25C for three consecutive days in the majority of the UK, it would be classified as a heatwave.</p> \n<p>The Met Office tweeted that temperatures reached 31C at Heathrow airport at around midday. Although the main concentration of the hot weather will be in central and south-eastern England, it could reach the high 20s in parts of Scotland, where most schools broke up earlier this month.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2019/jul/23/britains-hottest-day-of-the-year-in-pictures\">British bask in the July heat \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The humid conditions are expected to lead to thundery showers across south-west England on Tuesday evening and the early hours of Wednesday morning, which could cause travel delays and power cuts. Scattered patches of lightning, hail and winds are predicted to move north from Tuesday evening, according to the Met Office.</p> \n<p>A yellow severe weather warning covering most of England, Wales, and Scotland began at 6pm on Tuesday and will run until 9am on Wednesday. Public Health England has also renewed warnings about the heat, urging people to keep hydrated, find shade and take protection against the sun. </p> \n<p>Marco Petagna, a Met Office forecaster, said there was the potential for record-breaking temperatures by Thursday evening. He said there was a 60% chance that Thursday\u2019s weather would surpass the July record of 36.7C <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/01/heatwave-hits-heathrow-temperature-airport-flies-past-32c\">set at Heathrow</a> in 2015 and a 30% chance of beating the all-time UK temperature record of 38.5C (101.3F), recorded in Faversham, Kent, in August 2003.</p> \n<p>Petagna said: \u201cOn Thursday, we\u2019ll see an east and west split with showers in the western parts of England but the eastern parts will look very hot with 36 to 37C (96.8F).</p> \n<p>He said the coolest areas would be in western England where temperatures will remain in the 20s, adding that anywhere across England could see some thundery showers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a38f0f29-4edd-426f-9e7f-3706fd5cca1e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Hotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/northern-hemispheres-extreme-heatwave-in-2018-impossible-without-climate-change\">could not have occurred without human-induced climate change</a>\u201d. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was <a href=\"https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/resources/angry-summer-report/\">made at least 50 times more likely by global heating</a>, linking it directly to climate change.</p>\n    <p>Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/27/climate-change-human-fingerprint-found-on-global-extreme-weather\">strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves</a> (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.</p>\n    <p>When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Most of the planet\u2019s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. <a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/another-unprecedented-tropical-cyclone-and-flooding-hits-mozambique\">Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique</a> in March and April. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/global-warming-made-hurricane-harvey-deadly-rains-three-times-more-likely-research-shows\">three times more likely by climate change</a>.

      "bodyText": "Record-breaking temperatures could hit parts of Britain for the rest of the week as the school holidays get under way in much of the country. Temperatures will increase as the week progresses, according to forecasters, from a high of 33C (91.4F) on Tuesday to 34C on Wednesday and rising up to 37C before the end of the week, which would be a July record. If temperatures reach at least 25C for three consecutive days in the majority of the UK, it would be classified as a heatwave. The Met Office tweeted that temperatures reached 31C at Heathrow airport at around midday. Although the main concentration of the hot weather will be in central and south-eastern England, it could reach the high 20s in parts of Scotland, where most schools broke up earlier this month. The humid conditions are expected to lead to thundery showers across south-west England on Tuesday evening and the early hours of Wednesday morning, which could cause travel delays and power cuts. Scattered patches of lightning, hail and winds are predicted to move north from Tuesday evening, according to the Met Office. A yellow severe weather warning covering most of England, Wales, and Scotland began at 6pm on Tuesday and will run until 9am on Wednesday. Public Health England has also renewed warnings about the heat, urging people to keep hydrated, find shade and take protection against the sun. Marco Petagna, a Met Office forecaster, said there was the potential for record-breaking temperatures by Thursday evening. He said there was a 60% chance that Thursday\u2019s weather would surpass the July record of 36.7C set at Heathrow in 2015 and a 30% chance of beating the all-time UK temperature record of 38.5C (101.3F), recorded in Faversham, Kent, in August 2003. Petagna said: \u201cOn Thursday, we\u2019ll see an east and west split with showers in the western parts of England but the eastern parts will look very hot with 36 to 37C (96.8F). He said the coolest areas would be in western England where temperatures will remain in the 20s, adding that anywhere across England could see some thundery showers. Ruth May, the chief nursing officer for England, urged people to check on their neighbours during the warm weather. She said people should take care as temperatures rise, while Asthma UK urged sufferers to keep up their medication. May said: \u201cThe NHS will be there always for anyone who needs it, but everyone can help by checking in on vulnerable friends and neighbours, while making use of the free, convenient and helpful phone and online NHS services for minor illnesses, to help frontline staff provide care for those in emergency and serious need.\u201d A dog welfare charity has advised owners to not leave pets alone in a hot car even for a few minutes. Dogs Trust says on days when the temperature is 22C it could rise by 11C in 10 minutes inside a car and dogs could not cool down the same way as humans. Earlier this week, an American bulldog received treatment after his body temperature soared to a life-threatening 42.2C in Glasgow. Paula Boyden, Dogs Trust\u2019s veterinary director, said: \u201cThere are so many things we can do to make sure our dogs stay happy and healthy in hot weather, but it is crucial we keep a close eye on them, even if we are playing indoors.

Only 12% of people in the UK earn more than \u00a350,000 a year, so this pledge would help those on the highest incomes. Johnson believes, however, that it will appeal to aspirational voters. Some of the giveaway would be clawed back by higher national insurance contributions but the net cost would still be <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14212\">\u00a39bn a year</a>, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d492f6cf-1fda-46ad-a040-347be0393605\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>A cabinet reshuffle</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The first task of any new PM involves rewarding some loyal allies and disappointing more.

If this wasn\u2019t tricky enough, a small but significant section of Tory MPs openly detest Johnson, and will not want to help him out - and with his cabinet sackings, the \u2018Gaukward squad\u2019 of former senior cabinet members set on blocking a no-deal Brexit swelled in ranks.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Loosening the purse strings</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Such was the fiscal largesse on display from both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt during the hustings process that much as he will seek to kick any decisions towards an autumn budget, voters \u2013 especially Tory members \u2013 will be expecting both tax cuts and more spending on areas such as education and the police.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Everything non-Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This might sound glib, but there is a lot to consider \u2013 during the three-plus years of Brexit introversion May\u2019s government failed to properly grasp any of a series of long-term, pressing national problems: the crisis in social care; the future of the NHS; a climate emergency; the increasingly insecure future of work; a broken housing market; rampant poverty, including among many working people. This is a huge workload for any new administration.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Being prime ministerial</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Critics might say this is Johnson\u2019s single biggest challenge. The leadership process has shown that while he endlessly harked back to supposed successes as London mayor \u2013 an often ceremonial role with relatively few powers \u2013 Johnson was notably quieter about his period as foreign secretary.</p>\n    <p>Being prime minister is like the latter, to a factor of 10 \u2013 a never-ending succession of red boxes containing vital documents, of urgent briefings, of a whole system hanging on your decisions. Johnson has a tendency to ignore advice, pluck statistics out of the air and rely on sudden, cheap glibness. Curbing these long habits will be a daily struggle - his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/24/meet-the-new-dude-at-no-10-papers-greet-boris-johnsons-victory\">adopting the acronym 'Dude' in his victory speech</a> shows just how hard it is for him.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterwalker\"><b>Peter Walker</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Political correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>2.

Johnson wants to gradually align the two systems by raising the NICs ceiling to an annual \u00a312,500.

      "bodyText": "Taxes will be cut and public spending increased if Boris Johnson makes good on the pledges he has made in recent weeks while campaigning to be prime minister. In a marked reversal of the fiscal restraint enforced over the past nine years, Johnson has committed himself to a multibillion pound programme of measures paid for by extra government borrowing. The plans \u2013 some of which are sketchy \u2013 will be fleshed out in the autumn budget and a possible three-year Treasury spending review, should the new chancellor choose to have one this year. Johnson\u2019s proposals include: 1. Raising the threshold at which income tax is paid at 40% from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000 Cost: \u00a39bn. Only 12% of people in the UK earn more than \u00a350,000 a year, so this pledge would help those on the highest incomes. Johnson believes, however, that it will appeal to aspirational voters. Some of the giveaway would be clawed back by higher national insurance contributions but the net cost would still be \u00a39bn a year, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). 2. Increasing the starting point for national insurance contributions to \u00a312,500 Cost: \u00a311bn. At present people pay NICs when they earn \u00a3166 a week and income tax when they earn \u00a312,500 a year. Johnson wants to gradually align the two systems by raising the NICs ceiling to an annual \u00a312,500.

Any pledge to be tough on law and order tends to go down well with the Conservative party faithful, and Johnson wooed them during the leadership race with a recruitment policy that will cost \u00a31.1bn a year. 5.

The next prime minister has given no further details of this pledge.

Review HS2 and build HS3 Cost: unknown. So far \u00a34bn has been spent on HS2 \u2013 the high-speed rail project designed to link London to cities in the Midlands and the north.

Given that Boris had had six weeks to write his acceptance speech, you might have expected something more than the usual glib, off-the-cuff bollocks. But Johnson is nothing if not predictably slapdash and he appeared to have dashed it off in a couple of minutes in the back of the car on the way to his coronation.</p> <p>First there was the entirely insincere thanks to Theresa May \u2013 Johnson has spent the last three years plotting her downfall \u2013 then the usual glib stuff about one nation conservatism and governing for the whole country. The promises that every Tory leader makes when they are elected and are never heard of again.</p> <p>Johnson then dissolved into campaign patter. People have said the incoming leader has never faced such daunting problems, he declared. But are you daunted? Silence. Boris looked puzzled. He had expected everyone to shout \u2018No\u2019. Maybe they weren\u2019t quite as stupid as he had always imagined them to be. \u201cYou don\u2019t look daunted to me,\u201d he continued, hesitantly. But they did to everyone else. Some were just beginning to realise they had made a hideous mistake.</p> <p>Then the race to the end. Pifflepafflewifflewaffle. Brexit would be delivered if only everyone closed their eyes and believed. He was going to put the E into the DUD of Deliver, Unite and Defeat, and Energise something or other. Though not the country. Everyone else was busy stockpiling Prozac and Valium. He concluded by saying he would be working flat out. Or two hours a day, whichever was the longer. His ambition is not matched by his work ethic.</p> <p>In one way, though, this had been a remarkable Johnson speech. It had been the first one he\u2019d given for years which hadn\u2019t contained any outright lies. Just the odd half-truth. Mainly because he hadn\u2019t actually really said anything. Still there would be plenty of time to rectify that. The lying could restart tomorrow.</p>",

Given that Boris had had six weeks to write his acceptance speech, you might have expected something more than the usual glib, off-the-cuff bollocks. But Johnson is nothing if not predictably slapdash and he appeared to have dashed it off in a couple of minutes in the back of the car on the way to his coronation. First there was the entirely insincere thanks to Theresa May \u2013 Johnson has spent the last three years plotting her downfall \u2013 then the usual glib stuff about one nation conservatism and governing for the whole country. The promises that every Tory leader makes when they are elected and are never heard of again. Johnson then dissolved into campaign patter. People have said the incoming leader has never faced such daunting problems, he declared. But are you daunted? Silence. Boris looked puzzled. He had expected everyone to shout \u2018No\u2019. Maybe they weren\u2019t quite as stupid as he had always imagined them to be. \u201cYou don\u2019t look daunted to me,\u201d he continued, hesitantly. But they did to everyone else. Some were just beginning to realise they had made a hideous mistake. Then the race to the end. Pifflepafflewifflewaffle. Brexit would be delivered if only everyone closed their eyes and believed. He was going to put the E into the DUD of Deliver, Unite and Defeat, and Energise something or other. Though not the country. Everyone else was busy stockpiling Prozac and Valium. He concluded by saying he would be working flat out. Or two hours a day, whichever was the longer. His ambition is not matched by his work ethic. In one way, though, this had been a remarkable Johnson speech. It had been the first one he\u2019d given for years which hadn\u2019t contained any outright lies. Just the odd half-truth. Mainly because he hadn\u2019t actually really said anything. Still there would be plenty of time to rectify that. The lying could restart tomorrow.",

      "bodyText": "A conservative philosopher has been reappointed to a government commission from which he was sacked when he was judged to have made inflammatory remarks about Chinese people during a magazine interview. Sir Roger Scruton has said that he was misrepresented and made to look as if he was making a \u201cracist slur\u201d about Chinese people following an interview with the New Statesman, which subsequently apologised to him and said that his views were not accurately represented. The academic, who had been chairman of the government\u2019s Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission, has now been appointed as its co-chair by the housing, communities and local government secretary, James Brokenshire. In a letter, he expressed his gratitude for Scruton\u2019s thoughts on what form the re-appointment might take, including a suggestion that he would become a co-chair alongside Nicholas Boys Smith. The minister concluded: \u201cI know that you still have so much more to give and hope this may also help to put things right after the regrettable events of recent months.\u201d Scruton replied that he was pleased that the matter had been resolved, according to correspondence published on Tuesday by the Spectator, which played a key part in the affair when it obtained a recording of the original New Statesman interview with the philosopher. The Spectator turned Scruton\u2019s sacking into a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for conservatives, who insisted quotes in a New Statesman article \u2013 such as: \u201cEach Chinese person is a kind of replica of the next one and that is a very frightening thing\u201d \u2013 were part of a longer discussion by him about the power of the Chinese state to impose its will on citizens, rather than racism. The Conservative leadership candidates, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, had both called for the reinstatement of the 75-year-old writer, who claimed in April that he was the victim of a witch-hunt and an attempt to silence voices such as his. The commission on which he will again serve has been charged with ensuring new housing developments are attractive and engage with, as well as reflect, local communities. Brokenshire said the body\u2019s interim report \u2013 which was presented on 9 July by Boys Smith \u2013 provided an opportunity to consider next steps in finalising recommendations to the government. Scruton told the Guardian that he was \u201cvery glad that this has been resolved, and that I can devote some time to what is one of our most important national problems\u201d. In an apology, the New Statesman said that links to the original article were tweeted out with partial quotations from the interview \u2013 including a truncated version of a quotation regarding China. \u201cWe acknowledge that the views of Professor Scruton were not accurately represented in the tweets to his disadvantage. We apologise for this, and regret any distress that this has caused Sir Roger,\u201d the magazine added.",

Several Johnson loyalists have had their eye on the post of chancellor, but only one can do it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/24/boris-johnson-takes-his-revenge-and-sacks-over-half-the-cabinet\">A complete clearout of May\u2019s remain-minded ministers</a> provided plenty of opportunity to reward the Brexit believers though.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The issue that will define a Johnson premiership. He has promised to rapidly renegotiate almost all of May\u2019s departure deal, ditching the Irish backstop border guarantee policy \u2013 something that would seem a huge task over any timescale, let alone little more than 12 weeks, a fair proportion of which is taken up by a summer break. If this fails, he will be set on a no-deal departure for 31 October, and a likely huge clash with MPs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Iran</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>&nbsp;wasn\u2019t enough, a new Johnson government must immediately take steps to make sure he doesn\u2019t begin his time in No 10 with a slide into war. The situation in the gulf is complex, fast-moving and hugely dangerous. Johnson did not cover himself in glory as foreign secretary, especially over Iran. It will be his task to prove he has learned.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Managing parliament and Tory MPs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Johnson will start as PM with a working Commons majority of four, thanks to the DUP, but within weeks it is likely to be down to three if as expected the Liberal Democrats win in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. If this wasn\u2019t tricky enough, a small but significant section of Tory MPs openly detest Johnson, and will not want to help him out - and with his cabinet sackings, the \u2018Gaukward squad\u2019 of former senior cabinet members set on blocking a no-deal Brexit swelled in ranks.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Loosening the purse strings</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Such was the fiscal largesse on display from both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt during the hustings process that much as he will seek to kick any decisions towards an autumn budget, voters \u2013 especially Tory members \u2013 will be expecting both tax cuts and more spending on areas such as education and the police.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Everything non-Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This might sound glib, but there is a lot to consider \u2013 during the three-plus years of Brexit introversion May\u2019s government failed to properly grasp any of a series of long-term, pressing national problems: the crisis in social care; the future of the NHS; a climate emergency; the increasingly insecure future of work; a broken housing market; rampant poverty, including among many working people. This is a huge workload for any new administration.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Being prime ministerial</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Critics might say this is Johnson\u2019s single biggest challenge. The leadership process has shown that while he endlessly harked back to supposed successes as London mayor \u2013 an often ceremonial role with relatively few powers \u2013 Johnson was notably quieter about his period as foreign secretary.</p>\n    <p>Being prime minister is like the latter, to a factor of 10 \u2013 a never-ending succession of red boxes containing vital documents, of urgent briefings, of a whole system hanging on your decisions. Johnson has a tendency to ignore advice, pluck statistics out of the air and rely on sudden, cheap glibness.

The electoral successes at Holyrood in 2016 and Westminster in 2017 were a result of Davidson\u2019s comprehensive remodelling of the party, subtly changing policy emphasis and bringing in talented individuals who did not fit the traditional Tory mould. Scottish Conservatives are well aware that Johnson does not carry that same message and what a challenge it will be to explain that on the doorstep.</p>",

As one prominent Scottish Tory and Johnson critic put it, watching the leadership results was \u201clike the Trump election or Brexit morning \u2013 we just don\u2019t know which will have the biggest hangover yet\u201d. The tweeted congratulations from Scottish Tory MPs \u2013 the majority of whom backed Johnson \u2013 and MSPs \u2013 who mainly backed Jeremy Hunt \u2013 have uniformly emphasised the importance of safeguarding the UK. Johnson is expected to underline his commitment to the union as he makes one of his first appearances as prime minister on a trip to Scotland over the weekend or early next week after a visit to the pro-Brexit heartland of north-east England later this week. Early in the leadership campaign, Scottish Conservative critics told the Guardian a Johnson premiership would spell \u201ccatastrophe\u201d for the party, boosting support for independence and bolstering Scottish nationalist arguments that Westminster represents only a wealthy, southern elite. A Panelbase poll in the Sunday Times Scotland towards the end of June found support for independence would jump to 53% if Johnson became prime minister, giving the yes campaign a six-point lead. Johnson telephoned the Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, who supported Jeremy Hunt, after first backing Sajid Javid and then Michael Gove, within hours of his win.

After Theresa May used her last speech in Scotland as prime minister to warn her successor of the consequences of a no-deal Brexit for the unity of the UK, Johnson and Hunt both insisted that the union must come first, with Johnson committing to set up a \u201cunion unit\u201d within Downing Street and support more direct funding of projects in Scotland. But senior Scottish Tory insiders are very aware that much depends on the tone Johnson strikes in the coming days and weeks \u2013 \u201cthe clock starts now\u201d said one \u2013 and how effectively he factors Scotland into the \u201cnew spirit of can-do\u201d he promised in his acceptance speech on Tuesday. \u201cSo much of this is down to nuance,\u201d says one senior party source, \u201cand there are lots of ways to get things wrong. The test will be whether he does take advice from people more experienced in Scottish politics. \u201cThe indications are good that he understands he needs to take advice from Ruth Davidson, [current Scottish secretary] David Mundell and colleagues. There is a consciousness of how no deal plays into the hands of the SNP and a preparedness on the part of Scottish Tory MPs to take him at his word.\u201d This follows what was described as a \u201cbusinesslike\u201d and \u201cpositive\u201d meeting last Wednesday between Johnson and 11 out of the 13 Scottish Conservatives at Westminster. Johnson is also known to recognise the importance of the Scottish MPs in terms of parliamentary arithmetic. Colin Clark, the Scottish Tory MP who unseated former SNP leader Alex Salmond in the 2017 election and has been a vocal supporter of Johnson, said the new leader \u201cclearly recognises\u201d that he has 13 Scottish MPs who want to feed into policy decisions and that he was \u201cvery open to hearing ideas\u201d. Clark insisted Johnson\u2019s positivity would win over Scottish Tory doubters. \u201cEnthusiasm is infectious. He will offer a complete contrast to the defeatist, grievance-based politics of the current Scottish government,\u201d he said. Nevertheless, anxieties remain. While elected Tory members may be ready to reset the clock, they remain uncertain about their voters. The electoral successes at Holyrood in 2016 and Westminster in 2017 were a result of Davidson\u2019s comprehensive remodelling of the party, subtly changing policy emphasis and bringing in talented individuals who did not fit the traditional Tory mould. Scottish Conservatives are well aware that Johnson does not carry that same message and what a challenge it will be to explain that on the doorstep.",

She was expected to become a lawyer and join the family law firm, but the pull of the dancefloor proved too strong, and the bar gave way to the cha-cha-cha.</p> <p><strong>And now she\u2019s on Strictly.</strong> She is, but hey, you\u2019re supposed to ask the questions and I\u2019m supposed to answer them.</p> <p><strong>Yeah, but everyone knows. She has been on before, many times. She\u2019s one of the pro dancers, recently with Graeme Swann, the cricketer, and she was runner-up with somebody off Hollyoaks a while back ...</strong> Er, no.</p> <p><strong>The name\u2019s familiar though.</strong> Because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/20/oti-mabuse-dancer-strictly-come-dancing-interview\">you\u2019re thinking of her sister, Oti Mabuse</a>.</p> <p><strong>Oooh, now Motsi\u2019s joining the show, that\u2019s nice, bringing sibling rivalry to the dance floor, a bit of pasa doble trouble ... </strong>Yes, but Motsi\u2019s not going to be dancing</p> <p><strong>Hang on, you said she was also a dancer.</strong> She is, you might know her from being a pro on the German show Let\u2019s Dance. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/22/motsi-mabuse-to-join-strictly-come-dancing-judging-panel\">But for the BBC she\u2019s replacing Darcey Bussell</a> ...</p> <p><strong>As a judge? No way! But isn\u2019t her sister going to be there</strong><strong> as a pro, competing with Huw Edwards or whoever it turns out to be?</strong> Yes. Oti will be judged by her elder sister.</p> <p><strong>That\u2019s terrible, like Jo Johnson turning up at the QEII Centre to find out his brother has been made ... </strong>No, it\u2019s not at all like that, and we don\u2019t want any of them in here, thanks. It\u2019s more like Serena Williams coming out on to the court and finding Venus in the umpire\u2019s chair.</p> <p><strong>Are there any winners?</strong> Serena, almost certainly \u2026 oh I see, in this, no. If Motsi holds up a big fat 10, it will obviously be seen as nepotism. And if it\u2019s a one, it will be because Oti pulled the arm off Motsi\u2019s favourite doll when they were kids in Pretoria or something.</p> <p><strong>I wonder if the Bible has anything to say on the matter?</strong> Not keen, as it happens. From Romans 14:10 \u2013 \u201cYou, then, why do you judge your brother or sister? Or why do you treat them with contempt? For we will all stand before God\u2019s judgment seat.\u201d</p> <p><strong>And Oti, has she anything to say about her </strong><strong>sister coming to judge?</strong> She\u2019s less bothered. She tweeted: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OtiMabuse/status/1153324908337909763\" title=\"\">\u201cYayyyy!!!! Da da da dadada daaaaa- da dada da da\u201d</a>.</p> <p><strong>Do say (as Motsi did):</strong> \u201cI am absolutely overjoyed to be joining the Strictly judging panel.\u201d Actually, don\u2019t \u2013 zzzzz.</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t say: </strong>\u201cThat\u2019s a zero from me, little sis, hahahahaha.\u201d Actually, do.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Name: Motsi Mabuse. Age: 28. From: She was born in Mankwe, a small settlement that was at the time part of the nominal Republic of Bophuthatswana, and was absorbed into South Africa. She\u2019s a dancer? Correct. She was expected to become a lawyer and join the family law firm, but the pull of the dancefloor proved too strong, and the bar gave way to the cha-cha-cha. And now she\u2019s on Strictly. She is, but hey, you\u2019re supposed to ask the questions and I\u2019m supposed to answer them. Yeah, but everyone knows. She has been on before, many times. She\u2019s one of the pro dancers, recently with Graeme Swann, the cricketer, and she was runner-up with somebody off Hollyoaks a while back ... Er, no. The name\u2019s familiar though. Because you\u2019re thinking of her sister, Oti Mabuse. Oooh, now Motsi\u2019s joining the show, that\u2019s nice, bringing sibling rivalry to the dance floor, a bit of pasa doble trouble ... Yes, but Motsi\u2019s not going to be dancing Hang on, you said she was also a dancer. She is, you might know her from being a pro on the German show Let\u2019s Dance. But for the BBC she\u2019s replacing Darcey Bussell ... As a judge? No way! But isn\u2019t her sister going to be there as a pro, competing with Huw Edwards or whoever it turns out to be? Yes. Oti will be judged by her elder sister. That\u2019s terrible, like Jo Johnson turning up at the QEII Centre to find out his brother has been made ... No, it\u2019s not at all like that, and we don\u2019t want any of them in here, thanks. It\u2019s more like Serena Williams coming out on to the court and finding Venus in the umpire\u2019s chair. Are there any winners? Serena, almost certainly \u2026 oh I see, in this, no. If Motsi holds up a big fat 10, it will obviously be seen as nepotism. And if it\u2019s a one, it will be because Oti pulled the arm off Motsi\u2019s favourite doll when they were kids in Pretoria or something. I wonder if the Bible has anything to say on the matter? Not keen, as it happens. From Romans 14:10 \u2013 \u201cYou, then, why do you judge your brother or sister? Or why do you treat them with contempt? For we will all stand before God\u2019s judgment seat.\u201d And Oti, has she anything to say about her sister coming to judge? She\u2019s less bothered. She tweeted: \u201cYayyyy!!!! Da da da dadada daaaaa- da dada da da\u201d. Do say (as Motsi did): \u201cI am absolutely overjoyed to be joining the Strictly judging panel.\u201d Actually, don\u2019t \u2013 zzzzz. Don\u2019t say: \u201cThat\u2019s a zero from me, little sis, hahahahaha.\u201d Actually, do.",

      "bodyText": "And with that, I\u2019m off to immerse myself into an ice bucket. Nick Ames will be here tomorrow to take you through Stage 17. Bye! I have a report for you, leading on the day\u2019s key crashes: Geraint Thomas has described his crash. News in brief: he\u2019s fine: I just had one hand on the bars and then the gears jumped and jammed and I got thrown off my bike on the corner. I knew the race wasn\u2019t, like, on, so it was just get back into the group. It\u2019s just frustrating. Like I say, such a freak thing, but I\u2019m right. The final sprint in full: Here\u2019s Caleb Ewan\u2019s instant reaction: To be honest I felt so bad today during the day. I think the heat really got to me and I was suffering so much and was about to tell Max [Monfort] to go up to the front because I was really suffering. We weren\u2019t in an ideal situation with 1km to go. QuickStep came past and I lost a few more positions. I looked at this finish at the start of the day and I played all the scenarios in my head and one of them was if I was too far back. I think if you watch it I really take a run at it and start sprinting before the rest of the guys, and it worked. It\u2019s a dream to be here. It was such a big dream to win one stage and now I\u2019ve won two. I can\u2019t believe it. Here\u2019s today\u2019s top 10: The Australian Caleb Ewan takes it on the line, steaming through to take it from Elia Viviani! Fantastic acceleration over the last 100m to come from eighth to first! 1km to go: Peter Sagan and Edvald Boasson Hagen both well placed, but this is anyone\u2019s stage. 2km to go: And it\u2019s all over for the fab five. They led for 167km, but they\u2019ve been consumed by the gaggle now. 3km to go: Still a 10sec advantage for the front five, but they have just turned into a headwind. 4km to go: Another minor crash, involving Ben King and Reinhardt Janse von Rensburg of Dimension Data. Neither looks seriously harmed. 8km to go: The fab five are going to be gobbled up any time now. Their advantage has been halved in the space of a couple of minutes, to 10 seconds now. 10km to go: Into the final stages, and 2.5km until they enter Nimes. The peloton can see the front five now, but are still 20sec behind. 13km to go: Apparently Fuglsang injured his shoulder, but there has been no confirmmation from Astana. 14km to go: The peloton has closed the gap to a mere 20sec. 15km to go: There are four Jumbo-Visma riders at the front of the peloton. Tony Martin has just had a go, and now dropped back. 17km to go: The same five riders have now been leading the field for more than 150km. They are currently 45sec ahead of the peloton. 21km to go: This is how his race ended, walking slowly away from the action. So little action on this stage, but still two of the GC contenders have fallen, and one has abandoned. 23km to go: And that is now confirmed: Fuglsang, ninth in the GC this morning, has abandoned. 25km to go: Unlike Thomas earlier, Fuglsang hasn\u2019t just hopped up and remounted. He\u2019s taken off his helmet and is being ushered towards a doctor, so he\u2019s walking, but it looks like his Tour might be over. 27kmm to go: Crash! There\u2019s a rider on the ground, and it\u2019s Jakob Fuglsang! This time a few others were also involved: Cees Bowl is there, and most of the Astana team seem to have stayed behind with Fuglsang. 28km to go: It\u2019s 37C in Uz\u00e8s. Proper baking. 30km to go: Here, courtesy of Eurosport, is Sir Brad\u2019s guide to the closing sprint. 31km to go: The peloton reaches Arpaillargues-et-Aureillac. Arpaillargues was almost certainly named by someone who was having dental treatment at the time. 37km to go: They\u2019re going at 57kmh currently, rocketing towards Uz\u00e8s. 45km to go: There has clearly been a collective decision to make this potentially troublesome and dramatic section as serene as possible. The fab five have stretched their lead back out to about 50sec, and everybody is basically trying to work out how soon they immerse themselves in a body of cool water. 51km to go: There has been no great crosswind-related drama, but the peloton has quickened and the front five\u2019s cushion has deflated to a mere 25ec. 52km to go: The peloton has just turned left, into the crosswind section. Ineos have four riders at the front. Meanwhile, I promise I\u2019ll stop bleating on about these sheep now, but the commentary is very much a classic of its ilk: 55km to go: It is apparently absolutely roasting in the Gard, and very much a day for squirting water through your helmet. 57km to go: The section identified before the start as key, with its potentially intrigue-inducing crosswinds, is about to start. The fab five are still about a minute up the road. 58km to go: And so to L\u00e9dignan, which seems an interesting spot. A couple of previous mentions in the Guardian include one report on the 1851 French coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. \u201cA vast number [of people, obviously] assembled at the rendezvous near Nismes, [sic]\u201d we wrote. \u201cWhen they were about to march upon the town, intelligence reached them that the troops and National Guard were on foot, and prepared to resist them, whereupon the leaders fled and their followers dispersed, after many acts of pillage of property and arms. The same scenes of plunder took place in several of the towns of the district. At Auduze, the authorities were treated with violence, and at L\u00e9dignan the barracks of the gendarmerie were burned to the ground.\u201d Meanwhile in September 1899 when Alfred Dreyfus was found guilty of treason, \u201cthe Municipal Council of L\u00e9dignan decided to christen a street in their commune, hitherto known as the Rue de la Republique, the Rue Alfred Dreyfus.\u201d This is commendable, though I can find no evidence of such a road still existing. 59km to go: Those sheep in full: 62km to go: The helicopters film a hilariously bad attempt to make lots of sheep with yellow-dyed wool fill a vaguely shirty shape. The only problem is that when the helicopters arrive none of the sheep are in position, plus their wool isn\u2019t really very yellow, plus they need at least five times as many sheep to fill their shirty shape. 68km to go: The fab five\u2019s lead is dropping fast, and is now but a mere 50sec. Not that it was ever particularly daunting. 71km to go: The leaders go through Anduze, which is apparently known for its zinc smelting. It also has a clock tower that dates to 1588. 73km to go: There has been precisely to change to the race situation since about 180 seconds after the flag was waved. The same five riders lead, with a gap of about 1min 20sec. 84km to go: Helicopter cameras linger lovingly on the Terril de Rochebelle, an odd-looking pimple on a hillside. According to my in-depth research, it is an \u201c old-fashioned slag heap\u201d. 87km to go: There is a category four climb up the C\u00f4te de Saint-Jean-du-Pin upcoming. They\u2019re about 6km from the summit already, and the leading five still/once again lead by 1min 20sec. 99km to go: Into the last 100km. Nearly there, guys! Meanwhile I\u2019ve been researching all the places on the route over the next 30km or so, trying to find things I can be sarcastic about, but there\u2019s literally nothing to say about any of them. 102km to go: The full results of that intermediate sprint: 105km to go: \u201cAs a serious cyclist, over 11,000 kms this year and two sportives wins, Thomas is my favourite rider,\u201d writes Keith Aitchison, \u201cbut only he can do this.\u201d 109km to go: The sprint has been sprinted. Lars Bak pocketed the maximum 20 points. 112km to go: The leading five currently have a lead of 1min 20sec over the peloton, though the gap has been expanding and contracting like an overused accordion. 115km to go: A snippet of cycling news: the Telegraph is reporting that Mark Cavendish, who was controversially left out of Dimension Data\u2019s team for the Tour, will ride the Adriatica Ionica, which starts on Thursday. 120km to go: \u201cAny theories on why G seems to fall off more than anyone else? Maybe he doesn\u2019t, it just seems that way,\u201d writes someone on Twitter. I can, I\u2019m afraid, offer few insights into Thomas\u2019s propensity to topple. I did speak to him once, mainly about yoghurt. 124km to go: Now Thomas is leaning on a team car, getting some water squirted down his grazed left leg. \u201cI live near Uz\u00e8s and work in N\u00eemes so of course I have managed to be in Paris today, and it\u2019s even hotter here,\u201d sniffs Lizz Poulter. \u201cAnyway, to explain Ed\u2019s query, they have reopened a closed railway line especially for today\u2019s stage. I\u2019m not sure you can say N\u00eemes has a famous bridge - technically the Pont du Gard is between Remoulins and Vers Pont du Gard where the quarry that provided the stone for the Pont is still exploited today. Apologies if you\u2019re getting all this from the TV - I\u2019m enjoying a falafel in a hummous restaurant. It\u2019s great, thanks for asking.\u201d 125km to go: Thomas has now rejoined the main group, though it\u2019s a long and straggly one. 126 km to go: Thomas has some scrapes on his left arm, but seems otherwise unharmed. 128km to go: It looks like Thomas\u2019s front wheel might have just clipped the kerb on a bend, causing him to fall. No other riders were involved. He hopped up and assessed his bike, deciding it wasn\u2019t worth persevering with, and waited a short while until a replacement was proffered. Jonathan Castroviejo and Dylan van Baarle have hung back to help lead him back to the peloton. 130km to go: There is now a little under 20km to go before the day\u2019s intermediate sprint, at Vallerargues. And Geraint Thomas is off his bike! 138km to go: The same five are still at the front, with a lead now just above 2min. 142km to go: That\u2019s a big tick in the Pont du Gard photo box. 144km to go: The leaders will soon reach Pouzilhac. Most mentions of Pouzilhac in the Guardian\u2019s archive concern the business Alain du Pouzilhac, who wasn\u2019t actually from Pouzilhac. They have extended their lead back up to 1min 35sec. 149km to go: Ed emails. He has taken a train from Remoulins station. The only sentence on the English-language Wikipedia page isn\u2019t even accurate. 150km to go: The leading five are now just 1min 9sec ahead of the peloton. The big-name sprinters will be too keen on winning this stage to let any breakaway steal their glory. 151km to go: \u201cPresumably The Guardian called it Nismes back in 1853 because they didn\u2019t have a keyboard option to add a circumflex,\u201d suggests Drew Goldie, which seems a very sensible deduction. There is a Nismes in Belgium, but it doesn\u2019t have a famous pont. 153km to go: The peloton has just crossed the Pont du Gard. Photo opportunity alert! 158km to go: The leaders\u2019 lead is now at 90sec. The peloton appears entirely unbothered about this. 160km to go: The leaders near Remoulins. The Wikipedia entry for Remoulins contains only one piece of information: \u201cRemoulins has a train station. However, no passenger trains are currently scheduled to stop there.\u201d 166km to go: The leading five have opened up a gap just north of 50sec on the pack, who seem entirely unbothered and are coasting along at a fairly gentle pace. 168km to go: Literally as I press send on that they\u2019re caught by the other three, Lars Bak, Paul Ourselin and Lukasz Wi\u015bniowski. 170km to go: There has been a near-instant breakaway of five, of whom two - St\u00e9phane Rossetto and Alexis Gougeard- have a slight lead. 171km to go: True fact: the first mention of the Pont du Gard in the Guardian was in 1853, when we were describing some of the highlights of a collection of \u201cmedals, badges an carvings\u201d owned by a Dr Harrison, which included \u201ca model finely executed in cork of the Roman aqueduct near Nismes [sic], called the Pont du Gard\u201d. 174km to go: The yellow flag has been waved, and it\u2019s go go go! The race start has been postponed, apparently because Alexander Kristoff has a flat tyre. We\u2019re in prime Brits-on-holiday territory here: the Pont du Gard, the very lovely market town of Uzes, Nimes itself, all stuffed full of pink-wine-sipping Brits of a summer. It\u2019s perhaps not the most characterful stage, but for many of us following from afar it\u2019ll be packed with memories. During the rollout and before the full-blooded action, you might want to watch this here video: And action! Apparently the 28km stretch from Aigremont to Uzes towards the end of the stage, when riders will have to deal with testy crosswinds, will be key. That\u2019s about 120km from the start. The riders are gathered at the start, ready for action. Geraint Thomas has a chat: We\u2019re aware of it [the possibility of high winds near the finish], just need to play it by ear really, see how strong it is in the final. I think the main thing is just keep riding as we have been, attentive and at the front and ready for anything. The main thing is just to drink plenty all the time. Some of the boys will be going back and forth to the car a bit more than normal today. Today\u2019s weather forecast for Nimes: 35C and non-stop sunshine, but at least a bit of a breeze. Just the 177km to go. What a job that is, patrolling the streets of France turning penises into aliens and random, unrecognisable shapes. We should be under way in about quarter of an hour. In the meantime, I\u2019m just checking you\u2019ve all seen this: Before the storm, something of a calm, though this stage will be ridden out in utterly blistering heat. No matter how you cut it, riding out in temperatures of 34 degrees in the shade is not the most ideal preparation for three days in the high mountains. The Alps approach, where the destiny of flagging Julian Alaphilippe will be decided. And in truth, if France want to end that 34-year drought, then Thibaut Pinot looks the best hope. A lack of wind means that today\u2019s stage is unlikely to produce the echelons that pegged Pinot back on the tenth stage, and so none of the favourites are likely to haul in time. So, to the sprinters, who have feasted on only the slimmest of pickings this year. Were the likes of Peter Sagan, Elia Viviani, Dylan Groenewegen, Caleb Ewan and Alexander Kristoff able to rest up on Monday? It\u2019s six days since the last sprint stage and much will depend on how the heavier brethren have survived the Pyrenees, which sprinters are still there and which of their lead-out men. Following the rest day, a second day\u2019s respite for the overall contenders, as long as the weather plays ball and there is no wind or rain. This stage is out and home rather than the usual place to place so the changes of direction could make for an gruesome day if there is a strong northerly, as we saw in this area in 2016. In such conditions one favourite thrives: Geraint Thomas.",

      "body": "<p>The Liberal Democrats are back, or so we\u2019re told, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/22/jo-swinson-elected-new-lib-dem-leader?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\" title=\"\">Jo Swinson\u2019s leadership victory </a>being pitched as the rebirth of the party. The unique conditions of Brexit have given the Lib Dems not only a reason to exist but the opportunity to detoxify their brand after their fatal coalition with the Conservatives, and to cast themselves as a reforming, progressive party in troubled times.</p> <p>And yet remarkably little has changed since the days when <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8678370.stm\" title=\"\">Nick Clegg stood laughing in the Downing Street rose garden</a> next to David Cameron as he signed Britain up to years of sweeping public spending cuts. When asked throughout this summer\u2019s leadership campaign, Swinson (and her opponent, Ed Davey) consistently defended her party\u2019s role in austerity measures. In an interview with Channel 4 News, Swinson said she had no regrets about the coalition, stating it was the right move \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/channel4news/status/1134464489280196615?s=21\" title=\"\">to get our country back on track</a>\u201d. This is despite the fact it has been shown that austerity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/21/uk-economy-100bn-smaller-because-of-austerity-thinktank\" title=\"\">shrunk the British economy</a> by \u00a3100bn, and has even been linked to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/01/perfect-storm-austerity-behind-130000-deaths-uk-ippr-report\" title=\"\">130,000 preventable deaths</a>. Swinson acknowledged \u201cthere were policies we let through [in coalition] that we shouldn\u2019t have done\u201d, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/channel4news/status/1145730434661310466?s=21\" title=\"\">naming the bedroom tax</a>, but remained unrepentant on a whole host of others.</p> <p>Instead, Swinson repeatedly claims credit for the Lib Dems being a moderating influence on the Tories. They may well have helped to rein in the Conservatives on some things (the party is said to have forced George Osborne to temporarily shelve child tax credit cuts) but this fundamentally misses the point: the Lib Dems weren\u2019t coerced into the partnership, they voluntarily chose it, and as such were a reason every Tory cut that was passed was possible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5486ad44b82526735625695a14e4862e2df85ad0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5486ad44b82526735625695a14e4862e2df85ad0/0_69_2144_1286/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says the party was a moderating influence on the Tories.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says the party was a moderating influence on the Tories.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This isn\u2019t about holding grudges or some sort of ideological purity. Political parties naturally evolve depending on the political times, and progress in policy positions should be credited. It was four years ago this week that the Labour party adopted its abysmal abstention strategy for key <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/20/corbyn-becomes-only-labour-leadership-candidate-to-vote-against-welfare-bill\" title=\"\">\u201cwelfare reform</a>\u201d, but the party has since wrestled internally to have the strong anti-austerity message it holds today, winning back support in the process.</p> <p>The same cannot be said for the Lib Dems. This is a party that as recently as last year spoke of sacrificing some of the poorest people in society to benefit sanctions in exchange <a href=\"https://www.libdemvoice.org/a-mistake-from-the-coalition-years-that-we-never-repeat-57482.html\" title=\"\">for a 5p tax on plastic bags</a> while in coalition. Nor are their MPs against forming a pact with the Tories again, with Swinson simply ruling out joining forces with <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/jo-swinson-could-lead-lib-17312883.amp\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson or any Brexiteer</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/apr/29/the-austerity-delusion\">The austerity delusion | Paul Krugman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Swinson, for her part, could hardly be called a fully progressive figure.

      "bodyText": "The Liberal Democrats are back, or so we\u2019re told, with Jo Swinson\u2019s leadership victory being pitched as the rebirth of the party. The unique conditions of Brexit have given the Lib Dems not only a reason to exist but the opportunity to detoxify their brand after their fatal coalition with the Conservatives, and to cast themselves as a reforming, progressive party in troubled times. And yet remarkably little has changed since the days when Nick Clegg stood laughing in the Downing Street rose garden next to David Cameron as he signed Britain up to years of sweeping public spending cuts. When asked throughout this summer\u2019s leadership campaign, Swinson (and her opponent, Ed Davey) consistently defended her party\u2019s role in austerity measures. In an interview with Channel 4 News, Swinson said she had no regrets about the coalition, stating it was the right move \u201cto get our country back on track\u201d. This is despite the fact it has been shown that austerity shrunk the British economy by \u00a3100bn, and has even been linked to 130,000 preventable deaths. Swinson acknowledged \u201cthere were policies we let through [in coalition] that we shouldn\u2019t have done\u201d, naming the bedroom tax, but remained unrepentant on a whole host of others. Instead, Swinson repeatedly claims credit for the Lib Dems being a moderating influence on the Tories. They may well have helped to rein in the Conservatives on some things (the party is said to have forced George Osborne to temporarily shelve child tax credit cuts) but this fundamentally misses the point: the Lib Dems weren\u2019t coerced into the partnership, they voluntarily chose it, and as such were a reason every Tory cut that was passed was possible. This isn\u2019t about holding grudges or some sort of ideological purity. Political parties naturally evolve depending on the political times, and progress in policy positions should be credited. It was four years ago this week that the Labour party adopted its abysmal abstention strategy for key \u201cwelfare reform\u201d, but the party has since wrestled internally to have the strong anti-austerity message it holds today, winning back support in the process. The same cannot be said for the Lib Dems. This is a party that as recently as last year spoke of sacrificing some of the poorest people in society to benefit sanctions in exchange for a 5p tax on plastic bags while in coalition. Nor are their MPs against forming a pact with the Tories again, with Swinson simply ruling out joining forces with Boris Johnson or any Brexiteer. Swinson, for her part, could hardly be called a fully progressive figure. As employment minister, she reversed workers\u2019 rights by introducing charges of up to \u00a31,200 for the privilege of attending an employment tribunal (a move later ruled unlawful by the supreme court) and even considered cutting the minimum wage, all at a time when workers faced an unprecedented squeeze. There is a sense in some circles that disabled people and working-class families should \u201cget over it\u201d; that those who can\u2019t summon optimism for the revived Lib Dems are too tribal, irrational, or stuck in the past. But this insultingly dismisses the scale of suffering austerity has caused \u2013 typically by commentators who have never experienced the pain themselves \u2013 and recasts it as a historical slight. Go to your closed local Sure Start centre or try to get your elderly mother a social care package and this all seems ever-present news. Similarly, it\u2019s often inferred that compared with Brexit, cuts to services are insignificant. The danger of no-deal Brexit is real and this will hit the poorest hardest.

Guaid\u00f3 swore himself in as president in January, but although he counts on the backing of the US and dozens of other western states, he has been unable to force Maduro from power, and public support for his campaign has run into headwinds. \u201cPopular sentiment goes against politicians that cannot resolve the country\u2019s problems,\u201d said Dimitris Pantoulas, an analyst. \u201cThat goes for the whole political class.\u201d Guaid\u00f3 is set to hold a rally on Tuesday morning in Caracas, where he is likely to address the blackouts. \u201cThey tried to hide the tragedy by rationing supplies across the country, but their failure is evident,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 tweeted on Monday night. \u201cThey destroyed the system and they don\u2019t have answers.\u201d",

Their peaceful protest turned bloody when Manchester magistrates ordered Yeoman \u2013 a private militia paid for by rich locals \u2013 to storm the crowd with sabres.</p>\n    <p>Most historians agree that 14 people were definitely killed in the massacre \u2013 15 if you include the unborn child of Elizabeth Gaunt, killed in the womb after she was beaten by constables in custody. A further three named people are believed to have either been stabbed or trampled to death.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is it called Peterloo?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The name was first coined five days after the massacre by James Wroe, editor of the Manchester Observer, the city\u2019s first radical newspaper (no relation to the Observer of today). According to historian Robert Poole, Peterloo was \u201ca bitter pun, comparing the cowardly attacks by the Yeomanry and soldiers on unarmed civilians to the brutality suffered at Waterloo.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What did the protesters want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>They wanted political reform. The years leading up to Peterloo had been tough for working class people and they wanted a voice in parliament to put their needs and wants on the political agenda, inspired by the French Revolution across the Channel. Machines had begun to take jobs in the lucrative cotton industry but periodic trade slumps closed factories at short notice, putting workers out on the street. The Napoleonic Wars, which ended in 1815 with the Battle of Waterloo, had taken a heavy toll on the nation\u2019s finances, and 350,000 ex-servicemen returned home needing jobs and food. Yet those in power seemed more interested in lining their own pockets than helping the poor.</p>\n    <p>At that point, only the richest landowners could vote, and large swathes of the country were not represented in Westminster. Manchester and Salford, which then had a population of 150,000, had no MP, yet Oxford and Cambridge Universities had their own representation. At the time the extension of the vote to all men, let alone women, was actively opposed by many who thought the vote should be restricted to those of influence and means.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is Peterloo important?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It paved the way for parliamentary democracy and particularly the Great Reform Act of 1832 which created new parliamentary seats, particularly in the industrial towns of the north of England. It also led to the establishment two years later of the Manchester Guardian by John Edward Taylor, a 28-year-old English journalist who was present at the massacre and saw how the \u201cestablishment\u201d media sought to discredit the protesters.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/helenpidd\"><b>Helen Pidd</b></a>, <i>North of England editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Free tickets will be released on 25 July for three performances on the day, in which visitors can play their part by reading from scripted lines printed onto entry wristbands.</p> \n<p>At 1.30pm \u2013 the time the cavalry charged the crowd 200 years ago \u2013 the annual reading of the names will take place, while musicians Streetwise Opera, Aziz Ibrahim and Commoners Choir will perform throughout the day.</p> \n<p>Karen Shannon, the head of the charity Manchester Histories, says: \u201cThe Peterloo massacre is a globally significant milestone in the history of democracy that also set Manchester\u2019s path as a radical city of progress, change and where equality is championed.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Peterloo massacre <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/16/a-mission-for-journalism-in-a-time-of-crisis\">led to the establishment of the Guardian</a>, after reporter John Edward Taylor correctly feared that without the account of a journalist on the scene, Londoners would get only the official version of events, which would protect the magistrates who had caused the bloodshed.</p> \n<p>After reporting doggedly on the protests for months in the massacre\u2019s aftermath, Taylor founded the Manchester Guardian in 1821.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government has been taken to court over its decision to deny European citizens the right to access data the Home Office holds on individuals in immigration cases. In a high court judicial review, campaigners for EU citizens allege that a clause in the Data Protection Act 2018 unlawfully excludes them from rights they would otherwise hold to access private data held by third parties. It emerged during the hearing that 60% of the requests for disclosure of data held by the government have been denied since the beginning of 2019 using these powers, leaving migrant workers and others unable to appeal Home Office decisions. Law firm Leigh Day, acting for the activist group the3million and the Open Rights Group, which brought the case, said the exemption affects 3.6 million EU citizens living in the UK who will have to apply for new immigration status after Brexit. Lawyers for the Home Office argue that the exemption is compatible with EU data regulations and charter rights. But solicitor Rosa Curling of Leigh Day said it was discriminatory and a breach of EU law. \u201cThe discriminatory, two-tier data protection regime created by our government is unlawful and we hope the court will agree it must be reconsidered on an urgent basis. \u201cIndividuals must have access to their personal data so they know what information is held about them by the Home Office and others, how this information is being processed and shared and to allow them to correct any errors made. \u201cWithout access to the data, their right to rectify is meaningless.\u201d By blocking access to data, the groups argue that mistakes by the Home Office will go unchecked and decisions about an individual\u2019s immigration status \u201ccould be made based on incorrect or incomplete information and it could even lead to wrongful deportations\u201d. \u201cThis is of particular concern given that the chief inspector of borders and immigration has acknowledged the Home Office has a 10% error rate in immigration status checks,\u201d they said. EU citizens in the UK are affected by the new data laws because they must go through an application for a category of immigration post-Brexit called settled status. As the law stands, an EU citizen whose application for settled status is rejected will not have the opportunity to establish if it is because of erroneous information or incomplete information held by the Home Office, says the3million. \u201cData protection rights have proven vital to avoid miscarriages of justice in the immigration context [and] that importance will only increase as the immigration system becomes more dependent on automated analysis and profiling of data,\u201d lawyers said in a submission to the high court. They argue that the immigration exemption in the data act was discriminatory and contrary to the circumstances set out under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) legislation under which member states could derogate from the law. Lawyers noted that the only right left untouched by the immigration exemption was the right of a citizen to correct incorrect date. This, they said, was meaningless given they could not access the data in the first place. Matthew Rice, Scotland director at the Open Rights group, said the implications of the exemption could be far reaching. \u201cThe immigration exemption removes that right [to access private data] for millions of people for the vague purpose of effective immigration control. This restriction is available to all data controllers, it could be your school, your Doctor, your local authority or your employer that exercise the exemption and restricts your access to your data while continuing to share it with the Government for immigration enforcement.\u201d",

They\u2019ve shaken hands, signed autographs, and posed for selfies with disingenuous fixed grins across their bored faces like the best of them. They\u2019ve done their bit. And yet it wasn\u2019t enough for some irate hack from Chinese state news agency Xinhua, who accused City of a \u201clack of enthusiasm\u201d, \u201cindifferent treatment\u201d and \u201cutter disrespect\u201d in contrast to fellow forelock-tugging Premier League Asia Trophy competitors Wolves, West Ham and Newcastle. A PR disaster for City, because finding yourself ranked below an organisation run by Mike Ashley is never a good look. And this is the best press Ashley has received for years and years, since that time it was claimed he threw up in a pub fireplace. (It\u2019s all relative. He doesn\u2019t get much good press.)</p> <p>But City are fighting back. Pep Guardiola \u2013 accused by Xinhua of blanking fans \u201cwithout breaking stride and with eyes fixed on the empty space ahead of him, shielded by his two heavies\u201d \u2013 today strenuously denied the allegations. \u201cI should say I don\u2019t agree and also that it\u2019s false. I can\u2019t understand what people are saying \u2013 maybe one journalist is a bit upset, I don\u2019t know why. But it\u2019s far away from the reality. We had an incredible time in Shanghai. We were committed to the cooperation you have to do.\u201d City will hope his statement puts an end to this unfortunate row, and that the historical comparison with Burnley 1960 ends here. Because a few months later, Clarets boss Potts found himself being manhandled off the pitch by gendarmes and pelted with stones during a Big Cup tie in Reims, after squabbling with opposition players over the positioning of a free-kick. All very unbecoming. Although given City\u2019s ambivalent relationship with Europe, their fans may quite enjoy witnessing something similar to that.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cThey need a holiday.

And this is the best press Ashley has received for years and years, since that time it was claimed he threw up in a pub fireplace. (It\u2019s all relative. He doesn\u2019t get much good press.) But City are fighting back. Pep Guardiola \u2013 accused by Xinhua of blanking fans \u201cwithout breaking stride and with eyes fixed on the empty space ahead of him, shielded by his two heavies\u201d \u2013 today strenuously denied the allegations. \u201cI should say I don\u2019t agree and also that it\u2019s false. I can\u2019t understand what people are saying \u2013 maybe one journalist is a bit upset, I don\u2019t know why. But it\u2019s far away from the reality. We had an incredible time in Shanghai. We were committed to the cooperation you have to do.\u201d City will hope his statement puts an end to this unfortunate row, and that the historical comparison with Burnley 1960 ends here. Because a few months later, Clarets boss Potts found himself being manhandled off the pitch by gendarmes and pelted with stones during a Big Cup tie in Reims, after squabbling with opposition players over the positioning of a free-kick. All very unbecoming. Although given City\u2019s ambivalent relationship with Europe, their fans may quite enjoy witnessing something similar to that. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThey need a holiday.

The apparent abnormalities might have pre-dated the attacks, they said, and could have more mundane explanations such as anxiety or depression. One said the study did not meet the usual standards for publication.</p> <p>Dozens of staff at the US embassy in Havana were treated for a range of medical complaints from headaches, dizziness and problems with sleep to difficulties in concentration, balance, vision and hearing in a wave of illness that struck staff and their families between late 2016 and May 2018.</p> <p>Many described falling ill in their homes or hotels after hearing penetrating noises described variously as grinding, cicada-like chirps or the buffeting caused by an open window in a car, prompting speculation that the diplomats were victims of an acoustic attack.</p> <p>While the US government withdrew half of its Havana staff, issued a travel warning and expelled more than a dozen Cubans over the incident, the sonic weapon theory was largely discredited when the FBI found no evidence for such an attack and scientists matched an audio recording of the offending sound to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/06/sonic-attack-on-us-embassy-in-havana-could-have-been-crickets-say-scientists\">call of the Indies short-tailed cricket</a>. The prospect of another type of mystery weapon has not been discounted, however.</p> <p>The brain scan study follows on from medical tests that the University of Pennsylvania doctors published last year. <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2673168\">Those tests</a> concluded that the US staff had suffered concussion-like brain damage, but the findings were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/14/cuban-acoustic-attack-report-on-us-diplomats-flawed-say-neurologists\">heavily criticised by neurologists and other brain specialists</a> who described major flaws in the work.</p> <p>For the latest study, published in the <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2738552?guestAccessKey=47486c47-c01c-47fa-8b6e-41fc69f29cf4&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=072319\">Journal of the American Medical Association</a>, doctors compared brain scans taken from the US employees after they fell ill with scans from two control groups of healthy individuals. The US embassy staff had less white matter, on average, with 542cc compared with 569cc in the controls. They also had evidence of lowered connectivity in brain subnetworks that process sound and vision.</p> <p>Further scans looked for problems at the microscopic level. When the brain is injured and nerve cells die, the damage can show up in scanners that measure how water diffuses around the brain. More damage tends to increase diffusivity, because there is less nerve structure penning the water in. It also reduces the tendency for water to flow in particular directions, a measure called fractional anisotropy, because the nerve fibres that normally channel the flow have deteriorated.</p> <p>Here the results were baffling. The diplomats\u2019 brains showed the opposite of what is seen with brain damage. Instead of rising, diffusivity fell in a region called the vermis, which handles visual and auditory signals. And instead of falling, fractional anisotropy in the region rose. Verma suspects the results are due to a drop in water content in the diplomats\u2019 brains, but admits this is speculation. \u201cFor now all we can say is that something happened and these people should be followed up with more imaging,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Prof Paul Matthews, head of brain sciences at Imperial College London, was not impressed with the work and pointed at a number of important shortcomings. \u201cThis paper would not meet usual standards for publication, particularly in a high-profile journal, were it not for the topicality of the findings,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe differences are small, they do not correspond to known patterns of brain injury and could not be shown to have changed in the people before and after the exposure,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cThere is little that one can conclude from what is presented: does it suggest that the people who were susceptible to the symptoms were more likely to have brains with these characteristics from the start or was there some unknown \u2013 and difficult to conceive \u2013 effect of the \u2018directional phenomenon\u2019 that changed their brains? The mystery remains unsolved.\u201d</p> <p>Heidi Johansen-Berg, the director of the Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging at Oxford University, said the differences in the patients\u2019 brains were not clear cut. It was impossible to say whether they were linked to a particular event, the precise pattern of changes was difficult to explain and it was not clear if or how they related to the patients\u2019 symptoms, she said. \u201cThis is an important study given how little is known about the exposure that these individuals might have experienced. However, the uniqueness of the exposure and the population make it impossible to gain clear answers on whether the potential exposure resulted in brain change,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Prof Ray Dolan, the director of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at University College London, was similarly cautious. \u201cGiven what we know about functional specialisation in the brain one would expect meaningful relationships between the severity of specific deficits and the degree of change in brain regions that mediate specific functions. For example, if there were subjects with severe memory impairment one might expect a relationship with changes in the hippocampus. The report is silent on this,\u201d he said. \u201cI would take the findings with a pinch of salt.\u201d</p> <p>Dr David Silbersweig, the chairman of psychiatry at Brigham &amp; Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, said one problem was that the scans were taken for medical reasons rather than research, where the data would be higher quality. \u201cA next study with research scans rather than clinical scans, and with some additional controls, is something that would be helpful as a next step to continue to try to get to the bottom of this.\u201d</p>",

Dozens of staff at the US embassy in Havana were treated for a range of medical complaints from headaches, dizziness and problems with sleep to difficulties in concentration, balance, vision and hearing in a wave of illness that struck staff and their families between late 2016 and May 2018. Many described falling ill in their homes or hotels after hearing penetrating noises described variously as grinding, cicada-like chirps or the buffeting caused by an open window in a car, prompting speculation that the diplomats were victims of an acoustic attack. While the US government withdrew half of its Havana staff, issued a travel warning and expelled more than a dozen Cubans over the incident, the sonic weapon theory was largely discredited when the FBI found no evidence for such an attack and scientists matched an audio recording of the offending sound to the call of the Indies short-tailed cricket. The prospect of another type of mystery weapon has not been discounted, however. The brain scan study follows on from medical tests that the University of Pennsylvania doctors published last year. Those tests concluded that the US staff had suffered concussion-like brain damage, but the findings were heavily criticised by neurologists and other brain specialists who described major flaws in the work. For the latest study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, doctors compared brain scans taken from the US employees after they fell ill with scans from two control groups of healthy individuals. The US embassy staff had less white matter, on average, with 542cc compared with 569cc in the controls. They also had evidence of lowered connectivity in brain subnetworks that process sound and vision. Further scans looked for problems at the microscopic level. When the brain is injured and nerve cells die, the damage can show up in scanners that measure how water diffuses around the brain. More damage tends to increase diffusivity, because there is less nerve structure penning the water in. It also reduces the tendency for water to flow in particular directions, a measure called fractional anisotropy, because the nerve fibres that normally channel the flow have deteriorated. Here the results were baffling. The diplomats\u2019 brains showed the opposite of what is seen with brain damage. Instead of rising, diffusivity fell in a region called the vermis, which handles visual and auditory signals. And instead of falling, fractional anisotropy in the region rose. Verma suspects the results are due to a drop in water content in the diplomats\u2019 brains, but admits this is speculation. \u201cFor now all we can say is that something happened and these people should be followed up with more imaging,\u201d she said. Prof Paul Matthews, head of brain sciences at Imperial College London, was not impressed with the work and pointed at a number of important shortcomings. \u201cThis paper would not meet usual standards for publication, particularly in a high-profile journal, were it not for the topicality of the findings,\u201d he said. \u201cThe differences are small, they do not correspond to known patterns of brain injury and could not be shown to have changed in the people before and after the exposure,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cThere is little that one can conclude from what is presented: does it suggest that the people who were susceptible to the symptoms were more likely to have brains with these characteristics from the start or was there some unknown \u2013 and difficult to conceive \u2013 effect of the \u2018directional phenomenon\u2019 that changed their brains? The mystery remains unsolved.\u201d Heidi Johansen-Berg, the director of the Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging at Oxford University, said the differences in the patients\u2019 brains were not clear cut. It was impossible to say whether they were linked to a particular event, the precise pattern of changes was difficult to explain and it was not clear if or how they related to the patients\u2019 symptoms, she said. \u201cThis is an important study given how little is known about the exposure that these individuals might have experienced. However, the uniqueness of the exposure and the population make it impossible to gain clear answers on whether the potential exposure resulted in brain change,\u201d she said. Prof Ray Dolan, the director of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at University College London, was similarly cautious. \u201cGiven what we know about functional specialisation in the brain one would expect meaningful relationships between the severity of specific deficits and the degree of change in brain regions that mediate specific functions. For example, if there were subjects with severe memory impairment one might expect a relationship with changes in the hippocampus. The report is silent on this,\u201d he said. \u201cI would take the findings with a pinch of salt.\u201d Dr David Silbersweig, the chairman of psychiatry at Brigham &amp; Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, said one problem was that the scans were taken for medical reasons rather than research, where the data would be higher quality. \u201cA next study with research scans rather than clinical scans, and with some additional controls, is something that would be helpful as a next step to continue to try to get to the bottom of this.\u201d",

Also \u2018cunning\u2019 is slightly archaic and \u2018plan\u2019 you can stretch out. The first time I said it, I thought, \u2018This could turn into a catchphrase.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And it did. \u201cThe more I said it, the more people laughed and the more we wanted to include it, which is ironic because we\u2019d been very snobby on that show about the whole idea of catchphrases.\u201d By the fourth and final series, Blackadder Goes Forth, Robinson needed only to say \u201cI\u201d to reduce the audience to hysterics. \u201cIt\u2019s not that you\u2019ve said anything funny. It\u2019s just out of recognition of all those times they\u2019ve laughed in the past.\u201d</p> <p>He refers to it now as a kind of spell. \u201cIt makes people go into a place they weren\u2019t in before. And to use that spell overmuch is to weaken it. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t usually say it when people ask me to. If they\u2019re absolutely dying for me to do it, I will. But not out of choice.\u201d However, just as Wilson has revived his catchphrase for a fake Radio 4 memoir (Believe It!), and a comedy sketch campaigning for a second EU referendum, so Robinson has borrowed his for an autobiography (No Cunning Plan) and a live show (Tony Robinson\u2019s Cunning Night Out). \u201cThere\u2019s a limit to the amount of times I\u2019m prepared to prostitute my catchphrase,\u201d Robinson laughs, \u201cand I think I\u2019ve reached it.\u201d</p> <p>It isn\u2019t so funny for everyone. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/cuba-gooding-jr\">Cuba Gooding Jr</a> admitted to this paper last year that he hadn\u2019t gone more than two days since the release of Jerry Maguire in 1996 without someone shouting the best-known line from his Oscar-winning performance in that film: \u201cShow me the money!\u201d The late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/01/barry-norman-obituary\">Barry Norman</a> expressed bewilderment that the phrase \u201cAnd why not?\u201d proved so unshakable when he had never said it in the first place.

      "bodyText": "When it happens to Richard Wilson, he gives a wave and keeps walking. Maureen Lipman, on the other hand, tends to assume an expression of weary resignation, which she calls her \u201cdead sea bass\u201d look. Tony Robinson is a bit more forgiving: he might even play along. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be a dick about it,\u201d he says. What each of these actors has in common is a catchphrase that has dogged them for decades. Wilson played the curmudgeonly Victor Meldrew in the BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave from 1990 to 2000, and it\u2019s rare now for a week to pass without someone calling out his character\u2019s incredulous catchphrase \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t believe it!\u201d \u2013 or pleading with him to repeat it. \u201cMost of them think they\u2019re the only one who\u2019s ever asked,\u201d explains the 83-year-old. \u201cTaxi drivers I get it from a lot. I suppose they\u2019ve got me trapped. I feel a bit bad not saying it to kids but I\u2019ve got to have my freedom. If it\u2019s someone\u2019s birthday I may say it.\u201d He remembers the show\u2019s creator, David Renwick, rationing its appearances in the script once he realised it had caught on. \u201cDavid would allow it in one episode, then have the next one without it. Or he would just put in half the line: \u2018I! Don\u2019t!\u2019 And that would be enough.\u201d Lipman, now 73 and a Coronation Street regular, has been living with her catchphrase for even longer. It\u2019s more than 30 years since she played the fussbudget Beattie in a series of commercials for British Telecom. Calling her grandson in anticipation of his outstanding exam results, Beattie is downhearted to learn that he flunked them all, only to perk up when he mentions a pass in sociology. \u201cAn \u2018ology\u2019?\u201d she exclaims. \u201cHe gets an \u2018ology\u2019 and he says he failed. You get an \u2018ology\u2019, you\u2019re a scientist!\u201d When she was filming the ad, written by Richard Phillips, she couldn\u2019t quite see the joke. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was all that funny, which is probably why it was good. Like most hits, it took us by surprise.\u201d Besides, there were other catchphrase contenders from the BT campaign. One ad even featured Wilson as a harried shop assistant fielding telephone queries from Beattie. His exasperated response to her questions about the outfits in stock \u2013 \u201cAll the colours in all sizes!\u201d \u2013 gave him an early taste of the echo-chamber experience. \u201cI used to hear that line occasionally when I was out,\u201d he says, sounding wistful for a time when the air was filled with something other than the cries of a million Meldrews. But it was the \u201cology\u201d ad that stuck. And, like Wilson, Lipman has to deal with her catchphrase on a weekly basis. \u201c\u2018Eh!

I\u2019m sure when I die it\u2019ll be the headline \u2013 \u2018Lipman Cut Off!\u2019 or \u2018Receiver Is Finally Put Down On Jewish Comedienne\u2019.\u201d Nigel Farage did his bit to revive it in 2014 by blaming Lipman and the \u201cology\u201d for what he regarded as a rise in \u201csoft-option\u201d degrees tempting school-leavers toward university when they should be learning carpentry instead. She responded by calling him \u201cthe first senior politician \u2026 to regard education as a bad thing\u201d. It was during the third series of the period sitcom Blackadder that Robinson, who played the dim and unhygienic Baldrick, first uttered the line that was to become his catchphrase. \u201cThe words \u2018plan\u2019 and \u2018cunning plan\u2019 had cropped up a few times before I took ownership of them,\u201d recalls the actor, now 72. \u201cIn the script, Baldrick\u2019s line was simply, \u2018I have a plan.\u2019 I asked if I could add \u2018cunning\u2019 because that worked better rhythmically.

Several Johnson loyalists have had their eye on the post of chancellor, but only one can do it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/24/boris-johnson-takes-his-revenge-and-sacks-over-half-the-cabinet\">A complete clearout of May\u2019s remain-minded ministers</a> provided plenty of opportunity to reward the Brexit believers though.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The issue that will define a Johnson premiership. He has promised to rapidly renegotiate almost all of May\u2019s departure deal, ditching the Irish backstop border guarantee policy \u2013 something that would seem a huge task over any timescale, let alone little more than 12 weeks, a fair proportion of which is taken up by a summer break. If this fails, he will be set on a no-deal departure for 31 October, and a likely huge clash with MPs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Iran</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>&nbsp;wasn\u2019t enough, a new Johnson government must immediately take steps to make sure he doesn\u2019t begin his time in No 10 with a slide into war. The situation in the gulf is complex, fast-moving and hugely dangerous. Johnson did not cover himself in glory as foreign secretary, especially over Iran. It will be his task to prove he has learned.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Managing parliament and Tory MPs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Johnson will start as PM with a working Commons majority of four, thanks to the DUP, but within weeks it is likely to be down to three if as expected the Liberal Democrats win in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. If this wasn\u2019t tricky enough, a small but significant section of Tory MPs openly detest Johnson, and will not want to help him out - and with his cabinet sackings, the \u2018Gaukward squad\u2019 of former senior cabinet members set on blocking a no-deal Brexit swelled in ranks.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Loosening the purse strings</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Such was the fiscal largesse on display from both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt during the hustings process that much as he will seek to kick any decisions towards an autumn budget, voters \u2013 especially Tory members \u2013 will be expecting both tax cuts and more spending on areas such as education and the police.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Everything non-Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This might sound glib, but there is a lot to consider \u2013 during the three-plus years of Brexit introversion May\u2019s government failed to properly grasp any of a series of long-term, pressing national problems: the crisis in social care; the future of the NHS; a climate emergency; the increasingly insecure future of work; a broken housing market; rampant poverty, including among many working people. This is a huge workload for any new administration.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Being prime ministerial</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Critics might say this is Johnson\u2019s single biggest challenge. The leadership process has shown that while he endlessly harked back to supposed successes as London mayor \u2013 an often ceremonial role with relatively few powers \u2013 Johnson was notably quieter about his period as foreign secretary.</p>\n    <p>Being prime minister is like the latter, to a factor of 10 \u2013 a never-ending succession of red boxes containing vital documents, of urgent briefings, of a whole system hanging on your decisions. Johnson has a tendency to ignore advice, pluck statistics out of the air and rely on sudden, cheap glibness. Curbing these long habits will be a daily struggle - his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/24/meet-the-new-dude-at-no-10-papers-greet-boris-johnsons-victory\">adopting the acronym 'Dude' in his victory speech</a> shows just how hard it is for him.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterwalker\"><b>Peter Walker</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Political correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he wished to \u201cvery much to work with [Johnson] as quickly as possible\u201d and would call him \u201cwhen he is officially prime minister\u201d.</p> \n<p>The German chancellor Angela Merkel echoed those comments, adding that her country and UK \u201cshould be close friends in future\u201d.</p> \n<p>But in an indication of the political baggage that Johnson will bring into Downing Street, EU officials felt free to take potshots in the hours immediately before the announcement of his election by the Conservative party membership.</p> \n<p>One eastern European commissioner, Vytenis Andriukaitis, likened Johnson\u2019s \u201cunrealistic promises\u201d to those of the former Russian president Boris Yeltsin, whose empty rhetoric was said to have ushered in the authoritarian rule of Vladimir Putin.</p> \n<p>The Lithuanian health commissioner, Vytenis Andriukaitis, wrote <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2014-2019/andriukaitis/blog/boris-you-are-wrong_en\">in a blogpost</a> published on the European commission website: \u201cIt is a different Boris, of course, but there was something in the way of doing politics that was similar: many unrealistic promises, ignoring economic rationales and rational decisions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0e9d21fc-1faa-4993-958e-f60ce5110447\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <!-- invalid atom id (0e9d21fc-1faa-4993-958e-f60ce5110447) -->\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThese decisions led to a new autocratic constitution and finally paved the way to Vladimir Putin.

      "body": "<p>Morning has broken, like the first morning, in Darvell, Sussex. The sun is shining, the air is full of birdsong and the scent of flowers. A bell rings and healthy-looking children, some barefoot, scamper happily off to school. The youngest are pushed around in wooden carts. Everyone is smiling and going about their business, taking washing to the central laundry or going to work in the workshops, offices or the kitchen garden. No one owns anything or earns anything. Everything is shared and everyone is very friendly. \u201cGood morning,\u201d they say, in a range of accents \u2013 British, American, some more Germanic-sounding ones among the older folk.</p> <p>And it does appear to be just that: a very good morning. Unless you take issue with the fact that the women here dress a bit like handmaids, with long shapeless skirts and head coverings (the men, mainly in plain jeans and shirts, look more contemporary, albeit untroubled by fashion). Or you\u2019re bothered that same-sex relationships are a sin around here. Or perhaps you find it all a bit creepy or (whisper it) culty.</p> <p>I\u2019m spending 24 hours with the Bruderhof, a radical Christian movement founded a century ago in Germany. In brief, it recognises the Bible\u2019s authority over everything, placing emphasis on the New Testament\u2019s Acts 2 and 4 and the Sermon on the Mount, which direct followers to embrace communal living and lifelong service to others. In its 100-year history, the group has moved around \u2013 Europe, Paraguay, North America \u2013 fleeing Nazis and wars. Now there are 3,000 or so living in communities worldwide, including some 300 here in the Weald. They have let the cameras in, for a BBC documentary, to show the world what they do. They might as well let the press in, too; hence my presence.</p> <p>I am met at the station in a communal Volkswagen Golf by Bernard, 38, who might be called something like outreach director if the Bruderhof did titles. He lives with his wife, Rachel, 46, and their children, Esther, Michael and Jonathan (14, 12 and five) in a wing of the central building, which was once a TB hospital. I\u2019m staying with them.</p> <p>For tea, after thanking the Lord, we have bacon rolls \u2013 from pigs raised on the premises \u2013 and salad, and they tell me about themselves. Rachel is from Connecticut, Bernard is British. They grew up and met within the community and were married in a field after a courtship that involved a lot of letter writing, discussion of the gospels and taking advice from pastors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"334f1b48a745b219def894d05bc57b1d4d4c7e92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/334f1b48a745b219def894d05bc57b1d4d4c7e92/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The community gather at the end of the day for games.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018What truly makes a woman free: is it choosing their clothing, or is it her personality and character?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dr\u0103goi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They have had a couple of arguments in their time together. \u201cOne was about whether we should go for a walk when Esther was screaming as a baby,\u201d says Rachel. That doesn\u2019t sound too serious. \u201cIt was for us. It was devastating that we were arguing for the first time in our lives.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel isn\u2019t wearing a headscarf at home, just a long black skirt and a grey top. Does she not mind looking like a 19th-century peasant? \u201cMy identity isn\u2019t defined by what I\u2019m wearing, my freedom isn\u2019t dictated by choosing the latest fashion of the high street,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat truly makes a woman free: is it choosing their clothing, or is it her personality and character?\u201d She says she covers her head outside not because it\u2019s the law laid down by men, but because Christ said she should when in prayer \u2013 and a lot of the day she is in prayer.</p> <p>If they have one beef with the documentary, it\u2019s that people might come away thinking the women just look after children and chop vegetables. \u201cWe have more women professionals than men,\u201d says Bernard. \u201cOur entire salesforce [of the business, making wooden furniture, where I\u2019ll be put to work in the morning] is run by women. My wife\u2019s a physiotherapist; we have doctors and architects.\u201d</p> <p>But do the women look after the kids and chop the vegetables? Mostly, admits Rachel. \u201cI don\u2019t mind that; I choose that as a Christian. My view is that men and women have different roles, but neither is superior.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s no TV in the house, no computers or tablets. What happens after tea? How about a gin and tonic? Oh, go on then! My kind of cul ... community. Bernard makes three large ones, and we have a quiz.

Would he like a TV? \u201cA tiny bit, yeah,\u201d he admits. He likes playing football, and sometimes gets to watch clips in the office, but doesn\u2019t support a team.</p> <p>And Jonathan? At five, he can swim 500 metres in the community lake (which contains trout and carp). And he\u2019s interested in the Antarctic, loves penguins. He sings a song about emperor penguins and everyone joins in: \u201cTo keep myself off the ice / I find my father\u2019s feet are nice / I snuggle in his belly fluff / And that\u2019s how I stay warm enough.\u201d The Bruderhof do a lot of singing.</p> <p>Another G&amp;T? I think they\u2019re trying to get me drunk, to get me in, then I\u2019ll never leave. It isn\u2019t a cult, says Bernard. \u201cPeople are free to come and free to go. We have a very orthodox Christianity. [The former archbishop of Canterbury] Rowan Williams has been here; we are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/18/evangelical-christians-social-action-revivify-church-brand\">members of the Evangelical Alliance</a>, they don\u2019t accept cults in their membership.

      "bodyText": "Morning has broken, like the first morning, in Darvell, Sussex. The sun is shining, the air is full of birdsong and the scent of flowers. A bell rings and healthy-looking children, some barefoot, scamper happily off to school. The youngest are pushed around in wooden carts. Everyone is smiling and going about their business, taking washing to the central laundry or going to work in the workshops, offices or the kitchen garden. No one owns anything or earns anything. Everything is shared and everyone is very friendly. \u201cGood morning,\u201d they say, in a range of accents \u2013 British, American, some more Germanic-sounding ones among the older folk. And it does appear to be just that: a very good morning. Unless you take issue with the fact that the women here dress a bit like handmaids, with long shapeless skirts and head coverings (the men, mainly in plain jeans and shirts, look more contemporary, albeit untroubled by fashion). Or you\u2019re bothered that same-sex relationships are a sin around here. Or perhaps you find it all a bit creepy or (whisper it) culty. I\u2019m spending 24 hours with the Bruderhof, a radical Christian movement founded a century ago in Germany. In brief, it recognises the Bible\u2019s authority over everything, placing emphasis on the New Testament\u2019s Acts 2 and 4 and the Sermon on the Mount, which direct followers to embrace communal living and lifelong service to others. In its 100-year history, the group has moved around \u2013 Europe, Paraguay, North America \u2013 fleeing Nazis and wars. Now there are 3,000 or so living in communities worldwide, including some 300 here in the Weald. They have let the cameras in, for a BBC documentary, to show the world what they do. They might as well let the press in, too; hence my presence. I am met at the station in a communal Volkswagen Golf by Bernard, 38, who might be called something like outreach director if the Bruderhof did titles. He lives with his wife, Rachel, 46, and their children, Esther, Michael and Jonathan (14, 12 and five) in a wing of the central building, which was once a TB hospital. I\u2019m staying with them. For tea, after thanking the Lord, we have bacon rolls \u2013 from pigs raised on the premises \u2013 and salad, and they tell me about themselves. Rachel is from Connecticut, Bernard is British. They grew up and met within the community and were married in a field after a courtship that involved a lot of letter writing, discussion of the gospels and taking advice from pastors. They have had a couple of arguments in their time together. \u201cOne was about whether we should go for a walk when Esther was screaming as a baby,\u201d says Rachel. That doesn\u2019t sound too serious. \u201cIt was for us. It was devastating that we were arguing for the first time in our lives.\u201d Rachel isn\u2019t wearing a headscarf at home, just a long black skirt and a grey top. Does she not mind looking like a 19th-century peasant? \u201cMy identity isn\u2019t defined by what I\u2019m wearing, my freedom isn\u2019t dictated by choosing the latest fashion of the high street,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat truly makes a woman free: is it choosing their clothing, or is it her personality and character?\u201d She says she covers her head outside not because it\u2019s the law laid down by men, but because Christ said she should when in prayer \u2013 and a lot of the day she is in prayer. If they have one beef with the documentary, it\u2019s that people might come away thinking the women just look after children and chop vegetables. \u201cWe have more women professionals than men,\u201d says Bernard. \u201cOur entire salesforce [of the business, making wooden furniture, where I\u2019ll be put to work in the morning] is run by women. My wife\u2019s a physiotherapist; we have doctors and architects.\u201d But do the women look after the kids and chop the vegetables? Mostly, admits Rachel. \u201cI don\u2019t mind that; I choose that as a Christian. My view is that men and women have different roles, but neither is superior.\u201d There\u2019s no TV in the house, no computers or tablets. What happens after tea? How about a gin and tonic? Oh, go on then! My kind of cul ... community. Bernard makes three large ones, and we have a quiz. Subject: life outside. Has 14-year-old Esther heard of Love Island? \u201cIs that the one where they all go to the island and then they all have to sleep in a bed together?\u201d Correct. She has never seen it, but a friend outside the community told her about it. Taylor Swift? Nope. Tory leadership, Trump, Brexit: all up to speed. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to know what\u2019s going on in the world,\u201d says Rachel. \u201cWe are a part of it.\u201d Brexit is going to affect them \u2013 the business exports, plus there may well be migration issues. \u201cCelebrity culture is one of the things I\u2019m perfectly happy my children know nothing about,\u201d says Bernard. And Instagram. \u201cThe majority of parents I speak to are pretty unhappy about the effects of social media.\u201d What about 12-year-old Michael. Would he like a TV? \u201cA tiny bit, yeah,\u201d he admits. He likes playing football, and sometimes gets to watch clips in the office, but doesn\u2019t support a team. And Jonathan? At five, he can swim 500 metres in the community lake (which contains trout and carp). And he\u2019s interested in the Antarctic, loves penguins. He sings a song about emperor penguins and everyone joins in: \u201cTo keep myself off the ice / I find my father\u2019s feet are nice / I snuggle in his belly fluff / And that\u2019s how I stay warm enough.\u201d The Bruderhof do a lot of singing.

I need to go to bed before I sign up. Up a wooden staircase into a comfortable room with a selection of German prayer books and a big bar of Cadbury Dairy Milk. They\u2019re definitely trying to get me. I\u2019m awoken by the braying of a donkey, and the sun. Breakfast is at 6.15 \u2013 more bacon, scrambled eggs, beans and a song.

The auction, at Julien\u2019s Auctions in Beverly Hills on 21 September, will also include the 15-time Grammy winner\u2019s touring van, jewellery and clothing as well as the National Medal of Arts that he was presented by President George HW Bush in 1990. Martin Nolan, executive director of Julien\u2019s Auctions, said the auction honored \u201can American national treasure, the mighty BB King. \u201cThis splendid collection \u2026 is a testament to King\u2019s revered stature among rock royalty,\u201d he said. The blues star from Mississippi, born Riley B King and later nicknamed Blues Boy, or BB, said the name Lucille originated from a near death experience when he rescued his guitar from a fire at a nightclub in Arkansas after two men started fighting. \u201cThe building was a wooden building, and it was burning so fast when I got my guitar, it started to collapse around me. So I almost lost my life trying to save the guitar,\u201d he told NPR. \u201cBut the next morning, we found that these two guys who was fighting was fighting about a lady. I never did meet the lady, but I learned that her name was Lucille. So I named my guitar Lucille and reminded me not to do a thing like that again.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Our economics editor Larry Elliott has analysed the IMF\u2019s new forecasts, and reports: Donald Trump\u2019s claim that his protectionist measures are hurting Chinamore than the US has received support from the International Monetary Fund in new forecasts showing how a fresh slowdown in the global economy has been concentrated in emerging economies. The Washington-based IMF said the outlook was gloomier than it envisaged three months ago due to the tit-for-tat tariff war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies, Brexit uncertainty and the impact of sanctions against Iran on oil prices. In an update to its half-yearly World Economic Outlook, the IMF said it expected global growth to be 0.1 percentage points lower in both 2019 and 2020 than it envisaged in April, at 3.2% and 3.5% respectively. The Fund\u2019s country-by-country breakdown upgraded its forecast of US growth this year from 2.3% to 2.6% but downgraded China from 6.3% to 6.2%. Britain\u2019s days of growing faster than the rest of the G7 are long behind it.... The IMF has nudged up its forecast for eurozone growth in 2020 to 1.6%, from 1.5%. But it still expects growth of just 1.3% this year, with Germany only expected to grow by 0.7% this year. France is tipped to grow by 1.3% this year, while Italy could only manage a meagre 0.1% growth. The forecast for 2019 is revised down slightly for Germany (due to weaker-than-expected external demand, which also weighs on investment), but it is unchanged for France (where fiscal measures are expected to support growth and the negative effects of street protests are dissipating) and Italy (where the uncertain fiscal outlook is similar to April\u2019s, taking a toll on investment and domestic demand). Growth has been revised up for 2019 in Spain, reflecting strong investment and weak imports at the start of the year. In a small boost to Donald Trump, the IMF has revised up its growth forecast for America. It now expects America\u2019s economy to grow by 2.6% this year, up from 2.3% previously. However, growth is still expected to slow in 2020, to +1.9%. The Fund says: The revision to 2019 growth reflects stronger-than-anticipated first quarter performance. While the headline number was strong on the back of robust exports and inventory accumulation, domestic demand was somewhat softer than expected and imports weaker as well, in part reflecting the effect of tariffs. These developments point to slowing momentum over the rest of the year The IMF warns that the global outlook has not improved in the last three months, since its previous forecasts: Since the April World Economic Outlook (WEO) report, the United States further increased tariffs on certain Chinese imports and China retaliated by raising tariffs on a subset of US imports. Additional escalation was averted following the June G20 summit. Global technology supply chains were threatened by the prospect of US sanctions, Brexit-related uncertainty continued, and rising geopolitical tensions roiled energy prices. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has cut its growth forecasts for the global economy, blaming the US-China trade war and Brexit uncertainty. The Fund now expects the world economy to only grow by 3.2% this year, down from a previous forecast of 3.3%. It expects growth of 3.5% in 2020, down from 3.6% before. In its latest World Economic Outlook, just released, the Fund says: Risks to the forecast are mainly to the downside. They include further trade and technology tensions that dent sentiment and slow investment; a protracted increase in risk aversion that exposes the financial vulnerabilities continuing to accumulate after years of low interest rates; and mounting disinflationary pressures that increase debt service difficulties, constrain monetary policy space to counter downturns, and make adverse shocks more persistent than normal. The Fund also warns that trade conflicts are hurting: Multilateral and national policy actions are vital to place global growth on a stronger footing. The pressing needs include reducing trade and technology tensions and expeditiously resolving uncertainty around trade agreements (including between the United Kingdom and the European Union and the free trade area encompassing Canada, Mexico, and the United States). Newsflash: Rating agency Moody\u2019s has warned that Boris Johnson\u2019s win increases the risk of a no-deal Brexit. In a new report to investors, Moody\u2019s also warns that crashing out of the EU would caused \u201csignificant\u201d damage to Britain\u2019s credit rating, and that of major companies (such as UK banks, I suspect). Moody\u2019s managing director Colin Ellis says Johnson\u2019s victory makes a \u201csustainable compromise\u201d between London and Brussels less likely. \u201cWith the election of Mr Johnson, the likelihood of a sustainable compromise appears lower than before...Our view remains that a no-deal Brexit would have significantly negative credit effects for the UK sovereign and related issuers.\u201d Moody\u2019s currently ranks the UK\u2019s debt as Aa2, the third-highest rating. City economists fear that Boris Johnson will face a rocky ride at Downing Street. James Smith, economist at ING Bank, points out that Johnson faces the same problems as Theresa May. He will probably struggle to get any meaningful changes to the Brexit deal, and then struggle to get the withdrawal agreement through parliament. Smith says: In a nutshell: PM Johnson to face the same hurdles as PM May Finding a tweaked deal that both the EU and Parliament can agree to will be challenging If a deal is to get a majority in Parliament, the devil might not be in the detail after all The election numbers look good for Mr Johnson - but can they last? Uncertainty to take its toll on growth, although rate cuts not yet on the horizon Smith has also pulled together this chart, showing how there are no easy options: The slump in UK factory orders underlines the challenges facing Boris Johnson, newly installed as the new leader of the Conservative Party (and prime minister by tomorrow). Several business groups have rushed to release advice for the new PM -- keen to squeeze into his in-tray. Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI Director-General, says Johnson needs to get a Brexit deal soon, to support the economy: \u201cBusiness needs three things in the first 100 days. A Brexit deal that unlocks confidence; clear signals the UK is open for business; and a truly pro-enterprise vision for our country. \u201cOn Brexit, the new Prime Minister must not underestimate the benefits of a good deal. It will unlock new investment and confidence in factories and boardrooms across the country. Business will back you across Europe to help get there. \u201cEarly signals back home also matter. From a new immigration system to green-lighting major infrastructure, there is no time to waste.\u201d Edwin Morgan, Interim Director General at the Institute of Directors, has a five-point plan for the new PM Provide financial support for SMEs to prepare for and adjust to Brexit, for instance through a Brexit planning voucher system offering grants to help smaller firms access the specialist professional and/or legal help they often need. Reform the skills system, introducing a wider range of courses under the flagship Apprenticeship Levy, while introducing new ways to incentivise lifelong learning through the tax system. Incentivise business investment by improving EIS and SEIS reliefs and creating a new Enhanced Capital Allowance for productivity-enhancing spending. Reduce the burden of business rates by removing the impact of investment in improvements, extending reliefs, and conducting more frequent revaluations. Supercharge regional growth by providing more local control of skills policy, piloting regional variances and exploring long-term investment vehicles such as urban wealth funds. Miles Celic, chief executive officer of TheCityUK, says Johnson must lift the threat of a no-deal Brexit: \u201cWe congratulate Boris Johnson. He becomes Prime Minister at a pivotal time in our country\u2019s history. He must now move swiftly to set out his plans for the road ahead. Ongoing Brexit uncertainty is depressing business activity, but the financial and related professional services industry remains very clear that a no-deal Brexit is still the worst of all outcomes. We hope the new Prime Minister can find an economically viable way through the ongoing political impasse in Parliament and with the EU27. The CBI\u2019s report also shows clearly that business optimism, and output, have both declined sharply of late: This chart, from the CBI\u2019s survey, shows how activity across UK factories has slumped in the last few months. UK factories are struggling because the boost from pre-Brexit panic stockpiling earlier this year has faded. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Chief Economist, explains: \u201cAs the tailwind from stockpiling weakens, clouds are gathering above the manufacturing sector. It\u2019s being hit by the double-blow of Brexit uncertainty and slower global growth. \u201cWith orders, employment, investment, output and business optimism all deteriorating among manufacturers, it\u2019s crucial for the new Prime Minister to secure a Brexit deal ahead of the October deadline. And get on with pressing domestic priorities from improving our infrastructure to fixing the apprenticeship levy. \u201cThis will allow firms to focus on investing in new technology and tackling the skill shortages that plague this sector.\u201d Only five of the 17 sub-sectors that make up UK industry have grown in the last three months, according to the CBI. Growth was strongest in food, drink &amp; tobacco, and mechanical engineering. But the slump in output was particularly due to motor vehicles &amp; transport equipment-making. OUCH! UK factory orders have fallen at the fastest pace in a decade, as Brexit uncertainty continues to hurt British manufacturing. A new survey from the CBI found that UK manufacturing output fell in the three months to July, for the first time since March 2016. The business group warns that \u201cstorm clouds\u201d are gathering over the economy, with confidence waning and order books shrinking. The rather echoes Michael Saunders\u2019 concerns over the economy, and may intensify concerns that Britain is heading into recession. The CBI interviewed 291 manufacturing firms, and found: Total new orders fell at the quickest pace since January 2012, driven by the fastest falls in domestic and export orders since the financial crisis. Business sentiment deteriorated at the quickest rate since July 2016 (just after the EU referendum), while investment intentions worsened relative to last quarter. Stockpiling activities slowed noticeably from last quarter, when stocks of raw materials, work in progress, and finished goods all grew at survey record highs. More to follow... It looks like perfect conditions for a chilled G&amp;T today (not in the newsroom, of course!), but bad weather earlier this year has hurt tonic maker Fever-Tree. Shares in Fever-Tree have slumped by 9% this morning, after it reported that revenue only grew by 13% in the first half of 2019, to \u00a3117.3m. A year ago, revenue swelled by 45%, as consumers flocked to Fever-Tree\u2019s range of premium tonic waters, ginger beer and lemonade. Inclement weather maybe to blame -- it was unusually cold in April, and unpleasantly wet in June, neither of which are ideal for quaffing cocktails. CEO Tim Warrillow says: The poor weather in the past quarter has had a dampening effect on growth rates in the short term as we lap what was an incredibly strong period of trading in summer 2018. Shares in Fever-Tree have dropped to \u00a321, from almost \u00a340 last summer. Fever-Tree has achieved sparkling growth since it was created in 2005 (its founders famously scoured the world looking for ingredients, shaking up the rather stale tonic sector). Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, says: \u201cFevertree, a former darling of the stock market and a popular share amongst retail investors, seems to have lost even more fizz from this morning\u2019s trading update.... The company has not been immune to issues affecting many other companies including the wetter start to the current summer season. It is also finding it increasingly difficult to find new customers in bars, pubs and supermarkets as the UK market appears to be quite saturated. The weakening pound has pushed up shares in major exporters (whose foreign earnings are more valuable in sterling terms). The FTSE 100 is now 46 points higher, or 0.6%, at 7561, not far from an 11-month high. Engineering firm Melrose (+4.2%) is the top riser, followed by packaging giants Mondi and DS Smith (both +3.2%) and chemicals firm Johnson Mathey (+2.6%) Sterling is also dipping against the euro, back down to \u20ac1.111, towards last week\u2019s six-month lows. Fiona Cincotta at City Index says today\u2019s Conservative Party leadership election is casting a \u201cdark cloud\u201d over the currency markets. Sterling\u2019s slide continues to reflect concerns that a Boris Johnson win will result in a messy Brexit despite the fact that Parliamentarians have been putting legal breaks in place to prevent this outcome. A lot of the weakness has already been discounted in the currency and if Johnson does win sterling may continue to slide but not actually crash as some analysts seem to expect. The pound has dropped since Michael Saunders\u2019 comments hit the wires. Traders are calculating that an early UK interest rate rise is even less likely, as Saunders was on the hawkish end of the Monetary Policy Committee. Sterling has lost half a cent this morning to $1.2420, only half a cent above last week\u2019s 27-month low. Boom! One of the Bank of England\u2019s most hawkish policymakers has warned that the UK economy looks weak. Michael Saunders told Bloomberg that it was very uncertain that Britain would leave the EU smoothly (as the Bank\u2019s own forecasts assume). That\u2019s a signal that Saunders might not vote for higher borrowing costs soon. Saunders explained: The economy right now is clearly not overheating -- the underlying pace of growth, stripping out all of the funny effects, inventories, car shutdowns and so forth, is weak and below trend.\u201d He also hinted that he wouldn\u2019t be swayed to vote for higher interest rates, just because the BoE\u2019s own forecasts suggested they were necessary to curb inflation. \u201cThe link from the forecast to my actual vote [last time the MPC met] was quite loose.\u201d This is quite a dovish twist from Saunders. Last month he warned that the Bank risked lifting rates too slowly, and shouldn\u2019t wait until Brexit uncertainty had been resolved. Clearly the facts have changed -- with growth continuing to slow (Britain could already be entering recession), and markets anticipating rate cuts in the US and fresh stimulus in Europe. Many investors expect the BoE to slash interest rates in a no-deal scenario, but Saunders isn\u2019t committing himself, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how it would play out with any certainty....I wouldn\u2019t want to give a strong steer now as to which way policy would go.\u201d A resolution to the US-China trade war can\u2019t come soon enough for Huawei. Overnight, the Chinese technology giant laid off more than 600 workers from its US-based research arm Futurewei. This follows Huawei being placed on a US government blacklist, which prevented American firms from selling it technology without a special licence. According to the Financial Times, that ban means that Futurewei, which is based in California and incorporated in Texas, can no longer transfer US-originated technologies back to Huawei, scuppering the original aims of the research arm. European carmakers, and auto part manufacturers, are among the top risers this morning. BMW has gained 4%, with tyre-maker Continental up 4.5%, lifted by optimism over a trade war breakthrough. Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House, has admitted that avoiding a stock market crash was a key factor behind the budget deal hammered out yesterday. CNN explains: In a brief interview Monday evening, Pelosi said two factors above all played a critical role in her successful behind-the-scenes negotiations with [Treasury secretary] Mnuchin: avoiding a stock market collapse and the fiscal fallout from failing to raise the debt ceiling. \u201cThe debt ceiling and the stock market were always two major motivators for him to try and clear the way,\u201d Pelosi told CNN. \u201cWe avoided sequestration and for the moment avoided a shutdown. For federal workers, that was very important.\u201d It\u2019s looking like mission accomplished so far, with markets in Asia and Europe both gaining ground today: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a beautiful day in the City of London, with many investors in a sunnier mood as they settle down at their computers too. Signs of progress on two bugbears -- the US debt ceiling, and the US-China trade war \u2013 is cheering the markets. Overnight, President Donald Trump reached a deal with Congress that will remove the threat of a new fiscal crisis until at least 2021. The plan clears the way for more US spending, removing the danger of a government shutdown because the national debt had hit the current limit. Trump declared that the deal was a \u201creal compromise\u201d. Investors will be relieved, as it removes the risk that America could default on its debts (even though it can print all the dollars it ever needs). It also defuses one potential landmine in the way of Trump\u2019s re-election bid. Adam Cole of RBC Capital Markets points out the deal has strengthened the US dollar. The deal raises the debt ceiling to mid-2021... and alleviates one of the risks overhanging policy in the US. In another welcome sign of progress, US officials are expected to head back to China next week for new talks over the trade war. The South China Post reported that America\u2019s trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will meet Vice-Premier Liu He. The meeting comes as the two sides appear to thaw their positions. The US has recently offered exemptions to 110 Chinese products, including medical equipment and key electronic components, from import tariffs. China has also offered an olive branch, allowing several companies to buy US agricultural products without tariffs. This is giving stocks a lift, particularly technology firms who are vulnerable to the trade conflict. Asian markets have rallied, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei gaining 1% and China\u2019s Shanghai Composite up 0.5%. European markets are also expected to rise, with the UK FTSE 100 gaining 0.5% in early trading. Also coming up today Investors are adopting a brace position ahead of the results of the Conservative Party leadership election, likely to confirm Boris Johnson will become Britain\u2019s next prime minister. The prospect of a no-deal Brexit will keep the pound under pressure, while Johnson\u2019s promise of tax cuts and higher spending could sway the bond market (as he\u2019ll have to borrow to pay for it). The International Monetary Fund will release its latest assessment of the world economy, forecasting how issues such as the US-China trade war and Brexit will hurt growth. In the UK, the CBI\u2019s monthly manufacturing survey is likely to show weak confidence among UK industrial firms.

      "bodyText": "Spain\u2019s Socialist party leader, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has failed in his first attempt to form a new government after the anti-austerity Unidas Podemos party abstained in a parliamentary vote. S\u00e1nchez, who has been acting prime minister since an inconclusive election in April, needed an absolute majority of at least 176 votes in his favour in the 350-seat house to be confirmed as PM. Instead he received 124 votes in favour and 170 against, and there were 52 abstentions. The vote now goes to a second round on Thursday when S\u00e1nchez only needs a simple majority \u2013 ie more \u201cyes\u201d than \u201cno\u201d votes. In the meantime he needs to strike a deal with Podemos in order to secure its MPs\u2019 votes. At the weekend Pablo Iglesias agreed to step aside as Podemos leader after S\u00e1nchez accused him of being the main obstacle to forming a coalition. But any hope that S\u00e1nchez would respond by offering Podemos senior ministerial positions failed to materialise. The party was apparently offered the new ministries of youth and housing, as well the vice-presidency for Irene Montero, the Podemos number two and Iglesias\u2019s partner. However, the offer was rejected on the grounds that the posts, which Podemos dismissed as \u201cdecorative\u201d, carry no executive power. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to be a Chinese vase,\u201d said party spokeswoman Ione Belarra. \u201cNegotiations are at a standstill but we are confident that the socialist party will reflect and change its position.\u201d During Monday\u2019s investiture debate an angry Iglesias told S\u00e1nchez that the 3.7 million people who voted for his party deserved representation in government. Montero, who is heavily pregnant, voted no by phone, suggesting that Podemos\u2019s decision to abstain rather than outright oppose was taken at the last minute. With the support of Podemos\u2019s 42 MPs and a few others from small regional parties, S\u00e1nchez could get through on Thursday, but given the anger of these potential allies, that support looks uncertain. Catalan separatist party ERC accused S\u00e1nchez of being \u201cirresponsible\u201d for not appearing to want to negotiate with anyone, while Aitor Esteban of the PNV Basque nationalist party said the Socialists had not even been in touch with them in the past few weeks. \u201cThey have taken for granted that our vote was going to be positive,\u201d he said.

That frantic trolly dash last summer, which appeared to lack a coherent strategy and ended up disrupting the rhythm of a team on the up, counts against the hierarchy, though there were mitigating circumstances. Khan has pointed to the play-off campaign delaying plans, with the World Cup another hindrance as he sought to strengthen a side who had relied heavily upon loan players. Yet if Mitrovic, Anguissa, Mawson and Joe Bryan \u2013 all purchased that summer \u2013 excel then that outlay could be cast in a different light. They might even have a team that are Premier League ready, like Wolves, if promotion is secured. Throw in an academy, overseen expertly by Huw Jennings, which is seeking to expand and continues to nurture talent, and the redevelopment of the Riverside stand \u2013 the capacity at Craven Cottage will be reduced to around 19,000 this season \u2013 and the overriding optimism feels justified. \u201cNobody at Fulham liked the way last season went,\u201d the vice\u2011chairman said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve kept the spirit and backbone of a really strong team who, two seasons ago, went 23 games unbeaten to end the season. It was the best day I\u2019ve ever had to go to Wembley stadium and win the Championship play-off final but, this year, our goal is to be auto-promoted.\u201d",

The nudists say they are being pestered in an area of the city\u2019s Bois de Vincennes where for the last two years they have been allowed to shed their clothes. An area of almost two acres of the park is set aside for naturists between April and October. When it opened in 2017, City officials insisted no inappropriate behaviour would be tolerated, a message reiterated on a sign at the entrance to the zone. But a number of naturists have complained their peace is being disturbed by the \u201creprehensible\u201d actions of some non-nudists.

The local mayor, Catherine Baratti-Elbaz, said police had been asked to increase park patrols after reports of \u201cvoyeurism and exhibitionism\u201d, but the police commissioner, Hugo Arer, said he had not received any formal complaints this year.

They said the costs for a voyage through the strait for a very large crude carrier (VLCC), the most common supertanker in the range of 200,000 to 400,000 tonnes, was set to rise by about $500,000 (\u00a3402,000). There are fears that shipping companies will start unflagging from the British ensign fearing the flag turns the ship into an Iranian target. Some Iranian MPs have also called for tolls on British and US ships moving through the strait.</p> \n<p>The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, insisted Johnson needed to understand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/23/iran-not-seeking-confrontation-tehran-says-in-message-for-boris-johnson\">Iran was not seeking confrontation</a>. Speaking after meeting his Nicaraguan counterpart, Denis Moncada, on Monday, he told reporters \u201cIt\u2019s important for everybody to realise, it\u2019s important for Boris Johnson to understand, that Iran does not seek confrontation. Iran wants to have normal relations based on mutual respect.\u201d</p> \n<p>Zarif made no reference to the UK-proposed EU-led maritime protection force but said: \u201cWe have 1,500 miles of coastline in the Persian Gulf. We are responsible for the security and the freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf. That is our lifeline.\u201d</p> \n<p>Using his usual description of the group around the hawkish US national security adviser John Bolton as the B-team, he said: \u201cIt is much much better for the United Kingdom not to be engaged in implementing the ploys of the B-team. The B-team is losing ground in the United States and now they are turning their attention to the UK. I guess the same policies that failed in the US will fail in the United Kingdom.\u201d</p> \n<p>The diplomat made the remarks after Britain delivered a volley of threatening messages to Iran in response to its seizure last Friday of a UK-flagged tanker. Stena Impero was captured and an investigation initiated after the tanker collided with an Iranian fishing boat in the Persian Gulf and refused to respond to its distress call.</p> \n<p>Zarif said Iran acted against Stena Impero only after the UK flouted maritime regulations.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe UK ship had turned down its signal for more time than it was allowed to [and] was passing through the wrong channel, endangering the safety and security of shipping and navigation in the strait of Hormuz, for which we are responsible,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Nathalie Loiseau, the former leader of Macron\u2019s party in the European parliament, said the two priorities were de-escalation and monitoring in the strait of Hormuz. Speaking on BBC World Tonight, she said: \u201cWhat I find extremely interesting when a British ship has been seized \u2013 and it\u2019s a question of high concern in the UK and rightly \u2013 there is this reflex to call the Europeans. At the very moment when you are talking about Brexit you can see we have common threats and have common ways of assessing threats.</p> \n<p>\u201cI listened carefully to the foreign secretary saying the initiative he has in mind is very different from the American initiative of a policy of maximum pressure.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Jennifer Rankin in Brussels</em></p>",

Hunt\u2019s allies believe he could not leave a vacuum at a time of crisis and there is no constitutional requirement for the cabinet to consult a then-candidate for the Conservative leadership over British security plans. Hunt\u2019s future as foreign secretary remains in question and the scale of his leadership election defeat will be weighed against the disruption of changing foreign secretary at a time of crisis. British shipping representatives fear the plan for a European-led convoy might take as long as four months to be operational and many British ships, fearing capture by Iran, might de-flag in the interim unless they feel fully protected. They are seeking talks with the Department for Transport over interim protection. British shipping executives reported the cost of war insurance for shipping going through the strait of Hormuz was soaring. They said the costs for a voyage through the strait for a very large crude carrier (VLCC), the most common supertanker in the range of 200,000 to 400,000 tonnes, was set to rise by about $500,000 (\u00a3402,000). There are fears that shipping companies will start unflagging from the British ensign fearing the flag turns the ship into an Iranian target. Some Iranian MPs have also called for tolls on British and US ships moving through the strait. The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, insisted Johnson needed to understand Iran was not seeking confrontation. Speaking after meeting his Nicaraguan counterpart, Denis Moncada, on Monday, he told reporters \u201cIt\u2019s important for everybody to realise, it\u2019s important for Boris Johnson to understand, that Iran does not seek confrontation. Iran wants to have normal relations based on mutual respect.\u201d Zarif made no reference to the UK-proposed EU-led maritime protection force but said: \u201cWe have 1,500 miles of coastline in the Persian Gulf. We are responsible for the security and the freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf. That is our lifeline.\u201d Using his usual description of the group around the hawkish US national security adviser John Bolton as the B-team, he said: \u201cIt is much much better for the United Kingdom not to be engaged in implementing the ploys of the B-team. The B-team is losing ground in the United States and now they are turning their attention to the UK. I guess the same policies that failed in the US will fail in the United Kingdom.\u201d The diplomat made the remarks after Britain delivered a volley of threatening messages to Iran in response to its seizure last Friday of a UK-flagged tanker. Stena Impero was captured and an investigation initiated after the tanker collided with an Iranian fishing boat in the Persian Gulf and refused to respond to its distress call. Zarif said Iran acted against Stena Impero only after the UK flouted maritime regulations. \u201cThe UK ship had turned down its signal for more time than it was allowed to [and] was passing through the wrong channel, endangering the safety and security of shipping and navigation in the strait of Hormuz, for which we are responsible,\u201d he said. Nathalie Loiseau, the former leader of Macron\u2019s party in the European parliament, said the two priorities were de-escalation and monitoring in the strait of Hormuz. Speaking on BBC World Tonight, she said: \u201cWhat I find extremely interesting when a British ship has been seized \u2013 and it\u2019s a question of high concern in the UK and rightly \u2013 there is this reflex to call the Europeans. At the very moment when you are talking about Brexit you can see we have common threats and have common ways of assessing threats. \u201cI listened carefully to the foreign secretary saying the initiative he has in mind is very different from the American initiative of a policy of maximum pressure.\u201d Additional reporting by Jennifer Rankin in Brussels",

Wilton\u2019s was built in 1859, as grand purpose-built music halls began to appear in London following changes in licensing laws. Crowds loved the mix of smutty and sentimental songs, as well as slapstick, circus performers and black face minstrels.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In 1878, drunken medical students incensed at the closure of their favourite haunt took to the streets and, urged on by cheering prostitutes, hurled firecrackers at the police</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>InBy the 1860s, music halls were drawing crowds twice as large as the old West End theatres, whose owners launched various countermeasures \u2013 including downright duplicitous manipulation of licensing loopholes \u2013 to get their rivals closed down. Music halls were also accused of harbouring prostitutes or providing entertainment of a low moral and intellectual calibre, which is precisely what made them so popular.</p> <p>Over time, proprietors closed their bars and toned down the acts so that by 1912, music hall was deemed acceptable even for royalty. That\u2019s when George V attended the Royal Variety Performance at the Palace Theatre. At Wilton\u2019s you can still see a mix of theatre, comedy and music \u2013 and there\u2019s also a great bar.</p> <h2>Dancing rooms: Argyll Rooms, Piccadilly</h2> <p>It\u2019s now a building site near Leicester Square, but when the Argyll Rooms lost its licence in 1878, there was a riot. Drunken medical students were so incensed at the closure of their favourite haunt they took to the streets and, urged on by cheering prostitutes, hurled firecrackers at the police.

Photograph: David Levene/ the Guardian</p></li> </ul> <p>A dance craze hit London in the 1840s, and a number of dancing rooms \u2013 or casinos \u2013 were opened, including Laurent\u2019s Casino off the Strand. This was London\u2019s first night-club, and it later transferred to the Argyll Rooms on Shaftesbury Avenue, taking over a space that had previously been used as a museum, automaton show and indoor \u201ccentrifugal railway\u201d \u2013 a primitive rollercoaster complete with loop-the-loop. The proprietor was Bob Bignell, a West End bookmaker, who saw money in the dancing trend. His club soon attracted crowds out for a good time \u2013 too much so for the authorities, leading to its eventual shutdown.</p> <p>The Argyll closed as the dance fad came to an end, and Bignell turned the space into the Trocadero music hall. It kept that name through the 20th century when it was transformed into one of London\u2019s naffest tourist attractions. The site currently awaits development into a hotel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"08e968568b1106e6d2941f72c9cc5cd39907c997\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08e968568b1106e6d2941f72c9cc5cd39907c997/0_0_1858_1346/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gin palaces were created partly to make gin drinking respectable; their decorative features are still the defining characteristics of modern pubs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gin palaces were created partly to make gin drinking respectable; their decorative features are still the defining characteristics of modern pubs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The History Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Gin palaces: Prince Alfred, Maida Vale</h2> <p>One of the most distinctive features of the handsome Prince Alfred pub in Maida Vale is the panelled dividers which you have to duck under to move from bar to bar. These were installed to ensure different classes of customer had their own safe space \u2013 and class was a major concern for Victorian moral authorities, who worried that the new forms of mass entertainment were cutting across traditional boundaries.</p> <p>Sumptuous boozers like the Prince Alfred, rich with decorative wood and etched glass, were created to partly address the class issue by making gin-drinking itself respectable \u2013 but even then, the different classes needed to know their place.</p> <p>Temperance campaigners were not satisfied. They argued that it was precisely the gorgeousness of the gin palace \u2013 the gaslight and gilding, brass fixtures and fittings, large windows, etched glass and mirrors, not to mention the innovation of counter service \u2013 that lured more respectable members of the working-class into the sinful public house. Despite such concerns, these would all become standard features of the Victorian pub and remain the defining characteristics of the pubs we use today.</p> <h2>Pleasure gardens: Cremorne Gardens, Chelsea</h2> <p>A set of wrought iron gates by a riverside park are all that remain of the Cremorne, once one of the most notorious of London\u2019s Victorian pleasure gardens. Stretching from the Kings Road to the Thames, it opened in 1843 and along with the gardens at Vauxhall, Highbury Barn, Walworth and Islington\u2019s Eagle Tavern, catered for thousands of nightly visitors.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Balloonist Madame Poitevin took to the air on the back of a bull. The balloon crashed in Ilford and the animal died of shock, causing the RSPCA to get involved</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The average pleasure garden had promenades, bandstands and follies, plus curious performers such as Michael Boai, who played music on his chin, or \u201cthe Beckwith frogs\u201d, a family who ate breakfast in an underwater tank. There were elaborate firework displays, including Cremorne\u2019s pyro-boosted pride-restoring recreations of the Crimean War and Indian Mutiny. Another Victorian favourite was the novelty hot-air balloon ascent. At Cremorne, a balloonist called Madame Poitevin took to the air on the back of a bull. The balloon crashed in Ilford and the animal died of shock, causing the RSPCA to get involved.</p> <p>Cremorne was managed by a trio of West End publicans, and became identified with a fast set who would swan down to Chelsea after the theatres had closed, raising hell.

      "bodyText": "Whether it was visiting a \u201chuman zoo\u201d, taking a bull on a hot-air balloon ride, or singing risqu\u00e9 songs about rhubarb, Victorian Londoners loved to have fun. As entrepreneurs and impresarios came up with increasingly elaborate ways to make money from the capital\u2019s huge potential audience, Victorians effectively invented the modern leisure industry \u2013 including theme parks, pubs and professional football. As a new book by historian Lee Jackson explains, the hunt for profit took place against the backdrop of typical Victorian concerns surrounding morality, class and empire. So where did Victorians go for fun? And what still exists today? Music halls: Wilton\u2019s, Whitechapel You probably won\u2019t hear the music hall classic Pulling My Rhubarb Out at Wilton\u2019s these days but this back-street Wapping theatre is one of the few Victorian music halls still standing. Wilton\u2019s was built in 1859, as grand purpose-built music halls began to appear in London following changes in licensing laws. Crowds loved the mix of smutty and sentimental songs, as well as slapstick, circus performers and black face minstrels. InBy the 1860s, music halls were drawing crowds twice as large as the old West End theatres, whose owners launched various countermeasures \u2013 including downright duplicitous manipulation of licensing loopholes \u2013 to get their rivals closed down. Music halls were also accused of harbouring prostitutes or providing entertainment of a low moral and intellectual calibre, which is precisely what made them so popular. Over time, proprietors closed their bars and toned down the acts so that by 1912, music hall was deemed acceptable even for royalty. That\u2019s when George V attended the Royal Variety Performance at the Palace Theatre. At Wilton\u2019s you can still see a mix of theatre, comedy and music \u2013 and there\u2019s also a great bar. Dancing rooms: Argyll Rooms, Piccadilly It\u2019s now a building site near Leicester Square, but when the Argyll Rooms lost its licence in 1878, there was a riot. Drunken medical students were so incensed at the closure of their favourite haunt they took to the streets and, urged on by cheering prostitutes, hurled firecrackers at the police. That gives you an idea of the sort of crowd that used to frequent the Argyll Rooms, the West End\u2019s premier and most dissolute dance hall. The Trocadero in London, formerly the Argyll Rooms, which opened in response to a dance craze in the 1840s. Photograph: David Levene/ the Guardian A dance craze hit London in the 1840s, and a number of dancing rooms \u2013 or casinos \u2013 were opened, including Laurent\u2019s Casino off the Strand. This was London\u2019s first night-club, and it later transferred to the Argyll Rooms on Shaftesbury Avenue, taking over a space that had previously been used as a museum, automaton show and indoor \u201ccentrifugal railway\u201d \u2013 a primitive rollercoaster complete with loop-the-loop. The proprietor was Bob Bignell, a West End bookmaker, who saw money in the dancing trend. His club soon attracted crowds out for a good time \u2013 too much so for the authorities, leading to its eventual shutdown. The Argyll closed as the dance fad came to an end, and Bignell turned the space into the Trocadero music hall. It kept that name through the 20th century when it was transformed into one of London\u2019s naffest tourist attractions. The site currently awaits development into a hotel. Gin palaces: Prince Alfred, Maida Vale One of the most distinctive features of the handsome Prince Alfred pub in Maida Vale is the panelled dividers which you have to duck under to move from bar to bar. These were installed to ensure different classes of customer had their own safe space \u2013 and class was a major concern for Victorian moral authorities, who worried that the new forms of mass entertainment were cutting across traditional boundaries. Sumptuous boozers like the Prince Alfred, rich with decorative wood and etched glass, were created to partly address the class issue by making gin-drinking itself respectable \u2013 but even then, the different classes needed to know their place. Temperance campaigners were not satisfied. They argued that it was precisely the gorgeousness of the gin palace \u2013 the gaslight and gilding, brass fixtures and fittings, large windows, etched glass and mirrors, not to mention the innovation of counter service \u2013 that lured more respectable members of the working-class into the sinful public house. Despite such concerns, these would all become standard features of the Victorian pub and remain the defining characteristics of the pubs we use today. Pleasure gardens: Cremorne Gardens, Chelsea A set of wrought iron gates by a riverside park are all that remain of the Cremorne, once one of the most notorious of London\u2019s Victorian pleasure gardens. Stretching from the Kings Road to the Thames, it opened in 1843 and along with the gardens at Vauxhall, Highbury Barn, Walworth and Islington\u2019s Eagle Tavern, catered for thousands of nightly visitors. The average pleasure garden had promenades, bandstands and follies, plus curious performers such as Michael Boai, who played music on his chin, or \u201cthe Beckwith frogs\u201d, a family who ate breakfast in an underwater tank. There were elaborate firework displays, including Cremorne\u2019s pyro-boosted pride-restoring recreations of the Crimean War and Indian Mutiny. Another Victorian favourite was the novelty hot-air balloon ascent. At Cremorne, a balloonist called Madame Poitevin took to the air on the back of a bull. The balloon crashed in Ilford and the animal died of shock, causing the RSPCA to get involved. Cremorne was managed by a trio of West End publicans, and became identified with a fast set who would swan down to Chelsea after the theatres had closed, raising hell. Brawls were commonplace, and the gardens were popular with prostitutes and Londoners looking for fun. It closed in 1877, after losing its licence. Pleasure gardens more generally lost their raison d\u2019etre with the establishment of public parks. London\u2019s rapid growth meant the valuable land was usually sold to developers, which is why so little of London\u2019s great pleasure gardens remain. Exhibition grounds: Crystal Palace, Sydenham Pleasure gardens were also overshadowed by larger exhibition grounds such as the Crystal Palace, which tried to find a way of balancing entertainment with a hard dose of cultural education. Little physically remains of the Crystal Palace itself, which moved to Sydenham from Hyde Park in 1854, but the grand 200-acre grounds still exist as a public park. The great glass building was used as a sort of showcase for luxury goods but also had zones with fine art, artefacts and historic architecture such as a Roman villa and 50-ft copies of the statues of Ramesses II in Abu Simbel. There were dioramas showing flora and fauna from around the world, complete with models of West Indians and Native Americans. The gardens hosted elaborate entertainments \u2013 a race featuring ponies ridden by monkeys was one highlight \u2013 as well as plays, operas and pantomimes. There was also a \u201chuman zoo\u201d featuring 60 Somalis, transported from Africa to be gawped at by curious South London. The Crystal Palace was destroyed by fire in 1936 but its footprint remains, while you can get a sense of its somewhat haphazard educational ambition through the beloved stone statues of dinosaurs.

It was railways that made Margate and Southend accessible to Londoners, and some of the leisure activities peculiar to the seaside soon made it back to the capital.

      "bodyText": "Gruff, iconoclastic and relentlessly on-message, Bernie Sanders thrilled the progressive left when he ran for president in 2016 and came within striking distance of capturing the Democratic nomination. This time around, Sanders\u2019 ideas are shaping the policy debate in the race for the party\u2019s 2020 nomination, but the 77-year-old senator finds himself struggling to stand out in a younger and more diverse field of candidates. His once-sturdy second-place standing in the polls has slipped. This quarter, Sanders was out-raised by Elizabeth Warren, his closest ideological rival who has also rejected high-dollar fundraisers. \u201cBernie\u2019s ideas aren\u2019t just Bernie\u2019s any more,\u201d said Carolyn Fiddler, the communications director for the progressive politics blog the Daily Kos. \u201cThe conversation that he brought to 2016 \u2013 the issues that he brought to 2016 \u2013 have been co-opted by other candidates. And he alone does not represent the progressive wing of the Democratic party.\u201d And in Miami last month, in the first Democratic presidential debate, Sanders was largely overshadowed by the clash between the former vice-president Joe Biden, seen as the current frontrunner, and Senator Kamala Harris of California, who has been rising in profile and polls. Squeezed by questions over electability and a deep desire among Democrats to elevate women and people of color, Sanders is attempting to reset the debate on his own terms. Last week, he vigorously defended his signature Medicare for All healthcare proposal, sharpening the battle lines over an issue that is animating the Democratic presidential race. \u201cNow is the time not for tinkering around the edges,\u201d Sanders said, an implicit reference to candidates like Biden, who oppose the plan. \u201cNow is the time to do what every other major country on earth does, now is time to do what the American people want us to do, now is the time to pass a Medicare for All, single-payer program.\u201d In his remarks, Sanders also challenged his rivals to join him in rejecting campaign donations from lobbyists, executives and political action committees of health insurance and pharmaceutical companies. This pledge targets Biden, whose campaign has accepted money from healthcare executives, according to publicly available financial reports, and includes an aide who has previously lobbied on behalf of pharmaceutical companies and a hospital association. \u201cCandidates who are not willing to take that pledge,\u201d Sanders said, \u201cshould explain to the American people why those corporate interests believe their campaigns are a good investment.\u201d In many ways, the speech also served to distinguish Sanders on a central campaign issue from the other candidates, several of whom have backed his healthcare plan or versions of it. \u201cHe\u2019s saying this is his issue,\u201d said the progressive strategist Rebecca Katz. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the other candidates aren\u2019t also for Medicare for All, but this speech shows voters that he is willing to fight for it harder than anyone else in the race.\u201d Next week Sanders will appear on a debate stage with Warren. The pair have so far dispatched questions about their rivalry by emphasizing their friendship \u2013 and allies of both camps see little to be gained by turning on one another. Sanders\u2019 campaign leaders say they are unfazed by the shifting dynamics of the nomination contest at this early stage. \u201cProgressives know where he stands. They understand the man and they understand his mission,\u201d said Nina Turner, the former Ohio state senator who is co-chair of his campaign. She added: \u201cWhether it\u2019s Medicare for All, student debt or raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, these issues are now part of the mainstream discussion because Senator Sanders had the courage to put them there.\u201d The senator has maintained a devoted base of voters, and entered July with more money than any other Democratic candidate \u2013 long-term advantages that could prove crucial. And he has addressed shortcomings from his first run, building a campaign led by women and people of color. He has also made inroads with African Americans and sharpened his message on racial justice. Yet he has struggled to expand his support. Yvette Simpson, the chief executive of the political action committee Democracy for America, said Sanders won the battle of ideas in 2016 \u2013 now his challenge is to offer a plan for achieving his vision. Less preacher and more prophet, she suggested. \u201cThe question isn\u2019t whether we trust his motivation. It\u2019s: will he show us the way?\u201d she said. \u201cCan he pivot from being a cheerleader to being the guide?\u201d In 2016, Democracy for America endorsed Sanders after he won support from a supermajority of its membership. But a new poll of its members showed Warren and Harris encroaching on Sanders\u2019s top spot. \u201cWe need to hear a different voice from him, too,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cWe know he\u2019s a fighter and a champion in the issues.

The Sanders campaign believes its path to the nomination rests on its success in \u201cexpanding the electorate\u201d \u2013 engaging non-traditional and disaffected voters and turning them into supporters. Their approach consists of novel organizing tactics, such as \u201cdistributed organizing\u201d that trains volunteers to host events, phone bank and register voters, as well as efforts to turn out his supporters on picket lines and protests. Last week Sanders joined a protest against the planned closure of a hospital in Philadelphia that serves low-income people \u2013 a stop he made a day after skipping Netroots Nation, the annual progressive conference held there last week. And the campaign is proud that after Sanders confronted Walmart executives at their annual shareholders\u2019 meeting, the company\u2019s workers were the most frequent contributors by employer to his campaign. Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families party, said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be essential for anybody who wins to be deeply committed to building a multiracial movement that leaves no working person unconsidered. Every single working person is going to matter. That\u2019s the challenge and the test.\u201d As Trump and Republicans escalate their assault on Democrats, accusing them of being a party of \u201csocialists\u201d with a vision for the country that is not only \u201cextreme\u201d but un-American, Biden and an increasingly punchy group of lower-tier moderate candidates are betting that centrism and compromise \u2013 not socialism \u2013 will win the day.

Alan Duncan quit as a Foreign Office minister on Monday and Anne Milton as education minister on Tuesday, rather than serve under Johnson.</p> \n<p>The chancellor, Philip Hammond, the justice secretary, David Gauke, and the international development secretary, Rory Stewart, are expected to join them on the backbenches after the leadership change.</p> \n<p>Stewart confirmed he would return to the backbenches on Wednesday, tweeting: \u201cBackbench tomorrow serving Cumbria.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson will become Britain\u2019s next prime minister after winning a convincing victory over Jeremy Hunt in the Conservative party leadership race. The former mayor of London, who has long cherished an ambition to lead his country, won 66% of the votes \u2013 92,153, to Hunt\u2019s 46,656. Turnout was 87.4% among 159,320 party members. In a characteristically lighthearted acceptance speech, Johnson conceded that even some of his own supporters may \u201cwonder quite what they have done\u201d. He claimed the Tory party had historically demonstrated it could \u201cmanage the jostling instincts in the human heart\u201d \u2013 such as those of owning a home and helping the poorest in society. \u201cToday, at this pivotal moment in our history, we again have to reconcile two noble sets of instincts \u2013 between the deep desire for friendship and free trade and mutual support and security and defence between Britain and our European partners; and the simultaneous desire, equally heartfelt, for democratic self-government in this country.\u201d He reminded his audience of ministers and party staff of his campaign mantra: \u201cDeliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn.\u201d Saying \u201csome wag\u201d had pointed out that this spelled \u201cdud\u201d, he joked that the final e \u2013 \u201cE for energise\u201d \u2013 had been left out. \u201cI say to all the doubters: dude, we are going to energise the country!\u201d And Johnson said he would \u201cget Brexit done by 31 October\u201d with a \u201cnew spirit of can-do\u201d. \u201cWe are once again going to believe in ourselves and what we can achieve, and like some slumbering giant we are going to rise and ping off the guy-ropes of self-doubt and negativity.\u201d The result of the contest was announced by the joint chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, Cheryl Gillan. Her colleague, Charles Walker, first urged MPs to be \u201ckinder\u201d to the new leader than they had been to Theresa May. Brandon Lewis, the Conservative party chair, introduced the slick event at a conference centre in Westminster, saying the race had shown that his party was fundamentally united. Johnson\u2019s victory was almost immediately welcomed by Donald Trump, who tweeted: \u201cHe will be great!\u201d But Johnson was left in no doubt about the opposition he will face from his own benches if he attempts to force through a no-deal Brexit. Alan Duncan quit as a Foreign Office minister on Monday and Anne Milton as education minister on Tuesday, rather than serve under Johnson. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, the justice secretary, David Gauke, and the international development secretary, Rory Stewart, are expected to join them on the backbenches after the leadership change. Stewart confirmed he would return to the backbenches on Wednesday, tweeting: \u201cBackbench tomorrow serving Cumbria. Thank you all. More walking!\u201d Johnson addressed Tory MPs at a meeting of the 1922 Committee on Tuesday afternoon, as well as thanking party staff and his own campaign team. He will not take office formally until Wednesday afternoon. May will face her final prime minister\u2019s questions in the House of Commons before tendering her resignation to the Queen. Johnson will then go to Buckingham Palace for his appointment to be confirmed before being driven to Downing Street to give a speech in front of the black door of No 10. He takes charge at a perilous political moment. The Conservatives\u2019 wafer-thin parliamentary working majority is expected to be eroded further next week \u2013 to just two \u2013 if the Liberal Democrats win the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. Johnson has faced a furious internal revolt even before arriving in Downing Street, with several key cabinet ministers, including Hammond saying they would resign rather than serve under him. They have been alarmed by Johnson\u2019s insistence that he is willing to countenance leaving the European Union without a deal on 31 October, rather than postpone Brexit once again, even if that meant proroguing parliament. Despite painstaking media management, his campaign has been dogged by a series of controversies, including the revelation that police had been called to a noisy argument at the home he shares with his partner, Carrie Symonds. Johnson was also blamed by some colleagues, including Duncan for the resignation of the ambassador to Washington, Sir Kim Darroch, after confidential diplomatic cables about Trump were leaked. Duncan said the former foreign secretary had thrown Darroch \u201cunder a bus\u201d. However, Johnson had been the runaway favourite to become leader after securing support from both wings of the bitterly divided Tory party, from the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to the chair of the European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg. He is regarded by colleagues as an impressive political campaigner, and the man with the best chance of seeing off the formidable electoral challenge from Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party, which beat the Tories soundly in May\u2019s European elections. May will leave Downing Street on Wednesday after a three-year premiership overwhelmingly defined by the failure of her government to implement Brexit. Johnson is likely to embark on fresh negotiations with EU leaders and key Brussels decision makers as soon as possible, with a view to securing changes to May\u2019s deal in time for the Halloween deadline. But with no secure majority, and Labour determined to demand a referendum on any deal he brings back from Brussels, many MPs believe he could be forced to call a general election within months in order to win a mandate for his plan.",

It\u2019s being hit by the double blow of Brexit uncertainty and slower global growth. \u201cWith orders, employment, investment, output and business optimism all deteriorating among manufacturers, it\u2019s crucial for the new prime minister to secure a Brexit deal ahead of the October deadline. And get on with pressing domestic priorities, from improving our infrastructure to fixing the apprenticeship levy. \u201cThis will allow firms to focus on investing in new technology and tackling the skill shortages that plague this sector.\u201d The CBI\u2019s gloomy survey came as a leading Bank of England policymaker said Brexit risks could scupper plans to raise interest rates even if the bank\u2019s forecasts suggested the economy was ready for a hike. While those forecasts assume a smooth Brexit, Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, told Bloomberg that the outcome was uncertain. Its comments suggested that economic projections by the central bank may not be enough to convince Saunders \u2013 recently one of the more hawkish MPC members \u2013 to vote for a rate rise in the coming months. Interest rates were cut to a record low of 0.25% in the aftermath of the EU referendum but have since been raised twice to reach 0.75%. Saunders voted in favour of the Bank of England\u2019s last two hikes, but said that economic forecasts had little influence on those decisions. \u201cThe link from the forecast to my actual vote was quite loose,\u201d he said. While markets have started pricing in the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and subsequent interest rate cuts, the Bank\u2019s central forecasts are still based on a smooth exit from the EU. Saunders\u2019 comments raise the prospect of an interest rate cut in the case of a no-deal Brexit, the prospect of which has risen since Theresa May\u2019s resignation as prime minister. Boris Johnson, announced on Tuesday as May\u2019s successor, has said that Britain will leave the EU on 31 October, \u201cdo or die\u201d. Saunders\u2019s fellow Bank policymaker, Gertjan Vlieghe, warned earlier this month that crashing out of the bloc without an agreement could result in a prolonged period with interest rates at a record low level of almost zero. Vlieghe said he would be prepared to cut borrowing costs aggressively in the event that the UK leaves without a transition deal. However, should Britain secure an agreement, Saunders told Bloomberg that rates would probably rise over time. In a separate speech, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said that it would take more than the current sluggishness of the economy to persuade him to cut interest rates. \u201cI would be very cautious about considering a monetary policy loosening barring some sharp economic downturn\u201d, Haldane said in Scunthorpe. Despite \u201cBrexit-related volatility\u201d, Haldane said the UK\u2019s underlying growth rate was steady, the high employment rate was pushing up pay and there were signs that the housing market had bottomed out. The Bank\u2019s chief economist said there was a risk that low interest rates could become normalised and that it was \u201cimportant that monetary policy is not a prisoner of its past, that the monetary cavalry are not called at the first whiff of grapeshot, that a dependency culture around monetary policy is not allowed to develop.\u201d The rate-setting monetary policy committee will publish its next set of economic forecasts on 1 August as part of its quarterly inflation report. The City expects borrowing costs to remain unchanged.",

After the meeting, the head of marketing called me into a side room and played me Not Gonna Get Us, the Russian version, and All the Things She Said (the Russian version). He said they wanted to see if they could cross it over. He asked me if I'd remake two tracks for them. I was intrigued by the idea but they obviously tried a couple of people after that, before me. A couple of DJs remixing them, but it didn't work. I don't think they had much money. Interestingly enough, I thought when they offered it to me, I thought I was gonna get the multitrack from the Russian version but they wouldn't give it to me, so I had to completely remake the record. Writing the lyric for that song was one of the most difficult things I ever had to do. It took me a long time to figure it out. I had a translation of the Russian lyric, and it was like, \"yes I'm mad! I am on fire for her!\" I didn't have a clue. And I also knew they couldn't sing English very well. So I tried to write the lyric as if it was a translation of something. \"I'm in serious shit, I feel totally lost\" - and it worked! Not immediately - we spent two weeks working on their voices on that track. And there was no budget so I had to play all the instruments myself. My late wife said, you had all these bloody guitars, time to put them to use! I ended up quite enjoying it really. Sometimes records come out well, sometimes they don't, but that one did. There was one point where we gave up for a day - we thought, we've blown it. I remember having a day off then going back to the Russian version and thinking, I've made a mistake somewhere. I found the way that the Russian version repeated certain words was really clever, so I changed mine the same way - \"running through my head, running through my head\". By then, the girls had gone back to Russia. But luckily we got the first access to some software that allowed us to change the pitch of their voices.</p> <p>Not Gonna Get Us - I had to write the Russian lyrics out phonetically. It's difficult, man, it really is tricky. I have to be honest, when I finished it, a guy said to me, what do you think? And I said, if you listen past the first chorus, it's a really good record. I was being my normal doom-laden self. I forgot about it then got a call and said it's No 1. Then we sold 7, 8m albums really fast.</p> <p>They were nice girls. We got on really well. They both could play the piano quite brilliantly. It made me think in a lot of ways, the Russians have a lot of culture that we don't have. The Russian guy was awful, I didn't like the manager. He said, \"I've got two girls, trying to get them to sing in English\" \u2013 that's not a situation where you're going to start being rough with people, but he would say to me, \"you're too kind, you're too gentle\". I was like, if you think you can do better... You'd do an hour, have a break, do another hour - he said, \"you need to push!\" I said, \"go ahead if you want\". He went in, within five minutes, both of them were crying. So I kicked him out. There's no shortcut, you can't bully people. So I didn't like him. But I liked the girls. They were both bumming cigarettes off me. They were 18, the manager didn't want them to be seen smoking. They were my daughters' age. Nice girls.</p> <p>The lesbian thing, they told me, we're not really \"career lesbians\". But it wasn't of any interest to me. I wrote the lyric of the song, the whole thing about \"all the things she said\", the original Russian one, was about two girls that had a crush on each other and didn't know whether they wanted to act on it. So I wrote it like that. That's what it was about.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/live/2019/jul/19/trevor-horn-webchat-post-your-questions-now#comment-131292916\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/101640255\" title=\"View trevor_horn\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/101640255\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for trevor_horn\"> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/101640255\" title=\"View trevor_horn\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">trevor_horn</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/131292916\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">23 July 2019 12:55pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>I tell you what was amazing, was when Russia hosted Eurovision - they played an acoustic version of Not Gonna Get Us singing in English lyrics.

Mute is really a one-off. It's the only record label like it. ZTT was very different because we signed three acts and in that first year we broke all three acts. Did all the development and broke them in a year.

You try having the hottest act around when you're a tiny subsidiary of Island and see how long you last. Propaganda only made one record on ZTT, the second was Virgin, so we couldn't really be blamed for that. Frankie's second album was always going to be difficult, like it is for any group after your first album.

They had a pressing plant out the back. Malcolm had hired a choir called the Hilltoppers. There was eight of them, they turned up in a purple van, they looked a bit like something from Deliverance. I set them up and we put the mics up in the air, we were trying to record Buffalo Gals and they were awful, absolutely awful. Malcolm came to me and said, they're awful, get rid of them! So I had to pretend to record them, then I gave them $70. They were really happy. That wasn't something I would enjoy! Things like - we went to Harlem in 1982, you practically needed an armoured car. We went to see a Cuban guy - that was something else. He gave us some cigarettes to smoke and we barely made it out. Those were the kind of things.

My PA in Los Angeles had a part-time job doing the dressing rooms for the Coachella festival. Her name is Marianne. And she met Belle and Sebastian because they were playing at Coachella. When she told them that she worked for me, they were interested in what I was like. I think they had no idea what somebody like me was like. And she obviously gave me a good report because the next thing was, I went to meet them in Scotland and I heard all of the songs for DCW. I had heard Belle and Sebastian quite a lot because my eldest daughter was a big fan. I loved one of their songs, Stars of Track and Field. When I met them we all seemed to like each other so we did a dummy run on the album up in Glasgow, recording the whole album in a day, straight into the computer. I wanted to get a feeling for what it would be like. I really enjoyed making that record, and I do think it came out really well - people always associate me with big whizz-bangy things, but actually that was a completely different kind of job. More like old-style record production - they liked take #15 and I liked take #9. And they're lovely people.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d36efbd8f0845f89e3129b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-23T11:31:48.077Z\">12.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17276023\">SpecialOrder937</a> asks:</p> <p><em>I have a two-part question in respect of vinyl.</em></p> <p><em>For me the Two Tribes 12in singles versions defined the 12in era, and the format opened up creative possibilities for many songs.

      "bodyText": "AlexNeedham asks: Slave to the Rhythm is a classic. What was Grace Jones like to work with, would you ever make another record with her, and whose idea was it to have an album that was one song done eight ways? BillyBudd asks: What are your thoughts on the production of ABC\u2019s Beauty Stab (their follow up to Lexicon) and how different would it have sounded if you had produced it? Xoxarle asks: Do you regret circumstances preventing you from having a crack at Propaganda\u2019s A Secret Wish, a ZTT highpoint, and how different would it have sounded if you and not Steve Lipson had manned the mixing desk? GregRandall asks: Are you still in touch with Paul Morley and how much did he contribute to the mid 80s ZZT image? It was his album sleeve texts, especially on Into Battle With the Art of Noise and Propaganda\u2019s Secret Wish that turned me on to \u201cart\u201d. Regards. DWFan1 asks: What\u2019s your favourite Pixar film? chrisgriff asks: What happened with Lee Griffiths? He was tipped for wonderful things in the late 90s, then he was supposed to have an album produced by you. But he disappeared. AlexNorris asks: You produced two of the best pop singles of the 2000s in t.A.T.u.\u2019s All the Things She Said and Not Gonna Get Us \u2013 how did you end up getting involved with the group and how did you find working with Yulia and Lena? 25aubrey asks: Just looking at the album cover of English Garden, which incidentally is still in perfect condition after 40 years, and what I\u2019d like to ask is, which palm house was it shot in? I may be wrong here, but was it in Sefton Park, Liverpool? Saf45K asks: Were you aware how influential Art of Noise\u2019s track Beatbox was in hip-hop, and what can you tell us about Anne Dudley\u2019s wonderful piano outro? Buzzaboom asks: Did you realise that Art of Noise were so ground breaking at the time? I can\u2019t imagine many people being in a studio and thinking \u2018this literally hasn\u2019t existed before\u2019. Brian Capaloff asks: I can recall getting a front row seat for Yes many years ago, at the Rainbow, with Geoff Downes and you having just taken over the vocal and keyboard reins. How did that period feel for you, bearing in mind the nature of the audience and the music, which was vastly different from Video Killed the Radio Star (a rendition of which was given at the gig!). Saf45K asks: Whose idea was it to release remixes of FGTH\u2019s Two Tribe? Were you surprised it was at No 1 for 9 weeks? How did you spend the cash? concerndium asks: You were groundbreaking with your use of samplers, but synth-wise, what direction do you lean, East or West coast? Stevewebster60 asks: What was it like to work with Lol Creme of 10cc. Is he as talented as I think he is? jimble675 asks: What was the inspiration behind the \u201cLove, coupled with a minced pie\u201d lyric as spoken by Arnold Rimmer on War off of Welcome to the Pleasuredome? Ever since, I\u2019ve always thought the world\u2019s problems could be solved with mince pies, but, to be frank, the lack of a more liquid-based accompaniment to this vision of Xanadu has left me scratching my head... regularjoe65 asks: Which albums that you\u2019ve worked on do you have the fondest memories of &amp; which ones do you think have aged the best? Daz Dazzy Dazzo Noyce asks: ZTT created an \u201cexperience\u201d and \u201ceco-system\u201d long before those marketing folk coined these terms. Who gets the credit for this? And why has the model not been repeated since? SirGodfreyMutton asks: Did you learn much from Yes or Eddie Offord. If you did, in what ways? Comeagain asks: ZTT are claimed to have been an over zealous record label, intent on controlling groups as opposed to nurturing them? Labels such as Mute have always had an approach of supporting the artist/group develop, would Trevor say that ZTT had a similar approach and contest what many groups have said? watlington asks: I liked your idea of using tiny transistor radio speakers to sort out mixes and have used it ever since I heard you waxing about the \u201cif it sounds good on these it\u2019ll sound amazing on something decent\u201d mantra. A couple of beat up Binatone speakers, then on to the Yamaha monitors, and it\u2019s spot-on every time. Do you still work that way? voiceofq asks: I\u2019d love to know your views on production skills and innovation today given the advances made in technology and the multitude of training opportunities that are more easily accessible. What would you say is the tool or technique that is changing the production game currently and do you have a producer you would recommend as the next \u201cTrevor Horn\u201d? Wishing you all the best in all you do! timnorfolk asks: Why did you get Fly From Here deleted in favour of a new version with your voice instead of Benoit David, and will it ever be commercially available? bluepuzzle asks: You pretty much provided the soundtrack to my earlier years and will have influenced my listening habits ever since. So thank you for that!Have you ever met Max Martin? If you were to have a \u201cProducer-off\u201d competition with him by picking one of today\u2019s pop artists, who would you choose to work with? DanWorsley asks: Malcolm McLaren seemed like a bit of a character. What was your experience working with him like and did it affect the subsequent work you did? Nidoc101 asks: Dear Trevor, almost four decades on would you conclude that video really did kill the radio star? SamandAmysDad asks: Dear Catastrophe Waitress is unquestionably the best Belle &amp; Sebastian album, largely due to the fantastic production. How did this seemingly unusual combination come about and were you pleased with the results? SpecialOrder937 asks: I have a two-part question in respect of vinyl. For me the Two Tribes 12in singles versions defined the 12in era, and the format opened up creative possibilities for many songs. But did you find the LP format limiting in those days, compared to what can be achieved today? And (this part two of the question) the LP has regained popularity in recent years. What do you make of the resurgence? Flingo asks: I had Lexicon of Love and the Frankie blockbusters with all the big production sound, but I have to say I would put little old Back of My Hand by the Jags ahead of them. What was it you could do for ABC and Frankie you couldn\u2019t do for the Jags? midnightrambler1971 asks: As an early advocate of modern recording technology, is it finally time to admit that computers have actually ruined music? Manamind asks: Trevor, is Machine Messiah still one of your favourite tracks and how was it producing Jon [Anderson] in 90125 after Drama? Was there any drama? fannybygastropub asks: What kind of music do you relax to? And if you could travel back in time which artists would you have liked to work with? richgart asks: You said that you were attracted to tracks for the lyrics in selecting for the 80s album, who is your favourite lyricist and what is your favourite lyric? Scott McLennan asks: Given Prodigy\u2019s Firestarter samples Art Of Noise, have you ever discussed your differing styles of production with Liam Howlett? What were your initial thoughts when you first heard Firestarter in 1996? Scott adds: You stepped back in as Seal\u2019s producer for Seal IV after his proposed 2001 album Togetherland was scrapped. What is the greatest recording you\u2019ve been involved with that has never seen the light of day? He\u2019s credited as the man who invented the 80s \u2013 or at least its sound, thanks to his early acquisition of a Fairlight sampler and a LinnDrum machine. Whoever else might lay claim to that title, Trevor Horn certainly predicted pop\u2019s most visual era as half of the Buggles, with their massive 1979 hit Video Killed the Radio Star, and then capitalised on it in the decade to come.

They spent years pestering the R&amp;A to try to persuade them to bring the Open back there. In the end it almost got to be a running joke. Every Open starts with a press conference held by the R&amp;A\u2019s chief executive and one of the Irish journalists would always make a point of asking whether they had any plans to bring the championship back there for the first time in 51, 52, 53 years and counting. And the R&amp;A\u2019s chief executive, Peter Dawson, would always find some new way to fob them off, usually something about the political climate, or the security risks, or the infrastructure concerns, or the commercial needs.</p> \n<p>Then Padraig Harrington won the Open at Carnoustie in 2007 and again at Royal Birkdale a year later. And Graeme McDowell won at Pebble Beach in 2010. And Darren Clarke won at Royal St George\u2019s in 2011. And some young, mop-haired kid called Rory McIlroy cleaned up at Congressional in 2011 and Kiawah Island in 2012 and Royal Liverpool and Valhalla in 2014. There are no borders in Irish golf and they all counted as Irish victories. And in the middle of McIlroy\u2019s run Dawson finally relented and made the announcement that the R&amp;A were going to bring the Open back to Portrush after all.</p> \n<p>By then the Irish weren\u2019t asking for the Open but demanding it. Their success has defined this era of the championship. Between them they have won it as many times in the past 12 years as the English have in the previous 68. And it\u2019s an Open secret that their previous four major champions \u2013 Harrington, McDowell, Clarke and McIlroy \u2013 spent a lot of time lobbying the R&amp;A to bring it here. \u201cGentle ribbing,\u201d McDowell called it. The R&amp;A still waited to see whether or not Portrush would do a good job of hosting the Irish Open in 2012, when, in the end, so many people turned up that they broke the attendance record for the European Tour.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d7a201445ed2c2032cdd7b04d7ff3d48b3b171f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d7a201445ed2c2032cdd7b04d7ff3d48b3b171f/0_0_5204_3123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shane Lowry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shane Lowry soaks up the affection at Portrush.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jan Kruger/R&amp;A via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Well, on Wednesday morning, right around the time that some of the heavier hangovers from Sunday night celebrating the latest Irish major winner may just be beginning to lift, there will be another milestone in sporting relations between the two nations.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a wonder the Irish are so well known for their hospitality when you consider the state of some of the people they have to welcome. The very same day play got under way in the 148th Open the papers here led with the Boris Johnson line, first reported in the Financial Times, about Leo Varadkar, \u201cwhy isn\u2019t he called Murphy like all the rest of them?\u201d Add it to the list, along with Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s blithe dismissal of \u201cthis Irish stuff\u201d, Karen Bradley\u2019s blunt admission of her own ignorance of the difference between unionists and nationalists, Priti Patel\u2019s bright idea to leverage the threat of food shortages in the Brexit negotiations, and countless others. \u201cWhat kills you is the ignorance,\u201d the Irish journalist Megan Nolan wrote in the Irish Times last October, about her experience of living in England for three years. \u201cWhat grinds you down is how much they don\u2019t know about the past and, if they do know, how little they care.\u201d In the Guardian, Ireland\u2019s former ambassador to the UK, Bobby McDonagh, couched it in more diplomatic language. \u201cA large swathe of opinion in London, although of course by no means everyone, has come to misunderstand seven major aspects of Ireland: our motivation, allegiance, influence, intelligence, resolve, politics and friendship.\u201d Pottering around Portrush last week was a short, quick and incomplete reminder of all this English obliviousness. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever tell me how beautiful Portrush is when the sun\u2019s out?\u201d I asked a friend who spent all his young summers here. \u201cYou never asked.\u201d The Irish did. They spent years pestering the R&amp;A to try to persuade them to bring the Open back there. In the end it almost got to be a running joke. Every Open starts with a press conference held by the R&amp;A\u2019s chief executive and one of the Irish journalists would always make a point of asking whether they had any plans to bring the championship back there for the first time in 51, 52, 53 years and counting. And the R&amp;A\u2019s chief executive, Peter Dawson, would always find some new way to fob them off, usually something about the political climate, or the security risks, or the infrastructure concerns, or the commercial needs. Then Padraig Harrington won the Open at Carnoustie in 2007 and again at Royal Birkdale a year later. And Graeme McDowell won at Pebble Beach in 2010. And Darren Clarke won at Royal St George\u2019s in 2011. And some young, mop-haired kid called Rory McIlroy cleaned up at Congressional in 2011 and Kiawah Island in 2012 and Royal Liverpool and Valhalla in 2014. There are no borders in Irish golf and they all counted as Irish victories. And in the middle of McIlroy\u2019s run Dawson finally relented and made the announcement that the R&amp;A were going to bring the Open back to Portrush after all. By then the Irish weren\u2019t asking for the Open but demanding it. Their success has defined this era of the championship. Between them they have won it as many times in the past 12 years as the English have in the previous 68. And it\u2019s an Open secret that their previous four major champions \u2013 Harrington, McDowell, Clarke and McIlroy \u2013 spent a lot of time lobbying the R&amp;A to bring it here. \u201cGentle ribbing,\u201d McDowell called it. The R&amp;A still waited to see whether or not Portrush would do a good job of hosting the Irish Open in 2012, when, in the end, so many people turned up that they broke the attendance record for the European Tour. Well, on Wednesday morning, right around the time that some of the heavier hangovers from Sunday night celebrating the latest Irish major winner may just be beginning to lift, there will be another milestone in sporting relations between the two nations. Ireland are playing their very first Test match against England \u2013 and at Lord\u2019s, too, the home of the MCC, one of the few institutions as patrician as the R&amp;A. The Irish have been waiting a long time for this one, too, and, while they were, the English were very happy to take advantage of them by recruiting their best players into their own team. It wasn\u2019t just Eoin Morgan but Boyd Rankin, who they abandoned after a single Test, and Ed Joyce, who didn\u2019t even get that many. Here, too, the Irish had to batter the door down just to get the English to answer it. The ECB started giving the Irish regular games only because they were spooked into it when the Irish got India and South Africa to come over and play in a tri-series in 2007. After that the ECB decided to throw the Irish the odd fixture to keep them sweet and make sure there weren\u2019t any more scheduling clashes with their own matches. And then the Irish went and beat them at the 2011 World Cup. Eight years later, they are finally going to play a Test except \u2013 except \u2013 the ECB, in its wisdom, has decided this landmark match would be the right time to trial a new, four-day format of the sport. Now the game may not have lasted five days anyway, less do these days, but it still feels like a snub. \u201cIt\u2019s our greatest test at the greatest ground,\u201d the Irish player Andy Balbirnie said, and here are the English making them play guinea pigs in it because God forbid the Irish should just get to play a regular Test, same as anyone else. It wasn\u2019t meant as an insult, it never is, but it smacks of what Nolan described as the English\u2019s \u201cmix of dismissal and casual disdain\u201d.

Now is the time, she says, to build a \u201cgreat storehouse\u201d of weather memories. We are going to need a lot more than a storehouse of memories to weather what is coming, of course. We need to significantly change our behaviour and, even more importantly, overhaul our economic system. After all, only 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions. You know all this already; we all do. But our politicians still are not taking meaningful action. Capitalism is carrying on with business as usual. The world is literally on fire \u2013 and it feels as though we are fiddling with paper straws while it burns. \u2022Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",

In the Lake District, Keswick Adventures has a one-night tailor-made canoe expedition for \u00a3100pp, minimum of four people. Paddleboarding Several of the UK\u2019s many paddleboarding sites offer something a little different. Putting trust into a group of well-balanced friends would be wise for Inspire 2 Adventure\u2019s paddleboarding sessions, in Monmouth, south Wales. Its giant paddleboard, the mega-SUP, has room for up to eight people, who navigate the river as a team (two hours, \u00a325pp). After-dark adventures with Psyched Paddleboarding include head-torches and light-up boards for trips out into a sheltered bay around Anglesey, a designated Dark Skies Reserve (two hours, from \u00a350pp, experience required). Rockpooling and coastal foraging Wembury in south Devon is one of the UK\u2019s top rockpooling spots. The Wembury Marine Centre runs sessions for all ages (\u00a33pp) \u2013 and keep those eyes peeled for cushion starfish and spawning beadlet anemones. There are several free guided rockpooling sessions on the coast near St Michael\u2019s Mount, in west Cornwall this summer, run by Great Scott! Adventures Outdoors (18 Aug, 1 Sept). Day trips with Coastal Foraging, in Carmarthenshire, include exploring mud flats, rock pools and estuaries around Pendine Sands and St Ishmael for wild ingredients, before cooking them over a fire in a sheltered sea cave (\u00a380pp, \u00a370 if travelling via public transport). Fore/Adventure runs half-day seashore foraging courses in Studland on the Jurassic coast in Dorset (\u00a340pp). It also has Forage and Feast sessions (three hours, \u00a370pp), and Kayak, Fish, Forage and Feast (six hours, \u00a3120), both include three-course dinner with cocktails and wine. Wild About Pembrokshire runs a variety of family sea foraging courses, with guided walks, coastal picnics and more (from \u00a315 adults, \u00a35 children). Windsurfing West Sussex-based windsurfing and kitesurfing club 2Xs runs taster sessions from its West Wittering base (two hour windsurf tasters \u00a355 ), and a Saturday club for children (7-12), which includes windsurfing, and other water sports (\u00a335 for two hours). The Little Rippers Windsurfing course (for 5-7s) costs \u00a365 for two hours. Scotland\u2019s \u201csunshine\u201d island of Tiree is one of the UK\u2019s top windsurfing locations. Wild Diamond runs two-hour windsurfing courses here (children \u00a330, adults \u00a335) on flat, shallow Loch Bhasapol. Balinoe Campsite has pitches with views towards Mull and the Treshnish Isles \u2013 and a bothy and self-catering house for those reluctant to stay under canvas. Thanks to the exposed coast, the wide, sandy bay of Rhosneigr, on Anglesey\u2019s western shore, is a great place to try windsurfing. FunSport runs lessons on the beach (weather dependent) for beginners, in groups of up to 4 people (\u00a330pp) or one-on-one (\u00a342.50). Paddling pools and fountains While Rome may look to ban visitors from taking a dip in its Trevi fountain, the UK has plenty of public paddling sites in cities where it\u2019s possible to cool off for free. Among London\u2019s most popular is Granary Square Fountain in King\u2019s Cross, which is colourfully lit up in the evenings and choreographed to spurt at different heights; then there is the Edmond J Safra fountain court in front of Somerset House, the Diana Memorial Fountain in Kensington Gardens, close to the Serpentine, and the V&amp;A\u2019s John Madejski Garden Fountains, an oval lake with jets. Elsewhere, there\u2019s Custom House pavement fountain in Belfast; Sheffield\u2019s award-winning Peace Gardens; and the Mirror Pool in Bradford\u2019s City Park, which is the UK\u2019s largest urban water feature (welcoming paddlers, minus the fountain jets, which are due back on in October). Octopush Also known as underwater hockey, this water sport has clubs all over the UK and even its own governing body, the British Octopush Association. It was invented in the early 1950s by \u201csub-aqua divers in Southsea who got bored just swimming up and down pool lanes to get fit\u201d. Equipment includes a mask, snorkel, fins and water polo hat. Players in teams of 10 hold a small stick in a gloved hand to push a 1.2kg puck into a tray at either end of a 25-metre pool. Most of the 120 BOA clubs in the UK run free taster sessions at local pools, including sessions for juniors. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 August 2019 to clarify the location of Awol Outdoor Adventure.

Can Johnson rescue Britain from the Brexit bind or will Tory members and MPs rue the day they elevated him? Johnson claimed not to be daunted by the task ahead today. But the scale of it is enormous.</p> \n<p>Just like Theresa May before him, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/27/boris-johnson-refuses-rule-out-forcing-through-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">Johnson has talked up</a> the \u201cthreat\u201d of no deal. Yet threatening a colossal act of self-harm is an obvious and self-defeating bluff. Besides, no deal is a process, not a destination: it is plainly unsustainable for the UK to have no agreement covering half its international trade or more than a million of its citizens. Nonetheless, it appears more credible from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/laughter-lies-boris-johnson-journey-journalist-mp\" title=\"\">man with a history</a> of personal, political and professional recklessness than from a leader who, despite her many flaws, appeared to consider every aspect of life as more a matter of duty than pleasure.</p> \n<p>So the UK can either negotiate a deal while still inside the bloc or from a weaker position outside of it. No matter what, there will be an eternal return to the question of the Irish border. Even if the UK were to exit without a deal, agreeing to the backstop and paying the financial settlement will be preconditions of any trade talks. Johnson knows this, and knows that conceding to those conditions after the chaos of a disorderly no-deal Brexit would be a humiliation from which he could never recover.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s why it is more likely that Johnson will seek to scrap the withdrawal agreement for a prolonged transition where Britain exits the political union but remains in everything else. During that time, the ERG cabinet he is likely to appoint will be tasked with negotiating a new free trade agreement. But buried beneath it all will surely be either the backstop reimagined or an indefinite continuation of the transition period, with no unilateral exit. That will be a price that many in the ERG will not be prepared to pay \u2013 and they may yet have the chance to live out their fantasies of a running jump over the edge.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Tom Kibasi is director of the Institute for Public Policy Research and chair of the IPPR Commission on Economic Justice.

During the campaign Johnson sent mixed signals when he pledged to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal on 31 October \u2013 while also saying he wanted a deal. The only way to actually achieve a deal is to actively engage with the EU27, who are far less enthralled with Johnson than the Conservative party membership.</p> \n<p>As prime minister, he will begin by a series of visits to European capitals where he will be politely received, but it\u2019s important that he does not mistake civility for support. From the outset, the EU has said what it meant in these negotiations \u2013 and meant what it said. There is little appetite in Europe to offer Johnson concessions that were not afforded to Theresa May. Bonhomie and bluster will count for little.</p> \n<p>What will Boris Johnson ask for? If he seeks a standstill transition period during which the future relationship is negotiated, he will be refused. The EU will not abandon the backstop or the wider withdrawal agreement: it will be possible, though, to revisit a Northern Ireland-only backstop \u2013 the original design \u2013 or to achieve changes to the political declaration that specify in greater detail how the backstop provisions would fall away once credible alternatives became available.</p> \n<p>Around Europe, they will take note of who is given the Brexit portfolio in a Johnson government. If it is a Brexit ultra, the EU will ratchet up preparations for no deal.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Brigid Laffan is director of the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies, and director of the global governance programme, both at the European University Institute, Florence</p>",

Nonetheless, it appears more credible from a man with a history of personal, political and professional recklessness than from a leader who, despite her many flaws, appeared to consider every aspect of life as more a matter of duty than pleasure. So the UK can either negotiate a deal while still inside the bloc or from a weaker position outside of it. No matter what, there will be an eternal return to the question of the Irish border. Even if the UK were to exit without a deal, agreeing to the backstop and paying the financial settlement will be preconditions of any trade talks. Johnson knows this, and knows that conceding to those conditions after the chaos of a disorderly no-deal Brexit would be a humiliation from which he could never recover. That\u2019s why it is more likely that Johnson will seek to scrap the withdrawal agreement for a prolonged transition where Britain exits the political union but remains in everything else. During that time, the ERG cabinet he is likely to appoint will be tasked with negotiating a new free trade agreement. But buried beneath it all will surely be either the backstop reimagined or an indefinite continuation of the transition period, with no unilateral exit. That will be a price that many in the ERG will not be prepared to pay \u2013 and they may yet have the chance to live out their fantasies of a running jump over the edge. \u2022 Tom Kibasi is director of the Institute for Public Policy Research and chair of the IPPR Commission on Economic Justice. He writes in a personal capacity Brigid Laffan: There is no appetite in Europe for concessions \u2013 bonhomie and bluster will count for little Boris Johnson will have no time to savour his victory. During the campaign Johnson sent mixed signals when he pledged to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal on 31 October \u2013 while also saying he wanted a deal. The only way to actually achieve a deal is to actively engage with the EU27, who are far less enthralled with Johnson than the Conservative party membership. As prime minister, he will begin by a series of visits to European capitals where he will be politely received, but it\u2019s important that he does not mistake civility for support. From the outset, the EU has said what it meant in these negotiations \u2013 and meant what it said. There is little appetite in Europe to offer Johnson concessions that were not afforded to Theresa May. Bonhomie and bluster will count for little. What will Boris Johnson ask for? If he seeks a standstill transition period during which the future relationship is negotiated, he will be refused. The EU will not abandon the backstop or the wider withdrawal agreement: it will be possible, though, to revisit a Northern Ireland-only backstop \u2013 the original design \u2013 or to achieve changes to the political declaration that specify in greater detail how the backstop provisions would fall away once credible alternatives became available. Around Europe, they will take note of who is given the Brexit portfolio in a Johnson government. If it is a Brexit ultra, the EU will ratchet up preparations for no deal. \u2022 Brigid Laffan is director of the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies, and director of the global governance programme, both at the European University Institute, Florence",

      "bodyText": "Police in San Juan fired tear gas on Monday night to disperse thousands of protesters demanding Puerto Rico\u2019s governor resign over offensive chat messages, the latest scandal to hit a bankrupt island struggling to recover from 2017 hurricanes. Police moved in at about 11pm to break up protesters still on the streets of San Juan\u2019s old city following day-long demonstrations by hundreds of thousands of residents. It follows Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3\u2019s attempt to cling on to power despite resigning as president of the ruling New Progressive party and announcing he will not run for re-election next year. A general strike took place across the US territory on Monday morning, protesters chanting the now familiar cry of \u201cRicky resign!\u201d, waving flags and banging drums. Demonstrations have gripped the island since hundreds of pages of leaked text messages between the governor and 11 members of his inner circle were published on 13 July. The messages contain homophobic and sexist slurs against political rivals and cultural figures. They also contain a joke about dead bodies during Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island in September 2017. Puerto Rico\u2019s largest mall, Plaza de las Am\u00e9ricas, closed before Monday\u2019s demonstration along with many other businesses. Last week police used teargas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters at a huge rally outside the governor\u2019s residence in the island\u2019s capital, San Juan. Carmen Portela, 40, was among those protesting on Monday. The founder of Local Guest, a Puerto Rico-based travel company, Portela said that Rossell\u00f3 \u201chas demonstrated that he\u2019s not capable of governing\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to have a new Puerto Rico and that begins with a new government \u2026 This chat gave light to what we all already knew, that this is a very corrupt government.\u201d In the Oval Office on Monday, Donald Trump once again laid into Rossell\u00f3 and the mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, a vocal critic of the governor and the president. \u201cHe\u2019s a terrible governor.

Although Puerto Ricans are American citizens, those living on the island cannot vote in presidential elections and have no voting member of Congress. A number of senior Republicans and Democrats have called on Rossell\u00f3 to resign but the White House has not formally called for him to go. Protest organizers branded the planned Monday shutdown \u201c660,510 + 1\u201d, representative of the number of people who voted for Rossell\u00f3 plus one, in order to reject the governor\u2019s suggestion that he is not resigning due to his popular mandate. In an interview on Fox News, Rossell\u00f3 struggled to show evidence of support, finally citing a single local mayor when asked by interviewer Shep Smith for \u201cjust one name\u201d of a prominent supporter.

Since I started my term to lead Puerto Rico\u2019s destiny, in front of the most devastating economic and fiscal panorama ever.\u201d The administration has been plagued by corruption scandals. Shortly before the text message scandal erupted, the FBI arrested a number of administration officials and contractors \u2013 including Rossell\u00f3\u2019s former education secretary \u2013 over allegations of corruption and misappropriation of $15.5m (\u00a312.5m) in federal funds apportioned to Puerto Rico after Maria.

      "body": "<p>My grandfather, a lover of classical music, was president of the Hull Philharmonic Orchestra for many years. When I was 15, I played him an orchestrated version of Nobuo Uematsu\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-0G_FI61a8\">To Zanarkand</a>, from the video game Final Fantasy X. \u201cThis isn\u2019t real music if it\u2019s from a video game,\u201d he told me at the time. I don\u2019t think he could ever have imagined that 12 years later, the Hull orchestra to which he had devoted so many years would be performing music from 1980s video games, in front of a packed hall.</p> <p>In the past, video game music concerts were a promotional novelty, but today they are regular and well-attended billings in venues across the world. From The Legend of Zelda: Symphony of the Goddess to Final Fantasy: Distant Worlds, Assassin\u2019s Creed Symphony to the recent debut by the <a href=\"https://www.lvgo.co.uk/\">London Video Game Orchestra</a> and even a performance by the BBC Concert Orchestra hosted by lauded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/30/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-video-game-sound-music\">composer Jessica Curry</a>, fans are flocking to concert halls to hear their favourite video game melodies played live. For many, it is their first experience of live orchestral music.</p> <p>This unique concert, the 8-Bit Symphony, is the culmination of many years of work. It isn\u2019t pinned to a massively popular series such as Mario or The Elder Scrolls, though. Instead, the 8-Bit Symphony features orchestral arrangements from titles such as Monty on the Run, WAR, International Karate, Firelord and Trap, video games that were released over 30 years ago on the Commodore 64.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b6fc23a04cae0e28345ba4a012e3c4a9421d571\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b6fc23a04cae0e28345ba4a012e3c4a9421d571/0_188_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Game on \u2026 imagery from 1980s Commodore 64 games plays on a screen behind the orchestra.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Game on \u2026 imagery from 1980s Commodore 64 games plays on a screen behind the orchestra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Moon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With no corporate budget, the 8-Bit Symphony had trouble finding the right orchestra to work with \u2013 but that changed once it found financial support from Hull College and enlisted the Hull Philharmonic Orchestra. Hull might seem a strange place to debut a video game concert, but it makes sense when you consider that one of the trailblazers of video game composition was born here. <a href=\"https://www.8-bit-symphony.com/rob-hubbard.html\">Rob Hubbard</a> composed music for over 75 video games in the 80s before capturing the attention of video game giant EA, and becoming their first full-time time sound guy.</p> <p>Hubbard\u2019s video game music was truly pioneering. Advanced musical and programming knowledge was needed to compose music for the C64: musicians had to code their own drivers to generate sound. The musical limitations imposed by the hardware posed a challenge, but also led to innovations; the C64 is still used by composers today, thanks to its unique sound.

      "bodyText": "My grandfather, a lover of classical music, was president of the Hull Philharmonic Orchestra for many years. When I was 15, I played him an orchestrated version of Nobuo Uematsu\u2019s To Zanarkand, from the video game Final Fantasy X. \u201cThis isn\u2019t real music if it\u2019s from a video game,\u201d he told me at the time. I don\u2019t think he could ever have imagined that 12 years later, the Hull orchestra to which he had devoted so many years would be performing music from 1980s video games, in front of a packed hall. In the past, video game music concerts were a promotional novelty, but today they are regular and well-attended billings in venues across the world. From The Legend of Zelda: Symphony of the Goddess to Final Fantasy: Distant Worlds, Assassin\u2019s Creed Symphony to the recent debut by the London Video Game Orchestra and even a performance by the BBC Concert Orchestra hosted by lauded composer Jessica Curry, fans are flocking to concert halls to hear their favourite video game melodies played live. For many, it is their first experience of live orchestral music. This unique concert, the 8-Bit Symphony, is the culmination of many years of work. It isn\u2019t pinned to a massively popular series such as Mario or The Elder Scrolls, though. Instead, the 8-Bit Symphony features orchestral arrangements from titles such as Monty on the Run, WAR, International Karate, Firelord and Trap, video games that were released over 30 years ago on the Commodore 64. With no corporate budget, the 8-Bit Symphony had trouble finding the right orchestra to work with \u2013 but that changed once it found financial support from Hull College and enlisted the Hull Philharmonic Orchestra. Hull might seem a strange place to debut a video game concert, but it makes sense when you consider that one of the trailblazers of video game composition was born here. Rob Hubbard composed music for over 75 video games in the 80s before capturing the attention of video game giant EA, and becoming their first full-time time sound guy. Hubbard\u2019s video game music was truly pioneering. Advanced musical and programming knowledge was needed to compose music for the C64: musicians had to code their own drivers to generate sound. The musical limitations imposed by the hardware posed a challenge, but also led to innovations; the C64 is still used by composers today, thanks to its unique sound. Hubbard combined his musical theory knowledge with programming expertise to make the C64\u2019s three-voice SID chip sing. \u201cIn the old days, composers had to write code for something as simple as vibrato,\u201d Chris Abbott explains. Abbott is the organiser behind the 8-Bit Symphony and has been remixing C64 music for over 30 years on C64 Audio, a website that he runs with other chip music enthusiasts. \u201cThe way that composers got round playing chords when you could only play one note at a time, for instance, was to play the notes really fast to create the illusion of chords. That [technique] was different from composer to composer; each had a unique voice and it was very specific.\u201d Taking pieces of music that solely exist as computer code and arranging them for a live symphony orchestra has been no easy task: in fact it has taken the team behind 8-Bit Symphonies a number of years.

Further help was provided by musical prodigy Alisdair J Pickering, who had just won the prestigious Ricciotti Ensemble\u2019s Great Arranging Contest for his arrangement of Jeroen Tel\u2019s theme from the video game Overlord on the C64.

Taylor, who is the minister for energy and emissions reduction, was asked repeatedly by Labor on Tuesday whether emissions had risen in recent years, whether he supported calls by government backbenchers to establish a nuclear industry, and whether he had declared any relevant conflicts when meeting departmental officials. Guardian Australia revealed in June that Taylor met with Josh Frydenberg\u2019s office and department officials to discuss the federal government\u2019s designation of the critically endangered grasslands known as the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands. The meetings occurred at the same time that New South Wales and federal investigations were under way into the poisoning of about 30 hectares that contained the grasses on a property in the state\u2019s Monaro region owned by Jam Land Pty Ltd. One of the directors of that company is Richard Taylor, the minister\u2019s brother, and the minister himself holds an interest in the firm via his family investment company, Gufee. After lobbying by Taylor, Frydenberg\u2019s office canvassed whether protections for the grasslands \u2013 known as the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands \u2013 could be watered down and if the change had to be published. Taylor has said the briefing he received from the department was unrelated to the investigation, and on Tuesday told parliament he was pursuing the issue on behalf of farmers in his electorate. \u201cI make absolutely no apology for seeking and receiving a briefing on policies that seriously impact farmers in my electorate because I care about farmers in my electorate.\u201d He said he \u201calways\u201d disclosed relevant personal interests.

How do you define it, how do you measure it and, most importantly, how do you provide it?</p> <p>Clenton Farquharson, who has recently taken over as chair of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/adult-social-care-quality-matters\">Quality Matters</a> initiative, which aims to inspire high-quality adult social care across England, admits that the concept can be intangible.

She just put her hand over mine and told me she was there for me if I needed her.\u201d</p> <p>Quality Matters, a government programme set up in 2017 and led by partners from across the social care sector, aspires to achieve high-quality care \u201ceven when no one is looking\u201d. Farquharson\u2019s ambition for his six-month stint as chair is to ensure that quality is \u201cfundamentally grounded in the experience of citizens\u201d so their experience directly informs practice and policy.</p> <p>\u201cIn other words, the sector recognises co-production as a prerequisite to embedding quality,\u201d Farquharson says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/26/what-i-learned-from-stay-in-care-home\">Good food, noisy TVs, busy staff: what I learned from my stay in a care home</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/skills-for-care-partner-zone/2018/jul/04/pulling-together-training-the-workforce-to-use-co-production\">Co-production</a>, which is built on the principle that people who use a service are best placed to help design it, was central to debate at the annual conference of the <a href=\"https://essc-eu.eu/\">European Social Network</a> (ESN) in June, when delegates from 35 countries met in Milan to discuss how to raise the quality of care and support in a post-austerity era.</p> <p>The ESN, which is funded by the European Commission but also draws members from outside the EU, shares knowledge and best practice in social services.

      "bodyText": "\u201cFunding matters, of course it does, but the thing people really care about is the quality of the care that they receive,\u201d Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, told the recent Local Government Association annual conference. What is quality? How do you define it, how do you measure it and, most importantly, how do you provide it? Clenton Farquharson, who has recently taken over as chair of the Quality Matters initiative, which aims to inspire high-quality adult social care across England, admits that the concept can be intangible. In the end, he thinks it comes down to how the individual receiving care and support is made to feel. \u201cAn example from my own experience was a time when I was in hospital for an eye condition, unable to see and worried that I was going blind,\u201d says Farquharson, who lives with multiple long-term conditions and is a wheelchair user. \u201cThe doctors did a brilliant job on the eye, and I couldn\u2019t fault them for that, but they missed the personal touch. \u201cIt took a healthcare assistant who could see I was terrified to demonstrate the kindness and compassion that is the real hallmark of quality. She just put her hand over mine and told me she was there for me if I needed her.\u201d Quality Matters, a government programme set up in 2017 and led by partners from across the social care sector, aspires to achieve high-quality care \u201ceven when no one is looking\u201d. Farquharson\u2019s ambition for his six-month stint as chair is to ensure that quality is \u201cfundamentally grounded in the experience of citizens\u201d so their experience directly informs practice and policy. \u201cIn other words, the sector recognises co-production as a prerequisite to embedding quality,\u201d Farquharson says. Co-production, which is built on the principle that people who use a service are best placed to help design it, was central to debate at the annual conference of the European Social Network (ESN) in June, when delegates from 35 countries met in Milan to discuss how to raise the quality of care and support in a post-austerity era. The ESN, which is funded by the European Commission but also draws members from outside the EU, shares knowledge and best practice in social services. It wants the commission to draw up a new framework for quality to guide EU states and others as policy moves on from a primary focus on ensuring continued provision of services in the face of the financial constraints of the past decade. Katarina Ivankovi\u0107-Kne\u017eevi\u0107, the commission\u2019s director for social affairs, told the conference that quality was \u201cas important as the availability of social services\u201d and a golden thread running through the 20 principles of the European pillar of social rights proclaimed in 2017. It was work from Scotland, in the form of health and social care standards introduced last year, that helped shape much of the discussion in Milan. These are intended for all services, not just those regulated by statute, and are based on underlying principles of dignity and respect, compassion, inclusion, responsiveness of care and support and wellbeing. Peter Macleod, chief executive of the Care Inspectorate in Scotland, said the principles were rooted firmly in a human-rights approach to care and support, and that the goal should be for the individual to be able to say: \u201cI am receiving high-quality care that is right for me.\u201d What does this look like? Eva Liz Moen, a disabled woman from Norway, told the conference how she was enabled to employ two personal assistants \u2013 \u201cmy liberation tools\u201d \u2013 to support her lifestyle and her work for Norwegian independent living charity Uloba. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that I decide who, what, where and when,\u201d she said. Eloy Van Hal, founder of the celebrated Hogeweyk dementia care village in the Netherlands, said quality meant \u201cliving as usual\u201d for residents of the village, however advanced their condition. And John Healy, deputy director of the Genio project in Ireland, which is enabling people to leave institutional care settings, reflected that \u201cthe voice that has been ignored for decades is often the most influential in the room\u201d.

But Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, described the deal as \u201ca total abdication of fiscal responsibility\u201d that \u201cmay end up being the worst budget agreement in our nation\u2019s history\u201d. Democrat: Mueller testimony will be \u2018damning and explosive\u2019 Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony to Congress on Wednesday is bound to be \u201cdamning and explosive\u201d, a Democrat on the House judiciary committee has told the Guardian, as the former special counsel prepares to speak publicly for the first time about his investigation into the ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, and the president\u2019s alleged efforts to obstruct justice. David Cicilline said the hearing was \u201cthe first opportunity for many, many Americans to actually hear what\u2019s contained in the Mueller report\u201d. Report read-a-thons. Hundreds of actors, journalists and novelists have been holding public, staged readings of the Mueller report in several US cities, in a bid to better inform Americans of the contents of the 448-page document. South Korean jets fire warning shots at Russian aircraft South Korean jets fired 360 rounds of warning shots after a Russian military plane violated South Korea\u2019s airspace twice on Tuesday, defence ministry officials in Seoul have said. In the first such incident between the two countries, South Korean fighter jets were scrambled after a Russian A-50 entered the country\u2019s territorial sky off its east coast. Russia denied it had violated Korean airspace and accused the South Korean jets of carrying out dangerous manoeuvres that threatened its aircraft. North Korea. North Korean state news reported on Tuesday that the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, had inspected a newly built submarine, raising fresh fears of a ballistic missile threat. Cold war. The former Soviet Union backed the North during the 1950-53 Korean war. Russia and South Korea re-established diplomatic ties in 1990, shortly before the breakup of the Soviet Union. Crib sheet UN experts have been blocked from visiting a deserted tanker, anchored and eroding off the coast of Yemen with more than 1m barrels of oil onboard, which they fear could become a \u201cfloating bomb\u201d with the potential to cause an environmental disaster. Police in Canada investigating three suspicious deaths and the disappearance of two teenagers on the remote Alaska Highway say the incidents could be linked. Boris Johnson is on course to become Britain\u2019s new prime minister, following a leadership vote by 160,000 members of the country\u2019s ruling Conservative party, which he is expected to win comfortably on Tuesday. Donald Trump Jr will join his father, mother and sister on bookshelves later this year when he publishes his first literary effort, titled Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us. Must-reads How Bay Area freeways became a venue for gun violence Gun homicides in the Bay Area have gone down overall \u2013 but not on the freeways, where there were 189 shootings between November 2015 and April 2019. California highway patrol puts that down to a combination of factors, including gang conflicts and displacement, as Darwin BondGraham and Aben\u00e9 Clayton report. Bernie Sanders battles to stand out in Democratic race Many of the policies Bernie Sanders ran on in 2016 are now consensus among the crowded Democratic field for 2020. That makes it harder for a leftwing firebrand to stand out, but he is hoping his signature Medicare for All proposal can do the trick, writes Lauren Gambino. Is fair trade finished? Fairtrade International was formed in 1997, and its green and blue certification logo changed the way we shop. But in recent years major companies have begun abandoning the label in favour of their own in-house imitations, putting the very idea of fair trade under threat, says Samanth Subramanian. Behind Teju Cole\u2019s exhibition on America The writer and photography critic Teju Cole has assembled an exhibition at Chicago\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Photography, for which he raided the museum\u2019s archive for images of human suffering and societal upheaval that reflect the current moment. \u201cFor me, nothing is absent of politics,\u201d he tells Nadja Sayej. Opinion Trump is hoping his racist attacks on four progressive congresswomen will distract Americans from his administration\u2019s policy disasters. On the contrary, argues Mallaika Jabali, it will rally people to the Squad and their causes. The louder he gets, the easier it will be for them to recruit teammates in this struggle for justice and basic human dignity. Sport Cristiano Ronaldo will not face criminal charges over claims he raped a woman in a Las Vegas hotel suite in 2009. Prosecutors in Nevada said there was not enough evidence to prove the allegations against the Juventus star. Egan Bernal has been a model of consistency during the mountain stages of this year\u2019s Tour de France, laying the groundwork to be Colombia\u2019s first ever Tour champion. Jeremy Whittle assesses Bernal\u2019s chances, and those of his five main remaining rivals. Sign up The US morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

The public purse would also compensate nuclear investors if the project was scrapped. The new funding structure could be used to prop up EDF Energy\u2019s \u00a316bn plans for a new nuclear reactor at Sizewell B in Suffolk, which was left in doubt after fierce criticism of the costs surrounding the Hinkley Point C project in Somerset. It could also resurrect the dormant plans for a \u00a316bn new nuclear reactor at the Wylfa project in North Wales, which fell apart last year due to the high costs of nuclear construction. The so-called \u201cregulated asset base\u201d, or RAB model, helps to make major infrastructure projects cheaper by shifting the risk of spiralling costs from the developer to the taxpayer.

      "body": "<p>It is a rainy spring night in Almaty, and in a small back-alley club a young DJ is playing dark British techno while wearing a T-shirt that could easily land him in jail. I\u2019m in a crowd of about 200 at ZVUK, which for the past three years has been a remarkable outlier on the limited clubbing scene of Kazakhstan\u2019s deeply conservative commercial capital.</p> <p>My visit to the city coincided with rare political ructions in a country where little dissent had been tolerated during 30 years of autocratic rule by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nursultan-nazarbayev\">President Nursultan Nazarbayev</a>. His sudden resignation in March and stage-managed elections in June had led to two protesters being jailed for 15 days for holding up a banner at the Almaty marathon that read: \u201cYou cannot run away from the truth.\u201d Days later another man was arrested for holding a banner bearing a line from the constitution: \u201cThe only source of state power is the people.\u201d Protests, which reignited after Nazarbayev\u2019s chosen successor was \u201celected\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/09/hundreds-arrested-as-kazakhs-protest-against-rigged-election\">in June</a>, have been met with more violence and arrests by the security forces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bc2d95b86ae5eae6c4643ef94622f2dada21ec9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc2d95b86ae5eae6c4643ef94622f2dada21ec9f/0_1219_4912_6141/800.jpg\" alt=\"Nazira Kassenova, founder of Almaty club night ZVUK.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Never compromise\u2019 \u2026 Nazira Kassenova, founder of ZVUK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kasia Zacharko</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>ZVUK is the only party collective in Almaty with a political-activism element, and the night I attended all of its members wore T-shirts bearing the slogan, \u201cYou cannot run away from the truth.\u201d As a friend of the collective put it, \u201cin Europe, people like us can express themselves and stand against the government in safety. Here we can be jailed for it.\u201d</p> <p>ZVUK is the brainchild of Nazira Kassenova, an upbeat, intelligent and humorous 28-year-old DJ originally from the small southern city of Taraz. These days she splits her time between Almaty and Berlin, where she is a resident at Room 4 Resistance and a host on Radio C\u00f3meme. She has played at De School in Amsterdam and Berghain in Berlin \u2013 arguably Europe\u2019s two best clubs \u2013 and in January reached another milestone by contributing to Resident Advisor\u2019s podcast series. The mix is a great primer for her sound: tough, angular, clattering techno and bass music with a constant, addictive groove.</p> <p>Part of what made this unlikely journey possible was four scholarship-funded years at university in St Andrews. During that time she made frequent trips to the Sub Club in Glasgow, which she cites as a defining influence. She returned to Almaty galvanised and ready to do her own thing. \u201cThere are three other crews in Almaty doing moderately good stuff,\u201d she says, \u201cbut none of them do anything musically, politically or socially challenging. I think that\u2019s fine in places that already have liberal laws and values, but not here.\u201d</p> <p>Since starting ZVUK, Kassenova has brought in two other DJs \u2013 Aisha, who mainly plays acid and electro, and ET, who loves \u201crhythmic, brutal deconstructed club music\u201d \u2013 as well as four non-DJ members. It is clear that for all six recruits, as well as the party\u2019s devotees, ZVUK is a life-changing sanctuary. \u201cZVUK inspired me to pursue my dreams and live my life the way I want, and now I\u2019m a full-time writer able to support myself and my family,\u201d Gera Nogaibayeva, the collective\u2019s operations manager, tells me.</p> <p>\u201cI am a part of the LGBT+ community,\u201d she says, \u201cand we are in often life-threatening danger in our country. To be a part of something that openly celebrates my community and strives to provide a safer space to be yourself is a huge deal.\u201d</p> <p>The fact that much remains to be done regarding LGBT rights had been vividly demonstrated to me earlier that week at a party organised in support of the two jailed activists. The vibe was like that of a bohemian, artistic, politically engaged gathering, but a conversation with Kassenova led to an eye-opening moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc6bafc3d6cc55d2ed71f1362e7f42da5025b19a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc6bafc3d6cc55d2ed71f1362e7f42da5025b19a/0_0_1819_1217/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An attendee at ZVUK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A life-changing sanctuary \u2026 ZVUK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yura Matiyun</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAlmost the whole country is homophobic,\u201d she said, \u201ceven some of the people at this party.\u201d She then collared the first person who happened to be passing, a party-hearty, vodka-swilling sculptor in his 30s. \u201cWhat do you think of gay people?\u201d she asked. He replied without hesitation: \u201cI think they should go and do that in some other country. We don\u2019t want that in Kazakhstan.\u201d</p> <p>The ZVUK party I attended was excellent by any city\u2019s standards, with tight, challenging sets and a deeply engaged and passionate crowd, all in the perfectly sized club Object, the only such independent clubbing space in the city. One of Kassenova\u2019s masterstrokes in building ZVUK has been to inject new perspectives via knowledgeable, thought-provoking international guests, among them Giant Swan, Via App and Don\u2019t DJ. In May the French/Northern Irish producer <a href=\"https://zoemcpherson.xyz/\">Zo\u00eb Mc Pherson</a> flew in to play, and, like many previous guests, also held a production workshop for a rapt audience a couple of days before the party.</p> <p>Mc Pherson spent 10 days in Kazakhstan and offered interesting takes on the experience as we walked around Almaty\u2019s top brutalist hotspots. \u201cI met a 17-year-old boy on a hike in the mountains,\u201d she said. \u201cWe became friends and he came to the workshop with his mother, and the whole family came to the club night. It was the first time he had been to a club, and his mother told me I had opened her ears to a new world of listening.\u201d</p> <p>She was similarly effusive on the crowd at ZVUK who were mesmerised by her hypnotic electronics-and-vocals set. \u201cI have never had a crowd dance together as one like that. Rhythmically, my stuff can seem experimental and awkward and many crowds get confused, but at ZVUK they knew how to rave very naturally to it.\u201d</p> <p>With Kassenova\u2019s DJ career taking off thousands of miles away, she is determined that ZVUK will continue to be a driver of change in Kazakhstan. \u201cFor a long time I lost money running ZVUK, and even now we just break even on most parties,\u201d she says. \u201cBut for me compromise has always been the number one thing to avoid and it will always be that way. I could easily start flying more straightforward, commercial techno acts in, move to a bigger venue and turn ZVUK into a business. But that wouldn\u2019t help change anything, so fuck that.\u201d</p> <h2>Five key ZVUK tracks, chosen by Nazira Kassenova</h2> <p><strong>Giant Swan \u2013 IGOM</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5Xaa3-MBps\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M5Xaa3-MBps?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cThe Bristolian heavy techno duo Giant Swan played here in November and were amazing \u2013 one of the best performances we\u2019ve had for sure.

We just finished the first half of the season, so we were getting ready to play the second half. The problems started and they said, \u2018We\u2019re going to stop the league for a week or 10 days until we solve these problems.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/22/how-west-broke-libya-gaddafi-national-unity\">Chaos quickly ensued</a>. \u201cI had to see many of my friends die in the street,\u201d the 27-year-old says. \u201cIf I had to go out, I wouldn\u2019t know if I was going to come back. We didn\u2019t have electricity from 7 o\u2019clock to 12, 1 o\u2019clock. In June or July, it started to be so difficult to find food.\u201d <br><br>But the people did have weapons, thanks to raids on government armories once the armed forces and the police disintegrated. \u201cYou\u2019d even see a child, 12-years old, and he\u2019d have a gun; he\u2019d have a bomb,\u201d El-Munir says. \u201cAt that time, everyone had weapons. They wanted to protect themselves. Nobody protected nobody.\u201d</p> <p>In the years since, El-Munir has forged a career abroad while striving to support his parents and two brothers in Libya, which he left in 2011. Los Angeles represents the latest stop in an odyssey that has taken El-Munir from Tripoli to Serbia, Belarus and Florida.

      "bodyText": "When the Libyan revolution started, Mohamed El-Munir was a 19-year old playing for Al-Ittihad Tripoli. \u201cNobody expected it,\u201d the Los Angeles FC defender tells the Guardian. \u201cIt just happened so fast. We just finished the first half of the season, so we were getting ready to play the second half. The problems started and they said, \u2018We\u2019re going to stop the league for a week or 10 days until we solve these problems.\u2019\u201d Chaos quickly ensued. \u201cI had to see many of my friends die in the street,\u201d the 27-year-old says. \u201cIf I had to go out, I wouldn\u2019t know if I was going to come back. We didn\u2019t have electricity from 7 o\u2019clock to 12, 1 o\u2019clock. In June or July, it started to be so difficult to find food.\u201d But the people did have weapons, thanks to raids on government armories once the armed forces and the police disintegrated. \u201cYou\u2019d even see a child, 12-years old, and he\u2019d have a gun; he\u2019d have a bomb,\u201d El-Munir says. \u201cAt that time, everyone had weapons. They wanted to protect themselves. Nobody protected nobody.\u201d In the years since, El-Munir has forged a career abroad while striving to support his parents and two brothers in Libya, which he left in 2011. Los Angeles represents the latest stop in an odyssey that has taken El-Munir from Tripoli to Serbia, Belarus and Florida. In the process, he has confronted loneliness, poverty and constant anxiety about his family. Even with his wife and two young sons living with him and the financial stability a career in Major League Soccer provides, that anxiety never disappears. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult, to tell you the truth,\u201d El-Munir tells the Guardian. \u201cI have good days, bad days.

      "body": "<p>It took a while before I felt it: the awareness of being gazed at as a foreign object, American-born yet an alien all the same. I didn\u2019t feel it when my blond neighbor Chris, a third-grade classmate, slipped me a note telling me how much he liked me. But, as he concluded in the blue ink scrawled across the page\u2019s lines, his mom wouldn\u2019t allow him to \u201cdate\u201d a seven-year-old black girl like me. <br><br>I didn\u2019t feel it when a new middle school teacher passed me over, despite enthusiastically raising my hand first to volunteer for a project, and chose my two white girl friends who stood next to me to assist her.<br><br>These were mere footnotes. Things to bookmark in my life\u2019s files, but not to obsess over in a childhood with more pressing matters \u2013 creeks to be played in, school honors to be earned, and boys (not named Chris) to crush on. I was not surprised by these stark incidents. I grew up in a south that still had the Confederate symbol on its state flag and a house that regularly received brochures offering to enroll me in a bussing program to integrate the increasingly white, outer core suburban schools. <br><br>The moment I felt \u201cothered\u201d, at around 18, was more mundane than that. I walked out of my school gym and watched several eyes turn to stare at me, this black girl in a sea of white faces at an elite private college. I looked to see what I had on. Was there something stuck on me? On my shoe? My hair? After several occurrences like this, where I wasn\u2019t talked to, or engaged with, but glared at, I surmised that it was my blackness that was the foreign object.</p> \n<p>But it is through the mundane, in the things unsaid, the slights we think we imagine, that we realize that the world doesn\u2019t allow us black and brown girls and boys to just <em>be</em>. The glares then transform to vitriol against us black and brown women and men, when being born and raised in America can still lend itself to commands to go back to the countries we came from, where only God knows where that may be. In the midst of Donald Trump commanding Ice raids to prompt widespread deportations, he was preaching what he practiced, telling a group of women of color, most of whom are American-born, that this country also didn\u2019t belong to them. <br><br>So when congresswoman Ayanna Pressley spoke of \u201cthe occupant in the White House \u2026\u201d in remarks confronting his attacks on her and congressional colleagues Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, all vocal critics of his white nationalist immigration policies \u2013 her statement wasn\u2019t tinged with surprise or disappointment. It wasn\u2019t rife with the naive shock of people who claim this isn\u2019t the America they know. It was rooted in the resolve of someone who probably once saw the same turned, glaring faces I did. The resolve of someone who knew his racist distractions would not keep her from attending to her own pressing matters \u2013 healthcare to be fought for and human rights to protect \u2013 and other crises facing the country.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d9e1837e-b4b5-480c-83cb-a9d36fb2ef0f\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Ayanna Pressley, Massachusetts</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A firebrand but nevertheless perhaps the most moderate member of \"The Squad\", Pressley became the first black congresswoman to represent Massachusetts when she defeated a 20-year incumbent (and fellow progressive) to win an area once represented by John F Kennedy. Pressley has adopted the humanitarian crisis on the southern border and the harsh conditions of detained migrants as focal issues. She has spoken about her father being incarcerated and how she is a rape survivor. \"The people closest to the pain should be closest to the power,\" is a favourite mantra. Pressley vowed they \"would not be silenced\".</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Ilhan Omar, Minnesota</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Omar is the first Somali-American member of Congress, and the first (along with Tlaib) of two Muslim women ever elected. She wears a hijab, obliging a change of rules about headgear in Congress. She is the only member of the Squad to be born outside the US, arriving more than 20 years ago as part of a refugee resettlement programme, becoming a US citizen in 2000 at the age of 17. Omar campaigns for universal healthcare, a $15 minimum wage, and student loan forgiveness. Omar has been a vocal critic of Israel's treatment of Palestinians, calling its government the \"apartheid Israeli regime\".</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Rashida Tlaib, Michigan</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Tlaib is the first of 14 children born to Palestinian immigrant parents and the first in her family to graduate from high school as well as college. She served in the Michigan state legislature, where she was known for causing controversy. A year before her 2018 election, she was expelled from a political rally in Michigan for asking the then-Republican presidential nominee Trump if he'd ever read the constitution. Immediately following her election to congress, Tlaib told a group of fellow progressives: \"We're gonna go in there and we're going to impeach the motherfucker\".</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best known of the four, Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman elected to Congress when she defeated a 10-term Democratic incumbent to win New York's 14th congressional district last November. Born in the Bronx, Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, the group that acts as an ideological nursery for young progressives. One of her first legislative proposals - the Green New Deal resolution to combat global heating and poverty - forced 2020 candidates to prioritise the climate crisis.</p>\n    <p><b>Edward Helmore</b> <i>New York</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Donald Trump hopes his apoplectic tweeting will detract from America\u2019s domestic and foreign policy disasters, which created the very \u201ccatastrophe\u201d in the regions he castigated in his verbal diarrhea. He hopes it will detract from the<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spccw30pQVY\"> impassioned </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spccw30pQVY\">congressional testimony </a>of Representative Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 delivered just three days before Trump\u2019s verbal assaults \u2013 about women at southern border camps being forced to drink toilet water and children being inexplicably separated from older siblings.</p> \n<p>These disasters are evident in the congresswomen\u2019s own homelands, from Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/puerto-rico-has-gotten-far-less-aid-trump-has-claimed-n1005506\">bungling of hurricane relief in Puerto Rico</a> to America\u2019s increasing military occupation in Africa, and specifically in Somalia, where American air strikes have been <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr52/9952/2019/en/\">increasingly killing civilians </a>since Trump became president. These failures are evident in America\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-palestinians-in-the-west-bank-are-reacting-to-trumps-peace-plan\">failed interventions in the Middle East</a> and undermining of Palestinian rights. He hopes, too, that while accusing migrants of being involved in human traffic rings and crime, that the attention steers away from <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-hosted-party-with-jeffrey-epstein-and-28-girls-report-claims\">his own associations with Jeffrey Epstein,</a> an alleged sex trafficker.</p> \n<p>There are white Americans who think the country only belongs to them; that it is their birthright and theirs alone. For some, people of color are barely citizens. They want to keep us constantly teetering on the edge of citizenship that is not constitutionally provided but, rather, temporarily licensed, revocable upon any mention of the country\u2019s white supremacist practices at home and abroad.</p> \n<p>But that <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1897/08/strivings-of-the-negro-people/305446/\">\u201cpeculiar sensation\u201d</a> of knowing America has never been entirely for us has also been a gift. It has given the marginalized, and our allies, a sense of shared struggle. What scares people like Trump is that \u201cthe Squad\u201d, as the freshmen progressive congresswomen have become known, is increasing in number. The louder he gets, the easier it will be for them to recruit team-mates in this struggle for justice and basic human dignity. We may never escape that peculiarity of being othered in America, but the Squad is bound to become so deep that it won\u2019t even matter.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It took a while before I felt it: the awareness of being gazed at as a foreign object, American-born yet an alien all the same. I didn\u2019t feel it when my blond neighbor Chris, a third-grade classmate, slipped me a note telling me how much he liked me. But, as he concluded in the blue ink scrawled across the page\u2019s lines, his mom wouldn\u2019t allow him to \u201cdate\u201d a seven-year-old black girl like me. I didn\u2019t feel it when a new middle school teacher passed me over, despite enthusiastically raising my hand first to volunteer for a project, and chose my two white girl friends who stood next to me to assist her. These were mere footnotes. Things to bookmark in my life\u2019s files, but not to obsess over in a childhood with more pressing matters \u2013 creeks to be played in, school honors to be earned, and boys (not named Chris) to crush on. I was not surprised by these stark incidents. I grew up in a south that still had the Confederate symbol on its state flag and a house that regularly received brochures offering to enroll me in a bussing program to integrate the increasingly white, outer core suburban schools. The moment I felt \u201cothered\u201d, at around 18, was more mundane than that. I walked out of my school gym and watched several eyes turn to stare at me, this black girl in a sea of white faces at an elite private college. I looked to see what I had on. Was there something stuck on me? On my shoe? My hair? After several occurrences like this, where I wasn\u2019t talked to, or engaged with, but glared at, I surmised that it was my blackness that was the foreign object. But it is through the mundane, in the things unsaid, the slights we think we imagine, that we realize that the world doesn\u2019t allow us black and brown girls and boys to just be. The glares then transform to vitriol against us black and brown women and men, when being born and raised in America can still lend itself to commands to go back to the countries we came from, where only God knows where that may be. In the midst of Donald Trump commanding Ice raids to prompt widespread deportations, he was preaching what he practiced, telling a group of women of color, most of whom are American-born, that this country also didn\u2019t belong to them. So when congresswoman Ayanna Pressley spoke of \u201cthe occupant in the White House \u2026\u201d in remarks confronting his attacks on her and congressional colleagues Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, all vocal critics of his white nationalist immigration policies \u2013 her statement wasn\u2019t tinged with surprise or disappointment. It wasn\u2019t rife with the naive shock of people who claim this isn\u2019t the America they know. It was rooted in the resolve of someone who probably once saw the same turned, glaring faces I did. The resolve of someone who knew his racist distractions would not keep her from attending to her own pressing matters \u2013 healthcare to be fought for and human rights to protect \u2013 and other crises facing the country. Donald Trump hopes his apoplectic tweeting will detract from America\u2019s domestic and foreign policy disasters, which created the very \u201ccatastrophe\u201d in the regions he castigated in his verbal diarrhea. He hopes it will detract from the impassioned congressional testimony of Representative Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 delivered just three days before Trump\u2019s verbal assaults \u2013 about women at southern border camps being forced to drink toilet water and children being inexplicably separated from older siblings. These disasters are evident in the congresswomen\u2019s own homelands, from Trump\u2019s bungling of hurricane relief in Puerto Rico to America\u2019s increasing military occupation in Africa, and specifically in Somalia, where American air strikes have been increasingly killing civilians since Trump became president. These failures are evident in America\u2019s failed interventions in the Middle East and undermining of Palestinian rights. He hopes, too, that while accusing migrants of being involved in human traffic rings and crime, that the attention steers away from his own associations with Jeffrey Epstein, an alleged sex trafficker. There are white Americans who think the country only belongs to them; that it is their birthright and theirs alone. For some, people of color are barely citizens. They want to keep us constantly teetering on the edge of citizenship that is not constitutionally provided but, rather, temporarily licensed, revocable upon any mention of the country\u2019s white supremacist practices at home and abroad. But that \u201cpeculiar sensation\u201d of knowing America has never been entirely for us has also been a gift. It has given the marginalized, and our allies, a sense of shared struggle. What scares people like Trump is that \u201cthe Squad\u201d, as the freshmen progressive congresswomen have become known, is increasing in number. The louder he gets, the easier it will be for them to recruit team-mates in this struggle for justice and basic human dignity. We may never escape that peculiarity of being othered in America, but the Squad is bound to become so deep that it won\u2019t even matter.",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy.

However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it.

      "bodyText": "The Channel Tunnel operator has said a no-deal Brexit is \u201cvery likely\u201d as it warned that annual profits will come in at the lower end of forecasts. Getlink said it expected underlying earnings for the year of \u20ac560m (\u00a3503m) \u2013 its no-deal scenario \u2013 as opposed to the \u20ac575m it expected under an agreed exit deal. The company, formerly known as Eurotunnel, accounts for 26% of goods trade between the UK and continental Europe. \u201cAs the absence of an agreement on Brexit on 31 October is becoming very likely, the reference scenario for 2019 is now the no-deal one,\u201d Getlink said in its half-year results. But Getlink\u2019s lower-end estimates still rely on the UK and EU putting in \u201cefficient\u201d border controls that \u201cdo not result in disruptions\u201d. The group said uncertainties created by Brexit delays and the subsequent impact on the economy knocked its financial performance in the first half of the year. A sharp slowdown in Channel Tunnel crossings, as well a French customs officer strike, were particularly harmful to its Eurotunnel operations, whose revenues rose just 1% to \u20ac456m. Getlink\u2019s main business is cross-Channel rail freight and passenger car and truck shuttles. \u201cAfter a first quarter of strong growth, which was boosted by the stockpiling by British companies during the first three months of the year on the assumption that Brexit would take place on 29 March, the cross-Channel truck market contracted sharply in the second quarter,\u201d Getlink said. The drop came as companies paused their stockpiling efforts and car manufacturers decided to schedule annual factory closures in April in anticipation of the Brexit deadline, instead of August. Overall, group earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell by 2% to \u20ac255m, while revenue grew by just 2% to \u20ac523m. Meanwhile, London Heathrow airport took a more optimistic view on Brexit, saying the chances of the UK leaving the bloc without a deal were low. While there are still unresolved travel issues, including around pet passports and cargo screening in the case of a no-deal Breaxit, the London airport operator said the scenario was unlikely.

If it sees nuclear power as that answer, it should be more open with Australians about its intentions.<br></p> <p>Research by the parliamentary library has confirmed there are literally dozens of sites around the nation where nuclear power plants could be constructed.<br></p> <p>Just this week the Australian Nuclear Association called for the construction of 20 nuclear energy plants and nominated potential sites including the Latrobe Valley, Albury and Whyalla.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-23T06:26:24.151Z\">at 7.26am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d36976a8f08d0b6ca535e38\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-23T05:15:14.529Z\">6.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Scott Morrison</strong> leaves the chamber with<strong> Angus Taylor</strong>, as <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> stands on indulgence to congratulate <strong>Amanda Rishworth </strong>on the birth of her son, Oscar.</p> <p><strong>Christian Porter </strong>seconds the congratulations from the government and compliments the \u201cbeautiful name\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Anne Aly </strong>wants to note that she has been misrepresented \u2013 but it is not time for that yet.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget me,\u201d Aly says.</p> <p><strong>Tony Smith</strong> promises that he won\u2019t.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-23T05:18:10.969Z\">at 6.18am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d3697368f08cf92bb775186\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-23T05:12:56.603Z\">6.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Scott Morrison</strong> calls time on question time, adding:</p> <p>\u201cAnd I would invite the opposition to ask me a question tomorrow.

These are drugs which are illegal for a reason. They are drugs because they can kill. They are drugs because the nature of the response may not be known in an individual case, at the very moment that this parliament, that this government and the entire nation is seeking to deal with some of the challenges of amphetamines and of opioids, the idea that we would be condoning, encouraging and supporting the expansion of their consumption is, to mind mind, utterly unthinkable, and so this is not a position which the Australian government will be adopted. <br></p> <p>It is an position the Australian government will be opposing ... <br></p> <p>Even if it makes it clear that it is a pure form of MDMA, or a pure form of ice, or a pure form of fentanyl, that is not going to save a person.

A massive thank you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp for everything today, as well as all of those behind the scenes who keep this little blog that could ticking along. But as always, the biggest thank you goes to you, for following along with us. We\u2019ll be back at sparrow\u2019s tomorrow. In the meantime \u2013 take care of you. Labor\u2019s amendments on the temporary exclusion bill have been officially defeated \u2013 Peter Dutton has just called for the third reading and the bill will be off to the Senate. A totally normal reaction. Much adulation. Many congrats It\u2019s great that the 2019 parliament lets me throw back to 2013 memes The House is going through the pretence that Labor\u2019s amendments are going to change anything (the government has already said no, and Labor has already said it will vote for it anyway). If you want to know what a temporary exclusion order is about and why Labor has some concerns about the legislation (it is now going to vote for) Paul Karp has done up an explainer for you. All of these speeches are for when there is a challenge or failure of the legislation and Labor can say \u201ctold you so\u201d. Police have committed a series of illegal metadata searches, including Western Australian police obtaining invalid warrants targeting journalists and ACT police accessing data 116 times without proper authorisation. The breaches of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act are revealed in a Commonwealth Ombudsman report for the period July 2016 to June 2017, tabled in parliament by the government on Monday. In addition to one instance of the Australian federal police accessing a journalist\u2019s data without a warrant reported in 2017, the ombudsman discovered two instances where the WA police applied for \u2013 and obtained \u2013 a journalist information warrant from a person not authorised to provide it. \u201cThis occurred due to a lack of awareness by WA police regarding to whom an application for a journalist information warrant could be made,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn response to this issue, WA police took steps to quarantine all information obtained under the invalid warrants.\u201d The report also revealed that between 13 and 26 October 2015 \u201call authorisations within ACT policing were made by an officer not authorised\u201d by the relevant section of the law. \u201cThis issue affected 116 authorisations during the period,\u201d it said. \u201cThis issue also affected a large number of authorisations dating back to March 2015, which precede the commencement of our office\u2019s oversight on 13 October 2015.\u201d Anyone wanting some context for Greg Hunt\u2019s victory yell - you might remember that Julia Banks left the seat of Chisholm (which Gladys Liu won) to challenge him in Flinders. So it was less about Liu and more about hyping himself up. That was some Kanye level love right there. Some of how Mike Bowers saw the day Peter Dutton is now on his feet, confirming the government will not be accepting Labor\u2019s amendment to the temporary exclusion order. Labor has already confirmed it will vote for the bill, even if the government rejects its amendments. Greg Hunt just held up Gladys Liu\u2019s hands like a boxing champion and yelled \u201cYEAH\u201d in the chamber. This is an actual thing which just happened. Meanwhile The first speeches continue \u2013 Gladys Liu is delivering hers now. The government has just released a review of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal conducted by former high court justice Ian Callinan. The structure of the AAT may sound a bit nerdy, but it is super important because the AAT reviews government actions including refugee cases and robo-debt decisions. The report paints a picture of a massive backlog of cases - particularly in the migration division - and members without legal training struggling to write decisions. Throughout the last term of parliament, Labor accused the Coalition of stacking the tribunal with its mates. The review recommended: Appointment of no fewer than 15 to 30 members to the migration and refugee division All further appointments, re-appointments or renewals of appointment to the membership of the AAT should be of lawyers, admitted or qualified for admission ... and on the basis of merit The practice of seeking advice from staff by members should be restricted to 12 requests for the provision of relevant material from the library. Any request by a member, for the review of or advice on the drafting of decisions is not acceptable. Appointment of counsel assisting the migration and refugee division \u201cas an advocate, as required, in the public interest\u201d. \u201cThe presence in different and complex cases of such a counsel would relieve the member of the onerous duties that the members now have and assist unrepresented applicants.\u201d Abolish the second tier of review by the general division of the social security and child support division Extend the power to make oral decisions to decisions to vary or set aside a Centrelink decision Callinan also suggested consideration of \u201ca new information rule conferring a wide discretion upon the AAT to receive or refuse evidence not before the original decision-maker\u201d. That was because of evidence from several members of the migration and refugee division \u201cthat during delays in hearings not a small number of applicants contrived situations to support a favourable decision, or ground for appeal to the courts\u201d. The attorney general, Christian Porter, acknowledged that \u201csince amalgamation, the tribunal\u2019s workload has increased significantly, particularly in the migration and refugee division\u201d. He said: \u201cThe government is carefully considering the recommendations from Mr Callinan\u2019s report and is committed to improving the efficiency of the tribunal and maintaining the integrity of Australia\u2019s migration policy.\u201d Anyone who caught Ed Husic on Sky and wondered who he was talking about when he said this: It was in relation to this And the terms of reference for that inquiry are below: That the following matters be referred to the environment and communications references committee for inquiry and report by the third sitting day of December 2019: a) disclosure and public reporting of sensitive and classified information, including the appropriate regime for warrants regarding journalists and media organisations and adequacy of existing legislation; b) the whistleblower protection regime and protections for public sector employees; c) the adequacy of referral practices of the Australian government in relation to leaks of sensitive and classified information; d) appropriate culture, practice and leadership for government and senior public employees; e) mechanisms to ensure that the Australian federal police have sufficient independence to effectively and impartially carry out their investigatory and law enforcement responsibilities in relation to politically sensitive matters; and f) any related matters. A Senate committee will look at press freedom. From Sarah Hanson-Young (who will chair it): This week\u2019s arrest of four French journalists highlights how badly we need to rethink press freedom in Australia. Press and whistleblower protections have been steadily eroded and the government just wants to sweep this under the carpet. Today the Senate voted for an inquiry into press freedom and whistleblower protection showing that there are some in our parliament who care about a frank and fearless media. The raids on the ABC and a News Corp journalist sent chills through the country. The erosions of freedoms in Australia must be wound back. The ability of citizens to speak truth to power must be maintained and that is why whistleblowers must be protected and journalists allowed to do their job. This inquiry will get to the bottom of what has gone on and ensure a future for a free press in Australia.\u201d Anyone looking for the stories Anne Davies and Lisa Cox wrote on Angus Taylor can find them here and here. PHRASING boom! Following question time, Mark Butler sent out this press release: Australians deserve to know exactly where the Morrison government would build nuclear power plants under the intensifying Coalition campaign for Australia to develop a nuclear power industry. In question time today energy minister Angus Taylor said he had an \u201copen mind\u201d on the use of nuclear energy. Industry minister Karen Andrews and several other MPs have made similar comments, while prime minister Scott Morrison has said nuclear power is \u201cnot not\u2019\u2019 on his agenda and Queensland MPs Keith Pitt and James McGrath have called for a parliamentary inquiry into the issue. Earlier this week maverick National Barnaby Joyce ramped up the pressure for change by proposing authorities could get around public concerns about safety of nuclear energy by giving people free power if they could see a nuclear reactor from their home. Nuclear energy is banned in Australia. But with so many Coalition MPs now advocating its use, Australians deserve to know where the government is headed on energy policy. In particular, it should explain where nuclear power plants might be built, particularly since these facilities need to be sited near large bodies of water. If Mr Morrison is open to using nuclear energy, would he be prepared to have a nuclear power plant built in the Sutherland shire, in his own electorate? Given her position, Ms Andrews should say whether she would welcome a nuclear power plant in her community on the Gold Coast. With Mr Pitt and senator McGrath advocating a parliamentary inquiry, they should say whether they would support construction of nuclear power plants in Queensland coastal towns like Townsville, Rockhampton, Gladstone and the Sunshine Coast. The Coalition should also say whether they believe coastal centres in New South Wales, such Coffs Harbour, Wollongong and Nowra, or Western Australian cities including Perth, Bunbury and Geraldton would make good sites for reactors. The Coalition is struggling for an answer to six years of failure on energy policy. If it sees nuclear power as that answer, it should be more open with Australians about its intentions. Research by the parliamentary library has confirmed there are literally dozens of sites around the nation where nuclear power plants could be constructed. Just this week the Australian Nuclear Association called for the construction of 20 nuclear energy plants and nominated potential sites including the Latrobe Valley, Albury and Whyalla. Scott Morrison leaves the chamber with Angus Taylor, as Anthony Albanese stands on indulgence to congratulate Amanda Rishworth on the birth of her son, Oscar. Christian Porter seconds the congratulations from the government and compliments the \u201cbeautiful name\u201d. Anne Aly wants to note that she has been misrepresented \u2013 but it is not time for that yet. \u201cDon\u2019t forget me,\u201d Aly says. Tony Smith promises that he won\u2019t. Scott Morrison calls time on question time, adding: \u201cAnd I would invite the opposition to ask me a question tomorrow. You didn\u2019t do that today. Maybe tomorrow\u201d Karen Andrews Karens her dixer again: We have committed to an additional $5m to promote globally the Australian-made logo because we want everyone across the world, when they see that green and gold label, to go, how good is Australia?\u201d While Karen Andrews takes the next dixer, Scott Morrison caucuses with Michael McCormack, Greg Hunt and Josh Frydenberg and the cameras go off madly, capturing it. David Littleproud finds this hilarious. To be fair, question time has a very low bar for what is funny. It is back to Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: \u201cWhy won\u2019t the minister tell the House whether or not a compliance officer was present at the meeting?\u201d Taylor: At the time, 2017, when I was in a previous role, I had no idea who was coming to that meeting, I didn\u2019t appoint, I didn\u2019t ask those people to come to a meeting. My understanding that there was a compliance officer there ... It is very clear, Mr Speaker, that on that day I received a briefing from departmental officials on technical aspects of the revised listing. This is a big deal for farmers, something that those opposite wouldn\u2019t understand. It affects the small businesses and farms in my electorate and all of those businesses that depend on them. And it is my job as a local member to make sure they get a fair deal. As I said in the previous answer, an independent review by Wendy Crag identified there was serious issues and I am pleased now that the government is acting on, which will ensure that farmers are better able to work with the EPBC act and hopefully will reduce red tape for farmers who are the greatest custodians of our environment.\u201d I have just been told that the government didn\u2019t miss a question. It was waiting for the crossbench to jump, and Andrew Wilkie didn\u2019t. So I take back my Bert van Manen sass. He remains out of the principal\u2019s office. Andrew Wilkie gets the crossbench question and it is to Greg Hunt: \u201cHobart city council yesterday voted in support of pill testing at major events and festivals. Now we know pill testing saves lives and health experts agree a harmonisation approach is the only sensible response to illicit drug use. \u201cYet the Tasmanian government is clinging to an ideological opposition to harm minimisation and pill testing in particular and refuses to back the council\u2019s position. \u201cMinister, ... government like Tasmania\u2019s have shown they simply don\u2019t understand the issue. So will you as health minister put the issue of pill testing on the Coag health council?\u201d Hunt: The answer is no. Yesterday I respectfully disagreed on the proposition. Today I will respectfully but categorically disagree with the member. What he has proposed is, I believe, a dangerous and unfounded course of action. Let me say this, whether it is tested or not, MDMA, ice, certain opioids can be deadly in their purest form. These are drugs which are illegal for a reason. They are drugs because they can kill. They are drugs because the nature of the response may not be known in an individual case, at the very moment that this parliament, that this government and the entire nation is seeking to deal with some of the challenges of amphetamines and of opioids, the idea that we would be condoning, encouraging and supporting the expansion of their consumption is, to mind mind, utterly unthinkable, and so this is not a position which the Australian government will be adopted. It is an position the Australian government will be opposing ... Even if it makes it clear that it is a pure form of MDMA, or a pure form of ice, or a pure form of fentanyl, that is not going to save a person. They may take an overdose or even if they take what they believe is an appropriate dose, that can be enough to take their lives. That is why these drugs are dangerous, that is why these drugs are illicit and that is why we will not be adopting the approach which the member I believe foolishly and dangerously has advocated.\u201d Lucky alcohol has never killed anyone. Oh, wait ... Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer to his previous answer. When seeking the assistance of the treasurer to arrange a meeting with departmental officials about critically endangered grasslands in the Monaro region, did he disclose his personal interest in the matter? Taylor: Mr Speaker, I have always disclosed my personal interest, any interest, that may have an impact on my role. I have been clear about that, but is my job and I do it all the time. Now as I said, at this meeting the member opposite refers to, I received a briefing from a departmental official, some technical aspects of the revised listing, but I would point out that an independent review since then by Wendy Craig released only about one month ago found that there have been major deficiencies in how the act is understood and how in particular farmers are dealt with. And I am pleased that this review specifically identified the very issues that I have previously raised and that were raised in this meeting, Mr Speaker, and that is because I will always act in the interest of farmers. Perhaps those opposite could learn a little bit from that.\u201d For the second day in a row, a government MP forgets to jump when it is their question and Terri Butler gets a second go. Scott Morrison\u2019s head swivels to the backbench so fast he would have put Jim Carrey in his prime to shame. Someone from the government says \u201cno\u201d and Tony Smith tells them there is no \u201cno\u201d and that he looked to the government side, and then to Labor and \u201conly one person jumped\u201d. Bert van Manen, as the chief government whip, can probably expect a call to the principal\u2019s office. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer to the minister\u2019s previous answer and I asked again was the compliance officer present at the meeting? Taylor: I have dealt with this in the previous question, I have dealt with this in the previous question. This was not a discussion, this was not a discussion about a compliance action. It was a discussion, it was a discussion \u2013 let\u2019s be clear, let\u2019s be clear \u2013 the discussion was about the impact of a revised listing on farmers in my electorate. And there were two affected electorates, Mr Speaker, my electorate and my neighbour\u2019s electorate. I care about the farmers in my electorate. I will always act in the interest because that is my job.\u201d Taylor: Now, Mr Speaker, it is simply not enough to have power when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing. We need it 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. And that is why we sharply focused on keeping our existing coal and gas generation in the market, running at full tilt. But there are alternative approaches.\u201d \u201cWhat about Barnaby\u2019s proposal,\u201d Labor yells. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: Was the compliance officer from the department of the environment present at the meeting referred to in his previous answer with departmental officials about the listing of critically endangered grasslands in the Monaro region affecting land he part owned?\u201d Taylor: Thank you for the question but look this is a grubby smear from those opposite, one of many that have been made and were made during the election campaign and I have been very clear on this. This was not a discussion about compliance action; it was a briefing from departmental officials on technical aspects of a revised listing under the EPBC act! And the secretary of the department has made very clear, and I quote, \u2018I can be very clear that minister Taylor has never raised the issue.\u2019 This is the point. And I make no apology, Mr Speaker, I make no apology for acting in the interests of the farmers in my electorate and it is about time those opposite, it is about time those opposite stood up for the farmers in their electorates.\u201d Labor points out that Monaro is not his electorate. Tony Burke gets up to ask a point of order, but Taylor has finished his answer. He also gets the next dixer, which makes the Labor benches laugh. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: \u201cIn the meeting he referred to in his official answer with members of the department, did he disclose his ... [interest] or in compliance investigation into land clearing in that region?\u201d Taylor: \u201cI have always disclosed my interests, I have always disclosed my interests, and I have been clear about those. \u201cIn 2017 before I was the minister in this role, as I answered in the previous question, I received a briefing from departmental officials on technical aspects of a revised listing under the act and the reason is that those changes impacted the farmers in my electorate. \u201cI care about the farmers in my electorate. I care about the farmers in my electorate. I wanted to see the drought fund go through yesterday, despite, despite the protestations from those opposite. \u201cUnlike the member for Eden Monaro who takes no interest in the farmers in his electorate! \u201cThe department for environment has confirmed the briefing did not discuss compliance action. They have confirmed that when raised in Senate estimates in April 2019 the secretary of the department of the environment said: \u2018I could be very clear that Mr Taylor has never raised an issue with me.\u2019 \u201d For someone who doesn\u2019t talk about \u201con water matters\u201d, Peter Dutton certainly likes talking about on-water matters. When it suits. There have been 34 attempted boat arrivals since the Coalition came to power. Also, it is not illegal to seek asylum. Peter Dutton is now explaining how the most recent boat arrival attempt is Labor\u2019s fault. Six years after Labor was last in government. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer to the minister by the appointment to environment and energy including all matters to the department made on 29 May. Can the minister confirm the company in which he has an interest is now being investigated by his own department in relation to the alleged illegal land clearing of critically endangered grasslands? Taylor: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank you for the question. I have been very clear about this in public. I have no association and I have remained unlinked from the company. In 2017 I received a briefing from departmental officials on technical aspects of a revised listing under the act and I make absolutely no apology for seeking and receiving a briefing on policies that seriously impact farmers in my electorate because I care about farmers in my electorate. I care about farmers in my electorate and ... what the people expect from me as their local member, the most remarkable fact is that other affected members such as the member for Eden Monaro did not do the same. I will always stand up for the people of my electorate. I will do the right thing by them at every point in time.\u201d Christian Porter is continuing the JUST HOW SAFE ARE YOU: WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON segment that Peter Dutton started. He mentions something Anne Aly said during the debate, about it not being \u201cimpactful\u201d legislation. It was a bit more nuanced than that, but Tony Smith tells Aly that if she wants to dispute it, there are other ways to do it. Porter continues. \u201cOh, my God, read a book,\u201d Aly says, which is an excellent Archer reference, whether she knows it or not. Pat Conroy to ... ANGUS TAYLOR ***Ding-ding-ding*** \u201cIs the government working on a policy proposed by the member for New England where, and I quote, \u2018If you can see the nuclear reactor from your house, your power is for free. If you are within 50km of a reactor, you get the power for half price.\u201d The response from a potential-future-Liberal-prime-minister: \u201cThe answer to that is no.\u201d It\u2019s time for Peter Dutton\u2019s JUST HOW SAFE ARE YOU segment. VERY SAFE. As long as you pass all his legislation. This has been JUST HOW SAFE ARE YOU: WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON edition. Justine Elliott to Angus Taylor: Does he rule out a nuclear power station being built in northern New South Wales, or on the Gold Coast? Taylor: I am delighted to receive questions from those of us who are here today because during the election campaign they steadfastly refused to answer questions about their real plan, which was to establish a carbon tax, double the price of electricity and triple the price of gas for all Australians. That is what they intended to do and that is why the member for Maribyrnong and the member for Port Adelaide\u2019s steadfastly refused to answer questions throughout the campaign ... The government\u2019s priority is on getting energy prices down for all Australians, hard-working households and small businesses while we keep the lights on and we have steadfastly said that we will focus on cuts ...\u201d Tony Smith tells him his preamble is over. Taylor: We\u2019re not focused on the fuel source, we are focused on the outcome and we currently have a moratorium on nuclear power generation in Australia, and the government has no plans to change that. Now we always approach these things with an open mind, but we do not have ... We do not have a plan to change the moratorium. I tell you what we will do. We will steadfastly focus on affordable, reliable energy for all Australians and we will not put in place policies that are going to double the price of electricity and triple the price of gas as those opposite proposed at the last election.\u201d In the meantime, Luke Gosling is thrown out for a very loud interjection. Tony Smith is dealing with points of order on how Angus Taylor is not actually answering the question. They have called in Christian Porter to answer whether or not Taylor was answering the question. Taylor is back: Mr Speaker, and as I was saying, emissions in that year were 100m tonnes, over 100m tonnes below what was forecast by the climate change authority in 2013, and now it is true Mr Speaker, it is true Mr Speaker from year to year and quarter to quarter, emissions go up and down. That is what happens, Mr Speaker. But it is all LNG\u2019s fault. He is done. Taylor is not having a good day. Speaking of the member for Maribyrnong, Bill Shorten is back from leave and in the chamber. Mark Butler to ... #WELLDONEANGUS It\u2019s like watching a wounded gazelle being slowly cut off from the pack. \u201cMy question again is to the member for emissions reduction: did Australia\u2019s total annual carbon emissions rise in the year to December 2016?\u201d Taylor: As I say I am delighted* to take questions from the member for Port Adelaide. He absolutely refused to answer any questions on his policy during the election campaign. And the member for Maribyrnong was not much better, Mr Speaker, wasn\u2019t much better. I have already answered this question, Mr Speaker, in the previous answer but what I can tell you, what I can tell you is that in 2013, in 2013 ...\u201d *He was not, in fact, delighted. Michael McCormack is attempting to answer a question his office wrote. It\u2019s going about how you would expect. Bob Katter has a question for Scott Morrison about dams \u2013 I think. It includes the phrase of whether or not this would make Morrison \u201cthe modern day Moses\u201d. Morrison asks if Katter was in the back row of his church because they were just talking about Moses on Sunday. This is all going into Hansard. \u201cWatch your temper,\u201d someone from Labor yells at Taylor as he takes back his seat. He may have caught on to Labor\u2019s strategy. There are graphs on the paper he is looking at. Greg Hunt has come over to talk to him. There is a lot of hand waving. Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: Did Australia\u2019s total carbon emissions rise to the year to December 2017? Taylor: I\u2019m delighted to take these questions from you because during the election campaign you were not able to answer a single question on the cost of impacts of your energy policies, Mr Speaker! Not a single question! Mr Speaker, we have seen again in the last year a reduction in emissions per capita in emissions intensity and in the electricity sector and it is true of the absolute level there was a small increase in the last 12 months. That was driven entirely, entirely Mr Speaker, by a growth in LNG exports and ...\u201d And he\u2019s decided he has finished his answer. Yesterday it was the day of the female MP dixer. Today, so far, it\u2019s Queensland day, with Julian Simmonds followed by Phil Thompson. The government is still talking about its tax package, which has passed. Tony Smith is triggered by the LNG export reference, so he again pulls Angus Taylor, the Rhode\u2019s scholar (how do you know he\u2019s a Rhode\u2019s scholar? He\u2019ll tell you) and tells him to answer the question. #WelldoneAngus: Thank you, and as I said, we are at the lowest levels of emissions per person in 29 years and they have been falling year on year, and it is true from year to year they bump up and down, and in the last year there is no doubt, there is no doubt that LNG exports have had an impact, have had an impact on our emissions. There is no doubt about that. But let\u2019s talk about that because in the last year our LNG exports reduced global emissions by up to 26% of our total emissions, because when you sell LNG up into China and Korea and Asia, even though there were the increased emissions from the extraction of that LNG, we see a reduction in global emissions.\u201d Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: Did Australia\u2019s total emissions rise in 2018? Taylor: As I said, we are in our 28th year of economic growth and the emissions per capita are the lowest years, the lowest level in 29 years. From year to year emissions ... we inherited from you opposite a 700m tonne deficit. But there is no doubt that there was upward pressure in recent years on emissions driven by growth in LNG, and that growth in LNG.\u201d I get it. My weight has been subject to upward pressure, too. The first dixer goes to Julian Simmonds, who has asked Scott Morrison just how safe and secure Australia is. VERY is the short answer. The rest of it is about tax relief and border security which, now that has been signed off on with the help of Labor, is about the sum of the government\u2019s agenda. Angus Taylor starts talking about LNG exports. Tony Smith pulls him up before Labor even has a chance to laugh, and tells him he has strayed way off topic. Smith also tells Josh Frydenberg to stop interjecting. Meanwhile, some wags from the Coalition backbench ask about Labor\u2019s primary vote, saying that has gone down. It did. The Coalition\u2019s primary wasn\u2019t exactly historic either. But you know what hasn\u2019t gone down? Australia\u2019s emissions. Anyway, the answer is emissions are going up. Anthony Albanese to Angus Taylor (I miss most of it, but it about whether greenhouse emissions are going up or down.) The minister for emissions reduction: \u201cI would like to inform the house that Australia is currently in its 28th year of economic growth and emissions per capita ... \u201cAs I was saying, the lowest level of emissions per capita in 29 years, Mr Speaker, and the lowest level of emissions intensity in 29 years. Our electricity sector emissions are down 6.5 million tonnes on the year to December 2018. We have seen during that year the highest level of renewable investment in the world. Double the next country in the world. And we are on target to exceed our Kyoto obligations for 2020 by 367 million tonnes.\u201d Albanese says the question was easy: up or down. Tony Smith goes to answer the point of order, and Taylor gets back up, to which Smith tells him to sit down because he hasn\u2019t be called to do anything yet. #welldoneAngus. He\u2019s a Rhode\u2019s scholar don\u2019t cha you know. Scott Morrison is in the House. Question time is about to begin. It\u2019s time for \u201cWho\u2019s that MP?\u201d It\u2019s Kevin Andrews, making yet another invaluable contribution to the Australian parliament from one of the safest electorates in the nation. We are just about to head into the chamber for question time. Paul Karp has your Senate needs covered. Hit me up with your QT predictions. I have a feeling this one will be quite interesting. In other non-surprising news, Labor is also going to allow the (soon to be $5bn) future drought fund to pass through the Senate. The government had the numbers on that anyway. Labor had said it would pass \u201cany number\u201d the government wanted, as long as it was new money. The government plans on redirecting the funding from the Building Australia Fund, which was a Labor initiative which has largely sat dormant under the Coalition. Thank you to the secret squirrel who reminded me of the metadata report the government was due to table yesterday. It did table it. It\u2019s here. It is for July 2016 to June 2017. The date on the report cover sheet is November 2018. It was tabled yesterday, 22 July 2019. That\u2019s a two-year-old report that sat somewhere for nine months. This is the amendment Labor will attempt to move on the temporary exclusion order legislation, before the government ignores it, and then Labor supports the bill anyway. That all words after \u201cThat\u201d be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: \u201cwhilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) notes that: (a) the government has failed to implement in full at least 10 recommendations of the bipartisan parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, without explanation; (b) this is the first time since 2013 that this government has ever openly rejected recommendations of the bipartisan committee; and (c) this rejection constitutes a significant breach of the compact between the opposition and the government on national security bills, which is premised on an understanding that the recommendations of the bipartisan committee are to be respected and implemented; and (2) is of the view that: (a) it is not the job of this parliament to act as a rubber stamp for government bills; the parliament\u2019s job is to get legislation right; (b) this bill should therefore be amended so that it conforms faithfully to the detailed recommendations of the bipartisan parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security; and (c) this bill should be referred back to the bipartisan parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security for further scrutiny.\u201d tl;dr - shut the hell up. You know what it absolutely is not and was never going to be? A third chamber. Just more on what Labor has decided re Newstart. Linda Burney brought the submission to caucus \u2013 that Labor not only wants to review the Newstart payment, but increase it. Before that was just the implied position. So it will now head to the Senate standing committee on economics, but there won\u2019t be a dollar figure put on the rate. Labor wants to know who is having trouble finding work and why, as well as what will be the economic value to raising the rate. Labor won\u2019t vote for the Greens bill because it does not want to support a dollar amount figure just yet. Plus you can\u2019t have money bills originate in the Senate (under the constitution, it can\u2019t deal with finances). I am SHOCKED. SHOCKED* I say, about the findings of this study from RMIT. A study of dictators over the past 150 years shows they are rarely associated with strong economies, and quite often with weaker ones. Autocratic leaders are often credited with purposefully delivering good economic outcomes, such as the late Lee Kuan-Yew, who is widely credited with Singapore\u2019s prosperity. But new research published in the Leadership Quarterly journal by researchers from RMIT University and Victoria University in Melbourne, Australia, challenges that long-held assumption. RMIT economist Dr Ahmed Skali said robust analysis of data on economic growth, political regimes and political leaders from 1858 to 2010 found dictators rarely oversaw strong economies. \u201cIn an era where voters are willingly trading their political freedoms in exchange for promises of strong economic performance to strongman figures like Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin or Recep Tayyip Erdogan, it\u2019s important to understand whether autocratic leaders do deliver economic growth,\u201d Skali said. \u201c ... Autocrats whose countries experienced larger than average economic growth were found only as frequently as you would predict based on chance alone. \u201cIn contrast, autocrats overseeing poor economic growth were found significantly more frequently than chance would predict. \u201cTaken together, these two results cast serious doubt on the view that autocratic leaders are successful at promoting economic growth.\u201d *Not actually shocked. I am Lithuanian after all. Anyone who is surprised by Labor\u2019s position on the temporary exclusion orders shouldn\u2019t be. This nation has had a bipartisan position on national security, pretty much since we were sent to war after 9/11. And it was so successfully weaponised that any questioning of any legislation which has a national security element leads to WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON attacks. And so we have yet another national security bill about to sail through the parliament. Even though there are concerns over the bill. Even though a joint, bipartisan committee, which is government heavy, has recommendations the government is not accepting. That pesky constitution again Quelle surprise And just in case you missed Murph\u2019s story from this morning: The independent health advice panel overseeing medical transfers for asylum seekers languishing offshore says there were 73 admissions covering 43 people at the RPC medical centre on Nauru in the first quarter of 2019, with \u2018the majority\u2019 relating to mental health conditions. The first quarterly report of the independent panel, obtained by Labor under an order for the production of documents in the Senate, found that in addition to the 73 admissions, with stays ranging between one and 44 days, there were 8,260 medical consultations provided to people on Nauru in the quarter \u2013 mostly for mental health problems. The new figures underscoring significant problems with the mental health and wellbeing of asylum seekers, and people whose asylum claims have failed, came as the Liberal backbencher Russell Broadbent declared on Monday Australia could not continue with \u2018indefinite detention\u2019. It being Tuesday, party rooms are under way. The Greens have resolved to try to amend the government\u2019s drought legislation to say it should not be funded by the Building Australia Fund but instead by the petroleum resources rent tax. Given the Senate can\u2019t actually impose that change without creating constitutional issues, this proposal will be put in a second reading amendment just as a proposal. I\u2019d be surprised if that got wide-ranging support in the Senate but strange things happen and I will keep an eye out. Other amendments are proposed to increase transparency from the fund, make the grants and the investment mandate disallowable, and ensure practice is consistent with the Murray-Darling Basin plan. A couple of insights too, from the Greens national conference at the weekend. We\u2019ve reported that there has been some internal debate about a proposal to give party members a say in electing the federal leader. The conference resolved to make a final decision on the model for giving members a say by next May (bearing in mind that this discussion has been going on inside the Greens since 2016). The Greens will also attempt to build support in this parliament for declaring a climate emergency. Joel Fitzgibbon responded to Michael McCormack\u2019s comments, also on Sky, saying his \u201cjust move\u201d policy was not a stroke of genius, but something you say when you have no policy. I am sorry, but that is such a privileged view from our deputy prime minister. Let\u2019s assume you are in the best case scenario to take up his advice, and don\u2019t have children or dependants \u2013 for whom you would need to find care while you move to a place where you know no one \u2013 are healthy, have previous experience and no pets. You still need money to move. Best case scenario that will cost you $2,000, and that is doing it yourself, with limited furniture. You need bond money \u2013 again, let\u2019s assume rent of $200 a week, so that is $800. We\u2019ve hit $3,000 and you haven\u2019t even hit the pavement yet. Politicians receive more travel allowance in a day when they are in Canberra than people on Newstart receive in a week. Those extra payments the government harps on about, at best, add about $10 a week. It is not as easy as \u201cmove and you\u2019ll find work\u201d. And that has nothing to do with talking regional communities down, which is one of Michael McCormack\u2019s favourite complaints about city media. Many of us come from rural and regional communities, have family and friends there. Living in a city doesn\u2019t mean you have no understanding of how the rest of the nation works. But living in a privileged position and pretending you don\u2019t need to raise the unemployment benefit \u2013 the benefit that everyone from social service councils to the business community say needs to increase because it\u2019s been close to 20 years since it was seriously reviewed \u2013 and people can just \u201cmove\u201d to get jobs? That\u2019s some bubble bullshit right there. Michael McCormack on Newstart, after questioning from Kieran Gilbert on Sky News: There are jobs out there in regional Australia and there are good paying jobs and what I think we do need in this country is a more mobile workforce. And so people have to be prepared to move sometimes out of their comfort zone and their home town and move to the next town to take a job. There are jobs there \u2013 it is just that you\u2019re not always going to get a job in the home town you\u2019ve grown up in; you\u2019re not always going to get the job that you actually want for the right here and now. But a job, any job will be better than none at all and it will be better than living on welfare. Certainly with Newstart, it is that safety net measure. It is not meant to be a living wage. What we support is more jobs growth, and we\u2019ve already through business helped create the economic conditions to grow [jobs].\u201d Asked how people are supposed to live and feed themselves on Newstart \u2013 and look for work, given the transport and accommodation costs \u2013 McCormack says: \u201cIndeed, and it would be a very meagre existence, but it is only supposed to be a safety net out there, between jobs. There are jobs out there, and that is why I encourage people who have either slipped through the cracks, and they just can\u2019t find work at the moment, to look around. There are many jobs. \u201cYou go into Dubbo and it is almost full employment in Dubbo and you go up the main streets of some regional towns, indeed, regional capitals, and there are notes in the windows that say \u2018job available, apply within\u2019 and there are so many jobs, and people have to have the wherewithal to go to those places and have the capacity and indeed have the innovative spirit to actually move out of their home town where they have lived all their life and go to a town where there are jobs available.\u201d You know what it takes to move towns? MONEY. Which people on Newstart DO NOT HAVE. Michael McCormack sees jobs, people. Party room and caucus are on right now, which is why it is so quiet. We\u2019ll bring you the updates when those meetings break. The Australian Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance is a bit cranky with the government over its proposed legislation to tackle (illegally) phoenix businesses \u2013 companies which are deliberately liquidated to avoid debts, and then restarted as a new business. From its statement: The Australian Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance (ATA), a 75,000+ member national grassroots advocacy group that represents the nation\u2019s taxpayers, today condemned new powers proposed for the Australian Taxation Office under the Morrison government\u2019s Treasury Laws Amendment (Combating Illegal Phoenixing) Bill 2019 which is listed for debate in parliament this week. \u201cBy granting the ATO the power to make its own arbitrary estimates about how much GST a business will owe without any independent review or appeals process prior to the imposition of liability, this shocking new legislation is likely to drive innocent and hardworking taxpaying businesses bankrupt,\u201d said Satya Marar, ATA\u2019s director of policy. \u201cTaxpayers nationwide should be even more concerned as these powers will be backed by the threat of withholding tax refunds and making small business owners personally liable before any legal or factual dispute is resolved.\u201d Side note, but lovely news: Labor MP Amanda Rishworth welcomed Oscar Walker into the world yesterday, making him the first baby of the 46th parliament. And just in case it is of interest, there have been 33 boat turnbacks since 2013, when the Coalition was elected. But don\u2019t take my word for it. Here is the official report on it, which was largely created from numbers provided to Senate estimates. After two and a bit days of actual parliament sitting, Anthony Albanese finishes with this view on how he sees the government\u2019s behaviour so far: This government is obsessed by looking for arguments rather than looking for solutions. They won the election in May. And ever since then they\u2019ve acted like an opposition in exile. They looking for wedge politics. On each occasion they are putting up legislation they are not saying we\u2019re putting this forward because it\u2019s in the national interest. They saying we\u2019re putting this forward because it\u2019s a test for Labor. That\u2019s a bizarre way for a government that was elected just two months ago into its third term to be behaving. That follows Scott Morrison\u2019s assertion during question time on Monday that Labor, under Albanese, was back to being the opposition with a capital O. Which is, you know, strange, given that so far Labor has voted with the government on all its major pieces of legislation \u2013 namely the tax package and drought funding, even if it has expressed concerns with parts of the bill. Asked by Sky News\u2019s Laura Jayes about Labor\u2019s position on the temporary exclusion orders, Anthony Albanese had this to say: What we\u2019ll be doing is, one, Kristina Keneally has written to Peter Dutton asking for the legislation to be referred back to the joint intelligence committee. The joint intelligence committee has operated very well. These are difficult circumstances. We live in an unsafe world. And the joint intelligence committee has been able to receive briefings from the security agencies, has been able to come to positions on a unanimous basis. It\u2019s chaired by Andrew Hastie, there is a majority of government members on that committee, and every single one of its recommendations for a number of years have been adopted by the parliament and supported by Labor and the Coalition. Now, what\u2019s happened with the temporary exclusion orders is that a number of the recommendations that were made unanimously by the committee chair, Andrew Hastie, had been rejected by the government. The government hasn\u2019t made a case of why that is, why that\u2019s occurring. Some of those recommendations are based upon international experience, for example, that it should be under the UK legislation \u2013 it\u2019s a judge who\u2019s able to make the determination rather than the minister. The government hasn\u2019t put forward a reason why that should be done any differently. It also has a recommendation that we needed to take into account whether there is somewhere else for the person affected by the order to go. And the reason why that was the case, of course, was because of people concerned about legal challenges on these issues. So a commonsense approach is what we\u2019re taking, Laura, an approach that\u2019s consistent with what was previously a bipartisan position. One of Peter Dutton\u2019s main reasons for wanting to repeal the medevac legislation is that it contains no processes for returning asylum seekers or refugees to Manus Island or Nauru once their treatment has been completed. Which is interesting, given that the vast majority of people brought to the mainland for treatment under the previous government regime (which often involved the federal court ordering the government to bring people for treatment, a judicial power the government was attempting to challenge) are still in Australia, receiving treatment. Anyone brought to Australia for treatment remains in detention. They are not released into the community and are escorted to their appointments. They remain under guard. Anthony Albanese was on Sky this morning and had this to say about the report a boat from Sri Lanka was intercepted on its way to Australia: This is only been put in the Australian newspaper by the usual, the usual suspects. And I am prepared to say that has obviously been put there by the government ... Well because \u2013 who else has put it there? The asylum seekers themselves?\u201d On the medevac repeal legislation, which has been sent to a parliamentary committee for review and report back in October (meaning it probably won\u2019t hit the parliament again until November), Albanese had this to say when asked if Labor was willing to \u201ctweak it\u201d: No. The fact is, it\u2019s working. If the government has any practical suggestions I can put them forward, but they haven\u2019t done that. They\u2019ve just engaged in rhetoric. There are some 90 people who have been brought to Australia under the medevac legislation; there\u2019s 900 who have been brought to Australia by the government itself prior to the medevac legislation being there. So the government hasn\u2019t, I don\u2019t believe, made a case for change. This legislation was pretty straightforward. It allowed for the minister himself to appoint the committee that makes the decisions about these matters. Indeed, a number of the objections have been upheld by the committee when issues have been raised. Quite clearly, the government rhetoric was if this legislation was passed last December, then there would be floods of boats coming and everyone who was currently in offshore processing would be brought to Australia. That hasn\u2019t happened. And indeed, the numbers of 90 are very modest compared to the numbers of 900 which occurred previously.\u201d Not a total surprise, given the first week was mostly taken up with pomp and ceremony, but the Senate sort of ran out of legislation to debate last night. Penny Wong\u2019s eyebrows were at peak Penny Wong as she delivered this spray to the government in the Senate just before 8.30pm: It\u2019s the Monday of this sitting week, and we have the government saying, \u2018Guess what? We have run out of legislation in the Senate. We want to go to the address-in-reply.\u2019 The same old tried and true delaying tactic that governments use when they have to fill Senate chamber time. They\u2019ve already gone to that at 8.25pm on the Monday night of the sitting week. What is the government\u2019s agenda? Where is the government\u2019s agenda? The government doesn\u2019t have an agenda for the Senate. Do you know why? Because you\u2019ve just spent the day in the House of Representatives trying to gain a wedge on the Labor party to abolish the Building Australia Fund because you want to talk about drought. You\u2019ve had a situation where the prime minister is so focused on playing politics that he hasn\u2019t even wanted to allow the shadow cabinet to meet to determine a position. He hasn\u2019t wanted to allow the caucus to meet to determine a position. He\u2019s so desperate to make sure he gets a political wedge up, and you come in here and, so embarrassingly, don\u2019t have any legislation for the Senate that you have to go to the address-in-reply at 8.25pm on the Monday night of a sitting week. What are we all doing? We\u2019re all sitting here waiting for Mr Morrison to get the votes through the House of Representatives, which he hasn\u2019t got as yet, on legislation to abolish the Building Australia Fund because he wants to try and wedge the Labor party on drought. If you ever wanted an example of a government that doesn\u2019t have an agenda, you have it now. You have it with senator Ruston sitting here saying, \u2018You do what you want, senator Wong, because we don\u2019t have any legislation. I\u2019ve got an address-in-reply I want to get in. That\u2019s what I want to do because I want delay tactics, as the government manager, as long as possible.\u2019 Here is senator Cormann. He\u2019s coming in to make up an agenda. You\u2019re on to the address-in-reply at 8.25 on a Monday night because you haven\u2019t got any legislation. I say the Senate should adjourn until you\u2019ve got an agenda to debate. The reason you haven\u2019t got an agenda today is because you\u2019ve been so focused on playing politics in the lower house and you haven\u2019t got any legislation through. You could have put legislation through the lower house today. But you haven\u2019t. Instead you\u2019ve chosen to delay because you want a political debate on the Building Australia Fund abolition. That is entirely what is occurring.\u201d Welcome to day two of parliament \u2013 which is day 15 for the year. Because 2019 is the new 2004, we are talking national security and WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON. Peter Dutton has decided temporary exclusion orders, which have been in place in the UK since 2015, is URGENT with a capital POLITICS and is pushing the parliament into passing the bill, without taking into account all the recommendations from the joint parliamentary security committee. That committee is headed up by Liberal Andrew Hastie, and recommended a range of changes, including that there be some judicial oversight of any temporary exclusion order. Labor has said it is willing to support the spirit of the laws, but wants a tad more oversight. Cue all of the WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON rhetoric. Or, if you are Michael McCormack, WHICH SIDE DO YOU SIT ON. Kristina Keneally had this to say, this morning: Labor has always supported the intent of the temporary exclusion order (TEO) legislation and any claims otherwise \u2013 such as this bill being a \u201ctest for Labor\u201d \u2013 are nonsense. Labor and the Liberals have already come together in agreeing to support the TEO laws subject to the bipartisan recommendations made by the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security (PJCIS), a Liberal-dominated committee which is chaired by Liberal MP Andrew Hastie. The PJCIS has operated for years to achieve bipartisanship on national security legislation. Since 2013 the government has not explicitly rejected a recommendation of the PJCIS. The cooperative value of the PJCIS to reach consensus and improve national security legislation provides significant benefit to our national security agencies and to Australians. The government should not jeopardise or politicise the important work of the PJCIS.\u201d Meanwhile, the fact a third boat from Sri Lanka had been intercepted on its way to Australia managed to find its way into the Australian newspaper, just as Dutton and the government attempt to gain support to repeal medevac. Yes, medevac has been in place since February, but there was also a pretty awful terrorist attack in Sri Lanka earlier this year, but that doesn\u2019t tend to get mentioned. We\u2019ll bring you all of the national security argy bargy, as well as the fight over drought funding, as this brave new civil parliament enters its second week of sitting. Mike Bowers is out and about, and you\u2019ll also have Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp helping to steer the ship. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it",

      "bodyText": "The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has urged discipline among MPs, warning that the party\u2019s election win does not give them a \u201cblank cheque\u201d to freelance on issues beyond what was promised to the Australian public. As Coalition MPs agitate publicly for policy changes on Newstart and superannuation, Morrison told the party room meeting on Tuesday that they should be mindful of \u201cwhat we took to the election and what we didn\u2019t take to the election\u201d and stick to delivering on the party\u2019s \u201cvalues and policies\u201d. \u201cGovernment is not a blank cheque,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cIt is a contract with the public and they understand why they voted for us. \u201cWe must all be mindful of sticking to that and not running off on other issues that we didn\u2019t take to the election and especially not doing so publicly.\u201d The prime minister said that if MPs had policy issues they wanted to explore, they should first speak to the relevant minister and use the backbench committee process and the party room to ventilate ideas. He cited examples of where positive progress had been made using such avenues, including policy development for suicide prevention, Indigenous recognition and help for eating disorders. \u201cThey are the processes you can use to get things done. And also the processes that, when you use them effectively, earn the respect of your colleagues,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go outside of those processes, it\u2019s showing disrespect to those you\u2019re sitting next to, it\u2019s showing disrespect to your other colleagues.\u201d But as the prime minister urged unity, MPs raised concern about the party\u2019s position on a number of issues, including constitutional recognition and Newstart, while new Queensland senator Gerard Rennick asked government MPs to tell former ministers Julie Bishop and Christopher Pyne to quit their new jobs as they were \u201ccreating difficulties\u201d for the government. Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce told the party room that the government should consider a lift to the Newstart payment, saying people were \u201cdoing it tough\u201d and were relying heavily on services such as St Vincent de Paul and the Salvation Army. Queensland senator James McGrath asked Morrison to clarify what the party\u2019s position was on constitutional recognition, after the party split on whether an Indigenous \u201cvoice\u201d to parliament, as recommended by the Uluru Statement of the Heart, would be enshrined in the constitution. Morrison emphasised that there had been no change to the party\u2019s position since the election and suggested it had been \u201cunfair\u201d to suggest that Wyatt had proposed otherwise. Wyatt urged colleagues to consult with their communities and noted that \u201che did not want to see the nation divided, he wanted to find a way for us to walk together\u201d He also assured them that if the government pursued an Indigenous voice, it would be legislated and not constitutionally enshrined. MPs also spoke about the case of academic Peter Ridd, with the attorney general, Christian Porter, suggesting the commonwealth could offer financial assistance to help his legal fight against James Cook University. James Cook University is considering its legal options after the federal circuit court ruled it had unlawfully sacked a professor who had criticised scientific research about the climate change impact on the Great Barrier Reef. The education minister, Dan Tehan, said he was concerned about academic freedom, while Porter has told MPs a commonwealth fund \u2013 the Commonwealth Public Interest and Test Cases Scheme \u2013 may be available to help. A spokesman said the scheme provided \u201cfinancial assistance for cases of public importance, that settle an uncertain area or question of commonwealth law, or that resolve a question of commonwealth law that affects the rights of a disadvantaged section of the public\u201d. As the Coalition focuses its attention on national security and industrial relations legislation in parliament this week, Morrison commended MPs for making a \u201cgood strong start\u201d to the new parliamentary term, but cautioned against hubris. \u201cWe should not underestimate the Labor party because at some stage they will presumably regroup and get their act together.\u201d Labor, which has agreed to support the government\u2019s national security and drought bills, has accused the government of \u201clooking for arguments rather than looking for solutions\u201d. \u201cThey won the election in May, ever since then they\u2019ve acted like an opposition in exile,\u201d opposition leader Anthony Albanese said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for wedge politics and on each occasion they\u2019re putting forward legislation, they\u2019re not saying: \u2018We\u2019re putting this forward because it\u2019s in the national interest.\u2019 They\u2019re saying: \u2018We\u2019re putting this forward because it\u2019s a test for Labor.\u2019 \u201cThat\u2019s a bizarre way for a government that was elected just two months ago into its third term to be behaving.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In an essay from 2003 \u2013 <a href=\"https://statweb.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/papers/thinking.pdf\" title=\"\">The Problem of Thinking Too Much</a> \u2013 the statistician <a href=\"https://statweb.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/\" title=\"\">Persi Diaconis</a> recounts being unable to make his mind up about a move from Stanford University to Harvard. After much discussion, a colleague says: \u201cYou\u2019re one of our leading decision theorists \u2013 maybe you should make a list of the costs and benefits and calculate your expected utility.\u201d To which Diaconis replies: \u201cCome on, Sandy, this is serious.\u201d Even statistical decision theorists do not make serious choices by consulting cold, textbook models. Like the rest of us, they resort to a knottier combination of deliberation, gut feel and blind hope. For choices, so too for beliefs, which, when met with evidence, are pushed and pulled by processes that are equally mysterious.</p> <p>The Australian philosopher Eleanor Gordon-Smith\u2019s first book, <em>Stop Being Reasonable</em>, explores how we really go about changing our minds. Her approach is to probe six real-life stories of people who have had to radically rethink in high-stakes situations. Like Dylan, who, in a flash of insight, realises the apocalyptic cult that he was born into is bogus. Or upper-crust Alex, who appears on a reality TV show in which he has to fake it as a London bouncer and ends up with an unrecognisably new identity. Each story functions as \u201ca miniature of a much larger complex sprawl\u201d, and collectively they give a sense of the richness and strangeness of human reason.</p> <p>The book came out of an item that Gordon-Smith produced for the radio programme <em><a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/\" title=\"\">This American Life</a></em>. Her idea was to wander around a nightlife district of Sydney, wait for the predictable catcalls to start and then try to dissuade her catcallers from engaging in this type of behaviour again. But despite her orderly arguments, the catcallers left the conversations still convinced that it was \u201cOK to grab, yell at, or follow women\u201d. Gordon-Smith\u2019s takeaway from the experience was that people are often unmoved by dispassionate logic, peer-reviewed research and statistics, but in fact are swayed by ego, emotion, self-interest and identity. If we want our public discourse to succeed in changing attitudes, Gordon-Smith insists, we have to ditch our idealised, sterile picture of persuasion and be more sensitive to how people behave in real life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She has a nose for identifying the highlights of this difficult academic literature, and a talent for making it relevant</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Orthodox theories of rationality adopt the sterile picture \u2013 the kind of thing a statistician like Diaconis works on \u2013 as a model of correct reasoning. Gordon-Smith takes a heterodox approach, suggesting that we can discover the secrets of rationality in passionate, messy real-world reasoning \u2013 her idea is that the way Diaconis actually makes up his mind may have a lot to recommend it. Her six stories \u2013 of Dylan, Alex and others \u2013 function both as portraits of fringe psychology and as corner cases for a theory of rationality.</p> <p>Contemporary epistemology, the branch of philosophy that deals with these areas, addresses fascinating and fundamental topics, such as the relationship between reason and emotion, or the role of ethics in the pursuit of truth. It can also be somewhat divorced from real life: one of its subfields analyses the concept of knowledge by devising thought experiments about, for example, mules disguised as zebras. Gordon-Smith has a nose for identifying the highlights of this difficult academic literature, and a talent for making it relevant and accessible (a phenomenon termed \u201ctestimonial injustice\u201d is glossed as \u201cthe bullshit when people dismiss your words for no good reason\u201d).</p> <p>Her book also raises difficult questions. For instance, sometimes all of us just reason sloppily, and any theory of rationality should take this into account. A potential pitfall for an approach to rationality like Gordon-Smith\u2019s is that this basic observation is in danger of being overlooked: by tightly tethering the normative to the descriptive her proposal risks leading to the absurd consequence that all human reasoning is deemed rational. For example, are we comfortable accepting that climate change denial, or for that matter believing that women enjoy being catcalled, are appropriate responses to the evidence? No doubt Gordon-Smith would shrink in horror at the suggestion. But her book flirts with this odd claim and we are never told how her view distinguishes psychology from rationality, or bad reasoning from good.</p> <p>Gordon-Smith\u2019s silence on this question \u2013 of what rationality requires of us \u2013 might seem like a shortcoming, but in the end it is strategic. She debunks easy answers while shrewdly adopting a position of intellectual humility. She thinks we are ignorant of rationality\u2019s demands, and \u201cvery close to the edge of what we know how to talk about at all sensibly\u201d.</p> <p>It is sometimes held that rationality defines us as human, a claim written into our species name, <em>Homo</em> <em>sapiens</em>. If this is right, it follows from Gordon-Smith\u2019s witty, intelligent book that, like the people she profiles, we do not really know who, or even what, we are.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Stop Being Reasonable: Six Stories of How We Really Change Our Minds </em>by Eleanor Gordon-Smith is published by Scribe (\u00a314.99) in the UK and by <a href=\"https://www.newsouthbooks.com.au/books/stop-being-reasonable/\">NewSouth</a> ($27.99) in Australia.

      "bodyText": "In an essay from 2003 \u2013 The Problem of Thinking Too Much \u2013 the statistician Persi Diaconis recounts being unable to make his mind up about a move from Stanford University to Harvard. After much discussion, a colleague says: \u201cYou\u2019re one of our leading decision theorists \u2013 maybe you should make a list of the costs and benefits and calculate your expected utility.\u201d To which Diaconis replies: \u201cCome on, Sandy, this is serious.\u201d Even statistical decision theorists do not make serious choices by consulting cold, textbook models. Like the rest of us, they resort to a knottier combination of deliberation, gut feel and blind hope. For choices, so too for beliefs, which, when met with evidence, are pushed and pulled by processes that are equally mysterious. The Australian philosopher Eleanor Gordon-Smith\u2019s first book, Stop Being Reasonable, explores how we really go about changing our minds. Her approach is to probe six real-life stories of people who have had to radically rethink in high-stakes situations. Like Dylan, who, in a flash of insight, realises the apocalyptic cult that he was born into is bogus. Or upper-crust Alex, who appears on a reality TV show in which he has to fake it as a London bouncer and ends up with an unrecognisably new identity. Each story functions as \u201ca miniature of a much larger complex sprawl\u201d, and collectively they give a sense of the richness and strangeness of human reason. The book came out of an item that Gordon-Smith produced for the radio programme This American Life. Her idea was to wander around a nightlife district of Sydney, wait for the predictable catcalls to start and then try to dissuade her catcallers from engaging in this type of behaviour again. But despite her orderly arguments, the catcallers left the conversations still convinced that it was \u201cOK to grab, yell at, or follow women\u201d. Gordon-Smith\u2019s takeaway from the experience was that people are often unmoved by dispassionate logic, peer-reviewed research and statistics, but in fact are swayed by ego, emotion, self-interest and identity. If we want our public discourse to succeed in changing attitudes, Gordon-Smith insists, we have to ditch our idealised, sterile picture of persuasion and be more sensitive to how people behave in real life. Orthodox theories of rationality adopt the sterile picture \u2013 the kind of thing a statistician like Diaconis works on \u2013 as a model of correct reasoning. Gordon-Smith takes a heterodox approach, suggesting that we can discover the secrets of rationality in passionate, messy real-world reasoning \u2013 her idea is that the way Diaconis actually makes up his mind may have a lot to recommend it. Her six stories \u2013 of Dylan, Alex and others \u2013 function both as portraits of fringe psychology and as corner cases for a theory of rationality. Contemporary epistemology, the branch of philosophy that deals with these areas, addresses fascinating and fundamental topics, such as the relationship between reason and emotion, or the role of ethics in the pursuit of truth. It can also be somewhat divorced from real life: one of its subfields analyses the concept of knowledge by devising thought experiments about, for example, mules disguised as zebras. Gordon-Smith has a nose for identifying the highlights of this difficult academic literature, and a talent for making it relevant and accessible (a phenomenon termed \u201ctestimonial injustice\u201d is glossed as \u201cthe bullshit when people dismiss your words for no good reason\u201d). Her book also raises difficult questions. For instance, sometimes all of us just reason sloppily, and any theory of rationality should take this into account. A potential pitfall for an approach to rationality like Gordon-Smith\u2019s is that this basic observation is in danger of being overlooked: by tightly tethering the normative to the descriptive her proposal risks leading to the absurd consequence that all human reasoning is deemed rational. For example, are we comfortable accepting that climate change denial, or for that matter believing that women enjoy being catcalled, are appropriate responses to the evidence? No doubt Gordon-Smith would shrink in horror at the suggestion. But her book flirts with this odd claim and we are never told how her view distinguishes psychology from rationality, or bad reasoning from good. Gordon-Smith\u2019s silence on this question \u2013 of what rationality requires of us \u2013 might seem like a shortcoming, but in the end it is strategic. She debunks easy answers while shrewdly adopting a position of intellectual humility. She thinks we are ignorant of rationality\u2019s demands, and \u201cvery close to the edge of what we know how to talk about at all sensibly\u201d. It is sometimes held that rationality defines us as human, a claim written into our species name, Homo sapiens. If this is right, it follows from Gordon-Smith\u2019s witty, intelligent book that, like the people she profiles, we do not really know who, or even what, we are. \u2022 Stop Being Reasonable: Six Stories of How We Really Change Our Minds by Eleanor Gordon-Smith is published by Scribe (\u00a314.99) in the UK and by NewSouth ($27.99) in Australia.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is expected to be elected leader of the Conservatives within the next few hours, entering Downing Street as Theresa May\u2019s successor on Wednesday. He is likely to win by a substantial margin over his rival, Jeremy Hunt, after a seven-week contest in which 160,000 Conservative members have picked the next prime minister to govern the country. Johnson is set to take office at a time of political crisis over Brexit as he has promised to seek a new deal with the EU or leave without an agreement at the end of October. However, parliament has rejected May\u2019s deal and refused to countenance a no-deal Brexit, while the EU has consistently said it will not reopen the agreement for further negotiations. At least three cabinet ministers \u2013 Philip Hammond, Rory Stewart and David Gauke \u2013 have said they will resign from the cabinet in the next 36 hours rather than serve under Johnson because he is prepared to carry out a no-deal Brexit. Anne Milton, a business minster, pre-emptively resigned on Tuesday before Johnson\u2019s appointment, saying she had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about a no-deal Brexit. Margot James, a fellow business minister, also resigned from her job last week saying it was \u201cconcerning enough\u201d that Johnson was prepared to leave the EU without a deal, but refusing to rule out proroguing parliament to push it through was a \u201cbridge too far\u201d. Tory rebels have also threatened to vote down his government in the autumn if he pursues such a path and fails to approach the job with a conciliatory manner that brings together the party and country. Johnson campaign sources said he would stress unity as he speaks to the country following his election and appoint a \u201cbalanced\u201d cabinet. Michael Fallon, the former defence secretary, told the BBC he believed there would be \u201csome support for how we can get this agreement improved\u201d. On Johnson\u2019s critics within his own party, he suggested Hammond \u201cneeds a rest\u201d and said: \u201cI can\u2019t see any of them being self-indulgent enough to bring the government down.\u201d The would-be Tory rebels are not planning to challenge Johnson immediately, even though Alan Duncan quit as a minister on Monday and unsuccessfully tried to lay a motion to test Johnson\u2019s majority before he takes office. They said they were prepared to give Johnson a chance to avoid a no-deal Brexit and strike a fresh agreement with Brussels but he would need to move quickly. Gauke, the justice secretary who is likely to resign shortly, also said he was not prepared to vote down Johnson\u2019s government in a confidence vote. He said it would be \u201ca risk for my colleagues\u201d because it would trigger an election that could put Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street. However, the scale of the problems facing Johnson were set out by William Hague, the former party leader, in his Telegraph column (\u00a3). \u201cThe \u2018do or die\u2019 approach to Brexit by October 31 is counter-productive, since it fails to frighten the EU but is driving some current cabinet ministers into opposition inside the party. A government whose main policy is opposed by Philip Hammond, an accomplished chancellor; David Gauke, an excellent justice secretary; and Rory Stewart, one of the best hopes for the future, is in near-terminal trouble from its first hour. \u201cIt will be worth keeping in personal contact with these and other disaffected colleagues, since it would be bad enough for a Tory government to be brought down by its own side but still more tragic if it happened because of misunderstanding.\u201d In a scathing analysis, Hague said Johnson had \u201cconsistently advocated an improved deal with the EU, but steadily made that pretty much impossible to obtain\u201d. He warned that Johnson may not survive for long in the job and urged him not to \u201cmuck it up\u201d by failing to govern with a broad centre right unionist agenda. He added: \u201cThe wafer-thin margin of the Conservative and DUP majority in the Commons, and the opposition to your Brexit policy by a substantial number of Tories, means that unless you have a lot of Labour MPs up your sleeve you are only a few weeks from a fateful choice: becoming the second prime ministerial prisoner of this deadlocked parliament or seeking a new parliament. \u201cIt is perfectly good to be mysterious about what you will do in this situation, as long as it is not a mystery to you.

The breaches of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act are revealed in a Commonwealth Ombudsman report for the period July 2016 to June 2017, tabled in parliament by the government on Monday. The metadata retention laws, introduced in 2015, allow law enforcement agencies to access telecommunications data including call records, IP addresses and other so-called metadata when investigating certain offences. Journalists\u2019 data can also be accessed, but only with a warrant. In addition to one instance of the Australian federal police accessing a journalist\u2019s data without a warrant reported in 2017, the ombudsman discovered two instances where the WA police applied for \u2013 and obtained \u2013 a journalist information warrant from a person not authorised to provide it. \u201cThis occurred due to a lack of awareness by WA police regarding to whom an application for a journalist information warrant could be made,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn response to this issue, WA police took steps to quarantine all information obtained under the invalid warrants.\u201d The report also revealed that between 13 and 26 October 2015 \u201call authorisations within ACT policing were made by an officer not authorised\u201d by the relevant section of the law. \u201cThis issue affected 116 authorisations during the period,\u201d it said. \u201cThis issue also affected a large number of authorisations dating back to March 2015, which precede the commencement of our office\u2019s oversight on 13 October 2015.\u201d The AFP advised the breach occurred because its commissioner failed to authorise any officers within ACT Policing to access metadata due to an \u201cadministrative oversight\u201d. The ombudsman recommended the AFP quarantine all telecommunications data obtained under the 116 authorisations, which the AFP accepted. \u201cHowever it did not act to quarantine the affected data at that time, which resulted in additional use and communication of the data,\u201d the report said. Despite the quarantine process beginning in February 2018, the data had still not been fully quarantined by April 2018.

The ombudsman discovered \u201cone area of the NSW police which was routinely exercising its telecommunications data powers without a written or electronic authorisation in place\u201d. That area accessed data with verbal approval, recorded in a log, which the ombudsman said in its view was \u201cnot \u2026 permitted by the act\u201d. It recommended a policy review \u201cto ensure all authorisations for telecommunications data are in written or electronic form and signed by the relevant authorised officer\u201d. The ombudsman said in \u201cseveral\u201d instances agencies were \u201cunable to provide access to, or locate the telecommunications data obtained under authorisations\u201d. The ombudsman also found the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (Asic) had circumvented its inability to issue ongoing preservation notices for data to telecommunications companies because it is not an authorised interception agency. Ongoing notices allow a law enforcement agency that is also an interception agency to require a carrier to preserve stored communications from the time it receives the notice until the end of the 29th day after that date. The ombudsman found that Asic issued daily historic preservation notices 29 days in a row, which had \u201ca similar effect to giving an ongoing preservation notice\u201d despite Asic not having the powers of an interception agency. The ombudsman said the practice was \u201cnot strictly\u201d in breach of the law. The ombudsman inspected 170 authorisations at the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, finding that in 42 cases data outside the authority\u2019s parameters were obtained, in 41 cases due to \u201cautomatic and unintentional\u201d input from its database. Labor has questioned why the ombudsman\u2019s report, dated November 2018, was tabled nine months later and two years after the period it reported on. The 2017-18 report is also overdue. The metadata retention laws are currently the subject of a parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security committee review. Through that process the AFP has revealed it accessed the metadata of journalists 58 times in the 2017-18 financial year, while the WA police complained it had difficulty obtaining a journalist information warrant and had to make an application in South Australia owing to a public interest advocate not being based in WA. The ABC\u2019s Media Watch program on Monday night revealed for the first time the names of the public interest advocates selected to argue on behalf of journalists about information warrants. Those the government has selected so far are former judges and, according to Media Watch, at least one had argued against a warrant, while another had pointed out errors in the application for a warrant that led to the application being dropped. The PJCIS is also examining the impact of the use of national security laws such as the mandatory data retention legislation on freedom of the press in the wake of the AFP raids on the ABC and the home of the News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst over leaks related to national security and defence matters.",

      "body": "<p>I am in a determinedly neutral room on Harley Street, my feet in stirrups, my dignity nearly preserved by a flimsy sheet. On the monitor in front of me is my womb, empty of baby but nevertheless being energetically narrated by Prof Nick Macklon. He points out my contraceptive device, my uterine lining gearing up for evacuation in about a fortnight, the visible vacancy left by my just-departed egg \u2013 Macklon describes it all as being like a pivotal scene in an action movie. The stakes, certainly, feel high.</p> <p>I am midway through my \u201cfertility MOT\u201d: yes, like for a vehicle, but for my ovaries. The two-part process \u2013 offered by the London Women\u2019s Clinic (LWC) and other fertility clinics like it, for a few hundred pounds \u2013 consists of a blood test followed two weeks later by a \u201cnot overly invasive\u201d pelvic ultrasound. Alongside a consultation about your medical history and lifestyle, the results help you to understand your own fertility status and likely ability to conceive, now and in the future. \u201cI must say, I really hate that term, \u2018MOT\u2019,\u201d Macklon, medical director of LWC, had remarked earlier, back at his desk. \u201cWomen aren\u2019t cars.\u201d We aren\u2019t cars \u2013 but there are a lot of fiddly parts, which we are mostly ignorant of until they don\u2019t work.</p> <p>If you had asked me half an hour ago \u2013 as I sat in the clinic\u2019s stately waiting room, a baby\u2019s cry faintly, ominously audible from afar \u2013 I would have put my grasp on my fertility as slightly above average. I knew, for example, that I had been born with a finite number of eggs and that, at 28, I was approaching the age at which I should be starting to take it seriously. But with the reality of children still entirely, ludicrously at odds with my day-to-day life, I had felt content to leave the picture blurry.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t even sure that I wanted them, after all. From when I was a little girl to my mid-20s, I had steadfastly maintained that I would never have children of my own. In recent years, my flatmate had amassed a collection of photographs of me holding babies, their faces creased in terror, that, as a whole, seemed to form some damning body of evidence of my lack of maternal instincts.</p> <p>But as I reached my late 20s, something started to shift, tediously on schedule. Choices such as whether to move country, or change job, or dump or not-dump a boyfriend started to seem properly consequential. Friends my age started admitting to concerns about \u201crunning out of time\u201d; older friends who had witnessed too many heartbreaking struggles to conceive, urged me to take them seriously. And the reality of being a woman means you are afforded the luxury of ambivalence only for so long.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8cc0628196f125adec707434469fe5182a7ab98d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cc0628196f125adec707434469fe5182a7ab98d/1378_0_3886_3984/975.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Nick Macklon: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a good thing to plan these things\u201d.\" width=\"975\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Macklon: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a good thing to plan these things\u201d.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The MOT service, offered by LWC for the past two years, was born of two things, says Macklon: greater clarity about the impact of time on fertility, and the widespread lack of awareness of it. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30248536\" title=\"\">A 2018 meta-study</a> concluded that \u201cknowledge is insufficient, particularly in determining when female fertility markedly decreases\u201d \u2013 and this despite the tendency to delay children until later in life. In 2016, the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/bulletins/birthsbyparentscharacteristicsinenglandandwales/2016#average-ages-of-mothers-and-fathers-have-continued-to-rise\" title=\"\">average age of women</a> at first birth was 28.8 years, compared with 27.3 years in 2006. \u201cThere is clearly a lack of understanding among women that, essentially, their fertility ends about 10 years before they get their menopause, rather than when they get their menopause,\u201d says Macklon. \u201cThat is the huge information gap.\u201d</p> <p>Though they may be getting periods, many women do not even start reliably ovulating every month until they are in their mid-20s. Fertility peaks soon after, then starts to decline, though \u201cnot catastrophically\u201d, Macklon adds. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a steady progression downwards from about the age of 27 or 28.\u201d My age, then. I am starting to feel a bit panicked. The fertile window is from the mid-20s to the mid-30s \u2013 not exactly languorous, even with physiology on your side, and that can vary significantly.</p> <p>I was correct that women were born with all the eggs they will ever have, about 1m of them, but that number has usually halved by puberty \u2013 and I am shocked to learn that we lose about 30 to 40 eggs each month. Before each period, Macklon explains with enthusiasm, \u201ca whole group of eggs will have decided: \u2018It\u2019s our time now. We\u2019ve been waiting 20-odd years; this is it, off we go.\u2019\u201d Hooked on hormones, they start growing.</p> <p>Two weeks before ovulation, between about five and 20 eggs \u2013 a clutch, if you will \u2013 will be contenders. \u201cOf those 20, maybe one will be a little bit more mature, a little bit more sensitive to the hormones\u201d \u2013 and that frontrunner will start producing another hormone to stymie its competitors. \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting sibling behaviour,\u201d says Macklon, almost fondly. (And just as cut-throat as sperms\u2019 race to fertilise, I note \u2013 without any of the mythologising.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89153085b371e21a8eb041485c13a5493c47a50d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89153085b371e21a8eb041485c13a5493c47a50d/0_531_7921_4755/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elle Hunt undergoes fertility tests at the London Women\u2019s Clinic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elle Hunt undergoes fertility tests at the London Women\u2019s Clinic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over time, women not only lose eggs, but their quality depletes. \u201cThe consequences are, as women leave childbearing until their late 30s, their chances of producing an egg that is of high enough quality to produce a healthy baby falls,\u201d says Macklon.

      "bodyText": "I am in a determinedly neutral room on Harley Street, my feet in stirrups, my dignity nearly preserved by a flimsy sheet. On the monitor in front of me is my womb, empty of baby but nevertheless being energetically narrated by Prof Nick Macklon. He points out my contraceptive device, my uterine lining gearing up for evacuation in about a fortnight, the visible vacancy left by my just-departed egg \u2013 Macklon describes it all as being like a pivotal scene in an action movie. The stakes, certainly, feel high. I am midway through my \u201cfertility MOT\u201d: yes, like for a vehicle, but for my ovaries. The two-part process \u2013 offered by the London Women\u2019s Clinic (LWC) and other fertility clinics like it, for a few hundred pounds \u2013 consists of a blood test followed two weeks later by a \u201cnot overly invasive\u201d pelvic ultrasound. Alongside a consultation about your medical history and lifestyle, the results help you to understand your own fertility status and likely ability to conceive, now and in the future. \u201cI must say, I really hate that term, \u2018MOT\u2019,\u201d Macklon, medical director of LWC, had remarked earlier, back at his desk. \u201cWomen aren\u2019t cars.\u201d We aren\u2019t cars \u2013 but there are a lot of fiddly parts, which we are mostly ignorant of until they don\u2019t work. If you had asked me half an hour ago \u2013 as I sat in the clinic\u2019s stately waiting room, a baby\u2019s cry faintly, ominously audible from afar \u2013 I would have put my grasp on my fertility as slightly above average. I knew, for example, that I had been born with a finite number of eggs and that, at 28, I was approaching the age at which I should be starting to take it seriously. But with the reality of children still entirely, ludicrously at odds with my day-to-day life, I had felt content to leave the picture blurry. I wasn\u2019t even sure that I wanted them, after all. From when I was a little girl to my mid-20s, I had steadfastly maintained that I would never have children of my own. In recent years, my flatmate had amassed a collection of photographs of me holding babies, their faces creased in terror, that, as a whole, seemed to form some damning body of evidence of my lack of maternal instincts. But as I reached my late 20s, something started to shift, tediously on schedule. Choices such as whether to move country, or change job, or dump or not-dump a boyfriend started to seem properly consequential. Friends my age started admitting to concerns about \u201crunning out of time\u201d; older friends who had witnessed too many heartbreaking struggles to conceive, urged me to take them seriously. And the reality of being a woman means you are afforded the luxury of ambivalence only for so long. The MOT service, offered by LWC for the past two years, was born of two things, says Macklon: greater clarity about the impact of time on fertility, and the widespread lack of awareness of it. A 2018 meta-study concluded that \u201cknowledge is insufficient, particularly in determining when female fertility markedly decreases\u201d \u2013 and this despite the tendency to delay children until later in life. In 2016, the average age of women at first birth was 28.8 years, compared with 27.3 years in 2006. \u201cThere is clearly a lack of understanding among women that, essentially, their fertility ends about 10 years before they get their menopause, rather than when they get their menopause,\u201d says Macklon. \u201cThat is the huge information gap.\u201d Though they may be getting periods, many women do not even start reliably ovulating every month until they are in their mid-20s. Fertility peaks soon after, then starts to decline, though \u201cnot catastrophically\u201d, Macklon adds. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a steady progression downwards from about the age of 27 or 28.\u201d My age, then. I am starting to feel a bit panicked. The fertile window is from the mid-20s to the mid-30s \u2013 not exactly languorous, even with physiology on your side, and that can vary significantly. I was correct that women were born with all the eggs they will ever have, about 1m of them, but that number has usually halved by puberty \u2013 and I am shocked to learn that we lose about 30 to 40 eggs each month. Before each period, Macklon explains with enthusiasm, \u201ca whole group of eggs will have decided: \u2018It\u2019s our time now. We\u2019ve been waiting 20-odd years; this is it, off we go.\u2019\u201d Hooked on hormones, they start growing. Two weeks before ovulation, between about five and 20 eggs \u2013 a clutch, if you will \u2013 will be contenders. \u201cOf those 20, maybe one will be a little bit more mature, a little bit more sensitive to the hormones\u201d \u2013 and that frontrunner will start producing another hormone to stymie its competitors. \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting sibling behaviour,\u201d says Macklon, almost fondly. (And just as cut-throat as sperms\u2019 race to fertilise, I note \u2013 without any of the mythologising.) Over time, women not only lose eggs, but their quality depletes. \u201cThe consequences are, as women leave childbearing until their late 30s, their chances of producing an egg that is of high enough quality to produce a healthy baby falls,\u201d says Macklon. The fertility MOT can give an indication of \u201cwhere an individual is on their biological clock\u201d, and that there is demand for it reflects a more proactive approach to family planning. Ranging in price from about \u00a3200 for a consultation with no pelvic ultrasound, up to \u00a3450 for a male and female package (and \u00a3640 for two women), the service is not cheap, and about half the 800 women a year who undergo the consultation with LWC do so as a first step towards starting fertility treatment, \u201crather than for reassurance or help with future planning\u201d, says Macklon. Those women whose MOTs return problematic results may also be advised to consider egg-freezing, prompting concerns that the tests could be steering them down an uncertain, expensive path. The British Fertility Society (BFS) says that it is important to remember that these tests were developed to inform IVF treatment, not natural fertility, and as such are open to interpretation: \u201cThere is no doubt that tests showing a good ovarian reserve are reassuring but they by no means guarantee a baby; equally, a poor or impaired ovarian reserve does not mean you will struggle and need fertility treatment. Dr Raj Mathur, the BFS secretary, says his view of egg-freezing is \u201ccautiously favourable \u2026 but like everything, we are in danger of overselling its benefits and not adequately reflecting the problems\u201d. Similarly, he said, though the MOT might help some women and couples in their family planning, it should not be mistaken for a comprehensive diagnosis of individual fertility. \u201cThey are not looking at other aspects of women\u2019s fertility \u2013 whether you ovulate or not, whether your fallopian tubes are blocked \u2013 and they are often not looking at the man. They are a kind of incomplete snapshot of one aspect of a couple\u2019s ability to conceive, and that can easily give false reassurance.\u201d The blood-test component of the MOT measures levels of the anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) given off by growing follicles, which indicates how many eggs you have left \u2013 but a study last year found that a diminished ovarian reserve was not associated with infertility. \u201cIf you\u2019re just starting to try for a baby, a low AMH or a high AMH will not affect your chance of conceiving,\u201d says Mathur.

      "bodyText": "In 1993, the New York photographer Fazal Sheikh captured a young girl and her brother staring blankly into the camera. It was shot at a Somali refugee camp in Mandera, Kenya, and is part of the artist\u2019s 25-year journey documenting displaced minorities affected by war and catastrophe. This photo and roughly 150 others are on view in an exhibition opening at the Museum of Contemporary Photography in Chicago, which runs until 29 September. Guest curated by the Nigerian American writer Teju Cole, who is also the photography critic at the New York Times Magazine, the show, entitled Go Down Moses, reflects on human suffering. But looking through the images, which range from a toddler at a homeless shelter to a desolate road shot at night, Cole looked for a throughline to put together \u201ca visual analogy\u201d. \u201cWhen I look at these photos, I\u2019m looking at things we should be talking about: the future, climate change, the population, almost a cataclysm that has wiped out humanity,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything can be innocent any more. It is drawing an explicit comparison between societal upheaval and moments of disorder, moments of dishevel and the current moment.\u201d It all started when the museum invited Cole to peruse their archive of over 15,000 photos, which ranges from a young Aretha Franklin in a recording studio in 1960 to works by young Ethiopian photographer Aida Muluneh. \u201cThey invited me to interpret their archive through a selection,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in how different people can see what is here.\u201d The oldest work in the exhibit is from 1864, a photo by George N Barnard \u2013 an early user of the daguerreotype \u2013 for a photo called the Battle Field of Atlanta, Georgia, No 1, which shows a landscape ravaged by the American civil war. It\u2019s part of Barnard\u2019s time where he worked as the official army photographer for the Mississippi military (he also captured Abraham Lincoln\u2019s inauguration in 1861). However, most of the work is from 1920 to the present, including works by the depression-era American photographer Dorothea Lange, where Cole has selected a shot of a woman\u2019s legs wearing torn pantyhose, sewn together. \u201cWorking during the Great Depression has so much to say to us right in this minute; she took amazing photos in the 1930s to show how the state failed its children and how the government failed the citizens of its state,\u201d Cole says. \u201cIt is unfortunately too familiar in photographic space.\u201d But is it a political exhibition? \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to do anything these days without it having some kind of political energy throbbing behind it. For me, nothing is absent of politics.\u201d The exhibit also features works by Melissa Ann Pinney, a photographer known for capturing girlhood, who took intimate shots from a hairdressing school in 1987, while Zora J Murff, who creates portraits shot in black neighborhoods, details how one Nebraska town has prejudicial housing policies. There\u2019s also a photo by Kerry Coppin, who shot African American neighborhoods in Chicago throughout the 1980s. Coppin once said of his work: \u201cMy photographs are interpretations, testaments, and poems. They are indictments! Not the first, nor the last, in an ongoing debate \u2013 the means by which people of African descent will restore our histories and cultures to their rightful place in the world community.\u201d This exhibition is described as a \u201cpoem of contemporary America, exploring elemental themes of movement, chaos, freedom, and hope\u201d. That\u2019s broad territory, but Cole explains: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of mayhem in this show, a lot of melancholy moments of tension. One of the questions the exhibit asks is: what is hope when it\u2019s not naive? Hope can be very much an embodied thing. It\u2019s something that occurs fleetingly, but there\u2019s power when it occurs.\u201d He adds: \u201cIt attempts to say something about our collective predicaments as human beings. It deals a lot with the American experience.\u201d The photos are not all American. They do, however, reflect upon the consequences of failed decision-making, and look at human suffering with hope, suggesting that a glint of optimism is still possible in contemporary America. \u201cI\u2019m pessimistic and hopeful,\u201d Cole says. \u201cThe facts indicate we\u2019re all in a very hard time.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Who is Maria Ressa and what is Rappler?</strong></h2> <p>Maria Ressa is one of the most highly-regarded journalists in the Philippines. She spent two decades working as an investigative reporter, foreign correspondent and both Manila and Jakarta Bureau Chief for CNN. She then headed the news division of the Philippines biggest TV news channel, ABS-CBN.</p> <p>In 2012, she and three fellow female journalists came together to form Rappler, a online news platform with an ethos similar to a tech start-up, operating with a small team of 12 young reporters and developers. It was the first of its kind in the Philippines, and while initially seen as a site primarily for young readers, through the power of social media it has grown into the forth biggest news website in the Philippines with over 100 journalists. Rappler also works as a fact-checker for Facebook in the Philippines in the fight against fake news.</p> <p>Ressa\u2019s role at Rappler has won her plaudits around the world. She was among the journalists named <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/dec/11/time-person-of-the-year-2018-jamal-khashoggi-journalists\">Time Person of the Year 2018</a>, as well as numerous other prestigious journalism awards.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/13/the-guardian-view-on-media-freedom-it-must-be-defended\">The Guardian view on media freedom: it must be defended | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><br><strong>What has she done to attract President Duterte\u2019s attention?</strong></h2> <p>Ressa and Duterte have been crossing paths for over thirty years. She first interviewed him in the 1980s when he was Mayor of Davao. In 2015, during his election campaign, she conducted a now infamous interview with Duterte in which he confessed to killing three people.</p> <p>However, it was only after Duterte\u2019s election in 2016, when Rappler began shining a spotlight on the pro-Duterte online \u201ctroll army\u201d \u2013 who were pushing out fake news stories and manipulating the narrative around his presidency \u2013 that the organisation began to feel pressure from the administration. Rappler also began reporting critically on the extrajudicial killings, human rights violations and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/19/dutertes-philippines-drug-war-death-toll-rises-above-5000\">fast-rising death toll from Duterte\u2019s brutal war on drugs</a>, with stories demonstrating that the abuses were being carried out by the police with Duterte\u2019s approval.</p> <h2><strong>How did Duterte respond?</strong></h2> <p>The first indicator that Rappler was about to be targeted was during Duterte\u2019s State of the Union speech in July 2017, when, to Ressa\u2019s surprise, he declared that Rappler was \u201cfully owned\u201d by the Americans and therefore in violation of the constitution.</p> <p>Duterte later publicly declared: \u201cNot only is Rappler\u2019s news fake, it being Filipino is also fake.\u201d</p> <p>Ressa fully denies the claim, but in August 2017, the Philippine securities and exchange commission (SEC) began what Ressa described as a \u201csix month fishing expedition\u201d demanding hundreds of documents. By January 2017, the SEC had decided to revoke Rappler\u2019s license but the case went to the court of appeals, where it was remanded back to the SEC for having no basis.</p> <p>The government then began to investigate Rappler for tax evasion, alleging that the company failed to pay the $3m in tax due on the company\u2019s 2015 bond sales to two foreign parties. While usually such investigations take a minimum of a year, the department decided to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/03/philippines-journalist-maria-ressa-turn-herself-in-police-warrant-rappler\"> press charges in just five months</a>. A warrant for Ressa\u2019s arrest was issued in November 2018, and she turned herself into the authorities days later, where she posted bail and was released. The case is still ongoing. Ressa told the Guardian the charges were \u201cwithout basis and clearly politically motivated\u201d.</p> <p>Ressa is not the only Rappler journalist targeted. Last year, Rappler\u2019s political reporter was also banned from the presidential palace where press briefings take place.</p> <h2><strong>What are the new charges she is facing?</strong></h2> <p>In February, Ressa and Rappler were hit with yet another lawsuit, this time for alleged cyber-libel relating to a story published in 2012 about Philippine businessman Wildredo Keng and his connections to a top court judge. Keng had originally filed a lawsuit in 2017 claiming defamation which was it was dropped, but it was refiled again last year.</p> <p>However, as Rappler lawyers have pointed out, the cyber-libel law being used against Rappler and Ressa was enacted four months after the story was published.</p> <p>Nonetheless, 13 February, four plainclothes officers arrived at the Rappler headquarters in Manila and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/13/philippines-journalists-decry-intimidation-as-website-editor-arrested\">arrested Ressa</a>, taking her to the National Bureau of Investigation. She was held overnight, and was released on 14 February morning after posting bail of 100,000 Philipines peso (\u00a31,400).</p> <h2><strong>What happens next?</strong></h2> <p>Ressa has vowed to keep fighting and to continue Rappler\u2019s journalism. On 23 July her libel trial opened in Manila with a brief hearing that ended after testimony from one minor witness. The case is set to resume on 30 July.</p>",

In 2012, she and three fellow female journalists came together to form Rappler, a online news platform with an ethos similar to a tech start-up, operating with a small team of 12 young reporters and developers. It was the first of its kind in the Philippines, and while initially seen as a site primarily for young readers, through the power of social media it has grown into the forth biggest news website in the Philippines with over 100 journalists. Rappler also works as a fact-checker for Facebook in the Philippines in the fight against fake news. Ressa\u2019s role at Rappler has won her plaudits around the world. She was among the journalists named Time Person of the Year 2018, as well as numerous other prestigious journalism awards. What has she done to attract President Duterte\u2019s attention? Ressa and Duterte have been crossing paths for over thirty years. She first interviewed him in the 1980s when he was Mayor of Davao. In 2015, during his election campaign, she conducted a now infamous interview with Duterte in which he confessed to killing three people. However, it was only after Duterte\u2019s election in 2016, when Rappler began shining a spotlight on the pro-Duterte online \u201ctroll army\u201d \u2013 who were pushing out fake news stories and manipulating the narrative around his presidency \u2013 that the organisation began to feel pressure from the administration. Rappler also began reporting critically on the extrajudicial killings, human rights violations and fast-rising death toll from Duterte\u2019s brutal war on drugs, with stories demonstrating that the abuses were being carried out by the police with Duterte\u2019s approval. How did Duterte respond? The first indicator that Rappler was about to be targeted was during Duterte\u2019s State of the Union speech in July 2017, when, to Ressa\u2019s surprise, he declared that Rappler was \u201cfully owned\u201d by the Americans and therefore in violation of the constitution. Duterte later publicly declared: \u201cNot only is Rappler\u2019s news fake, it being Filipino is also fake.\u201d Ressa fully denies the claim, but in August 2017, the Philippine securities and exchange commission (SEC) began what Ressa described as a \u201csix month fishing expedition\u201d demanding hundreds of documents. By January 2017, the SEC had decided to revoke Rappler\u2019s license but the case went to the court of appeals, where it was remanded back to the SEC for having no basis. The government then began to investigate Rappler for tax evasion, alleging that the company failed to pay the $3m in tax due on the company\u2019s 2015 bond sales to two foreign parties. While usually such investigations take a minimum of a year, the department decided to press charges in just five months. A warrant for Ressa\u2019s arrest was issued in November 2018, and she turned herself into the authorities days later, where she posted bail and was released. The case is still ongoing. Ressa told the Guardian the charges were \u201cwithout basis and clearly politically motivated\u201d. Ressa is not the only Rappler journalist targeted. Last year, Rappler\u2019s political reporter was also banned from the presidential palace where press briefings take place. What are the new charges she is facing? In February, Ressa and Rappler were hit with yet another lawsuit, this time for alleged cyber-libel relating to a story published in 2012 about Philippine businessman Wildredo Keng and his connections to a top court judge. Keng had originally filed a lawsuit in 2017 claiming defamation which was it was dropped, but it was refiled again last year. However, as Rappler lawyers have pointed out, the cyber-libel law being used against Rappler and Ressa was enacted four months after the story was published. Nonetheless, 13 February, four plainclothes officers arrived at the Rappler headquarters in Manila and arrested Ressa, taking her to the National Bureau of Investigation. She was held overnight, and was released on 14 February morning after posting bail of 100,000 Philipines peso (\u00a31,400). What happens next? Ressa has vowed to keep fighting and to continue Rappler\u2019s journalism. On 23 July her libel trial opened in Manila with a brief hearing that ended after testimony from one minor witness. The case is set to resume on 30 July.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been put on notice by rebel Conservatives that he will not survive long as prime minister unless he drops his no-deal Brexit agenda, as he stands on the brink of entering Downing Street. Johnson is expected to be announced as the choice of the Conservative party to be the next prime minister on Tuesday morning after running a campaign against Jeremy Hunt that promised to take the UK out of the EU by the end of October \u201cdo or die\u201d. On the eve of his probable coronation by the Tory membership, several senior Conservatives sent warning shots that his hardline Brexit plans put him on a collision course with parliament. Rory Stewart, a former leadership rival, joined Philip Hammond and David Gauke in telling Johnson he would quit the cabinet before the new prime minister takes office rather than serve under him. In a further ominous move for Johnson, Sir Alan Duncan, a Foreign Office minister, resigned dramatically to launch an attempt to test whether the new prime minister could command a majority among MPs. Duncan\u2019s proposal for an emergency House of Commons debate on support for Johnson was turned down by the Speaker, but it was a sign that some Conservatives are already organising to make life difficult for the new incumbent of No 10. Duncan said he had \u201cvery grave concerns that Johnson flies by the seat of his pants\u201d and branded his former boss \u201chaphazard and ramshackle\u201d, but publicly insisted he was trying to be helpful to the new prime minister by ending speculation about whether MPs supported the new incumbent in No 10. The motion stated: \u201cThat this House has considered the merits of the newly chosen leader of the Conservative party, and supports his wish to form a government.\u201d However, it opened up the possibility that Johnson might fail to demonstrate he had the support of parliament, leaving Theresa May potentially unable to recommend him as her successor to the Queen on Wednesday. Conservative backbenchers fighting no deal are not planning to bring down Johnson immediately, with one serious critic of the frontrunner saying the party \u201cwould take a very, very dim view of getting rid of him before he has done anything yet\u201d. But several Conservative MPs said they would regard Johnson\u2019s first speech to the nation and cabinet appointments as a test of whether he was capable of reaching out across parliament to find a majority for a plan to leave the EU that can find approval from Eurosceptics and more moderate Brexit supporters. If he does not, then organisation will start again in earnest to prevent him pursuing a no-deal Brexit, with some senior Tories already sending out feelers about the possibility of a \u201cnational unity\u201d government with opposition MPs. A senior source on Johnson\u2019s transition team said that, as the new Tory leader, he would immediately emphasise \u201cunity\u201d and the need to bring the party and the country back together. The rebels are prepared to give Johnson the summer to see if he can make headway towards coming to a fresh agreement with the EU that avoids no deal but will make their moves against him after that if he takes the government full tilt towards a no-deal Brexit. One former minister said a \u201csizeable chunk\u201d of the 42 Tories who voted against a no-deal Brexit last week were prepared to put their own careers on the line to stop Johnson pursuing that path \u2013 either through a legislative block on leaving the EU without a deal or a confidence vote if that proves impossible. He said what Johnson said on the steps of Downing Street on Wednesday would be crucial, as his critics within the party will be infuriated and galvanised to action if he \u201ctries to act like he has a majority of 150\u201d or goes down the path of \u201cTrumpian rhetoric\u201d that forgets the country is split on Brexit. Another rebel Tory, Philip Lee, a former health minister pushing for a second referendum, said: \u201cIt is going to be really challenging for him to govern. I don\u2019t see how he has got a majority to govern.

If Johnson were to lose a confidence motion, some Conservative MPs are openly talking about the possibility of doing a deal with some Labour MPs to form a national unity government led by a respected figure such as the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, in order to secure a second referendum pitting remain against a deal.

      "body": "<p>At a pro-government rally on Saturday, one speaker made a disconcerting proposal for disciplining Hong Kong\u2019s young protesters. \u201cDo we have canes at home? Bring out your canes,\u201d said Arthur Shek, a co-founder of the Economic Times newspaper. \u201cFind a long one to beat your son. If you don\u2019t have a cane, what do you do? We can still go to a hardware shop to buy a 20mm PVC pipe.\u201d</p> \n<p>The next day, dozens of men in white T-shirts and masks descended on a railway station in Yuen Long where they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/22/where-were-the-police-hong-kong-outcry-after-masked-thugs-launch-attack\">beat commuters with long bamboo rods and pipes</a>.</p> \n<p>Footage showed several men punching and kneeing demonstrators <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/21/hong-kong-police-fire-rubber-bullets-as-protests-turn-violent\">returning from an anti-government march</a>. Photos showed commuters with bloodied faces and blood smeared on the station floor. At least 45 people were taken to hospital.</p> \n<p>Shek has since apologised for his comment made in jest, but it is one of several details linking the attack to pro-government camps, at least in intention.</p> \n<p>Protesters and opposition politicians have not only accused the government of looking the other way when the attacks took place \u2013 police arrived well after the assailants had left \u2013 but of facilitating them.</p> \n<p>Galileo Cheng, 34, a Catholic church worker, was among those injured when he attempted to help a female journalist who was being beaten. He was taken to hospital and suffered bruises on his back and arms. An injury to his face may require plastic surgery.</p> \n<p>Cheng said it was common knowledge that organised crime societies, or triads, were active in areas such as Yuen Long in the outskirts of Hong Kong.</p> \n<p>\u201cNormally, they won\u2019t attack local citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cUtilising triads to assault citizens, threatening them to withdraw from the social movement, is a common tactic used by the Communist party, <em>qunzhong dou qunzhong</em>\u201d \u2013 \u2018the masses fighting the masses\u2019. It seems the government has no way to stop the protests.\u201d</p> \n<p>A video showed the pro-Beijing legislator Junius Ho meeting the men in white in Yuen Long, shaking their hands, and giving them a thumbs-up. When one praised Ho, he responded: \u201cYou are all my heroes.\u201d</p> \n<p>In response to accusations that he had hired the men to go after protesters, Ho said in a press briefing on Monday that he had nothing to do with the attack and only warned residents to be safe and avoid violent protesters.</p> \n<p>When a journalist pointed out that the men had attacked protesters first, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. I can\u2019t criticise it, but \u2026 hitting people is wrong. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, and the police chief have vehemently denied any connection with the attack, calling such accusations \u201cinsulting\u201d.</p> \n<p>Sunday\u2019s violence in some ways mirrors similar attacks in 2014 during Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy Umbrella movement.

      "bodyText": "At a pro-government rally on Saturday, one speaker made a disconcerting proposal for disciplining Hong Kong\u2019s young protesters. \u201cDo we have canes at home? Bring out your canes,\u201d said Arthur Shek, a co-founder of the Economic Times newspaper. \u201cFind a long one to beat your son. If you don\u2019t have a cane, what do you do? We can still go to a hardware shop to buy a 20mm PVC pipe.\u201d The next day, dozens of men in white T-shirts and masks descended on a railway station in Yuen Long where they beat commuters with long bamboo rods and pipes. Footage showed several men punching and kneeing demonstrators returning from an anti-government march. Photos showed commuters with bloodied faces and blood smeared on the station floor. At least 45 people were taken to hospital. Shek has since apologised for his comment made in jest, but it is one of several details linking the attack to pro-government camps, at least in intention. Protesters and opposition politicians have not only accused the government of looking the other way when the attacks took place \u2013 police arrived well after the assailants had left \u2013 but of facilitating them. Galileo Cheng, 34, a Catholic church worker, was among those injured when he attempted to help a female journalist who was being beaten. He was taken to hospital and suffered bruises on his back and arms. An injury to his face may require plastic surgery. Cheng said it was common knowledge that organised crime societies, or triads, were active in areas such as Yuen Long in the outskirts of Hong Kong. \u201cNormally, they won\u2019t attack local citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cUtilising triads to assault citizens, threatening them to withdraw from the social movement, is a common tactic used by the Communist party, qunzhong dou qunzhong\u201d \u2013 \u2018the masses fighting the masses\u2019. It seems the government has no way to stop the protests.\u201d A video showed the pro-Beijing legislator Junius Ho meeting the men in white in Yuen Long, shaking their hands, and giving them a thumbs-up. When one praised Ho, he responded: \u201cYou are all my heroes.\u201d In response to accusations that he had hired the men to go after protesters, Ho said in a press briefing on Monday that he had nothing to do with the attack and only warned residents to be safe and avoid violent protesters. When a journalist pointed out that the men had attacked protesters first, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. I can\u2019t criticise it, but \u2026 hitting people is wrong. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, and the police chief have vehemently denied any connection with the attack, calling such accusations \u201cinsulting\u201d. Sunday\u2019s violence in some ways mirrors similar attacks in 2014 during Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy Umbrella movement. After demonstrators occupied the city centre for weeks, men with mainland Chinese accents began assaulting protesters. Now that the latest protests are in their seventh week, officials may again be desperate to put them down. \u201cThis is not the first time thugs have been sent in to beat up protesters,\u201d said Lynette Ong, a political scientist at the University of Toronto who has been studying organised crime in China. \u201cThis is more organised, suggesting they are becoming more daring, and the Hong Kong government or pro-Beijing officials are becoming more desperate to put the protests to rest.\u201d The method has precedent in mainland China, where local authorities are known to hire thugs to intimidate residents unwilling to give up their land, or to silence troublesome petitioners. \u201cThe underlying motive is quite similar \u2026 Sending in thugs is an option to evade responsibility,\u201d said Ong. \u201cIf you send thugs, it\u2019s almost impossible to trace, and you can\u2019t hold anyone accountable.\u201d Unlike the attacks in 2014, the assailants appeared to be from Hong Kong, cursing fluently in Cantonese, according to Cheng. The triads, who enjoy privileges related to their clans in their respective areas, may not necessarily have been paid or ordered to attack commuters and protesters. \u201cThese thugs \u2026 terrorise the protesters so fewer people will come out to protest,\u201d said the pro-democracy legislator Ray Chan. \u201cSome opportunists among them may even want to get political credit for their actions, so they will be in a better position to demand more influence in government policies that favour them,\u201d he said. The attacks may not have served their intended purpose. Demonstrators have been called on fellow protesters to \u201cprepare to fight\u201d and some are planning to apply for a permit to hold the next rally in Yuen Long.",

I feel younger and fitter and I look back at colleagues who I lost to heart attacks and think: that could have been me. Leaving teaching literally saved my life.",

The OnePlus 7 Pro is the firm\u2019s biggest yet with a monster 6.67in QHD+ AMOLED screen, which is arguably the best on any phone. It runs at a refresh rate of 90Hz \u2013 compared with 60Hz for the competition \u2013 which makes everything from scrolling through lists to smashing through games super slick.</p> \n<p>The screen is edge-to-edge in every direction too, lacking any intrusions by the notches plaguing rivals as the selfie camera has been moved to a motorised module that pops out of the top of the phone when needed.</p> \n<p>Speed is the name of the game. The OnePlus 7 Pro is the fastest-feeling smartphone by miles. Part of that is the firm\u2019s excellent version of Android 9 Pie called OxygenOS, which is on-par with Google\u2019s on the Pixels, and the other is the top-of-the-line hardware.</p> \n<p>It has Qualcomm\u2019s latest Snapdragon 855 processor, at least 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. But that storage is also much faster than rivals using the new UFS3.0 standard, and the difference in day-to-day usage is palpable.</p> \n<p>Even the optical in-display fingerprint scanner is the best in the business, beating that on the Huawei P30 Pro and matching traditional capacitive sensors for speed.</p> \n<p>The triple camera system on the back matches rivals combining a 48MP main, a 16MP ultra-wide angle and an 8MP telephoto camera. It can\u2019t beat the P30 Pro, but it matches or beats the rest on detail and utility.</p> \n<p>Battery life is good, but not Huawei-beating. It charges really fast using OnePlus\u2019s WarpCharge system, but there\u2019s no wireless charging, which is a shame. It is water resistant to some extent, but doesn\u2019t have an IP rating. It has dual-sim support in most markets too.</p> \n<p>The OnePlus 7 Pro also comes in a 5G version too, which is single-sim only but is the same size, weight and performance as the 4G-only version and is available <a href=\"https://shop.ee.co.uk/mobile-phones/pay-monthly/oneplus-7-pro-5g-256gb-nebula-blue/details\">exclusively from EE in the UK</a> starting at \u00a3170 with a 24-month \u00a359/month plan.</p> \n<p><strong>Why should you buy it?</strong></p> \n<p>The unrivalled screen, sheer speed and in-display fingerprint scanner, combined with the slick OxygenOS, make even mundane tasks a joy. The massive OnePlus 7 Pro is most definitely a stretch to use, but it\u2019s a stretch worth making</p> \n<p><strong>Buy if:</strong> you want the best and fastest superphone experience</p> \n<p><strong>Don\u2019t buy if:</strong> you don\u2019t want to stretch to such a big phone</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>Full review: </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/31/oneplus-7-pro-review-an-absolute-beast-in-every-way\">OnePlus 7 Pro review: an absolute beast in every way</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>Best iOS:</strong> Apple iPhone XS</h2> \n<p><strong>RRP:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-xs\">\u00a3999</a> / <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/us/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-xs\">$999</a></p> \n<p>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7437f5794951091d34c0edd1f392a2c745095934\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7437f5794951091d34c0edd1f392a2c745095934/139_91_3713_2228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"smartphone buyer's guide - iphone xs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apple\u2019s smallest new iPhone is also the best combination of power, size, screen and camera.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"price comparison of iphone xs\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://m.skimresources.com/widget/skimlinks/pc/iframe/iframe.html?shopId=973&amp;isoCurrencyCode=GBP&amp;isoLanguageCode=en&amp;geolocation=true&amp;nameKeywords=iphone%20xs%20NOT%20month&amp;resultLimit=3&amp;pub=114047X1592509&amp;css=rslxksjjea&amp;priceMin=300\" name=\"monetizer1\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border:none;height:154px\"> </iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  These regularly updated deals have been sourced through a third-party price comparison service.

The iPhone XS combines a stunning, good-size 5.8in screen, svelte body and top-notch performance into the most appealing package from Apple to date.</p> \n<p>Apple\u2019s Face ID is the best face recognition system in the business, the dual-camera system on the back is excellent, as is the performance of the A12 Bionic processor and the class-leading gesture navigation system of iOS, which has replaced the home button of iPhones of yore.</p> \n<p>You\u2019re also in line for about five years of software updates, which is likely at least two more than any other brand of phone. The iPhone XS is a metal and glass sandwich, and will smash just like the competition when dropped, but the stainless steel sides and glass back exude a luxury feel not matched by other phones. Sadly most will put it in a case.</p> \n<p>The biggest downsides are the price, which at \u00a31,000 is likely significantly more than the competition, and battery life, which only manages about a day of medium usage. The iPhone XS has wireless charging and supports fast charging via a USB-C to Lightning cable, but only ships with a slow charger in the box. Its cellular modem performance is also not as good as competitors, struggling more to keep a working 4G data connection in congested areas, particularly compared with the Mate 20 Pro.</p> \n<p><strong>Why should you buy it?</strong></p> \n<p>If you\u2019re locked in to iOS, or want the longest software update coverage, then the iPhone XS is the best Apple smartphone you can buy (and not very far behind the Mate 20 Pro overall), thanks to its combination of size, camera, capability and luxurious feel.</p> \n<p><strong>Buy if: </strong>you want the best iPhone</p> \n<p><strong>Don\u2019t buy if: </strong>you don\u2019t want to spend \u00a3999 or want to use Android</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>Full review:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/04/apple-iphone-xs-review-battery-life-camera-design-performance\">Apple iPhone XS review: two steps forward, one step back</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>Best smaller Android:</strong> Samsung Galaxy S10</h2> \n<p><strong>RRP:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-s10/buy/\">\u00a3799</a> / <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-s10/buy/\">$899</a></p> \n<p>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ead18d1b23b6cdaa33f6731c0c417a8f0576552\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ead18d1b23b6cdaa33f6731c0c417a8f0576552/539_452_3726_2236/1000.jpg\" alt=\"smartphone buyer's guide - samsung galaxy s10\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A big, beautiful screen in a smaller phone, the Galaxy S10 is the sweet spot in Samsung\u2019s flagship smartphone line.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"price comparison of samsung galaxy s10\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://m.skimresources.com/widget/skimlinks/pc/iframe/iframe.html?shopId=973&amp;isoCurrencyCode=GBP&amp;isoLanguageCode=en&amp;geolocation=true&amp;nameKeywords=samsung%20galaxy%20s10%20NOT%20month&amp;resultLimit=3&amp;pub=114047X1592509&amp;css=rslxksjjea&amp;priceMin=300\" name=\"monetizer1\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border:none;height:154px\"> </iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  These regularly updated deals have been sourced through a third-party price comparison service.

It\u2019s still a glass and metal sandwich, which means you might need a case to protect against falls.</p> \n<p>The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor mounted under the display works well, although it\u2019s no longer the fastest on the market.</p> \n<p>Samsung\u2019s new One UI software, based on Android 9 Pie, is a big leap in making large phone easier to use, putting things you have to touch toward the bottom of the screen and information towards the top. Samsung also gives you the choice of traditional navigation keys or swipe gestures.</p> \n<p>You should see around three-years of software support from Samsung, although the company is often slow to deliver big Android version updates.</p> \n<p>The rear triple camera is one of the best allowing you to zoom from 0.5 through 2x, and on to a 10x hybrid zoom. It won\u2019t beat the Huawei P30 Pro, but it keeps up with rest. The selfie camera pokes straight though the screen and is one of the best on the market.</p> \n<p>Performance is good, but battery life is the S10\u2019s one weakness. It will last a day of usage but not much more. There\u2019s both cable and fast wireless charging to top up during the day and the wireless power share feature turns the phone into an ad-hoc wireless charger for other devices.</p> \n<p><strong>Why should you buy it?</strong></p> \n<p>The big, beautiful screen in a comparatively small phone is the main selling point, but the good camera, performance and looks help too</p> \n<p><strong>Buy if:</strong> you want the best balance of big screen and small phone</p> \n<p><strong>Don\u2019t buy if:</strong> you want brilliant battery life</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>Full review: </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/06/samsung-galaxy-s10-review-the-sweet-spot\">Samsung Galaxy S10 review: the sweet spot</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>Best camera: </strong>Huawei P30 Pro</h2> \n<p><strong>RRP:</strong> \u00a3899</p> \n<p>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ce65a044590439fdc2f80e97a8e24f291772e95\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ce65a044590439fdc2f80e97a8e24f291772e95/367_420_4327_2597/1000.jpg\" alt=\"smartphone buyer's guide - huawei P30 pro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Huawei P30 Pro has a large, beautiful screen, long battery life and a game-changing camera with exceptional low-light performance, 5x optical zoom and up to 50x digital zoom.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"price comparison of Huawei P30 Pro\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://m.skimresources.com/widget/skimlinks/pc/iframe/iframe.html?shopId=973&amp;isoCurrencyCode=GBP&amp;isoLanguageCode=en&amp;geolocation=true&amp;nameKeywords=huawei%20p30%20pro%20NOT%20month&amp;resultLimit=3&amp;pub=114047X1592509&amp;css=rslxksjjea&amp;priceMin=300\" name=\"monetizer1\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border:none;height:154px\"> </iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  These regularly updated deals have been sourced through a third-party price comparison service.

No other phone provides as comprehensive a combination as Huawei\u2019s new Leica quad camera.</p> \n<p>The 20MP 0.6x ultra-wide angle camera is fun, the main 1x 40MP camera is terrific and it\u2019s joined by a new periscopic 5x optical zoom camera that gets you closer than any other smartphone. If five times magnification wasn\u2019t enough, there\u2019s an excellent 10x hybrid zoom on top and then a digital zoom all the way up to 50x. A 3D depth-sensing time-of-flight sensor rounds out the modules on the back.</p> \n<p>Remarkable levels of zoom aside, the P30 Pro also has game-changing low-light performance that instantly turns night into day without having to wait for a couple of seconds of capture.</p> \n<p>The rest of the phone is excellent too with stunning colour options. The large 6.47in FHD+ OLED is one of the best, with a small notch in the top containing the selfie camera and slim bezels all-round. The curved edges keep the width of the phone to a narrow 73.4mm wide, meaning it\u2019s still relatively manageable and easier to wield day-to-day particularly compared to the OnePlus 7 Pro or iPhone XS Max.</p> \n<p>The in-screen optical fingerprint sensor is second only to the OnePlus 7 Pro\u2019s. Huawei\u2019s top-notch Kirin 980 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, provides great performance and a battery that\u2019ll last around two days. Plus charges the fastest and has wireless charging and power sharing.</p> \n<p>Huawei\u2019s modified Android 9 Pie, EMUI 9.1, is highly customisable and has plenty of features but may not be to everyone\u2019s tastes. Huawei is currently facing sanctions from the US as part of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/20/trump-us-ban-huawei-google-trade-war\">US-China trade war</a>, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/19/google-huawei-trump-blacklist-report\">makes its future uncertain</a>.

It also lasts a good 34 hours on a charge, and its Oxygen OS Android software is fast and slick. OnePlus guarantees two years of software updates and an additional year of bi-monthly security updates from the release date of the phone too.</p> \n<p>It even has the fastest and best in-display fingerprint scanner currently available, which is as good as the best dedicated capacitive sensors, good haptics and dual-sim support for having two mobile phone network connections at the same time.</p> \n<p>The downsides are a camera that lacks ultra-wide or zoom capabilities, no formal water resistance rating and no wireless charging.

The bigger the number the larger the phone, but different phones use different ratios of height to width.</p>\n    <p>How easy it is to handle comes down to the width of the phone and its weight. The narrower and lighter it is, the easier it is to hold in one hand and the less likely you are to drop it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Processor</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>What is commonly called the processor in a phone is actually a system-on-a-chip combining the processor, graphics and other essential systems into one.</p>\n    <p>Generally the newer the processor the more powerful and battery efficient it will be. Samsung, Huawei and Apple make their own, while Qualcomm is the largest supplier to other brands at the high end, with its Snapdragon 8-series range at the top.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>RAM</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The RAM (memory) is where your apps and processes are stored when in use, so the you more your phone has the better, up to a point.</p>\n    <p>Android requires more RAM than iOS, so it's difficult to directly compare them. But with Android at least 4GB of RAM is currently recommended.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Storage</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Different from memory, storage is where everything is stored on the phone, including apps and media. While a few phones can have their storage expanded with microSD cards, most cannot.</p>\n    <p>That means you should aim for 64GB of storage at a minimum, but more if you want to store lots of photos. Cloud services such as Spotify or Google's Photos can help offload your music, photos or videos to the internet.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Software updates</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Keeping your phone secure from hackers is essential, which makes software updates critical to patch bugs and security holes, as well as adding new features and improving things such as battery life and the camera.</p>\n    <p>Not all phones receive regular updates. Apple's support of older phones is the best in the business of around 5 years, followed by Samsung and Google's three years, both from when the phone was released - not when you buy it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Battery life</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Battery life varies drastically between devices, and \"all-day battery\" often doesn't mean 24 hours between charges. Some may not last long enough, particularly if you're out in the evening.</p>\n    <p>Battery life gets worse as the battery ages too, so a two-day battery will likely make sure the phone lasts at least a day two years later.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Camera</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Cameras are the current battleground between the big players, but the margins between them are slimming.</p>\n    <p>Most use computational photography that combines hardware with advanced software algorithms, typically allowing multiple cameras to combine to make one image.</p>\n    <p>As such the camera software makes as much difference as the hardware, and is one of the few areas that actually improves over time with updates.</p>\n    <p>Multi-camera systems often offer more, such as useful zooms, portrait modes and better low-light performance, but they are not all created equally. There are also 3D cameras, which can detect facial expressions and other fun tricks.</p>\n    <p>The number of megapixels (MP) also makes a difference. Having more MP doesn't necessarily equal a better image, but modern smartphone cameras combine multiple pixels to improve image quality producing 12MP shots from 48MP sensors, for example.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Other things to consider</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Wireless charging:</b>&nbsp;convenient, but slower than via cable and normally a charging pad doesn't come in the box</p>\n    <p><b>Durability:</b>&nbsp;generally glass on the front and back of the phone makes it more fragile</p>\n    <p><b>Resale value:</b>&nbsp;iPhones hold their value better than most others</p>\n    <p><b>OLED versus LCD:</b> OLED screens emit their own light so have much deeper blacks and more vibrant colours, while LCD screens are cheaper</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Runners up</h2> \n<p>These are good phones still worth buying if none of the top four smartphones fit the bill.</p> \n<p><strong>Apple iPhone XR</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RRP:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-xr\">\u00a3749</a> / <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/us/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-xr\">$749</a></p> \n<p>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2ed1f099e30b889cf01d8d38bd0973c4fff43d4c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ed1f099e30b889cf01d8d38bd0973c4fff43d4c/825_0_2474_2474/1000.jpg\" alt=\"smartphone buyer's guide - iphone xr\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Apple\u2019s slightly cheaper iPhone XR offers most of the features of the iPhone XS.

      "bodyText": "Need a new smartphone but don\u2019t know which one is the very best? Here\u2019s a guide comparing the current top-end smartphones from Apple, Samsung, Huawei, OnePlus and others to help you pick the best handset for you. There has never been a better time to buy a new flagship smartphone with many quality handsets available at a wider range of prices than ever before. Whether your priority is two-day battery life, fantastic camera performance or a spectacular screen, there\u2019s plenty to choose from. This Guardian buyer\u2019s guide to top-end smartphones was last updated on 23 July 2019, and represents the best available models at the time. As new models are released and tested, this guide will be updated to help you choose the right flagship phone for you. Best overall: OnePlus 7 Pro RRP: \u00a3649 / $669 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The latest superphone undercuts the competition on price while offering a better experience in almost every meaningful way. The OnePlus 7 Pro is the firm\u2019s biggest yet with a monster 6.67in QHD+ AMOLED screen, which is arguably the best on any phone. It runs at a refresh rate of 90Hz \u2013 compared with 60Hz for the competition \u2013 which makes everything from scrolling through lists to smashing through games super slick. The screen is edge-to-edge in every direction too, lacking any intrusions by the notches plaguing rivals as the selfie camera has been moved to a motorised module that pops out of the top of the phone when needed. Speed is the name of the game. The OnePlus 7 Pro is the fastest-feeling smartphone by miles. Part of that is the firm\u2019s excellent version of Android 9 Pie called OxygenOS, which is on-par with Google\u2019s on the Pixels, and the other is the top-of-the-line hardware. It has Qualcomm\u2019s latest Snapdragon 855 processor, at least 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. But that storage is also much faster than rivals using the new UFS3.0 standard, and the difference in day-to-day usage is palpable. Even the optical in-display fingerprint scanner is the best in the business, beating that on the Huawei P30 Pro and matching traditional capacitive sensors for speed. The triple camera system on the back matches rivals combining a 48MP main, a 16MP ultra-wide angle and an 8MP telephoto camera. It can\u2019t beat the P30 Pro, but it matches or beats the rest on detail and utility. Battery life is good, but not Huawei-beating. It charges really fast using OnePlus\u2019s WarpCharge system, but there\u2019s no wireless charging, which is a shame. It is water resistant to some extent, but doesn\u2019t have an IP rating. It has dual-sim support in most markets too. The OnePlus 7 Pro also comes in a 5G version too, which is single-sim only but is the same size, weight and performance as the 4G-only version and is available exclusively from EE in the UK starting at \u00a3170 with a 24-month \u00a359/month plan. Why should you buy it? The unrivalled screen, sheer speed and in-display fingerprint scanner, combined with the slick OxygenOS, make even mundane tasks a joy. The massive OnePlus 7 Pro is most definitely a stretch to use, but it\u2019s a stretch worth making Buy if: you want the best and fastest superphone experience Don\u2019t buy if: you don\u2019t want to stretch to such a big phone Full review: OnePlus 7 Pro review: an absolute beast in every way Best iOS: Apple iPhone XS RRP: \u00a3999 / $999 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The best iPhone is not the biggest or most expensive. The iPhone XS combines a stunning, good-size 5.8in screen, svelte body and top-notch performance into the most appealing package from Apple to date. Apple\u2019s Face ID is the best face recognition system in the business, the dual-camera system on the back is excellent, as is the performance of the A12 Bionic processor and the class-leading gesture navigation system of iOS, which has replaced the home button of iPhones of yore. You\u2019re also in line for about five years of software updates, which is likely at least two more than any other brand of phone. The iPhone XS is a metal and glass sandwich, and will smash just like the competition when dropped, but the stainless steel sides and glass back exude a luxury feel not matched by other phones. Sadly most will put it in a case. The biggest downsides are the price, which at \u00a31,000 is likely significantly more than the competition, and battery life, which only manages about a day of medium usage. The iPhone XS has wireless charging and supports fast charging via a USB-C to Lightning cable, but only ships with a slow charger in the box. Its cellular modem performance is also not as good as competitors, struggling more to keep a working 4G data connection in congested areas, particularly compared with the Mate 20 Pro. Why should you buy it? If you\u2019re locked in to iOS, or want the longest software update coverage, then the iPhone XS is the best Apple smartphone you can buy (and not very far behind the Mate 20 Pro overall), thanks to its combination of size, camera, capability and luxurious feel. Buy if: you want the best iPhone Don\u2019t buy if: you don\u2019t want to spend \u00a3999 or want to use Android Full review: Apple iPhone XS review: two steps forward, one step back Best smaller Android: Samsung Galaxy S10 RRP: \u00a3799 / $899 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 If you want the sweet-spot between a big, stunning screen and smaller phone size that\u2019s easier to handle and fit in a pocket, that\u2019s the Galaxy S10. The 6.1in QHD+ AMOLED screen with a small hole-punch notch in the top right is one of the very best on the market and is big enough to make the most of apps and movies look great. Small bezels all round make the phone pretty compact compared to rivals, and it\u2019s light too. It\u2019s still a glass and metal sandwich, which means you might need a case to protect against falls. The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor mounted under the display works well, although it\u2019s no longer the fastest on the market. Samsung\u2019s new One UI software, based on Android 9 Pie, is a big leap in making large phone easier to use, putting things you have to touch toward the bottom of the screen and information towards the top. Samsung also gives you the choice of traditional navigation keys or swipe gestures. You should see around three-years of software support from Samsung, although the company is often slow to deliver big Android version updates. The rear triple camera is one of the best allowing you to zoom from 0.5 through 2x, and on to a 10x hybrid zoom. It won\u2019t beat the Huawei P30 Pro, but it keeps up with rest. The selfie camera pokes straight though the screen and is one of the best on the market. Performance is good, but battery life is the S10\u2019s one weakness. It will last a day of usage but not much more. There\u2019s both cable and fast wireless charging to top up during the day and the wireless power share feature turns the phone into an ad-hoc wireless charger for other devices. Why should you buy it? The big, beautiful screen in a comparatively small phone is the main selling point, but the good camera, performance and looks help too Buy if: you want the best balance of big screen and small phone Don\u2019t buy if: you want brilliant battery life Full review: Samsung Galaxy S10 review: the sweet spot Best camera: Huawei P30 Pro RRP: \u00a3899 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The best camera on a phone is the Huawei P30 Pro by some margin. No other phone provides as comprehensive a combination as Huawei\u2019s new Leica quad camera. The 20MP 0.6x ultra-wide angle camera is fun, the main 1x 40MP camera is terrific and it\u2019s joined by a new periscopic 5x optical zoom camera that gets you closer than any other smartphone. If five times magnification wasn\u2019t enough, there\u2019s an excellent 10x hybrid zoom on top and then a digital zoom all the way up to 50x. A 3D depth-sensing time-of-flight sensor rounds out the modules on the back. Remarkable levels of zoom aside, the P30 Pro also has game-changing low-light performance that instantly turns night into day without having to wait for a couple of seconds of capture. The rest of the phone is excellent too with stunning colour options. The large 6.47in FHD+ OLED is one of the best, with a small notch in the top containing the selfie camera and slim bezels all-round. The curved edges keep the width of the phone to a narrow 73.4mm wide, meaning it\u2019s still relatively manageable and easier to wield day-to-day particularly compared to the OnePlus 7 Pro or iPhone XS Max. The in-screen optical fingerprint sensor is second only to the OnePlus 7 Pro\u2019s. Huawei\u2019s top-notch Kirin 980 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, provides great performance and a battery that\u2019ll last around two days. Plus charges the fastest and has wireless charging and power sharing. Huawei\u2019s modified Android 9 Pie, EMUI 9.1, is highly customisable and has plenty of features but may not be to everyone\u2019s tastes. Huawei is currently facing sanctions from the US as part of the US-China trade war, which makes its future uncertain. The P30 Pro should continue to receive updates as normal, however. Why should you buy it? The camera is game-changing in meaningful, not gimmick-filled ways, while the rest of the phone is excellent Buy if: you want the best camera on a great phone Don\u2019t buy if: you want a smaller phone or are worried about US blockade of Huawei Full review: Huawei P30 Pro review: game-changing camera, stellar battery life Best value: OnePlus 7 RRP: \u00a3499 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 If you want big screen, top-spec phone, but don\u2019t want a monster of a phone or to spend \u00a3900, then the OnePlus 7 is the one to buy. It has a good-looking 6.41in full HD OLED screen, a widow\u2019s peak-like notch for the selfie camera, slim bezels all round and a premium-feeling metal and glass body matching the quality of others. It has 2019\u2019s top-of-the-line Snapdragon 855 processor, 6GB of RAM and 128GB of the faster UFS3.0 storage, just like the OnePlus 7 Pro. It also lasts a good 34 hours on a charge, and its Oxygen OS Android software is fast and slick. OnePlus guarantees two years of software updates and an additional year of bi-monthly security updates from the release date of the phone too. It even has the fastest and best in-display fingerprint scanner currently available, which is as good as the best dedicated capacitive sensors, good haptics and dual-sim support for having two mobile phone network connections at the same time. The downsides are a camera that lacks ultra-wide or zoom capabilities, no formal water resistance rating and no wireless charging. You can have it in any colour you like in the UK, as long as that colour is mirror grey. Fetching red and blue versions are available in India and China. It\u2019s also not available in the US, where the previous model the OnePlus 6T is still on sale instead. Why should you buy it? A great screen with slim bezels, excellent software and the best performance, in-display fingerprint scanner and a good camera mean you have to spend significantly more to get a better phone than this Buy if: you want a top-notch phone but don\u2019t want to spend more than \u00a3500 Don\u2019t buy if: you want a really good camera Full review: OnePlus 7 review: competition-beating performance for less Runners up These are good phones still worth buying if none of the top four smartphones fit the bill. Apple iPhone XR RRP: \u00a3749 / $749 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Apple\u2019s slightly cheaper iPhone XR offers most of the features of the iPhone XS. It has better battery life too, but has a worse camera, a slightly larger, but worse screen and is made of aluminium and glass, instead of stainless steel, losing its luxurious feel and the knowledge that it\u2019s the best Apple can make. The iPhone XR looks stunning in red, but it\u2019s not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, costing as much or more as true flagship phones from competitors. The iPhone XS still the one to buy if you want an iPhone, but if you want to save money, switch to Android. Full review: iPhone XR review: Apple\u2019s cheaper battery king Apple iPhone XS Max RRP: \u00a31,099 / $1,099 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 If you must have an iPhone and it must have a massive screen, then the iPhone XS Max is your only option. But it\u2019s even more expensive and bigger and heavier, making it pretty difficult to handle day-to-day, meaning the smaller iPhone XS is the better option. Full review: iPhone XS Max review: Apple\u2019s supersized smartphone Samsung Galaxy S10e RRP: \u00a3669 / $650 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 The smallest, cheapest variant of Samsung\u2019s current S10 line is still good, but falls slightly short of the high bar set by the regular Galaxy S10. The Galaxy S10e loses the optical zoom with only two cameras on the back, has a flat, slightly smaller screen and a lower capacity battery. It also ditches in the in-screen fingerprint scanner for one embedded in the power button \u2013 great for right-handed users but not so for the left handed. It doesn\u2019t feel any smaller in the hand, but can be had for less if you must have a top-end Samsung for the lowest possible cost or dislike curved screens. Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus RRP: \u00a3899 / $999 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The bigger version of the Galaxy S10 with a 6.4in QHD+ display has the best screen available on any device. The oval-shaped hole-punch notch is novel, containing two good selfie cameras. The triple rear camera is good, but not a patch on the Huawei P30 Pro. Performance is good, so is the software, but the battery life is slightly disappointing compared with the best. Full review: Samsung Galaxy S10+ review: a simply stunning screen Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Price: \u00a3899 / $899 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 9 offers something a bit different, with long battery life, a massive screen and the all-important S Pen stylus. If you\u2019re looking for a productivity powerhouse, the Note 9 is it. But it\u2019s also huge with a slightly dated design. Full review: Samsung Galaxy Note 9 review: the do-everything phone Huawei Mate 20 Pro RRP: \u00a3899.99 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The Mate 20 Pro has the big, attractive 6.39in QHD+ screen, svelte body, long battery life and great performance that made it the top phone of 2018. However, its excellent triple camera system with 3x optical zoom has been outdone by Huawei\u2019s newer P30 Pro, which has a Leica quad camera with 5x optical zoom. It is worth looking out for deals, particularly if you want the 3D face unlock option. Full review: Huawei Mate 20 Pro review: cutting-edge brilliance Honor View20 RRP: \u00a3500 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Huawei\u2019s Honor brand has made a name for itself cut-price but good phones. The View20 is the best phone it has ever made and is cracking value at just \u00a3500. It has a top-of-the-line Huawei Kirin 980 processor (as seen in the Mate 20 Pro), a good-looking 6.4in FHD+ LCD screen, plenty of storage, 6 or 8GB of RAM, a super-quick fingerprint scanner on the back and it even still has a headphone socket. Standout features are a hole-punch notch in the screen, through which an excellent 25MP selfie camera pokes, and a really great 48MP camera on the back. Fast charging, long battery life, great in-hand feel and a wild light-reflecting V-shaped pattern in the glass back round out the highlights. Honor\u2019s Magic UI 2, based on Android 9 Pie, is not quite as good as OnePlus\u2019s OxygenOS, but at least you get two to three years of updates. Out of the two \u00a3500 top-end phones, buy the Honor View20 if you want a better camera; buy the OnePlus 6T if you want a better user experience and software. Full review: Honor View20 review: top phone at half the cost of an iPhone XS Google Pixel 3 RRP: \u00a3739 / $799 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The Pixel 3 is all about Google\u2019s camera and software. The 5.5in OLED screen is small by 2019\u2019s standards and has large bezels at the top and bottom, which make the phone bigger than it needs to be and give it a dated look. But Google\u2019s fantastic single rear camera, excellent software and fast updates are worth buying into. Performance is good but battery life is a bit weak. Buy if you want a smaller phone and the Samsung Galaxy S10 isn\u2019t for you. Full review: Google Pixel 3 review: raising the bar for the Android experience Google Pixel 3 XL RRP: \u00a3869 / $899 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The larger Google Pixel 3 XL has everything that makes the Pixel 3 a really great phone, but is bigger with a huge notch at the top of the screen. It\u2019s more difficult to handle than its smaller sibling and is more expensive, but has slightly better battery life. If you like the Pixel 3 but want a bigger screen, this is the phone for you, but on the whole the smaller version is a better device for most people. The Mate 20 Pro is a better big-screen phone all round. Full review: Google Pixel 3 XL review: big is still beautiful Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 RRP: \u00a3499 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Xiaomi\u2019s first slider phone offers more than most for the money, with top-flight specs for 2018 competing directly with the OnePlus 6T and Honor View20. It takes a different approach to the problem of where to put the selfie camera in an all-screen design, hiding it behind the screen on slide-out section. Good, but quite as great as its competition, this huge phone is held back by a heavy weight and a software experience that just isn\u2019t as good, despite solid gesture navigation options. Full review: Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 review: novel slider finally hits the UK Not recommended Nokia 8 Sirocco \u2013 Good software but average design and camera \u2013 \u00a3600 Razer Phone 2 - Gaming phone beast that falls down on camera performance \u2013 \u00a3500 Sony Xperia XZ3 \u2013 Good, but not great phone that misses the mark \u2013 \u00a3699 LG G7 \u2013 uninspiring design and software that\u2019s not as good as rivals \u2013 \u00a3375 Best true wireless earbuds: AirPods, Samsung, Jabra and Anker compared and ranked",

      "body": "<p>Drop Dead Gorgeous is one of my favourite films. It also made less than its $15m budget at the box office and only has a 45% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Jesus loves winners, as Gladys Leeman tells her daughter Becky, but I do understand why Drop Dead Gorgeous was not triumphant when it was released 20 years ago. Shot as a mockumentary, and indebted to John Waters and Christopher Guest, it follows a group of young, wannabe high school beauty queens as they compete in the Sarah Rose Cosmetics Mount Rose American Teen Princess pageant. Its humour is crude, its message is anarchic, its bite is vicious and its jokes don\u2019t so much stretch the boundaries of taste as tap-dance all over them in a mortuary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/09/american-pie-20th-anniversary-jason-biggs\">American Pie at 20: why the raucous comedy could never be made today</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I loved it when I first saw it, as a VHS rental, and I treasure the tatty DVD of it still, even though it has been a long time since I owned a DVD player. Kirsten Dunst is Amber Atkins, an earnest teenager who works at the morgue and lives in a trailer park with her mother \u2013 Ellen Barkin, joyfully soused \u2013 and good-time gal neighbour Loretta. (Loretta, ever wise, never sentimental \u2013 \u201cDo you think a nice cool mint would help if I shoved your head up your ass?\u201d \u2013 is one of Alison Janney\u2019s career-best performances, in a career that is not exactly short of choices.) Amber wants out of Mount Rose, Minnesota, so she can become a news anchor, just like her idol, Diane Sawyer. The pageant offers a scholarship as its prize. If she can tap-dance hard enough, it will be her ticket to somewhere else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d2258b1ad81953a3c52b65bed2baabefae0dd175\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2258b1ad81953a3c52b65bed2baabefae0dd175/0_0_2926_1985/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ellen Barkin and Allison Janney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ellen Barkin and Allison Janney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/NEW LINE CINEMA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the hands of writer Lona Williams and director Michael Patrick Jann, both first-timers (and Jann never directed another feature film) a story we should know inside out, a rags to riches fable in which the good girl should triumph, gleefully rips into itself. Amber should win the pageant, because she has worked the hardest and she\u2019s the best. She deserves to win. She\u2019s up against a coterie of clowns \u2013 a clumsy girl with a dog obsession and a delicate stomach, an American girl with a confused cultural identity, a deathly serious drama student, a heartbreaking, giggly Brittany Murphy as the younger sister of a closeted musicals obsessive and the requisite sex-crazy hot girl (Amy Adams, in her first screen role), shamelessly horny at all times, a walking anti-slut-shaming manifesto before we even knew what slut-shaming was.</p> <p>But mostly, Amber is competing with Becky Ann Leeman (Denise Richards), the daughter of Mount Rose\u2019s self-anointed king and queen (a wonderfully demented Kirstie Alley). Becky\u2019s rivals start to disappear in an array of increasingly bizarre \u201caccidents\u201d \u2013 hunting season is particularly tricky, and who knew that a combine harvester could prove so lethal \u2013 and the competition becomes more than just a high school pageant. \u201cWhy do I think Becky\u2019ll win? You\u2019re talking about the richest family in a small town. It\u2019s front page news when one of them takes a shit,\u201d says Loretta. The message of the film isn\u2019t that good will triumph. It\u2019s that the game is always rigged. Becky wins the scholarship, because every one of the judges works for her father. She\u2019s doesn\u2019t even need it. Mount Rose had its very own college admissions scandal.</p> <p>Drop Dead Gorgeous bombed at the box office, like a beauty queen riding a flammable giant Mexican swan, and the reviews from 1999 were damning. \u201cPutting the words \u2018drop dead\u2019 in the title really is tempting fate,\u201d wrote Janet Maslin in the New York Times. Roger Ebert opened his review with: \u201cSometimes I wonder how anyone could have thought a screenplay was funny enough to film.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"419f04eb2a32c936be74997c253199632901b894\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/419f04eb2a32c936be74997c253199632901b894/0_0_2504_1675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kirsten Dunst\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kirsten Dunst.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/NEW LINE CINEMA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Taste is, of course, always subjective. Some will never see the humour in an anorexic pageant winner describing her competition prep (\u201cI was practising my talent, finishing my costume, brushing up on current events and running 18 miles a day on about 400 calories. I was <em>ready</em>\u201d), or in an operatic attack of shellfish-based food poisoning. But choosing bad taste is not the same as doing a bad job. Twenty years later, we live in a time that regularly confuses satire with endorsement, and Drop Dead Gorgeous may have been an early casualty of that. It was criticised for its shallow mockery of Minnesotans, which was seen then as sneering, but an excellent BuzzFeed feature from 2014 tracked down Lona Williams, and found that Amber Atkins\u2019 story was not too far from her own. Even the stepladder dance routine was basically true.</p> <p>And oh, the dancing. There are two scenes in Drop Dead Gorgeous that have me crying with laughter, and both involve dancing: Becky\u2019s ballroom waltz with a crucified dummy of Jesus Christ himself, and the victory lap of poor reigning champion Mary Johanson, who needs the help of a nurse to wheel her around the stage. These are the essence of Drop Dead Gorgeous. It is unrestrained by decency. It is too dark to be cheerful, and too gleefully nihilistic to be glum. It is trashy, wonderful, endlessly quotable, and it was 20 years ahead of its time.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Drop Dead Gorgeous is one of my favourite films. It also made less than its $15m budget at the box office and only has a 45% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Jesus loves winners, as Gladys Leeman tells her daughter Becky, but I do understand why Drop Dead Gorgeous was not triumphant when it was released 20 years ago. Shot as a mockumentary, and indebted to John Waters and Christopher Guest, it follows a group of young, wannabe high school beauty queens as they compete in the Sarah Rose Cosmetics Mount Rose American Teen Princess pageant. Its humour is crude, its message is anarchic, its bite is vicious and its jokes don\u2019t so much stretch the boundaries of taste as tap-dance all over them in a mortuary. I loved it when I first saw it, as a VHS rental, and I treasure the tatty DVD of it still, even though it has been a long time since I owned a DVD player. Kirsten Dunst is Amber Atkins, an earnest teenager who works at the morgue and lives in a trailer park with her mother \u2013 Ellen Barkin, joyfully soused \u2013 and good-time gal neighbour Loretta. (Loretta, ever wise, never sentimental \u2013 \u201cDo you think a nice cool mint would help if I shoved your head up your ass?\u201d \u2013 is one of Alison Janney\u2019s career-best performances, in a career that is not exactly short of choices.) Amber wants out of Mount Rose, Minnesota, so she can become a news anchor, just like her idol, Diane Sawyer. The pageant offers a scholarship as its prize. If she can tap-dance hard enough, it will be her ticket to somewhere else. In the hands of writer Lona Williams and director Michael Patrick Jann, both first-timers (and Jann never directed another feature film) a story we should know inside out, a rags to riches fable in which the good girl should triumph, gleefully rips into itself. Amber should win the pageant, because she has worked the hardest and she\u2019s the best. She deserves to win. She\u2019s up against a coterie of clowns \u2013 a clumsy girl with a dog obsession and a delicate stomach, an American girl with a confused cultural identity, a deathly serious drama student, a heartbreaking, giggly Brittany Murphy as the younger sister of a closeted musicals obsessive and the requisite sex-crazy hot girl (Amy Adams, in her first screen role), shamelessly horny at all times, a walking anti-slut-shaming manifesto before we even knew what slut-shaming was. But mostly, Amber is competing with Becky Ann Leeman (Denise Richards), the daughter of Mount Rose\u2019s self-anointed king and queen (a wonderfully demented Kirstie Alley). Becky\u2019s rivals start to disappear in an array of increasingly bizarre \u201caccidents\u201d \u2013 hunting season is particularly tricky, and who knew that a combine harvester could prove so lethal \u2013 and the competition becomes more than just a high school pageant. \u201cWhy do I think Becky\u2019ll win? You\u2019re talking about the richest family in a small town. It\u2019s front page news when one of them takes a shit,\u201d says Loretta. The message of the film isn\u2019t that good will triumph. It\u2019s that the game is always rigged. Becky wins the scholarship, because every one of the judges works for her father. She\u2019s doesn\u2019t even need it. Mount Rose had its very own college admissions scandal. Drop Dead Gorgeous bombed at the box office, like a beauty queen riding a flammable giant Mexican swan, and the reviews from 1999 were damning. \u201cPutting the words \u2018drop dead\u2019 in the title really is tempting fate,\u201d wrote Janet Maslin in the New York Times. Roger Ebert opened his review with: \u201cSometimes I wonder how anyone could have thought a screenplay was funny enough to film.\u201d Taste is, of course, always subjective. Some will never see the humour in an anorexic pageant winner describing her competition prep (\u201cI was practising my talent, finishing my costume, brushing up on current events and running 18 miles a day on about 400 calories. I was ready\u201d), or in an operatic attack of shellfish-based food poisoning. But choosing bad taste is not the same as doing a bad job. Twenty years later, we live in a time that regularly confuses satire with endorsement, and Drop Dead Gorgeous may have been an early casualty of that. It was criticised for its shallow mockery of Minnesotans, which was seen then as sneering, but an excellent BuzzFeed feature from 2014 tracked down Lona Williams, and found that Amber Atkins\u2019 story was not too far from her own. Even the stepladder dance routine was basically true. And oh, the dancing. There are two scenes in Drop Dead Gorgeous that have me crying with laughter, and both involve dancing: Becky\u2019s ballroom waltz with a crucified dummy of Jesus Christ himself, and the victory lap of poor reigning champion Mary Johanson, who needs the help of a nurse to wheel her around the stage. These are the essence of Drop Dead Gorgeous. It is unrestrained by decency. It is too dark to be cheerful, and too gleefully nihilistic to be glum. It is trashy, wonderful, endlessly quotable, and it was 20 years ahead of its time.",

      "bodyText": "Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s weekly Brexit briefing. If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, sign up here. You can catch our monthly Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here. And for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow\u2019s politics live blog. Top stories Both the Lords and the Commons gave Boris Johnson, who has pledged to negotiate wholesale changes to the withdrawal agreement or leave the EU \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d by 31 October (and refused to rule out proroguing parliament to do so), a stark reminder of the challenge his premiership will face. After the upper house voted to ensure parliament must sit in the weeks leading up to the Brexit deadline, MPs \u2013 including Conservative rebels \u2013 followed suit, blocking any attempt to suspend parliament in order to force through a no-deal Brexit. The presumed prime minister\u2019s march into Downing Street on Wednesday has also been spoiled by a string of ministerial resignations, with Philip Hammond and David Gauke saying they would step down before then, and Alan Duncan quitting on Monday in an unsuccessful bid to test parliament\u2019s confidence in Johnson. Dominic Grieve warned that former ministers would join those prepared to vote down a Johnson administration heading for no deal and Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer is seeking a cross-party alliance to block any attempt to leave without an agreement. However, Labour is thought unlikely to table a no-confidence motion in the new prime minister immediately, mainly because it stands little chance of winning before Johnson has at least tried to renegotiate Theresa May\u2019s deal with Brussels. The new prime minister is therefore likely just to make a statement setting out his summer Brexit plans \u2013 at which point parliament breaks until September. \u201cWe\u2019ll give him a time-limited chance,\u201d one minister said. Assorted senior figures including three former prime ministers, meanwhile, poured scorn on Johnson\u2019s embrace of a no-deal Brexit and his insistence, in his Telegraph column, that Brexit was like landing on the moon \u2013 all that was needed to pull it off was a bit of \u201ccan-do spirit\u201d and a \u201csense of mission\u201d. As the Democratic Unionist party impressed on him the need to resolve the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop to keep its support, Johnson claimed \u2013 giving no evidence as to how \u2013 that technological solutions could be found to prevent a hard border in Ireland. To add to Johnson\u2019s concerns, the Office for Budget Responsibility warned that a no-deal Brexit would plunge Britain into a recession that would shrink the economy by 2% and push unemployment above 5%. What next Amid reports in the British press of all sorts of possible concessions being lined up by the EU27, including a \u201cno-deal Brexit extension\u201d beyond 31 October, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, insisted a new British prime minister would not change the fundamentals and there was no chance of the EU ditching or watering down the Irish backstop. The EU said it had no off-the-shelf Brexit plan for the new prime minister, was not working on one and there was now a \u201cworrying lack of time\u201d to find a compromise. It would put nothing new on the table but remained open to reworking the political declaration on future relations, sources said. Bronwen Maddox of the Institute for Government said Johnson faced four major and critical tasks in his first week: pick his cabinet, replace the chief negotiator, Olly Robbins, restart no-deal preparations and devise a plan for winning parliamentary support. Best of the rest Jo Swinson elected new Lib Dem leader, pledges to fight Brexit Anti-Brexit protesters take to London streets. Weary firms gear up to hit the Brexit pause button for a second time. Prices rise for British tourists as Brexit puts the pound in the shade. Pro-Brexit activist wins appeal against \u00a320,000 electoral spending fine. Revenue chief who received death threats over Brexit steps down. Ursula von der Leyen: hard Brexit would be massive blow for both sides. \u00a31.3m in bonuses paid to Brexit department civil servants. Pound could fall to parity with dollar on hard-Brexit concerns. Hammond \u201cterrified\u201d by Jacob Rees-Mogg claim of no-deal Brexit boost. London house prices fall at fastest rate in 10 years. Sharp rise in Britons making applications for Irish passports.

      "body": "<p>On a muggy August afternoon nearly five years ago, criminal justice professor Wesley Bell saw protesters march past his front porch in Ferguson, Missouri.</p> <p>The killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by the white police officer Darren Wilson set off protests in the black-majority city over police brutality and long simmering tensions around racial inequality. The unrest transfixed a nation and propelled the Black Lives Matter movement into the political mainstream.</p> <p>Bell joined the demonstrations demanding justice for Brown.</p> <p>The experience was formative for Bell\u2019s political aspirations. In April 2015, he won a seat on the Ferguson city council. Then, last August, he shocked the state\u2019s Democratic political establishment by roundly defeating a seven-term incumbent to become prosecuting attorney for St Louis county.</p> <p>The protester was now the prosecutor. And Bell had won on a radical platform promising to end mass incarceration, dramatically reform the cash bail system, end the death penalty and decriminalize marijuana possession in the county of just under a million people.</p> <p>Bell is part of a movement. Across the country, progressives have won office in district attorney and prosecutor races. They have claimed victories in major cities like Philadelphia and Chicago but also in places like Portsmouth, Virginia, where in February 2015, Stephanie Morales, 31, became the city\u2019s first ever woman elected to the office of commonwealth\u2019s attorney. Pending a recount in the Queens DA race, the democratic socialist Tiffany Cab\u00e1n could become the latest.</p> <p>These candidates have bucked a decades-long \u201ctough-on-crime\u201d trend adopted by both major parties, in favor of fundamental reforms to criminal justice. They have been aided by armies of volunteers through traditional door-to-door campaigning, digital organizing, and \u2013 in some cases \u2013 funding from the billionaire George Soros and national progressive groups.</p> <p>The Guardian interviewed more than half a dozen of these office-holders to take the pulse of a movement gaining steam, even as Donald Trump has appointed and confirmed more than 100 conservative federal judges. In the Trump era, this struggle over who will define the future of the American criminal justice system may endure long after the president exits the White House.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43cd0e09ff9e4dd0d20c904e5fb1e4fbc8211f2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43cd0e09ff9e4dd0d20c904e5fb1e4fbc8211f2f/0_74_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wesley Bell in 2015.

Bell, for example, fired the veteran St Louis county prosecutor who had presented grand jury evidence in the Michael Brown case (a grand jury declined to bring charges against Wilson). Within his first 100 days, his office said it had reduced the county\u2019s jail population by 12%, taking it to its lowest level since 2002. And, within his first six months, Bell established an independent unit to tackle wrongful convictions and abuse by police.</p> <p>\u201cAs progressive prosecutors, we have the opportunity to lead the way in reducing mass incarceration,\u201d said Bell.</p> <p>And more like Bell are emerging in every part of the country, says Chris Lazare, organizing director for the Real Justice Pac, an organization that consults and endorses candidates running for these offices, so often held by white men.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of black and brown lawyers are stepping up,\u201d said Lazare.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018We are in the fight</strong><strong>\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Philadelphia\u2019s district attorney, Larry Krasner, tends to ramble off at tangents. He can jump from discussing Michelle Alexander\u2019s The New Jim Crow to the legislative minutiae of ending cash bail, often in the same breath. He likens mass incarceration to a \u201cgulag\u201d. He is also the most powerful law enforcement official in the nation\u2019s sixth largest city.</p> <p>Krasner won a shock victory in the May 2017 Democratic primary. As arguably the most high-profile progressive district attorney in the country, Krasner is a darling for social justice activists and a hated villain for his powerful enemies. They include the city\u2019s police union, the Republican-controlled Pennsylvania legislature and the Democrat attorney general, Josh Shapiro.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5618da65a8f727b02ced780319cb0876e3ad43e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5618da65a8f727b02ced780319cb0876e3ad43e9/0_164_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philadelphia district attorney Larry Krasner is a darling for social justice activists and a hated villain for his powerful enemies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Philadelphia district attorney, Larry Krasner, is a darling for social justice activists and a hated villain for his powerful enemies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Rourke/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve accomplished enough so the institutions woke up,\u201d Krasner said, listing accomplishments like reducing the city\u2019s jail population, ending cash bail for low-level crimes and exonerating eight individuals facing life sentences through an accountability unit he created. \u201cThis is what happens when you have moments for social change and they start to change. There\u2019s a commotion.\u201d</p> <p>The resistance to Krasner\u2019s policies reached a peak last month when the state legislature passed a law, known as Act 58, giving authority to Shapiro to prosecute certain firearms violations in Philadelphia \u2013 and nowhere else in the state. The effort to wrest power from Krasner was \u201can attack on democracy\u201d Krasner said. Shapiro backed down.</p> <p>The episode, Krasner said, was indicative of this cultural moment. \u201cIf you look at it as a movement, we are past the laughing, we are past the ignoring,\u201d said Krasner. \u201cWe are in the fight. The only step left is winning.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Sustaining a movement</strong></h2> <p>It was the 1994 Crime Bill that truly altered the nation\u2019s criminal justice system. It established the infamous \u201cthree strikes\u201d mandatory life sentence policy for repeat offenders, allocated money to hire 100,000 new police officers and granted nearly $10bn for new prisons.</p> <p>The nation\u2019s prison population soared, devastating communities of color in every city in America, said Rachael Rollins, the district attorney for Suffolk county in Massachusetts, which includes Boston.</p> <p>Rollins says she knows firsthand the impact of these policies. Two of her siblings are incarcerated.</p> <p>\u201cMy life experience is a little different from traditional DAs,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Rollins won a five-way race last September in a competitive primary that laid bare party divisions. She assembled a broad coalition across gender, racial and class lines, particularly in Boston\u2019s working-class neighborhoods, to beat her leading opponent, Greg Henning, an assistant district attorney backed by Boston\u2019s political class.</p> <p>Rollins pledged to not prosecute minor crimes like trespassing, shoplifting and drug possession and to increase efforts to decriminalize poverty, addiction and mental illness through newly created diversionary programs.</p> <p>On her first day in office, Rollins issued a memo that included a \u201cdo not prosecute list\u201d of 15 types of offenses for the 300 prosecutors she inherited. The resistance from the city\u2019s law enforcement institutions and its statehouse allies was fierce.</p> <p>The National Police Association accused Rollins of \u201creckless disregard\u201d for Massachusetts law in a written complaint to the state\u2019s bar association. Then came a letter from a member of the Republican governor Charlie Baker\u2019s cabinet condemning her memo.</p> <p>Rollins continued to push through her agenda, despite the blowback. Last month, her office won a preliminary injunction against US Immigrations and Custom Enforcement (Ice) blocking immigration arrests at state courthouses.</p> <p>She has, though, come under criticism from advocates. In March, CourtWatch MA, an oversight group, found many of the crimes from Rollins\u2019 \u201cdo not prosecute list\u201d were still being prosecuted within her first 100 days in office, but just in different ways. Rollins acknowledged the process had been slow.</p> <p>The criticism highlighted the political reality for insurgent candidates elected to office on promises to undo policies crafted over decades. Three years ago, Kim Ogg became the first Democrat elected district attorney in Harris county \u2013 which includes Houston \u2013 in nearly 40 years on a progressive platform. Heading into her 2020 re-election campaign, she faces a challenger from her left \u2013 democratic socialist Audia Jones \u2013 who says she has failed to fulfill her promises.</p> <p>The stakes are high for the movement because voters newly interested in these races expect results quickly, said David Alan Sklansky, a Stanford law professor who studies district attorneys.</p> <p>Falling crime rates in a number of urban areas in recent years have been important in making this movement politically possible, Sklansky added.</p> <p>Still, the movement itself \u2013 despite the resistance it has faced in nearly every place where a progressive has won office \u2013 is ultimately a response to the will of voters who want to see reform, said Marisa Maleck, a lawyer and conservative legal commentator who clerked for the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cThe tough-on-crime approach works to put people away,\u201d said Maleck, who identifies as Libertarian. \u201cBut, in these races, voters clearly are saying that\u2019s not working.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Future for movement?</strong></h2> <p>Since before Trump was elected, conservative organizations in Washington, like the Judicial Crisis Network and the Federalist Society, have methodically guided the president to their preferred judicial picks to both federal courts and to the supreme court.</p> <p>The moves have demoralized Democratic voters who see the long-lasting consequences of these choices. Republican-led state houses have pushed through a slew of anti-abortion laws emboldened by the right\u2019s hold on the nation\u2019s top court.</p> <p>The battlefield for progressives has, thus, shifted from the Supreme court to the prosecutor\u2019s office.</p> <p>\u201cOur supreme court is gone as an agent of good in seeking justice,\u201d said Krasner, who argues that winning more and more prosecutor\u2019s offices is critical to long-lasting reform.</p> <p>The progressive prosecutor movement is still in its nascent phase, Krasner and others interviewed agreed. But Sklansky, the Stanford law professor, still counts this era as historic.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of another moment where there was as broad a movement nationwide to moderate criminal justice policies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that dystopian rhetoric from its opponents hasn\u2019t stalled this movement is some sign that it\u2019s durable.\u201d</p>",

The protester was now the prosecutor. And Bell had won on a radical platform promising to end mass incarceration, dramatically reform the cash bail system, end the death penalty and decriminalize marijuana possession in the county of just under a million people. Bell is part of a movement. Across the country, progressives have won office in district attorney and prosecutor races. They have claimed victories in major cities like Philadelphia and Chicago but also in places like Portsmouth, Virginia, where in February 2015, Stephanie Morales, 31, became the city\u2019s first ever woman elected to the office of commonwealth\u2019s attorney. Pending a recount in the Queens DA race, the democratic socialist Tiffany Cab\u00e1n could become the latest. These candidates have bucked a decades-long \u201ctough-on-crime\u201d trend adopted by both major parties, in favor of fundamental reforms to criminal justice. They have been aided by armies of volunteers through traditional door-to-door campaigning, digital organizing, and \u2013 in some cases \u2013 funding from the billionaire George Soros and national progressive groups. The Guardian interviewed more than half a dozen of these office-holders to take the pulse of a movement gaining steam, even as Donald Trump has appointed and confirmed more than 100 conservative federal judges. In the Trump era, this struggle over who will define the future of the American criminal justice system may endure long after the president exits the White House. The new Democrats often act quickly. Bell, for example, fired the veteran St Louis county prosecutor who had presented grand jury evidence in the Michael Brown case (a grand jury declined to bring charges against Wilson). Within his first 100 days, his office said it had reduced the county\u2019s jail population by 12%, taking it to its lowest level since 2002. And, within his first six months, Bell established an independent unit to tackle wrongful convictions and abuse by police. \u201cAs progressive prosecutors, we have the opportunity to lead the way in reducing mass incarceration,\u201d said Bell. And more like Bell are emerging in every part of the country, says Chris Lazare, organizing director for the Real Justice Pac, an organization that consults and endorses candidates running for these offices, so often held by white men. \u201cA lot of black and brown lawyers are stepping up,\u201d said Lazare. \u2018We are in the fight\u2019 Philadelphia\u2019s district attorney, Larry Krasner, tends to ramble off at tangents. He can jump from discussing Michelle Alexander\u2019s The New Jim Crow to the legislative minutiae of ending cash bail, often in the same breath. He likens mass incarceration to a \u201cgulag\u201d. He is also the most powerful law enforcement official in the nation\u2019s sixth largest city. Krasner won a shock victory in the May 2017 Democratic primary. As arguably the most high-profile progressive district attorney in the country, Krasner is a darling for social justice activists and a hated villain for his powerful enemies. They include the city\u2019s police union, the Republican-controlled Pennsylvania legislature and the Democrat attorney general, Josh Shapiro. \u201cWe\u2019ve accomplished enough so the institutions woke up,\u201d Krasner said, listing accomplishments like reducing the city\u2019s jail population, ending cash bail for low-level crimes and exonerating eight individuals facing life sentences through an accountability unit he created. \u201cThis is what happens when you have moments for social change and they start to change. There\u2019s a commotion.\u201d The resistance to Krasner\u2019s policies reached a peak last month when the state legislature passed a law, known as Act 58, giving authority to Shapiro to prosecute certain firearms violations in Philadelphia \u2013 and nowhere else in the state. The effort to wrest power from Krasner was \u201can attack on democracy\u201d Krasner said. Shapiro backed down. The episode, Krasner said, was indicative of this cultural moment. \u201cIf you look at it as a movement, we are past the laughing, we are past the ignoring,\u201d said Krasner. \u201cWe are in the fight. The only step left is winning.\u201d Sustaining a movement It was the 1994 Crime Bill that truly altered the nation\u2019s criminal justice system. It established the infamous \u201cthree strikes\u201d mandatory life sentence policy for repeat offenders, allocated money to hire 100,000 new police officers and granted nearly $10bn for new prisons. The nation\u2019s prison population soared, devastating communities of color in every city in America, said Rachael Rollins, the district attorney for Suffolk county in Massachusetts, which includes Boston. Rollins says she knows firsthand the impact of these policies. Two of her siblings are incarcerated. \u201cMy life experience is a little different from traditional DAs,\u201d she said. Rollins won a five-way race last September in a competitive primary that laid bare party divisions. She assembled a broad coalition across gender, racial and class lines, particularly in Boston\u2019s working-class neighborhoods, to beat her leading opponent, Greg Henning, an assistant district attorney backed by Boston\u2019s political class. Rollins pledged to not prosecute minor crimes like trespassing, shoplifting and drug possession and to increase efforts to decriminalize poverty, addiction and mental illness through newly created diversionary programs. On her first day in office, Rollins issued a memo that included a \u201cdo not prosecute list\u201d of 15 types of offenses for the 300 prosecutors she inherited. The resistance from the city\u2019s law enforcement institutions and its statehouse allies was fierce. The National Police Association accused Rollins of \u201creckless disregard\u201d for Massachusetts law in a written complaint to the state\u2019s bar association. Then came a letter from a member of the Republican governor Charlie Baker\u2019s cabinet condemning her memo. Rollins continued to push through her agenda, despite the blowback. Last month, her office won a preliminary injunction against US Immigrations and Custom Enforcement (Ice) blocking immigration arrests at state courthouses. She has, though, come under criticism from advocates. In March, CourtWatch MA, an oversight group, found many of the crimes from Rollins\u2019 \u201cdo not prosecute list\u201d were still being prosecuted within her first 100 days in office, but just in different ways. Rollins acknowledged the process had been slow. The criticism highlighted the political reality for insurgent candidates elected to office on promises to undo policies crafted over decades. Three years ago, Kim Ogg became the first Democrat elected district attorney in Harris county \u2013 which includes Houston \u2013 in nearly 40 years on a progressive platform. Heading into her 2020 re-election campaign, she faces a challenger from her left \u2013 democratic socialist Audia Jones \u2013 who says she has failed to fulfill her promises. The stakes are high for the movement because voters newly interested in these races expect results quickly, said David Alan Sklansky, a Stanford law professor who studies district attorneys. Falling crime rates in a number of urban areas in recent years have been important in making this movement politically possible, Sklansky added. Still, the movement itself \u2013 despite the resistance it has faced in nearly every place where a progressive has won office \u2013 is ultimately a response to the will of voters who want to see reform, said Marisa Maleck, a lawyer and conservative legal commentator who clerked for the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas in 2015. \u201cThe tough-on-crime approach works to put people away,\u201d said Maleck, who identifies as Libertarian. \u201cBut, in these races, voters clearly are saying that\u2019s not working.\u201d Future for movement? Since before Trump was elected, conservative organizations in Washington, like the Judicial Crisis Network and the Federalist Society, have methodically guided the president to their preferred judicial picks to both federal courts and to the supreme court. The moves have demoralized Democratic voters who see the long-lasting consequences of these choices. Republican-led state houses have pushed through a slew of anti-abortion laws emboldened by the right\u2019s hold on the nation\u2019s top court. The battlefield for progressives has, thus, shifted from the Supreme court to the prosecutor\u2019s office. \u201cOur supreme court is gone as an agent of good in seeking justice,\u201d said Krasner, who argues that winning more and more prosecutor\u2019s offices is critical to long-lasting reform. The progressive prosecutor movement is still in its nascent phase, Krasner and others interviewed agreed. But Sklansky, the Stanford law professor, still counts this era as historic. \u201cI can\u2019t think of another moment where there was as broad a movement nationwide to moderate criminal justice policies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that dystopian rhetoric from its opponents hasn\u2019t stalled this movement is some sign that it\u2019s durable.\u201d",

Under the laws, black people also, increasingly, found themselves \u201crelegated to convict leasing camps that were, in many ways, worse than slavery\u201d. If Jim Crow was an effective means of controlling the black population, then modern mass incarceration, Alexander argues, is its successor.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The law is supposedly colour-blind but narratives around crimes are framed according to those deemed worthy of pity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The figures are extraordinary. A decade ago in Chicago, for instance, 55% of the adult black male population had a felony record. In quiet yet forceful writing Alexander, a legal scholar, outlines how the Reagan government exploited 1980s hysteria over crack cocaine to demonise the black population so that \u201cblack\u201d and \u201ccrime\u201d became interchangeable. It was a war \u2013 not on drugs \u2013 but on black people. While churchgoing mothers in the ghetto might want politicians to be tough on crime, they don\u2019t want to see their sons routinely arrested (suspected of being drug dealers for wearing baggy trousers).</p> <p>Alexander doesn\u2019t understate the devastation caused by crack cocaine, quoting the historian David Kennedy\u2019s observation that it \u201cblew through America\u2019s black neighbourhoods like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\u201d. But if the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d was simply a question of controlling crime then college campuses, rather than black ghettos, would have been a safer bet. In 2000, the National Institute on Drug Abuse reported that white students used crack cocaine at eight times the rate of black students.</p> <p>First-time drug offenders can face 10 years imprisonment; thousands of black Americans, following plea-bargaining, languish in jail for crimes they did not commit because of fears of these mandatory sentences. On release, they enter a parallel shadow society, where employment opportunities disappear, creating \u201ca closed circuit of marginality\u201d.</p> <p>Black people haven\u2019t fared better under the Democrats. President Clinton\u2019s \u201cthree strikes and you\u2019re out\u201d legislation led to a further surge in prisoners given mandatory life sentences after conviction of a violent third felony.</p> <p>The law is supposedly colour-blind but narratives around crimes are framed according to those deemed worthy or unworthy of compassion. Alexander draws stark comparisons with the prosecutions of drunk drivers. Cocaine is a scourge in US society but drunk driving (by white men 70% of the time) results in far more violent deaths, yet drunk drivers are often charged with misdemeanours.</p> <p>The emergence of black leaders hasn\u2019t improved matters but, rather, has perpetuated the fantasy of a post-racial society. How can a system be racist when there are black heads of police departments? Alexander argues that if we understood its dependency on black exceptionalism, then \u201cthe existence of black police chiefs would be no more encouraging today than the presence of black slave drivers\u2026hundreds of years ago\u201d.</p> <p>Alexander wrote recently in the <em>New York Times</em> that she\u2019s encouraged by \u201cthe astonishing changes that have been made in the last several years on a wide range of criminal justice issues\u201d, including Florida restoring voting rights to more than 1.4 million people with felony convictions. But she is sceptical about the technological fix championed by enthusiasts of algorithms determining who should or shouldn\u2019t be incarcerated. </p> <p>Notwithstanding improvements to the US judicial system, this distressing book offers important lessons for all societies that claim colour-blindness but enact policies that scapegoat marginalised groups. Colour-blindness leads to denial, believes Alexander; better to strive for colour-consciousness.</p> <p><em>This review is from the Observer </em></p> <p><em>\u2022 The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colourblindness </em>by Michelle Alexander<em> </em>is published by Penguin (\u00a39.99).

Under the laws, black people also, increasingly, found themselves \u201crelegated to convict leasing camps that were, in many ways, worse than slavery\u201d. If Jim Crow was an effective means of controlling the black population, then modern mass incarceration, Alexander argues, is its successor. The figures are extraordinary. A decade ago in Chicago, for instance, 55% of the adult black male population had a felony record. In quiet yet forceful writing Alexander, a legal scholar, outlines how the Reagan government exploited 1980s hysteria over crack cocaine to demonise the black population so that \u201cblack\u201d and \u201ccrime\u201d became interchangeable. It was a war \u2013 not on drugs \u2013 but on black people. While churchgoing mothers in the ghetto might want politicians to be tough on crime, they don\u2019t want to see their sons routinely arrested (suspected of being drug dealers for wearing baggy trousers). Alexander doesn\u2019t understate the devastation caused by crack cocaine, quoting the historian David Kennedy\u2019s observation that it \u201cblew through America\u2019s black neighbourhoods like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\u201d. But if the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d was simply a question of controlling crime then college campuses, rather than black ghettos, would have been a safer bet. In 2000, the National Institute on Drug Abuse reported that white students used crack cocaine at eight times the rate of black students. First-time drug offenders can face 10 years imprisonment; thousands of black Americans, following plea-bargaining, languish in jail for crimes they did not commit because of fears of these mandatory sentences. On release, they enter a parallel shadow society, where employment opportunities disappear, creating \u201ca closed circuit of marginality\u201d. Black people haven\u2019t fared better under the Democrats. President Clinton\u2019s \u201cthree strikes and you\u2019re out\u201d legislation led to a further surge in prisoners given mandatory life sentences after conviction of a violent third felony. The law is supposedly colour-blind but narratives around crimes are framed according to those deemed worthy or unworthy of compassion. Alexander draws stark comparisons with the prosecutions of drunk drivers. Cocaine is a scourge in US society but drunk driving (by white men 70% of the time) results in far more violent deaths, yet drunk drivers are often charged with misdemeanours. The emergence of black leaders hasn\u2019t improved matters but, rather, has perpetuated the fantasy of a post-racial society. How can a system be racist when there are black heads of police departments? Alexander argues that if we understood its dependency on black exceptionalism, then \u201cthe existence of black police chiefs would be no more encouraging today than the presence of black slave drivers\u2026hundreds of years ago\u201d. Alexander wrote recently in the New York Times that she\u2019s encouraged by \u201cthe astonishing changes that have been made in the last several years on a wide range of criminal justice issues\u201d, including Florida restoring voting rights to more than 1.4 million people with felony convictions. But she is sceptical about the technological fix championed by enthusiasts of algorithms determining who should or shouldn\u2019t be incarcerated. Notwithstanding improvements to the US judicial system, this distressing book offers important lessons for all societies that claim colour-blindness but enact policies that scapegoat marginalised groups. Colour-blindness leads to denial, believes Alexander; better to strive for colour-consciousness.

They are not even a \u201cthey\u201d. They are us. We exist as a totality of human beings in all our states of being, in all our various ways of surviving on this planet. When you or I talk of education, this can never exclude, marginalise, or downgrade any group because it has been prejudged as less worthy or less deserving. Yes, we talk of \u201cspecial\u201d needs, but really they are \u201cour needs\u201d, the needs of our society to be a society for all of us. I hope that\u2019s the attitude of everyone at the Department for Education, and you, too. When you talked of a \u201cfresh look\u201d, you and I know this was triggered entirely by what everyone knows is a crisis. There are reminders every week. A crisis in provision. And everyone knows this crisis has been caused by the preposterous idea that something you people call the \u201cBritish economy\u201d (as if all we British have equal parts of it and all get the same out of it) could be \u201csaved\u201d by stopping us having decent public services. Cynically and cruelly you people cut back where you thought there would be least resistance. Guess who that included? Children with special educational needs. What \u201cfresh look\u201d did you need in order to find out what\u2019s happened? You have armies of inspectors, accountants, testers, regional commissioners and performance monitors checking every time a child puts pen to paper and we are supposed to believe that you\u2019re going to find out something you didn\u2019t already know. Nevertheless, you diverted a DfE squad on an expedition to discover something. What? That the hundreds of protests from parents, carers, teachers, teaching assistants and children are wrong? Or that we don\u2019t really know that the provision has been cut? Or that families have not had to go to court to get funding for their child? Or that we weren\u2019t reading the papers in 2010 when politicians announced they were going to cut public services? Or is it that this whole charade of a \u201cfresh look\u201d and \u201cbest understanding\u201d was so you could conjure up a lash-up intended to assuage the rage of people who have been petitioning and demonstrating, until they can petition and demonstrate to your successor?

      "bodyText": "A potentially explosive second meeting between Mack Horton and his Chinese rival, Sun Yang, has been avoided with the Australian failing to qualify for the 800m freestyle final at the swimming world championships in South Korea. Horton, whose social media has been bombarded with abuse from supporters of Sun after staging a protest against the Chinese swimmer earlier this week, placed eighth in his heat on Tuesday and will miss out on another shot at Sun. Triple Olympic champion Sun, who beat Horton to gold in the 400m freestyle a day earlier, sneaked into the medal race after posting the eighth fastest qualifying time across four heats. The pair\u2019s rivalry, which stretches back to the Rio Olympics when Horton branded Sun a \u201cdrug cheat\u201d, reignited this week after the Australian chose not to shake the race winner\u2019s hand or stand on the podium alongside him after Monday\u2019s final. But Horton indicated after his disappointing showing in the 800m heat \u2013 an event in which he had been tipped as a medal chance \u2013 he may tone down his anti-doping stance for the sake of his teammates during the remainder of the championships. \u201cAs much as I want to protect the sport, I still need to protect the team,\u201d Horton said. \u201cSo the focus now is the team\u2019s performances and focusing on what everyone else is doing and making sure we get through the week.\u201d Horton\u2019s initial protest was met with widespread support from fellow swimmers \u2013 American breaststroke champion Lilly King said he received a standing ovation upon entering the athletes\u2019 village dining hall \u2013 but drew swift and cutting condemnation from Sun\u2019s supporters. \u201cYou should cherish the chance you got to bathe in Sun Yang\u2019s foot washing water.

There were also some death threats. Sun has been a controversial figure in swimming even before the start of his public rivalry with Horton, which began three years ago at the Rio Games; the 27-year-old served a three-month ban in 2014 for doping after testing positive for a banned stimulant. In 2013, he spent seven days in detention after driving without a licence and crashing his car into a bus in his hometown of Hangzhou. More recently, Sun is accused of allegedly smashing vials of blood samples with a hammer during a routine out-of-competition drug test.

Rory Stewart, a former leadership rival, has joined Philip Hammond and David Gauke in telling Johnson he will quit the cabinet rather than serve under him, while the Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan has quit in order to try, unsuccessfully, to bring on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/22/alan-duncan-quits-as-minister-before-boris-johnson-arrival-at-no-10\">pre-emptive confidence vote</a> about Johnson.

May would go to Buckingham Palace tomorrow and formally resign to the Queen, allowing Johnson to take her place. The new PM will have a majority of just two if the party loses the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection this month to the Liberal Democrats.

It is also opposed by many teachers and child development experts.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Cabinet members prepare to quit Hello, it\u2019s Warren Murray with the news we hope will hit the spot this morning. Boris Johnson is expected to be announced today as the choice of the Conservative party to be the next prime minister. Rory Stewart, a former leadership rival, has joined Philip Hammond and David Gauke in telling Johnson he will quit the cabinet rather than serve under him, while the Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan has quit in order to try, unsuccessfully, to bring on a pre-emptive confidence vote about Johnson. But Conservative backbenchers fighting no deal are not planning to bring down Johnson immediately, with one saying the party \u201cwould take a very, very dim view of getting rid of him before he has done anything yet\u201d. Assuming he beats Jeremy Hunt in the leadership contest, Johnson is expected to make his choices for the top four cabinet jobs tonight. May would go to Buckingham Palace tomorrow and formally resign to the Queen, allowing Johnson to take her place. The new PM will have a majority of just two if the party loses the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection this month to the Liberal Democrats. The Tories\u2019 majority was eroded further on Monday by the withdrawal of the whip from Charlie Elphicke, a Tory backbencher charged with three counts of sexual assault against two women. Keep an eye out for the launch of today\u2019s Politics Live blog covering the build-up, the result and the reaction to the announcement of Britain\u2019s next prime minister. * * * Reception pupils secretly tested \u2013 Four- and five-year-olds in about half of England\u2019s primary schools are to be taken out of class for a new test called the reception baseline assessment (RBA). But parents have no legal right to know, says the Department for Education (DfE), and informing them has been left up to individual schools. Families opposed to the testing are going to the high court in London arguing the testing will cause distress and damage future learning. It is also opposed by many teachers and child development experts. The government says the test is a \u201c20-minute check of language and ability to count\u201d that will provide a snapshot of children\u2019s development when they start school \u201cjust like checking their teeth or eyesight\u201d. * * * Mueller\u2019s moment \u2013 Robert Mueller, the Trump-Russia investigator, is due to testify on Wednesday to Congress where he will for the first time publicly detail ties between Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and Moscow, and potential efforts by the president to obstruct justice in the Russia investigation. Mueller is unlikely to deviate from the contents of his report where he outlined 11 attempts by Trump or his campaign to obstruct justice. He concluded the campaign was \u201creceptive\u201d to Russian interference and expected to benefit electorally from it. Hundreds of actors, journalists and novelists have been staging 24-hour long public readings of Mueller\u2019s findings. \u201cIt\u2019s not entertainment; it\u2019s not Saturday Night Live; people need to read this,\u201d said Brian Faker, who helped organise one such event in Seattle. * * * Horror on Canadian highway \u2013 Police are investigating three suspicious deaths and the disappearance of two teenagers within days of each other along a remote Canadian highway. The bodies of an Australian, Lucas Fowler, 23, and US citizen Chynna Deese, 24, were found near their broken-down vehicle beside the Alaska Highway in British Columbia on 15 July. Four days later police in Dease Lake \u2013 several hours\u2019 drive south \u2013 launched a search for two teenagers after their truck was discovered in flames and a man\u2019s body was found nearby. Janelle Shoihet, spokeswoman for the Mounties, said: \u201cThe police are proceeding with the knowledge that there\u2019s a possibility the investigations could be linked.\u201d * * * \u2018Floating bomb\u2019 \u2013 A deserted oil tanker lying at anchor off war-torn Yemen is at risk of exploding from a build-up of gases and spewing out 1m barrels of oil, causing an environmental disaster in the Red Sea, experts have warned. A UN team has been refused permission to visit the ship by Houthi rebels, who are fighting the Saudi-backed Yemen government. The ship \u2013 effectively a floating oil terminal, known as Safer \u2013 has been inoperational since 2015. According to the Yemen government its deteriorating state poses a risk four times that of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. * * * Heart-stopping conclusion \u2013 The loss of a gene 2 to 3 million years ago in our ancestry may help explain why humans are the only animals in which heart attacks are common. They are very rare in some of our closest genetic relatives including chimpanzees. Researchers have found that 2-3 million years ago a gene called CMAH shut down, making us deficient in molecules called sialic acids. Now, when humans eat meat that contains those molecules, \u201cit\u2019s like a Trojan horse \u2026 it sneaks in and causes an inflammatory immune response\u201d, said Professor Ajit Varki at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine. He envisions \u201can antidote to red meat to allow people to consume a moderate amount, which would give them the nutritious benefits, but without the negatives\u201d. Today in Focus podcast: Is Trump\u2019s racism an election strategy? On 14 July, Donald Trump used Twitter to tell four unnamed Democratic congresswomen to \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came\u201d. His racist language shocked many around the world, but he has refused to back down. The Guardian\u2019s Jamiles Lartey looks at Trump\u2019s history of racism while David Smith discusses how it may affect the 2020 presidential race. And: Ellie Geranmayeh on the Iran crisis.

Sport Prosecutors in Las Vegas say that Juventus star Cristiano Ronaldo will not face criminal charges over allegations he raped a woman at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009. The host country\u2019s hopes of a first Tour de France title winner since 1985 are high after a breathtaking weekend thanks to Julian Alaphilippe\u2019s risk-taking.

Lisa Richardson, solicitor for Irwin Mitchell, representing the families, says they fear their children could face harm: \u201cThey are worried about the immediate distress experienced by some children in the assessment process itself, and the longer-term impact on their education because of schools potentially using the feedback from the assessment to label or stream children at such a young age.\u201d Phillips says: \u201cI know about the tests only because I am a teacher and I asked. Her school said every child will be sitting the test. I said, well, not my daughter because it is a pilot and not statutory. I was told I would have to discuss it at the home visit in the first week of term in September.\u201d She adds: \u201cI\u2019ve nothing against the school. I\u2019m sure the assessment will be done in the nicest possible way, but I want Sophia to be able to play and bond with her reception teacher and teaching assistants. I\u2019m not sure that if she is taken out of class on her own she would be able to respond to the questions, even if she knew the answers. I don\u2019t think it would be a fair representation of what she can do and it is of no benefit to the children.\u201d The DfE says the test is not a measure of individual children and will not be kept on their school records. \u201cThe pilot is an opportunity for schools to familiarise themselves with the format and help us make sure it works \u2013 that\u2019s why it\u2019s so significant that almost 10,000 schools have registered. It is up to schools whether or not to tell parents that they are taking part. This is the case with all assessment pilots,\u201d says a spokesman. \u201cThe assessment will be stress-free for children as it will reflect normal classroom activities.\u201d But many parents and teachers are not convinced. Sharon Vince, another parent, from London, who is also a teacher, is planning to make a stand. \u201cMy daughter starts school in September and I have written to her headteacher asking them to reconsider taking part in the pilot,\u201d she says. \u201cI found out my daughter\u2019s school will be piloting them at a meeting with other teachers. I would have expected the school to tell parents,\u201d she says. \u201cWe teachers do assessment all the time, observing children as they play and talking to them in natural situations, which is quite different from taking them out of class for 20 to 30 minutes and asking them questions with right and wrong answers. \u201cAnd what about those with English as an additional language? Children could get a label assigned to them and that can be difficult to shake off.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Duncan Jones, director</h2> <p>I wanted Sam Rockwell to play the villain in Mute, a film I later made for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/netflix\">Netflix</a>. But he wanted to play a blue-collar kind of guy. We both liked the sci-fi films of the 70s and early 80s \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/27/silent-running-french-classic-dvd\">Silent Running</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/01/alien-review-ridley-scott-lethally-contemporary-masterpiece\">Alien</a>, Outland \u2013 and the sense of realism and mundanity they brought to space, with a lot of the day-to-day grind comparable to jobs on Earth. So I said: \u201cLet me see if I can write something.\u201d</p> <p>I developed the story, about a man mining helium-3 on the moon who meets his clone \u2013 and Nathan Parker wrote the script. The moon base is called Sarang, the Korean word for love, because I was in a long-distance relationship with a Korean girl at the time. The frustration and sense of isolation that Sam Bell, the main character, feels is definitely something I was channelling. I also thought there was something interesting about having the opportunity to meet yourself from a different point in your life, to see how a mature version of yourself would interact with a rawer, more emotional one. That\u2019s certainly how I\u2019ve changed in the course of getting older.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eca26218204138e4d6942c2d7689c6f9900dc195\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eca26218204138e4d6942c2d7689c6f9900dc195/0_143_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The main character\u2019s sense of isolation is definitely something I was channelling\u2019 \u2026 Duncan Jones on set.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The main character\u2019s sense of isolation is definitely something I was channelling\u2019 \u2026 Duncan Jones on set.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: c.Sony Pics/Everett / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My flatmate Gavin Rothery did a lot of the concept art. He gave the moon base and Gerty, the robot voiced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/kevinspacey\">Kevin Spacey</a>, their look. While we were working on it in London, we ordered so much food from Mexicali on Fulham Road that we ended up using their takeaway boxes for Sam\u2019s space rations. We built the moon base as a full 360-degree set and we would seal the cast and crew in at the start of the day. That set gave us confidence, though it cost close to a third of our $5m (\u00a33.9m) budget. It\u2019s hard enough to make a low-budget movie without fretting about: \u201cOh, I can\u2019t pan here because I don\u2019t have enough set.\u201d</p> <p>We wanted to make stuff seem as real as possible. A lot of love and attention was put into the miniature vehicle models, but they needed extra visual effects, such as dust kicking up off the tyres. Then there was the problem of the interaction between the two Sams.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twuScTcDP_Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/twuScTcDP_Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twuScTcDP_Q\">Watch a trailer for Moon</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Nowadays, that kind of multiple performance, achieved with CGI, is quite common, but it was much harder in the noughties. We picked scenes that would give the most impressive visuals featuring both clones so the audience never felt cheated. For the fight scene, Sam wrestled with a stunt guy who was wearing a green stocking over his head and we swapped it out digitally later.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think Moon was negative about technology but it wasn\u2019t particularly positive either. Right now, I\u2019m desperately hungry for more optimistic sci-fi because we bloody well need it. How does mankind get itself out of this predicament? Can we see a future we can get excited about? Moon was 10 years ago and it\u2019s crazy how much the world has changed.</p> <h2>Sam Rockwell, actor</h2> <p>There\u2019s a part of every actor that wants to control every scene, so when you\u2019re playing both parts you have that. But Moon was still daunting: a brainfuck, for sure. To differentiate the clones, I started improvising with an actor friend, Yul Vazquez, and Duncan would film us. I had been listening to Jeremy Irons\u2019 DVD commentary on Dead Ringers, in which he played twins, and he talked about contrasting energies. That\u2019s what we did: an alpha/beta thing. One clone had been there alone for three years, so he was a bit Robinson Crusoe, a bit batty. The other was full of testosterone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f8f664bf2e84807073e7fde7454830d518b3263f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8f664bf2e84807073e7fde7454830d518b3263f/932_0_2333_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I was very monk-like during that period, just going to the gym and eating chicken, rolling cigarettes and drinking coffee\u2019 ...

There was a whole conversation about using a wig and it was not a great wig. I said: \u201cI really don\u2019t think we should do that.\u201d It would have not worked for the whole movie. I pushed for using wardrobe and makeup to subtly distinguish them. We did snug clothing and healthy makeup for the healthy clone, baggier clothing for the other. I used props, such as reading glasses and hats, and stole Ratso Rizzo\u2019s cough from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/20/midnight-cowboy-favorite-best-picture-oscar-winner\">Midnight Cowboy</a> for the sick clone.</p> <p>A lot of the time, I was acting opposite a tennis ball on a stand, or opposite Robin Chalk, an actor who looked like me from the back. I would go into makeup to switch to the other clone two or three times a day \u2013 we were trying to complete whole scenes. It was a wild experience. There was a writers\u2019 strike, so we were basically alone at Shepperton Studios. I was very monk-like during that period, just going to the gym and eating chicken, rolling cigarettes and drinking coffee.</p> <p>It\u2019s a milestone in my career \u2013 it\u2019s been celebrated in this underground way. It helped promote a resurgence in intellectual sci-fi, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/03/district-9-review\">District 9</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/22/ex-machina-review\">Ex Machina</a>.

The moon base is called Sarang, the Korean word for love, because I was in a long-distance relationship with a Korean girl at the time. The frustration and sense of isolation that Sam Bell, the main character, feels is definitely something I was channelling. I also thought there was something interesting about having the opportunity to meet yourself from a different point in your life, to see how a mature version of yourself would interact with a rawer, more emotional one. That\u2019s certainly how I\u2019ve changed in the course of getting older. My flatmate Gavin Rothery did a lot of the concept art. He gave the moon base and Gerty, the robot voiced by Kevin Spacey, their look. While we were working on it in London, we ordered so much food from Mexicali on Fulham Road that we ended up using their takeaway boxes for Sam\u2019s space rations. We built the moon base as a full 360-degree set and we would seal the cast and crew in at the start of the day. That set gave us confidence, though it cost close to a third of our $5m (\u00a33.9m) budget. It\u2019s hard enough to make a low-budget movie without fretting about: \u201cOh, I can\u2019t pan here because I don\u2019t have enough set.\u201d We wanted to make stuff seem as real as possible. A lot of love and attention was put into the miniature vehicle models, but they needed extra visual effects, such as dust kicking up off the tyres. Then there was the problem of the interaction between the two Sams. Nowadays, that kind of multiple performance, achieved with CGI, is quite common, but it was much harder in the noughties. We picked scenes that would give the most impressive visuals featuring both clones so the audience never felt cheated. For the fight scene, Sam wrestled with a stunt guy who was wearing a green stocking over his head and we swapped it out digitally later. I don\u2019t think Moon was negative about technology but it wasn\u2019t particularly positive either. Right now, I\u2019m desperately hungry for more optimistic sci-fi because we bloody well need it. How does mankind get itself out of this predicament? Can we see a future we can get excited about? Moon was 10 years ago and it\u2019s crazy how much the world has changed. Sam Rockwell, actor There\u2019s a part of every actor that wants to control every scene, so when you\u2019re playing both parts you have that. But Moon was still daunting: a brainfuck, for sure. To differentiate the clones, I started improvising with an actor friend, Yul Vazquez, and Duncan would film us. I had been listening to Jeremy Irons\u2019 DVD commentary on Dead Ringers, in which he played twins, and he talked about contrasting energies. That\u2019s what we did: an alpha/beta thing. One clone had been there alone for three years, so he was a bit Robinson Crusoe, a bit batty. The other was full of testosterone. Duncan incorporated all this into the script but he was still concerned the audience wouldn\u2019t know who was who. There was a whole conversation about using a wig and it was not a great wig. I said: \u201cI really don\u2019t think we should do that.\u201d It would have not worked for the whole movie. I pushed for using wardrobe and makeup to subtly distinguish them. We did snug clothing and healthy makeup for the healthy clone, baggier clothing for the other. I used props, such as reading glasses and hats, and stole Ratso Rizzo\u2019s cough from Midnight Cowboy for the sick clone. A lot of the time, I was acting opposite a tennis ball on a stand, or opposite Robin Chalk, an actor who looked like me from the back. I would go into makeup to switch to the other clone two or three times a day \u2013 we were trying to complete whole scenes. It was a wild experience. There was a writers\u2019 strike, so we were basically alone at Shepperton Studios. I was very monk-like during that period, just going to the gym and eating chicken, rolling cigarettes and drinking coffee. It\u2019s a milestone in my career \u2013 it\u2019s been celebrated in this underground way. It helped promote a resurgence in intellectual sci-fi, such as District 9 and Ex Machina. Who knew the movie would have this life? \u2022 Moon is out now on 4K Blu-ray.",

One day, I saw him and called out: \u201cTom!\u201d Another neighbour shouted: \u201cMarmaduke!\u201d I realised we had all given him different names.

I wanted a cat that behaved like a dog because I wanted a dog, but didn\u2019t have time to walk one. I drove to Yorkshire to get her. It was love at first sight for me; she was uninterested at best. Off we went down the M1 to start our new life together. Twenty minutes later, Velma did a very runny poo, fell into it then threw up. Presumably because of the smell and overwhelming shame. I cleaned her off with baby wipes at Tibshelf services.</p> <p>Velma has been a constant through good times and bad. She has been there crying for food when she already has some in her bowl, snuggling with me on the sofa and defecating in a box in the corner.

So we called him Shadwell. He is amusing and infuriating in equal measures. He is always falling off things. Aren\u2019t cats supposed to have some sense of balance? If your cat started behaving this way, you\u2019d think there was something wrong with it. I did a routine about him in my show Crowd Pleaser. The premise was that we are nicer to animals than we are to each other. I mean, we found the cat by our bins and now it lives with us.

I went on to the stage in Bath and was trying to do my thigh-gap joke, but I just wasn\u2019t able to. I was struggling. Then I could hear this scratching at the door and it was Bernie. I brought her on and started telling the audience about why I got her, and about my mum\u2019s cancer journey. People really started responding.

It\u2019s an extraordinary reason to get hugely into debt. The cats inspire what I write, but are also incredible company; they sit at the desk when I\u2019m writing.

One day, I was talking to the builder and she trotted up and dropped a tampon at my feet, as if it were a present. Abigail is tiny \u2013 the runt of the litter.

If you\u2019re a fan of musical theatre, you\u2019ll know that\u2019s a character in Chicago. (If not, get a life.) I wanted a cat that behaved like a dog because I wanted a dog, but didn\u2019t have time to walk one. I drove to Yorkshire to get her. It was love at first sight for me; she was uninterested at best. Off we went down the M1 to start our new life together. Twenty minutes later, Velma did a very runny poo, fell into it then threw up. Presumably because of the smell and overwhelming shame. I cleaned her off with baby wipes at Tibshelf services. Velma has been a constant through good times and bad. She has been there crying for food when she already has some in her bowl, snuggling with me on the sofa and defecating in a box in the corner. I love her to bits. Suzi Ruffell is at Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh Jenny Bede: \u2018At the park, he humps all the other dogs \u2026 I\u2019m his humping accomplice\u2019 Buttons is a bichon frise and something between baby and boyfriend. At the park, he will hump all the other dogs. It got so bad that people started to leave when we arrived. It\u2019s gross \u2013 like I\u2019m his humping accomplice. This year, Buttons is on my Edinburgh poster. The photographer had a gorgeous schnauzer, and they played nonstop. It\u2019s amazing we got any photos done. He once bounded on to the stage at a gig, and I picked him up. You don\u2019t need to say anything funny if you have a dog in your arms. People aren\u2019t listening. We gave Buttons a surname: Lumbertubs. There\u2019s a road with that name in Northampton, where we got him. When you call the vet, they take the dog\u2019s name and say: \u201cSurname?\u201d I always forget they mean my name. \u201cYes, it\u2019s Lumbertubs \u2026\u201d Jenny Bede is at Just the Tonic at the Mash House Tony Law: \u2018The dog thinks the rabbit is his puppy\u2019 My wife and I have twins who are 10 and we live in a tiny flat with a big, black German shepherd, Wulfy. What else does this family need? A rabbit, obviously. Woodstock\u2019s cage is in the sitting room, I do my comedy writing in the corner, and Wulfy is usually on the sofa. This year, I wanted to change direction and get political. But I\u2019m surrounded by these animals, so it is more surreal than ever. I\u2019m trying to teach myself how to play the guitar. Every song is about Woodstock. Wulfy will lie next to the cage and they touch noses. I wrote a song about me panicking that I\u2019ve left them together. Wulfy does go into the cage and eat Woodstock\u2019s poos as if they\u2019re sweeties. He thinks Woodstock is his puppy. Tony Law is at Monkey Barrel, Edinburgh Ed Byrne: \u2018He is always falling off things. Aren\u2019t cats supposed to have a sense of balance?\u2019 My cat is like a shadow: black and always at your feet. But Shadow is a bit too superhero-y as a name, too serious. So we called him Shadwell. He is amusing and infuriating in equal measures. He is always falling off things. Aren\u2019t cats supposed to have some sense of balance? If your cat started behaving this way, you\u2019d think there was something wrong with it. I did a routine about him in my show Crowd Pleaser. The premise was that we are nicer to animals than we are to each other. I mean, we found the cat by our bins and now it lives with us. You wouldn\u2019t do that with a person, would you? Ed Byrne is at the Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh Stevie Martin: \u2018She\u2019ll spend August in a tortoise hotel\u2019 My mum presented me with a rescue tortoise. Dr Alison Parker is the perfect flatmate: quiet, polite and only wees on the floor once or twice a week. Everyone thinks tortoises are boring, but that\u2019s because the classic \u201cshove them in the garden\u201d approach makes them depressed. If they get enough UVB light, the right sort of weeds and regular baths, they want to investigate everything. Mine is no stranger to comedy. She starred in Adam Riches\u2019 2017 Christmas show The Beakington Town Hall Murders. It\u2019s coming to Edinburgh this year, minus Alison. It was too expensive to register her as a performer \u2013 she\u2019ll spend August in a tortoise hotel. Stevie Martin is at the Underbelly Bristo Square, Edinburgh John Pendal: \u2018When I lose the audience, I just hold up a cat photo\u2019 I\u2019ve got two rescue cats, Lizzy and Tommy. Most of the time she is called Queen Elizabeth and he is Sticky Tinker because he comes in with dirty paws and she is very regal. At Christmas, Lizzy jumped on to the table, got in the middle of the centrepiece and made herself a tinsel nest, as if to say: \u201cI am the reason you celebrate Christmas!\u201d Sometimes I lose the audience because I say something outside their comfort zone. When that happens, I go to a stack of cat photos I keep on stage. I hold one up and it always wins them back. John Pendal is at Gilded Balloon Teviot, Edinburgh Luisa Omielan: \u2018She is registered as my emotional support dog\u2019 When my mum was dying of cancer, I put in a reservation for a bernese mountain dog. After such a horrific experience, I wanted the most beautiful, ridiculous, gorgeous thing. I had never had a dog before. I drove for seven hours to pick her up. She is phenomenal. She is registered as my emotional support dog. After my mum died, I honoured a commitment to tour my show Am I Right, Ladies? and I took Bernie with me. I went on to the stage in Bath and was trying to do my thigh-gap joke, but I just wasn\u2019t able to. I was struggling. Then I could hear this scratching at the door and it was Bernie. I brought her on and started telling the audience about why I got her, and about my mum\u2019s cancer journey. People really started responding. That developed into the show Politics for Bitches, which the BBC bought as a documentary. It only happened because of Bernie. She has been amazing for me. I adore her. Luisa Omielan is at the Gilded Balloon Teviot, Edinburgh Susan Calman: \u2018We bought a bigger house so the cats could have more space\u2019 We have five rescue cats. We take the ones no one else wants. They all stay indoors because of various health problems. We bought a bigger house so the cats could have more space. It\u2019s an extraordinary reason to get hugely into debt. The cats inspire what I write, but are also incredible company; they sit at the desk when I\u2019m writing. People say that cats from different litters won\u2019t mix, but they are the best of friends. The eldest is called Pickle Kylie Joyce Grenfell. Then there are two pairs of sisters: Daisy Fay Harper (named after a character in a Fannie Flag novel) and DCI Jane Tennison (from Prime Suspect); Dr Abigail Bartlet (from The West Wing) and Olivia Pope (from the TV show Scandal). Olivia loves stealing tampons. One day, I was talking to the builder and she trotted up and dropped a tampon at my feet, as if it were a present. Abigail is tiny \u2013 the runt of the litter. My wife is obsessed with her \u2013 they spoon. Have you ever been excluded from your own bed by your wife and the cat? It\u2019s ridiculous. Susan Calman is at the BBC\u2019s Blue Tent, Edinburgh Anna Drezen: \u2018She jumped on my lap, sneezed, farted and ran away\u2019 Talk about my dog? That is the only conversation I ever want to have. I\u2019m filling out all the forms so I can take her from Brooklyn to Edinburgh. I have to prove she has had a rabies vaccination and is microchipped. They don\u2019t want chihuahuas with rabies running around the Scottish countryside. Her name is Lady Bird, after the former first lady of the US. She\u2019s a chihuahua-terrier mix with a chocolate-coloured patch around her eyes \u2013 it looks like a fascinator, as if she is going to a royal wedding. Soon after I got her, I had a bad day and came home crying. She jumped on my lap and I thought she\u2019d lick my tears away, like a classic Norman Rockwell moment. Instead, she sneezed, farted and ran away. I used to do jokes about her, but realised I was really just excited to talk about my dog. I\u2019d look at the audience and be like: \u201cOh God, that\u2019s the face of a bored co-worker.\u201d She doesn\u2019t like it when I write sketches at home. She just needs me to be staring at her. I try to explain that writing is how I buy the dog food. I\u2019ve had to get a dog-sitter in the run-up to Edinburgh so I can finish writing the show. Anna Drezen is at Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh Aditi Mittal: \u2018I don\u2019t know when Jack was born, but he behaves like a Capricorn\u2019 When I walk home, I play with the puppies on the street. Three years ago, one called Jack followed me home. My mother refused to let him in, so now he comes over once a day to the steps of our building for food and vigorous tummy rubs. The rest of his schedule includes earnestly licking his testicles and liaising with the other dogs for late-night barking sessions. I don\u2019t know when Jack was born, but he behaves like a Capricorn \u2013 he is gentle, loves candlelit dinners, long walks on the beach and humans. He\u2019s currently single. Aditi Mittal is at Assembly George Square, Edinburgh Jake Lambert: \u2018I thought I\u2019d give a kitten a better life. Then he got shot in the head\u2019 My sister\u2019s cat had kittens, so I rescued one. I thought I\u2019d given him a better life, but then he got shot in the head. He came home one day and was crying by the back door. One of his eyes was all bloody. I took him to the vet and they said the pellet was still in his skull. I\u2019d named him Richard Parker, after the tiger from Life of Pi. A cat is just a tiger for your living room, isn\u2019t it? Later, I called up the vet, they asked the cat\u2019s name and I said Richard Parker. They said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got two on our system.\u201d I said mine was the one with one eye. They replied: \u201cThey\u2019re both spelled the same.\u201d Jake Lambert is at Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh Elf Lyons: \u2018Don\u2019t ever tell me they\u2019re hamsters\u2019 I never used to understand why new parents would show you pictures of their kids. And then I got guinea pigs. Now, any opportunity I have, I\u2019m showing them off on my phone. I rescued them a couple of weeks after I\u2019d been ill and had spinal surgery. I wanted something to look after. They\u2019re called Ian McCulloch and Clara Cupcakes, named after the singer and an Australian clown who is phenomenal at hula-hooping. After I got them, I hid away with them for a week. They run free around my bedroom and make such beautiful little noises. When they get excited, they sprint and do a little flip in the air. It\u2019s the most joyous thing I have ever witnessed \u2013 and I\u2019ve lived with animals my whole life. Don\u2019t even dare tell me they\u2019re hamsters. That\u2019s so offensive. Elf Lyons is touring Angela Barnes: \u2018I realise I am bringing up a middle-class dog\u2019 My dog is called Tina Belcher, named after my favourite cartoon character from Bob\u2019s Burgers. She has changed my life. I have more time because my days start at 7am instead of 10am. I go out rain or shine because she needs walking, and that is so good for me. Sometimes, as a comic, you realise you haven\u2019t left the house \u2013 or got out of your pyjamas \u2013 for three days. She is the best company because she never bangs on about herself. I have realised that I am bringing up a middle-class dog. She eats much more healthily than I do and goes to puppy school in Brighton. I have spent a fortune on training toys and the right food. But she is worth every penny. Angela Barnes is touring Rose Matafeo: \u2018He\u2019s a handsome cat from a certain angle; from others he\u2019s a torpedo tubster\u2019 We never had pets growing up. The only way we were going to get one was by accident. That\u2019s how we got Burt Bachacat. My then boyfriend wanted a cat. We adopted one and it lived in his apartment. When he went away, the cat came to my house and stayed. My mother moved out and the cat went to my brother\u2019s. My brother moved country and the cat moved to my nan\u2019s. My nan hates cats, but is obsessed with Burt. She\u2019ll share a picture of a dead rat with an essay about how she\u2019s so proud because Burt brought it home. He still has the hunting instinct \u2013 even though he\u2019s about 14 and has a swinging sack belly. He\u2019s such a handsome cat from a certain angle; from others he\u2019s a torpedo tubster. Burt is scared of feet, doesn\u2019t like being picked up and hates the Fiddler on the Roof soundtrack. I think he\u2019s bi because we were watching Avengers: Endgame and I\u2019ve never seen a cat look at anything as intently as he watched Captain America\u2019s butt.

      "body": "<p>It wasn\u2019t very long ago that a banana was just a banana \u2013 just a curved, yellow fruit. All you knew, if you bought a bunch in 1986, was that they cost around 97p per kilo. You weren\u2019t told if they were organic or pesticide-free. You didn\u2019t know if they came from Costa Rica or the Dominican Republic. And you certainly weren\u2019t invited to worry about the farmers who grew them \u2013 or if their children went to school, or whether their villages had clinics. You just picked up your bananas and walked to the next aisle for your coffee or tea or chocolate, none the wiser about where they came from either, or about the people who farmed them.</p> <p>Back then, the countries that grew these commodities and many others were still known as the Third World, and the habit of not caring about their farming conditions was a legacy of their colonial past. For centuries, trade propelled the colonial project, and exploitation was its very purpose. The farmers of Asia, Africa and South America were forced to raise the crops that the empire\u2019s companies wanted, to work the crops in abject conditions, and to part with them at ruinously low prices. In the last century, the empires melted away but the trade remained lopsided \u2013 with the imbalance now rationalised by the market, which deemed it \u201cefficient\u201d to pay farmers as little as possible. In the 1970s, a Ghanaian cocoa farmer often received less than 10 cents out of every dollar his beans earned on the commodities market; as a proportion of the retail price of a chocolate bar, his take was smaller still. Child labour was common. The chocolate companies prospered and their customers shopped well; the farmers stayed poor.</p> <p>Then, in the late 1980s, you began to hear more about these farmers, encountering their stories on television or in newspapers or even on the labels of the packages you bought. The reasons were manifold. Environmental awareness was on the rise. The prices of some commodities were crashing, placing agricultural incomes in even more acute peril than usual. There had already been small groups pushing for more equitable trade: \u201clittle do-good shops scattered in cities around Europe, selling products \u2026 bought at fair prices directly from small producers abroad\u201d, as one pioneer<strong> </strong>described it. By the early 1990s, these disparate initiatives began to coalesce into a larger international struggle to radically reform our relationship with what we bought. Trade had long been unfair by design, but now there was a growing movement to make consumers care about that unfairness, and even to help rectify it.</p> <p>The crown jewel of this movement was Fairtrade International, an umbrella body formed in 1997 out of various national chapters that had sprouted over the previous decade. Fairtrade was founded on the conviction that consumers could make the marketplace more moral. The spine of Fairtrade\u2019s philosophy has always been price: simple, clean, the kind of measure that economists like to deal with. If companies pay farmers equitably, Fairtrade believes, other benefits cascade out as well. Farmers can hire adult workers, rather than employing children; they can send their kids to school, and buy medicines; they can improve the yields of their farms by using better fertilisers. Producers must meet a number of standards to qualify for Fairtrade: rules about labour conditions, for instance, or waste disposal. But for companies, the core of their ethical responsibility towards their producers is defined by price.</p> <p>So Fairtrade works by forming a kind of \u201cvirtuous triangle\u201d of ethical business. It recruits farmers and farming cooperatives as members, asking them to meet its standards; periodically, Fairtrade sends inspectors to these farms around the world, ensuring they are still compliant. At another vertex of the triangle, Fairtrade enlists companies to pay a minimum price for commodities from these member farms if market prices plunge, and offers to certify products made from such ethically sourced commodities. The final corner is the customer, who can, with a little counsel, be galvanised to shop consciously, and to buy Fairtrade-certified products even if they cost a few pence more.</p> <p>The Fairtrade certification mark has become widely familiar: a green-blue-black logo, resembling a yin-and-yang with a tear in its middle, soothing the consciences of shoppers the world over. Roughly $9bn worth of Fairtrade products were sold in 2017, their raw material sourced from 1.66 million farmers. Around 2,400 companies, including multinational giants such as Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer, pay licence fees to their national Fairtrade chapters to use the mark on their products. Fairtrade has become<strong> </strong>a byword for ethical consumption; 93% of British shoppers now recognise its mark.</p> <p>But its two real triumphs are in the realm of ideas, not numbers. First, and most obviously, Fairtrade challenged the entrenched model of the commodities business \u2013 the belief that a farmer\u2019s lean income was just an unavoidable reality of trade economics. Second, somewhat more stealthily, it cemented the notion that the modern corporation would be ethical if only someone held up a lamp and showed it the way. Capitalism didn\u2019t have to be feared; the market would figure out its own checks and balances, through labelling agencies such as Fairtrade and Rainforest Alliance, without having to be regulated by any higher authority. Persistent and egregious inequality could be solved by deft pleats and tucks to the garb of trade, rather than by a full reconsideration of its fabric and seams.</p> <p>Now, though, Fairtrade\u2019s success in helping to build a world of heightened expectations of sustainability is perversely paving the way to its own demise. Companies are losing faith in labels such as Fairtrade \u2013 losing faith in their ability to secure the future of farming and the future of commodities that drive corporate profit, but also losing faith that these independent stamps of sustainability carry any value at all any more. Instead, the world\u2019s giant food multinationals are taking matters into their own hands \u2013 setting up their own in-house certification programmes, appraising their own ethics to their own satisfaction.</p> <p>Although the fate of Fairtrade is not necessarily the fate of fair trade, the former has kept the latter alive as an object of aspiration. A weakened Fairtrade portends the enfeebling of the very idea of fair trade. This poses a serious problem, because Fairtrade relies on companies to constitute one half of its virtuous bazaar. Without the buyers, the Fairtrade bazaar folds up, and companies return to their own devices, to pursue only what\u2019s best for themselves. Increasingly, companies are finding it easier and more expedient to produce their own certifications, said Trishna Shah, a Euromonitor analyst who tracks ethical labels: \u201cA big change is happening.\u201d</p> <p>What we\u2019re looking at, in short, is something like a corporate capture of fair trade \u2013 and it comes at a time when agriculture is already in crisis. The world\u2019s population expanded<strong> </strong>from about 4.4 billion in 1980 to more than 7 billion by 2011, but the proportion of people employed in agriculture <a href=\"http://www.worldwatch.org/asia-and-africa-home-95-percent-global-agricultural-population\" title=\"\">shrank</a> by 12%<strong>. </strong>Globally, the average age of a coffee farmer is 55. No one from a younger generation seems to want to grow crops any more. The work is difficult and, in the developing world, nearly always unrewarding. And the coming decades, with all the challenges of a changing climate \u2013 waves of heat, virulent pests, droughts and floods \u2013 appear grimmer still. The lives of farmers are already poised to get worse. A move towards unfairer trade will only push them back towards the exploited miseries of the past.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The single most damaging blow to Fairtrade came two summers ago, and it was delivered by Sainsbury\u2019s, which once proudly boasted that it was the world\u2019s largest retailer of Fairtrade products. In May 2017, without any warning, Sainsbury\u2019s broke the news that its own-brand teas would no longer be certified by Fairtrade.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a bombshell,\u201d Paul Tiony said. He had travelled to Nairobi that month, from his tea farm in Nandi Hills, in western Kenya, to take part in a half-day workshop run by Fairtrade Africa. Other tea farmers, from Malawi, Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda, were there as well, at the Pride Westlands hotel; so was a team from Sainsbury\u2019s. The company called a meeting at the end of the workshop, and Tiony grew excited. Sainsbury\u2019s must have some kind of good news, he thought. But after gathering almost 50 workshop participants in a conference room of the hotel, Sainsbury\u2019s revealed that its in-house tea brands were abandoning Fairtrade. Instead, an executive said, it was piloting its own ethical label \u2013 and calling it \u201cFairly Traded\u201d. Later, Fairtrade estimated that these changes would affect nearly 250,000 farmers and workers.</p> <p>Among these were the 8,000 members of Sireet, the tea-farming cooperative to which Tiony belongs. Sireet\u2019s produce is certified by Fairtrade, and Sainsbury\u2019s used to be, by far, the largest buyer of Sireet\u2019s Fairtrade tea. So Tiony was dumbstruck at the shock announcement. \u201cEven Fairtrade Africa officials didn\u2019t seem to know much about it,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey were asking: \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019\u201d Someone inquired: \u201cAre you moving out of Fairtrade because of Brexit?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6276e56fdc1512a992c0a69f1c74fb7092a7b51e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6276e56fdc1512a992c0a69f1c74fb7092a7b51e/0_0_4724_3465/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Human tea bags protest outside Sainsbury\u2019s AGM.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"733\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Human tea bags protest outside Sainsbury\u2019s AGM.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Aitchison / Oxfam</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sainsbury\u2019s had no real answers, Tiony said \u2013 but it seemed to be doubting that Fairtrade was working as promised. One Sainsbury\u2019s executive singled out one of the central principles of Fairtrade\u2019s model: the so-called \u201cpremium\u201d above the minimum price that companies must pay, and which cooperatives must use to build schools, or run clinics, or improve their communities in other ways. Sainsbury\u2019s was concerned that the premium was being poorly used, and that it was money wasted. \u201cBut just a few days earlier,\u201d Tiony said, \u201csomeone from Sainsbury\u2019s had come to look at all our projects.\u201d The farmers tried to argue with the executives; the executives insisted they weren\u2019t going to change their minds. \u201cThe meeting ended just like that.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> <p>The announcement kicked off an immediate storm. In <a href=\"https://www.fairtrade.org.uk/Media-Centre/News/May-2017/Open-letter-to-Sainsburys-from-Fairtrade-producers\" title=\"\">an open letter</a>, Fairtrade\u2019s tea producers in Africa accused Sainsbury\u2019s of seeking \u201cpower and control\u201d over farmers in a manner \u201creminiscent of colonial rule\u201d. A coalition of British non-profits urged consumers into a weekend of action under the rubric: \u201cDon\u2019t Ditch Fairtrade\u201d. Buy a pack of \u201cFairly Traded\u201d tea and then give it back, they suggested: \u201cLet the sales assistant know you are returning it because it\u2019s not Fairtrade.\u201d In Parliament, MPs pressed Sainsbury\u2019s to reconsider; one <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2018-10-18/debates/16FD6EF6-FEE8-4882-BAA3-D7CA61B9326C/EndingExploitationInSupermarketSupplyChains#contribution-CF1BA453-23A6-4901-A40F-446FADD0341D\" title=\"\">accused</a> the company of lying, and another complained to the Advertising Standards Authority that the name Fairly Traded would mislead shoppers who confused it for Fairtrade. (Sainsbury\u2019s declined to comment for this story. \u201cThe launch of Fairly Traded was a bit of a disaster,\u201d a former executive told me with a sigh.)</p> <p>The Fairly Traded experiment ignited fears of a full divorce, in which Sainsbury\u2019s would abandon the rest of its Fairtrade products \u2013 its coffee and sugar; its flowers; the <a href=\"https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/making-a-difference/our-values/our-stories/2017/a-decade-of-100-fairtrade-bananas\" title=\"\">650</a><a href=\"https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/making-a-difference/our-values/our-stories/2017/a-decade-of-100-fairtrade-bananas\" title=\"\">m bananas</a> it sells every year \u2013 and move out of the Fairtrade house altogether. That would, the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jun/24/fairtrade-crashing-down-sainsburys-tesco-tea-growers-nairobi\" title=\"\">wrote</a> at the time, bring Fairtrade \u201ccrashing down\u201d. So far, this hasn\u2019t happened, but Sainsbury\u2019s is still only a couple of years into its experiment with Fairly Traded. The divorce could still come.</p> <p>The departure of Sainsbury\u2019s wasn\u2019t a one-off. Around the world, the largest agribusiness companies are quitting independent certification, either because they think they can do sustainability better in-house, or because they see an opportunity to craft standards that fit their own purposes. Soon after Sainsbury\u2019s, the global confectionary giant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/mondelez\" title=\"\">Mondel\u0113z</a> \u2013 whose vast holdings include Cadbury and Toblerone \u2013 pulled several of its chocolate bars, including Dairy Milk, away from Fairtrade and into an in-house certification scheme called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/03/green-blacks-new-uk-chocolate-bar-not-organic-fairtrade\" title=\"\">Cocoa Life</a>\u201d. Nestl\u00e9 had launched a similar programme, \u201cCocoa Plan\u201d, back in 2013; between them, Nestl\u00e9 and Mondelez control roughly 40% of the British chocolate market. Starbucks has \u201cCAFE Practices\u201d; Barry Callebaut, the Swiss cocoa producer, has \u201cCocoa Horizons\u201d; US giant Cargill has \u201cCocoa Promise\u201d; McDonald\u2019s has its own \u201cMcCaf\u00e9 Sustainability Improvement Platform\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>All these firms still have a few products that are certified by third parties \u2013 by Fairtrade, or by other agencies such as Rainforest Alliance or UTZ. (The latter two merged in January 2018.) But the ratio is dwindling. The great energies of these corporations, said Trishna Shah, the Euromonitor analyst, are being lavished upon their own, bespoke schemes \u2013 each with its own little logo, its own definition of fairness, its own explanatory literature on a web page somewhere.</p> <p>For shoppers, this promises bewildering times ahead at the supermarket: more and more instances of what people in the industry call \u201clabel fatigue\u201d. The shelves already crawl with sustainability logos: <a href=\"http://www.ecolabelindex.com/ecolabels/\" title=\"\">more than 460</a> of them on food and beverage packages, and a third of them created over the last 15 years. There are little chromatic decals to testify that tuna is dolphin-friendly; that coffee is bird-friendly; that \u201cwild-collected natural ingredients\u201d are up to FairWild standards; that a slice of salmon is Salmon-Safe and follows Best Aquaculture Practices; that a bottle of wine is LIVE, which means that it fulfills Low Input Viticulture and Ecology benchmarks. One logo promises a carbon-free product, another a carbon-neutral one, and a third a carbon-reducing one. The more labels there are, the less we know about them \u2013 about what they stand for, and about how meaningful they are.</p> <p>In a crowd, there\u2019s room to hide. When Fairtrade began, labels were rare and precious things; when you bought a product with a label on it, you knew what you were getting. In contrast, a company today can launch its certification logo into the large ocean of labels, confident that most shoppers will not know what the logo guarantees, but that it will nonetheless salve their consciences. \u201cI think companies are hoping that label fatigue is an enduring trend,\u201d said Elizabeth Bennett, a political economist who co-edited the Handbook of Research on Fair Trade. \u201cThey\u2019re hoping that consumers are tired of learning what 30 different labels in one sector mean, and that we\u2019ll all just think: \u2018Any claim of sustainability is an improvement over no claim.\u2019\u201d This makes it easy for companies to resort to the ruse of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d \u2013 pretending to be ethical without really being anything of the sort.</p> <p>Several people in the corporate world offered an even more depressing version of this story: companies are sidling away from third-party certifiers because their optimistic project \u2013 the idea that the market can be heedful of its own abuses and correct itself \u2013 has, in a grand sense, failed. After decades of work, these certifiers have been unable to truly alter the imbalance in global trade; they have struggled to protect farmers, or to arm them for their various social, economic and environmental battles.</p> <p>The proof is in the dire projections for the future of farming, showing how <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/1180463/icode/\" title=\"\">vanishing</a> agricultural biodiversity, the <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/natural-resources-environment/climate-change/agriculture-and-climate-change/\" title=\"\">warming</a> climate and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/feb/04/global-food-security-old-age-timebomb\" title=\"\">ageing and impoverishment</a> of farmers are all endangering the world\u2019s crops \u2013 which means they are also endangering the supply chains of companies who rely upon farmers in Asia, Africa and Latin America to manufacture chocolate bars, coffee pods, or cotton T-shirts. By launching all these in-house programmes, companies are trying to take matters into their own hands \u2013 if only to secure their sources of commodities, and their bottom lines.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The Fairtrade movement was born in 1988, when a Dutch non-profit introduced the first certification for ethically traded coffee. The label was named Max Havelaar, after a seminal anti-colonial novel by the Dutch writer Eduard Dekker, published in 1860. In the novel, Dekker described how the Dutch in Indonesia, having made themselves \u201cmasters of the country\u201d, compelled the Javanese farmer to grow sugar and coffee, instead of rice for his family. The government \u201cpunishes him if he sells what he has produced to any purchaser but itself; and it fixes the price actually paid\u201d, Dekker wrote. \u201cAnd because the entire trade must produce profit, that profit cannot be got in any other way than by paying the Javanese just enough to keep him from starving.\u201d Naming the label after the novel was a blunt acknowledgement of the straight line connecting colonial exploitation to corporate exploitation. When the label launched, three Dutch coffee brands signed on to source their beans from a farmers\u2019 cooperative in Mexico, paying a rate above market price that was agreed to be fair. The following year, coffee prices crashed following a breakdown of trade talks: the cost of a pound of coffee on the commodities market fell to rates last seen in the 1930s. Coffee farmers faced ruin. The universe seemed to be emphasising the urgency of Max Havelaar\u2019s mission.</p> <p>The label was a swift success; within a year, 65% of Dutch consumers had heard of Max Havelaar, and the certified coffee found its way on to shelves at the biggest supermarkets. In tandem with the coffee crisis, Max Havelaar inspired other \u201calternative trade\u201d initiatives across Europe. In Britain, the Fairtrade Foundation was set up by NGOs and church groups in 1992. By 1997, the various national Fairtrade chapters were gathered into an umbrella body, now called Fairtrade International and headquartered in Bonn, Germany.</p> <p>In the voluminous literature on its website, Fairtrade sets out the prices it calculates to be \u201cfair\u201d. As of mid-July, the <a href=\"https://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/Fairtrade_Minimum_Price_and_Premium_Table_EN_PUBLIC.pdf\" title=\"\">minimum price</a> for a metric tonne of cocoa beans was $2,000; for an 18.14kg box of bananas from Cameroon, \u20ac6.40; for 1,000 fresh coconuts from the Windward Islands, $112. But Fairtrade doesn\u2019t stop with ensuring these minimum prices; it also demands that producers be paid an extra premium \u2013 $11 for the Windward Islands coconuts, for instance \u2013 and that these premiums be spent to benefit the community.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3346ccc89016683f50f4e559a8ba3d0acaceee0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3346ccc89016683f50f4e559a8ba3d0acaceee0a/0_0_2880_2020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fairtrade cocoa farmers in Ghana, Africa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"701\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fairtrade cocoa farmers in Ghana, Africa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fairtrade insists that producers make these investment decisions democratically, which means that farmers have to organise into collectives such as Sireet. There is an undeniable power in Fairtrade bringing these collectives to the negotiating table, said Pauline Tiffen, the editor of the Journal of Fair Trade. \u201cThe tea industry used to be so hierarchical until quite recently that it was like something out of Dickens,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd cocoa still felt like it was operating in the 18th century. Until 20 years ago, if you went to any big trade meetings on cocoa, you\u2019d see no women, no people of colour.\u201d</p> <p>The debate over whether Fairtrade\u2019s systems truly transform the lives of farmers has raged for nearly all of Fairtrade\u2019s lifetime. Its numbers, in relative terms, are still puny. The 1.66 million farmers in the Fairtrade network form a speck within the 2 billion or so people who make their living from agriculture. The sale value of Fairtrade\u2019s products may add up to $9bn, but the global market for coffee alone <a href=\"http://clac-comerciojusto.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SMALLHOLDER-COFFEE-FARMERS-ARE-MOURNING.pdf\" title=\"\">is worth $200bn</a>.</p> <p>A more dramatic sign of Fairtrade\u2019s struggles is that it can\u2019t sell, on its terms, all the volumes of commodities it certifies. In 2016, of all the coffee grown as Fairtrade, only 34% of it could be sold at the minimum price. There were no takers for the rest; farmers had to unload the surplus into the standard \u201cunfair\u201d market, at the lower prices that the market determined. For cocoa, the rate is a bit better, 47%. For tea, it\u2019s much worse, only 4.7 %. There are tonnes of harvest for which Fairtrade fails to find any fair-minded buyers at all.</p> <p>Even the benefits that Fairtrade promises to deliver to farmers have been called into question. In 2014, Fairtrade entered into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/may/24/fairtrade-accused-of-failing-africas-poor\" title=\"\">public squabble</a> with a team from Soas University of London, which had examined how well Fairtrade did in shrinking poverty in Ethiopia and Uganda. The study, funded by the British government, found that schoolchildren had worked on Fairtrade-certified farms. The researchers compared wages on Fairtrade-certified tea and coffee estates \u2013 always owned by smallholders, in keeping with Fairtrade\u2019s belief in championing the small farmer \u2013 with wages on larger, uncertified plantations. Workers on the Fairtrade estates were paid less and often laboured in worse conditions, they concluded. Fairtrade called these \u201cdistorted comparisons\u201d and rejected the researchers\u2019 conclusions.</p> <p>In Kenya, the tea farmers of Sireet have experienced some of the frustrations of Fairtrade, but also the sudden precariousness of life without it. The cooperative came together 14 years ago, when 6,230 farmers raised money to buy nearly 1,000 hectares of land to cultivate their tea. Sireet has been a Fairtrade producer from the very beginning, its chairman, Wilson Tuwei, told me. Sireet\u2019s farmers worked hard to meet Fairtrade\u2019s rules and standards, he said, but even so, the cooperative was never able to sell more than 13% of its harvest at Fairtrade rates.</p> <p>Even that feels like a bonanza, though, compared to what has happened over the last two years. After Sainsbury\u2019s stopped its purchases, Sireet\u2019s sales of Fairtrade tea plummeted. \u201cLast year, we were at not even 1%,\u201d Tuwei said. Sireet\u2019s careful plans started to go up in smoke. \u201cWe\u2019ve stopped most of the projects we were funding with the Fairtrade premium. There were dispensaries. We were paying school fees for some children. There were irrigation projects. They\u2019ve all become white elephants now. It has really affected us.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The rupture between Sainsbury\u2019s and Fairtrade over tea has become the most prominent case of a large company concluding that Fairtrade wasn\u2019t quite cutting it any more. The details of that rupture convey why Sainsbury\u2019s was dissatisfied with Fairtrade, but also why replacement corporate schemes such as Fairly Traded feel flimsy or stifling to those meant to benefit from them.</p> <p>Two people who have worked with Sainsbury\u2019s told me that the company had been unhappy with Fairtrade for years. When I spoke to these anonymous sources in April, both sounded exasperated at the way Sainsbury\u2019s had handled its exit, but they made the case that its reasons were sound. \u201cWe were paying these premiums, but it wasn\u2019t clear where the money was going. Fairtrade isn\u2019t good at keeping tabs on it,\u201d one of them said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t always going to medicines and schools and things like that, as we found through our own investigations.\u201d</p> <p>Other Fairtrade partners had raised this as well, she added. \u201cWe wanted more data \u2026 Instead, there was just a systemic inefficiency.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s, as a corporation, was constantly pressured to be transparent, she said. \u201cBut it turned out that Fairtrade wasn\u2019t quite as transparent. That was frustrating.\u201d The other Sainsbury\u2019s source confirmed this. \u201cIf you wanted to find out what a cooperative had done with a whole wad of Fairtrade premiums, or what the impact of that had been over the years, nobody could tell you. Or you\u2019d get some anecdotal stuff.\u201d</p> <p>A Fairtrade spokesperson told me, in response to these claims, that the organisation wanted farmers to spend their premiums the way they wished, setting their own goals and monitoring their own progress. She added that, since April, Fairtrade has \u201cstrengthened the requirements on Fairtrade premium use, management, and reporting, in order to promote best practices and increase transparency\u201d. Now, if a cooperative\u2019s annual premiums exceed $150,000, it must hire an external auditor to inspect the way it accounts for the money.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a7573f2db4f915019d06484f3effcd36673df40e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7573f2db4f915019d06484f3effcd36673df40e/0_301_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"UK supermarket with Fairtrade bananas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK supermarket with Fairtrade bananas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Spencer/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even as Sainsbury\u2019s was stewing over the premiums it was paying out, the second Sainsbury\u2019s source told me, it had begun to \u201crain down with standards\u201d over the past decade. Companies and non-profits introduced a fleet of new labels and certifications, their names all seeming to blend hazily into each other. Pasture for Life. New Forest Marque. Food Made Good. Soil Association. Free Range Dairy Pasture Promise. LEAF Marque. \u201cThen Fairtrade starts to look just like a sliver of the pie \u2013 an expensive and not very satisfactory one,\u201d said the source. \u201cAnd Sainsbury\u2019s thinks: \u2018I\u2019m sure we can do this ourselves, I\u2019m sure we know what needs to be delivered.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Fairtrade didn\u2019t think so. Under Fairly Traded, farmer collectives no longer receive their premiums directly, or decide how to spend this money. Instead, they must work on \u201caction plans\u201d and convince a Sainsbury\u2019s board of experts in London to release their funds. In their <a href=\"https://www.fairtrade.org.uk/Media-Centre/News/May-2017/Open-letter-to-Sainsburys-from-Fairtrade-producers\" title=\"\">open letter</a>, Fairtrade\u2019s tea producers protested that the company was characterising these premiums as \u201cdonor money\u201d rather than earnings that rightfully belonged to the farmers. Fairtrade <a href=\"https://www.fairtrade.org.uk/Media-Centre/Blog/2017/May/FAQs-about-Sainsburys-Foundation-and-Fairtrade\" title=\"\">called the board</a> \u201ca further layer of bureaucracy controlled by a group far removed from day-to-day life in Africa\u201d.</p> <p>It feels like a paradox: that, in a moment when sustainability and ethics are more important than ever, corporations want to desert an agency such as Fairtrade, the most famous certifying entity in the field. Companies are under pressure \u2013 from customers, governments, banks and investors \u2013 to prove their sustainability credentials. Signatories to the UN\u2019s Principles of Responsible Investment now manage around $89tn in assets. The network of Sustainable Stock Exchanges \u2013 more than 80 bourses around the world \u2013 guide and sometimes even require listed companies to report on their sustainability.</p> <p>In a way, this dialled-up consciousness explains why companies are searching for alternatives to independent labelling systems, said Fredrik Galtung, who runs TrueFootprint, a firm that analyses data to tell businesses if their various sustainability projects make any sort of impact. He detects, in the industries he works with, a hardnosed sense that unsustainable practices will result in economic risk. So he isn\u2019t surprised that companies, finding Fairtrade insufficient at tackling that risk, are rushing to erect their own standards. \u201cIf Fairtrade producers could show that their farmers were 10 or 20 years younger on average, that would be something. If they could show they\u2019re more climate-resistant, that would be a massive advantage. But we\u2019re unable to see all this.\u201d</p> <p>Fairtrade denies that its future is dim, or that a schism has appeared between itself and the companies with which it aims to work. In his discussions of these issues, Dario Soto Abril, who has been the CEO of Fairtrade International since 2016, is a model of genial tact. He\u2019s in an unenviable position. He must keep his relations with corporations warm; Sainsbury\u2019s still retails plenty of Fairtrade-labelled products, for example, and Mondel\u0113z uses Fairtrade\u2019s skills to track payments and commodities up and down the supply chain. At the same time, Soto must project his conviction that it is best for everyone concerned \u2013 shoppers, farmers, but especially companies \u2013 if they all commit fully to Fairtrade.</p> <p>Agriculture has never been under more stress, Soto said. The world is so densely connected now that a tremor in one part of a supply chain sets off instant price fluctuations elsewhere. Corporate power is consolidating. Just three giants \u2013 Barry Callebaut, Cargill and Olam \u2013 control 60% of the world\u2019s cocoa-processing business, for example; this gives them enormous leverage over the prices they pay to producers. \u201cCocoa farmers still live in poverty,\u201d Soto said. \u201cBanana farmers find that there are hidden costs of production that their sales are not covering.\u201d</p> <p>The effects of climate change alone are \u201cso accelerated\u201d, Soto said, \u201cthat we think if nothing of significance is done by 2050, at least half the land under coffee production now will be lost, one way or another.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, the UN released a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/17/un-report-shows-climate-change-effect-on-farming.html\" title=\"\">map of the world</a> predicting where yields were likely to drop or rise before 2050. In West Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia, which have been plantation-farmed by colonists and then corporations, harvests will shrink. In North America and Europe, which have already cornered the profits of centuries of agribusiness, harvests will expand. The map is iniquity compounded upon iniquity.</p> <p>Soto insists Fairtrade is flourishing: \u201cOur credibility remains high. We get new partners all the time.\u201d Sales of Fairtrade-certified products have swelled year on year around the world, partly as a result of companies exploring new markets. On the other hand, farmers are entering Fairtrade at a slowing pace. Between 2015 and 2016, Fairtrade managed to bring 3,199 new workers into its network; the previous year, it recruited 9,955.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that Fairtrade can\u2019t solve everything,\u201d Soto said. \u201cWe\u2019re here trying to solve challenges as old as humanity. We need more committed partners. We need more innovative ideas.\u201d But Soto is also forgiving of companies that have chosen to set up schemes to certify themselves. \u201cI think companies are looking to test something new,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cWe need to allow for that. I will never doubt that companies will do the best they can.\u201d</p> <p>For the chief executive of an organisation founded on the premise that companies need to be cajoled or nagged into paying farmers a living income, this sounded like an astonishingly trusting statement. Soto\u2019s most barbed opinion concerned farmer premiums and the larger issue of involving producers in decision-making. \u201cI\u2019m with you when you say that these companies aren\u2019t giving farmers a seat at the table,\u201d Soto told me. \u201cYou have to allow farmers a say in the income generated by sales. They have to own their premiums. That was our biggest suggestion to Sainsbury\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>Last October, the Fairtrade Foundation in the UK <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/fairtrade-sustainability-strategy/fairtrade-ready-to-help-food-firms-move-to-self-certification-idUSL8N1WQ5EJ\" title=\"\">acknowledged</a> that, in the new era of self-certification, its function had to evolve. Since companies are setting up their own sustainability schemes, said Lord Mark Price, who chairs the Foundation\u2019s board of trustees, \u201cthe role of Fairtrade is to help those organisations be the best they can be\u201d. Fairtrade will still operate its certification programme; the yin-yang logo will still be seen on products. But for Fairtrade to climb into the role of a consultancy \u2013 a supplier of guidance, rather than an umpire enforcing a line for companies to toe \u2013 is the most conclusive evidence yet of the transformation under way. And it raises two questions. How will companies behave if they have to testify only to their own code of ethical sourcing? And in what shape will that leave the future of agriculture?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>If the animating principle of Fairtrade is \u201cprice,\u201d that of most corporate in-house programmes is \u201cyield\u201d. These programmes may differ in other details. Some are just two years old; others were established more than a decade ago. Some pay their farmers Fairtrade-like minimum prices; others do not. But they are united by their unwavering focus on yield \u2013 on squeezing more produce out of a hectare of land. They consider it the best way to protect and grow their supplies of coffee or tea or cocoa, and thus the best way to save agriculture.</p> <p>The investments are massive. Starbucks has sunk $100m into CAFE Practices, a programme started in 2004 to source sustainably grown coffee. Roughly 99% of Starbucks coffee now falls under this programme, said Michelle Burns, a senior vice president who heads global coffee and tea for the company. Mondel\u0113z will have spent $400m on Cocoa Life, its sustainable cocoa scheme, by 2022. Nearly half of all Mondel\u0113z cocoa is already sourced under this scheme, said Christine McGrath, who heads global impact and sustainability for the $80bn snack giant; she expects that number to have scaled to the full 100% by 2025. Both companies claimed they found existing third-party certifiers inadequate. \u201cThere were no programmes we could find that had an emphasis on quality,\u201d Burns said. \u201cNothing that was comprehensive enough.\u201d</p> <p>In my conversations with Starbucks and Mondel\u0113z, farmer welfare rarely came up. The tacit assumption seemed to be that if the companies help farmers improve their productivity, their lives will improve in tandem. Starbucks doesn\u2019t set a minimum price, or pay a premium for every tonne of coffee it purchases, the way Fairtrade would have it do. Instead, it pays \u201cstrategic premiums\u201d for preferred producers. As a result, last September, when coffee prices fell more than 20% to around $1 a pound, Starbucks had to inject a one-time $20m subsidy to its farmers in Central America.</p> <p>Mondel\u0113z also does not set a minimum price. It pays \u201cloyalty premiums\u201d to the farmer collectives with which it chooses to work, and Cathy Pieters, director of Mondel\u0113z\u2019s Cocoa Life programme, said it was up to them to decide what kind of \u201caction plans\u201d can be funded with the money. She added, though, that Mondel\u0113z commissions large NGOs to work with these cooperatives in determining and crafting these action plans. Once again, as with Sainsbury\u2019s and its Fairly Traded programme, the premiums intended to benefit farmers aren\u2019t quite wholly theirs to spend as they see fit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"388512330a32c243bd2fb42691311eb31876f19b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/388512330a32c243bd2fb42691311eb31876f19b/0_183_3720_2232/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fairtrade tea producers in Malawi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fairtrade tea producers in Malawi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Terry/Fairtrade</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fairtrade is half-owned by its producer cooperatives, so its standards and metrics are decided in large part by the representatives of farmers. The standards of Cocoa Life, CAFE Practices and other schemes aren\u2019t like that; they are written by the companies themselves, in the companies\u2019 own best interests. No independent third party certifies their success or failure in meeting these standards and publishes those results. Companies reporting on their own sustainability frequently fail \u201cto prioritise planet over profit\u201d, Hans Hoogervorst, who heads the International Accounting Standards Board, said in a speech in April. \u201cGreenwashing is rampant.\u201d</p> <p>Industries are increasingly left to audit themselves, in part because governments have shredded their budgets in the name of austerity. From Volkswagen to Boeing, we don\u2019t have to look very hard for evidence that companies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/22/dirty-lies-how-the-car-industry-hid-the-truth-about-diesel-emissions\" title=\"\">fib and cheat</a> when they get to mark their own homework. Bringing sustainability certification in-house is unlikely to empower farmers, or to renovate the structure of trade. \u201cBut it\u2019s simplistic to say that companies will act in ways that are injurious to farmers,\u201d said Fredrik Galtung of TrueFootprint, the sustainability analysts. In his view, the crises in agriculture are so stark that companies are motivated to protect farms and farm workers \u2013 if only to secure their own future profits. But TrueFootprint\u2019s scorecards indicate that most companies only report their spending on sustainability; almost none of them investigate the impact of these schemes on farmers or on natural resources like air and water. Galtung described it as \u201cjust being happy to check off boxes\u201d.</p> <p>Economists like to examine incentives, and to deduce behaviour from them. If the incentives of these companies are misaligned with those of their producers, it\u2019s only a matter of time before they produce conflict and rupture. Companies perceive Fairtrade to be rigid, and say that keeping sustainability programmes in-house gives them \u201cflexibility\u201d. That word is really standing in, though, for \u201ccontrol\u201d: control over how commodities are priced, how to select or discard producers, how farmers farm, even how they live. This may look, for firms and even for consumers, like efficiency, but the effects can be dysfunctional. When four firms \u2013 Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus \u2013 control between 70% and 90% of the global grain trade, they can bulldoze governments into clearing forested land for crops, crowd out smallholder farmers and push more and more processed grains into our diets. Many of the failings of global agriculture are not the result of multinational companies having too little control; they are the result of companies having too much.</p> <p>That lesson is available to students of the past as well. After the publication of Max Havelaar shocked the public, in 1901 the Dutch government formulated a new ethical policy \u2013 one that would treat Indonesia as a moral responsibility rather than simply as a territory to be exploited. Millions of guilders had flowed from these islands into the Dutch treasury \u2013 187m between 1867 and 1878 alone \u2013 and so the government committed to spending 30m guilders over the first decade on the welfare of the Indies\u2019 farmers. Not surprisingly, they received agricultural credit and irrigation canals, because the Dutch corporations were avid for better yields. They also gained more schools and more roads; they were not, however, encouraged to industrialise, because this would have inflated the cost of local labour and led to competition with Dutch businesses.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/20/tomatoes-italy-mafia-migrant-labour-modern-slavery\">Are your tinned tomatoes picked by slave labour?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Dutch ethical policy came undone as soon as the colonist\u2019s aims started to clash with those of the colony. The harvests improved, but not enough to warrant the investment. The Great Depression set in, and the government thinned down its expenditures even as Indonesian farmers slid into debt. Educating the populace began to seem like a mistake; there was no work for young Indonesian men who had attended university, and they inevitably drifted into the nationalist movement. By 1940, the government had ceased to fund the welfare projects.</p> <p>An unnamed administrator, who had once supported the ethical policy, watched with disappointment as the meagre progress unravelled and said: \u201cAs soon as we withdraw our hands, everything sinks back into the marsh.\u201d But what the Dutch didn\u2019t recognise was that they were the ones who made it impossible for the Indonesians to rise from the marsh in the first place.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 July 2019. An earlier version said that Fairtrade enlists companies to pay a minimum price, which is always set above market price. In fact, the Fairtrade minimum price is charged only when market prices drop below a pre-determined level. Sainsbury\u2019s pulled its own-brand teas out of Fairtrade, rather than ceasing to sell any Fairtrade-certified teas; companies buying Fairtrade must meet other standards in addition to price; and the minimum price for bananas from Cameroon is \u20ac6.40 per 18.14kg box, not per 1kg.

      "bodyText": "It wasn\u2019t very long ago that a banana was just a banana \u2013 just a curved, yellow fruit. All you knew, if you bought a bunch in 1986, was that they cost around 97p per kilo. You weren\u2019t told if they were organic or pesticide-free. You didn\u2019t know if they came from Costa Rica or the Dominican Republic. And you certainly weren\u2019t invited to worry about the farmers who grew them \u2013 or if their children went to school, or whether their villages had clinics. You just picked up your bananas and walked to the next aisle for your coffee or tea or chocolate, none the wiser about where they came from either, or about the people who farmed them. Back then, the countries that grew these commodities and many others were still known as the Third World, and the habit of not caring about their farming conditions was a legacy of their colonial past. For centuries, trade propelled the colonial project, and exploitation was its very purpose. The farmers of Asia, Africa and South America were forced to raise the crops that the empire\u2019s companies wanted, to work the crops in abject conditions, and to part with them at ruinously low prices. In the last century, the empires melted away but the trade remained lopsided \u2013 with the imbalance now rationalised by the market, which deemed it \u201cefficient\u201d to pay farmers as little as possible. In the 1970s, a Ghanaian cocoa farmer often received less than 10 cents out of every dollar his beans earned on the commodities market; as a proportion of the retail price of a chocolate bar, his take was smaller still. Child labour was common. The chocolate companies prospered and their customers shopped well; the farmers stayed poor. Then, in the late 1980s, you began to hear more about these farmers, encountering their stories on television or in newspapers or even on the labels of the packages you bought. The reasons were manifold. Environmental awareness was on the rise. The prices of some commodities were crashing, placing agricultural incomes in even more acute peril than usual. There had already been small groups pushing for more equitable trade: \u201clittle do-good shops scattered in cities around Europe, selling products \u2026 bought at fair prices directly from small producers abroad\u201d, as one pioneer described it. By the early 1990s, these disparate initiatives began to coalesce into a larger international struggle to radically reform our relationship with what we bought. Trade had long been unfair by design, but now there was a growing movement to make consumers care about that unfairness, and even to help rectify it. The crown jewel of this movement was Fairtrade International, an umbrella body formed in 1997 out of various national chapters that had sprouted over the previous decade. Fairtrade was founded on the conviction that consumers could make the marketplace more moral. The spine of Fairtrade\u2019s philosophy has always been price: simple, clean, the kind of measure that economists like to deal with. If companies pay farmers equitably, Fairtrade believes, other benefits cascade out as well. Farmers can hire adult workers, rather than employing children; they can send their kids to school, and buy medicines; they can improve the yields of their farms by using better fertilisers. Producers must meet a number of standards to qualify for Fairtrade: rules about labour conditions, for instance, or waste disposal. But for companies, the core of their ethical responsibility towards their producers is defined by price. So Fairtrade works by forming a kind of \u201cvirtuous triangle\u201d of ethical business. It recruits farmers and farming cooperatives as members, asking them to meet its standards; periodically, Fairtrade sends inspectors to these farms around the world, ensuring they are still compliant. At another vertex of the triangle, Fairtrade enlists companies to pay a minimum price for commodities from these member farms if market prices plunge, and offers to certify products made from such ethically sourced commodities. The final corner is the customer, who can, with a little counsel, be galvanised to shop consciously, and to buy Fairtrade-certified products even if they cost a few pence more. The Fairtrade certification mark has become widely familiar: a green-blue-black logo, resembling a yin-and-yang with a tear in its middle, soothing the consciences of shoppers the world over. Roughly $9bn worth of Fairtrade products were sold in 2017, their raw material sourced from 1.66 million farmers. Around 2,400 companies, including multinational giants such as Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer, pay licence fees to their national Fairtrade chapters to use the mark on their products. Fairtrade has become a byword for ethical consumption; 93% of British shoppers now recognise its mark. But its two real triumphs are in the realm of ideas, not numbers. First, and most obviously, Fairtrade challenged the entrenched model of the commodities business \u2013 the belief that a farmer\u2019s lean income was just an unavoidable reality of trade economics. Second, somewhat more stealthily, it cemented the notion that the modern corporation would be ethical if only someone held up a lamp and showed it the way. Capitalism didn\u2019t have to be feared; the market would figure out its own checks and balances, through labelling agencies such as Fairtrade and Rainforest Alliance, without having to be regulated by any higher authority. Persistent and egregious inequality could be solved by deft pleats and tucks to the garb of trade, rather than by a full reconsideration of its fabric and seams. Now, though, Fairtrade\u2019s success in helping to build a world of heightened expectations of sustainability is perversely paving the way to its own demise. Companies are losing faith in labels such as Fairtrade \u2013 losing faith in their ability to secure the future of farming and the future of commodities that drive corporate profit, but also losing faith that these independent stamps of sustainability carry any value at all any more. Instead, the world\u2019s giant food multinationals are taking matters into their own hands \u2013 setting up their own in-house certification programmes, appraising their own ethics to their own satisfaction. Although the fate of Fairtrade is not necessarily the fate of fair trade, the former has kept the latter alive as an object of aspiration. A weakened Fairtrade portends the enfeebling of the very idea of fair trade. This poses a serious problem, because Fairtrade relies on companies to constitute one half of its virtuous bazaar. Without the buyers, the Fairtrade bazaar folds up, and companies return to their own devices, to pursue only what\u2019s best for themselves. Increasingly, companies are finding it easier and more expedient to produce their own certifications, said Trishna Shah, a Euromonitor analyst who tracks ethical labels: \u201cA big change is happening.\u201d What we\u2019re looking at, in short, is something like a corporate capture of fair trade \u2013 and it comes at a time when agriculture is already in crisis. The world\u2019s population expanded from about 4.4 billion in 1980 to more than 7 billion by 2011, but the proportion of people employed in agriculture shrank by 12%. Globally, the average age of a coffee farmer is 55. No one from a younger generation seems to want to grow crops any more. The work is difficult and, in the developing world, nearly always unrewarding. And the coming decades, with all the challenges of a changing climate \u2013 waves of heat, virulent pests, droughts and floods \u2013 appear grimmer still. The lives of farmers are already poised to get worse. A move towards unfairer trade will only push them back towards the exploited miseries of the past. * * * The single most damaging blow to Fairtrade came two summers ago, and it was delivered by Sainsbury\u2019s, which once proudly boasted that it was the world\u2019s largest retailer of Fairtrade products. In May 2017, without any warning, Sainsbury\u2019s broke the news that its own-brand teas would no longer be certified by Fairtrade. \u201cIt was a bombshell,\u201d Paul Tiony said. He had travelled to Nairobi that month, from his tea farm in Nandi Hills, in western Kenya, to take part in a half-day workshop run by Fairtrade Africa. Other tea farmers, from Malawi, Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda, were there as well, at the Pride Westlands hotel; so was a team from Sainsbury\u2019s. The company called a meeting at the end of the workshop, and Tiony grew excited. Sainsbury\u2019s must have some kind of good news, he thought. But after gathering almost 50 workshop participants in a conference room of the hotel, Sainsbury\u2019s revealed that its in-house tea brands were abandoning Fairtrade. Instead, an executive said, it was piloting its own ethical label \u2013 and calling it \u201cFairly Traded\u201d. Later, Fairtrade estimated that these changes would affect nearly 250,000 farmers and workers. Among these were the 8,000 members of Sireet, the tea-farming cooperative to which Tiony belongs. Sireet\u2019s produce is certified by Fairtrade, and Sainsbury\u2019s used to be, by far, the largest buyer of Sireet\u2019s Fairtrade tea. So Tiony was dumbstruck at the shock announcement. \u201cEven Fairtrade Africa officials didn\u2019t seem to know much about it,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey were asking: \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019\u201d Someone inquired: \u201cAre you moving out of Fairtrade because of Brexit?\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s had no real answers, Tiony said \u2013 but it seemed to be doubting that Fairtrade was working as promised. One Sainsbury\u2019s executive singled out one of the central principles of Fairtrade\u2019s model: the so-called \u201cpremium\u201d above the minimum price that companies must pay, and which cooperatives must use to build schools, or run clinics, or improve their communities in other ways. Sainsbury\u2019s was concerned that the premium was being poorly used, and that it was money wasted. \u201cBut just a few days earlier,\u201d Tiony said, \u201csomeone from Sainsbury\u2019s had come to look at all our projects.\u201d The farmers tried to argue with the executives; the executives insisted they weren\u2019t going to change their minds. \u201cThe meeting ended just like that.\u201d The announcement kicked off an immediate storm. In an open letter, Fairtrade\u2019s tea producers in Africa accused Sainsbury\u2019s of seeking \u201cpower and control\u201d over farmers in a manner \u201creminiscent of colonial rule\u201d. A coalition of British non-profits urged consumers into a weekend of action under the rubric: \u201cDon\u2019t Ditch Fairtrade\u201d. Buy a pack of \u201cFairly Traded\u201d tea and then give it back, they suggested: \u201cLet the sales assistant know you are returning it because it\u2019s not Fairtrade.\u201d In Parliament, MPs pressed Sainsbury\u2019s to reconsider; one accused the company of lying, and another complained to the Advertising Standards Authority that the name Fairly Traded would mislead shoppers who confused it for Fairtrade. (Sainsbury\u2019s declined to comment for this story. \u201cThe launch of Fairly Traded was a bit of a disaster,\u201d a former executive told me with a sigh.) The Fairly Traded experiment ignited fears of a full divorce, in which Sainsbury\u2019s would abandon the rest of its Fairtrade products \u2013 its coffee and sugar; its flowers; the 650m bananas it sells every year \u2013 and move out of the Fairtrade house altogether. That would, the Guardian wrote at the time, bring Fairtrade \u201ccrashing down\u201d. So far, this hasn\u2019t happened, but Sainsbury\u2019s is still only a couple of years into its experiment with Fairly Traded. The divorce could still come. The departure of Sainsbury\u2019s wasn\u2019t a one-off. Around the world, the largest agribusiness companies are quitting independent certification, either because they think they can do sustainability better in-house, or because they see an opportunity to craft standards that fit their own purposes. Soon after Sainsbury\u2019s, the global confectionary giant Mondel\u0113z \u2013 whose vast holdings include Cadbury and Toblerone \u2013 pulled several of its chocolate bars, including Dairy Milk, away from Fairtrade and into an in-house certification scheme called \u201cCocoa Life\u201d. Nestl\u00e9 had launched a similar programme, \u201cCocoa Plan\u201d, back in 2013; between them, Nestl\u00e9 and Mondelez control roughly 40% of the British chocolate market. Starbucks has \u201cCAFE Practices\u201d; Barry Callebaut, the Swiss cocoa producer, has \u201cCocoa Horizons\u201d; US giant Cargill has \u201cCocoa Promise\u201d; McDonald\u2019s has its own \u201cMcCaf\u00e9 Sustainability Improvement Platform\u201d. All these firms still have a few products that are certified by third parties \u2013 by Fairtrade, or by other agencies such as Rainforest Alliance or UTZ. (The latter two merged in January 2018.) But the ratio is dwindling. The great energies of these corporations, said Trishna Shah, the Euromonitor analyst, are being lavished upon their own, bespoke schemes \u2013 each with its own little logo, its own definition of fairness, its own explanatory literature on a web page somewhere. For shoppers, this promises bewildering times ahead at the supermarket: more and more instances of what people in the industry call \u201clabel fatigue\u201d. The shelves already crawl with sustainability logos: more than 460 of them on food and beverage packages, and a third of them created over the last 15 years. There are little chromatic decals to testify that tuna is dolphin-friendly; that coffee is bird-friendly; that \u201cwild-collected natural ingredients\u201d are up to FairWild standards; that a slice of salmon is Salmon-Safe and follows Best Aquaculture Practices; that a bottle of wine is LIVE, which means that it fulfills Low Input Viticulture and Ecology benchmarks. One logo promises a carbon-free product, another a carbon-neutral one, and a third a carbon-reducing one. The more labels there are, the less we know about them \u2013 about what they stand for, and about how meaningful they are. In a crowd, there\u2019s room to hide. When Fairtrade began, labels were rare and precious things; when you bought a product with a label on it, you knew what you were getting. In contrast, a company today can launch its certification logo into the large ocean of labels, confident that most shoppers will not know what the logo guarantees, but that it will nonetheless salve their consciences. \u201cI think companies are hoping that label fatigue is an enduring trend,\u201d said Elizabeth Bennett, a political economist who co-edited the Handbook of Research on Fair Trade. \u201cThey\u2019re hoping that consumers are tired of learning what 30 different labels in one sector mean, and that we\u2019ll all just think: \u2018Any claim of sustainability is an improvement over no claim.\u2019\u201d This makes it easy for companies to resort to the ruse of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d \u2013 pretending to be ethical without really being anything of the sort. Several people in the corporate world offered an even more depressing version of this story: companies are sidling away from third-party certifiers because their optimistic project \u2013 the idea that the market can be heedful of its own abuses and correct itself \u2013 has, in a grand sense, failed. After decades of work, these certifiers have been unable to truly alter the imbalance in global trade; they have struggled to protect farmers, or to arm them for their various social, economic and environmental battles. The proof is in the dire projections for the future of farming, showing how vanishing agricultural biodiversity, the warming climate and the ageing and impoverishment of farmers are all endangering the world\u2019s crops \u2013 which means they are also endangering the supply chains of companies who rely upon farmers in Asia, Africa and Latin America to manufacture chocolate bars, coffee pods, or cotton T-shirts. By launching all these in-house programmes, companies are trying to take matters into their own hands \u2013 if only to secure their sources of commodities, and their bottom lines. * * * The Fairtrade movement was born in 1988, when a Dutch non-profit introduced the first certification for ethically traded coffee. The label was named Max Havelaar, after a seminal anti-colonial novel by the Dutch writer Eduard Dekker, published in 1860. In the novel, Dekker described how the Dutch in Indonesia, having made themselves \u201cmasters of the country\u201d, compelled the Javanese farmer to grow sugar and coffee, instead of rice for his family. The government \u201cpunishes him if he sells what he has produced to any purchaser but itself; and it fixes the price actually paid\u201d, Dekker wrote. \u201cAnd because the entire trade must produce profit, that profit cannot be got in any other way than by paying the Javanese just enough to keep him from starving.\u201d Naming the label after the novel was a blunt acknowledgement of the straight line connecting colonial exploitation to corporate exploitation. When the label launched, three Dutch coffee brands signed on to source their beans from a farmers\u2019 cooperative in Mexico, paying a rate above market price that was agreed to be fair. The following year, coffee prices crashed following a breakdown of trade talks: the cost of a pound of coffee on the commodities market fell to rates last seen in the 1930s. Coffee farmers faced ruin. The universe seemed to be emphasising the urgency of Max Havelaar\u2019s mission. The label was a swift success; within a year, 65% of Dutch consumers had heard of Max Havelaar, and the certified coffee found its way on to shelves at the biggest supermarkets. In tandem with the coffee crisis, Max Havelaar inspired other \u201calternative trade\u201d initiatives across Europe. In Britain, the Fairtrade Foundation was set up by NGOs and church groups in 1992. By 1997, the various national Fairtrade chapters were gathered into an umbrella body, now called Fairtrade International and headquartered in Bonn, Germany. In the voluminous literature on its website, Fairtrade sets out the prices it calculates to be \u201cfair\u201d. As of mid-July, the minimum price for a metric tonne of cocoa beans was $2,000; for an 18.14kg box of bananas from Cameroon, \u20ac6.40; for 1,000 fresh coconuts from the Windward Islands, $112. But Fairtrade doesn\u2019t stop with ensuring these minimum prices; it also demands that producers be paid an extra premium \u2013 $11 for the Windward Islands coconuts, for instance \u2013 and that these premiums be spent to benefit the community. Fairtrade insists that producers make these investment decisions democratically, which means that farmers have to organise into collectives such as Sireet. There is an undeniable power in Fairtrade bringing these collectives to the negotiating table, said Pauline Tiffen, the editor of the Journal of Fair Trade. \u201cThe tea industry used to be so hierarchical until quite recently that it was like something out of Dickens,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd cocoa still felt like it was operating in the 18th century. Until 20 years ago, if you went to any big trade meetings on cocoa, you\u2019d see no women, no people of colour.\u201d The debate over whether Fairtrade\u2019s systems truly transform the lives of farmers has raged for nearly all of Fairtrade\u2019s lifetime. Its numbers, in relative terms, are still puny. The 1.66 million farmers in the Fairtrade network form a speck within the 2 billion or so people who make their living from agriculture. The sale value of Fairtrade\u2019s products may add up to $9bn, but the global market for coffee alone is worth $200bn. A more dramatic sign of Fairtrade\u2019s struggles is that it can\u2019t sell, on its terms, all the volumes of commodities it certifies. In 2016, of all the coffee grown as Fairtrade, only 34% of it could be sold at the minimum price. There were no takers for the rest; farmers had to unload the surplus into the standard \u201cunfair\u201d market, at the lower prices that the market determined. For cocoa, the rate is a bit better, 47%. For tea, it\u2019s much worse, only 4.7 %. There are tonnes of harvest for which Fairtrade fails to find any fair-minded buyers at all. Even the benefits that Fairtrade promises to deliver to farmers have been called into question. In 2014, Fairtrade entered into a public squabble with a team from Soas University of London, which had examined how well Fairtrade did in shrinking poverty in Ethiopia and Uganda. The study, funded by the British government, found that schoolchildren had worked on Fairtrade-certified farms. The researchers compared wages on Fairtrade-certified tea and coffee estates \u2013 always owned by smallholders, in keeping with Fairtrade\u2019s belief in championing the small farmer \u2013 with wages on larger, uncertified plantations. Workers on the Fairtrade estates were paid less and often laboured in worse conditions, they concluded. Fairtrade called these \u201cdistorted comparisons\u201d and rejected the researchers\u2019 conclusions. In Kenya, the tea farmers of Sireet have experienced some of the frustrations of Fairtrade, but also the sudden precariousness of life without it. The cooperative came together 14 years ago, when 6,230 farmers raised money to buy nearly 1,000 hectares of land to cultivate their tea. Sireet has been a Fairtrade producer from the very beginning, its chairman, Wilson Tuwei, told me. Sireet\u2019s farmers worked hard to meet Fairtrade\u2019s rules and standards, he said, but even so, the cooperative was never able to sell more than 13% of its harvest at Fairtrade rates. Even that feels like a bonanza, though, compared to what has happened over the last two years. After Sainsbury\u2019s stopped its purchases, Sireet\u2019s sales of Fairtrade tea plummeted. \u201cLast year, we were at not even 1%,\u201d Tuwei said. Sireet\u2019s careful plans started to go up in smoke. \u201cWe\u2019ve stopped most of the projects we were funding with the Fairtrade premium. There were dispensaries. We were paying school fees for some children. There were irrigation projects. They\u2019ve all become white elephants now. It has really affected us.\u201d * * * The rupture between Sainsbury\u2019s and Fairtrade over tea has become the most prominent case of a large company concluding that Fairtrade wasn\u2019t quite cutting it any more. The details of that rupture convey why Sainsbury\u2019s was dissatisfied with Fairtrade, but also why replacement corporate schemes such as Fairly Traded feel flimsy or stifling to those meant to benefit from them. Two people who have worked with Sainsbury\u2019s told me that the company had been unhappy with Fairtrade for years. When I spoke to these anonymous sources in April, both sounded exasperated at the way Sainsbury\u2019s had handled its exit, but they made the case that its reasons were sound. \u201cWe were paying these premiums, but it wasn\u2019t clear where the money was going. Fairtrade isn\u2019t good at keeping tabs on it,\u201d one of them said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t always going to medicines and schools and things like that, as we found through our own investigations.\u201d Other Fairtrade partners had raised this as well, she added. \u201cWe wanted more data \u2026 Instead, there was just a systemic inefficiency.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s, as a corporation, was constantly pressured to be transparent, she said. \u201cBut it turned out that Fairtrade wasn\u2019t quite as transparent. That was frustrating.\u201d The other Sainsbury\u2019s source confirmed this. \u201cIf you wanted to find out what a cooperative had done with a whole wad of Fairtrade premiums, or what the impact of that had been over the years, nobody could tell you. Or you\u2019d get some anecdotal stuff.\u201d A Fairtrade spokesperson told me, in response to these claims, that the organisation wanted farmers to spend their premiums the way they wished, setting their own goals and monitoring their own progress. She added that, since April, Fairtrade has \u201cstrengthened the requirements on Fairtrade premium use, management, and reporting, in order to promote best practices and increase transparency\u201d. Now, if a cooperative\u2019s annual premiums exceed $150,000, it must hire an external auditor to inspect the way it accounts for the money. Even as Sainsbury\u2019s was stewing over the premiums it was paying out, the second Sainsbury\u2019s source told me, it had begun to \u201crain down with standards\u201d over the past decade. Companies and non-profits introduced a fleet of new labels and certifications, their names all seeming to blend hazily into each other. Pasture for Life. New Forest Marque. Food Made Good. Soil Association. Free Range Dairy Pasture Promise. LEAF Marque. \u201cThen Fairtrade starts to look just like a sliver of the pie \u2013 an expensive and not very satisfactory one,\u201d said the source. \u201cAnd Sainsbury\u2019s thinks: \u2018I\u2019m sure we can do this ourselves, I\u2019m sure we know what needs to be delivered.\u2019\u201d Fairtrade didn\u2019t think so. Under Fairly Traded, farmer collectives no longer receive their premiums directly, or decide how to spend this money. Instead, they must work on \u201caction plans\u201d and convince a Sainsbury\u2019s board of experts in London to release their funds. In their open letter, Fairtrade\u2019s tea producers protested that the company was characterising these premiums as \u201cdonor money\u201d rather than earnings that rightfully belonged to the farmers. Fairtrade called the board \u201ca further layer of bureaucracy controlled by a group far removed from day-to-day life in Africa\u201d. It feels like a paradox: that, in a moment when sustainability and ethics are more important than ever, corporations want to desert an agency such as Fairtrade, the most famous certifying entity in the field. Companies are under pressure \u2013 from customers, governments, banks and investors \u2013 to prove their sustainability credentials. Signatories to the UN\u2019s Principles of Responsible Investment now manage around $89tn in assets. The network of Sustainable Stock Exchanges \u2013 more than 80 bourses around the world \u2013 guide and sometimes even require listed companies to report on their sustainability. In a way, this dialled-up consciousness explains why companies are searching for alternatives to independent labelling systems, said Fredrik Galtung, who runs TrueFootprint, a firm that analyses data to tell businesses if their various sustainability projects make any sort of impact. He detects, in the industries he works with, a hardnosed sense that unsustainable practices will result in economic risk. So he isn\u2019t surprised that companies, finding Fairtrade insufficient at tackling that risk, are rushing to erect their own standards. \u201cIf Fairtrade producers could show that their farmers were 10 or 20 years younger on average, that would be something. If they could show they\u2019re more climate-resistant, that would be a massive advantage. But we\u2019re unable to see all this.\u201d Fairtrade denies that its future is dim, or that a schism has appeared between itself and the companies with which it aims to work. In his discussions of these issues, Dario Soto Abril, who has been the CEO of Fairtrade International since 2016, is a model of genial tact. He\u2019s in an unenviable position. He must keep his relations with corporations warm; Sainsbury\u2019s still retails plenty of Fairtrade-labelled products, for example, and Mondel\u0113z uses Fairtrade\u2019s skills to track payments and commodities up and down the supply chain. At the same time, Soto must project his conviction that it is best for everyone concerned \u2013 shoppers, farmers, but especially companies \u2013 if they all commit fully to Fairtrade. Agriculture has never been under more stress, Soto said. The world is so densely connected now that a tremor in one part of a supply chain sets off instant price fluctuations elsewhere. Corporate power is consolidating. Just three giants \u2013 Barry Callebaut, Cargill and Olam \u2013 control 60% of the world\u2019s cocoa-processing business, for example; this gives them enormous leverage over the prices they pay to producers. \u201cCocoa farmers still live in poverty,\u201d Soto said. \u201cBanana farmers find that there are hidden costs of production that their sales are not covering.\u201d The effects of climate change alone are \u201cso accelerated\u201d, Soto said, \u201cthat we think if nothing of significance is done by 2050, at least half the land under coffee production now will be lost, one way or another.\u201d Last year, the UN released a map of the world predicting where yields were likely to drop or rise before 2050. In West Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia, which have been plantation-farmed by colonists and then corporations, harvests will shrink. In North America and Europe, which have already cornered the profits of centuries of agribusiness, harvests will expand. The map is iniquity compounded upon iniquity. Soto insists Fairtrade is flourishing: \u201cOur credibility remains high. We get new partners all the time.\u201d Sales of Fairtrade-certified products have swelled year on year around the world, partly as a result of companies exploring new markets. On the other hand, farmers are entering Fairtrade at a slowing pace. Between 2015 and 2016, Fairtrade managed to bring 3,199 new workers into its network; the previous year, it recruited 9,955. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that Fairtrade can\u2019t solve everything,\u201d Soto said. \u201cWe\u2019re here trying to solve challenges as old as humanity. We need more committed partners. We need more innovative ideas.\u201d But Soto is also forgiving of companies that have chosen to set up schemes to certify themselves. \u201cI think companies are looking to test something new,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cWe need to allow for that. I will never doubt that companies will do the best they can.\u201d For the chief executive of an organisation founded on the premise that companies need to be cajoled or nagged into paying farmers a living income, this sounded like an astonishingly trusting statement. Soto\u2019s most barbed opinion concerned farmer premiums and the larger issue of involving producers in decision-making. \u201cI\u2019m with you when you say that these companies aren\u2019t giving farmers a seat at the table,\u201d Soto told me. \u201cYou have to allow farmers a say in the income generated by sales. They have to own their premiums. That was our biggest suggestion to Sainsbury\u2019s.\u201d Last October, the Fairtrade Foundation in the UK acknowledged that, in the new era of self-certification, its function had to evolve. Since companies are setting up their own sustainability schemes, said Lord Mark Price, who chairs the Foundation\u2019s board of trustees, \u201cthe role of Fairtrade is to help those organisations be the best they can be\u201d. Fairtrade will still operate its certification programme; the yin-yang logo will still be seen on products. But for Fairtrade to climb into the role of a consultancy \u2013 a supplier of guidance, rather than an umpire enforcing a line for companies to toe \u2013 is the most conclusive evidence yet of the transformation under way. And it raises two questions. How will companies behave if they have to testify only to their own code of ethical sourcing? And in what shape will that leave the future of agriculture? * * * If the animating principle of Fairtrade is \u201cprice,\u201d that of most corporate in-house programmes is \u201cyield\u201d. These programmes may differ in other details. Some are just two years old; others were established more than a decade ago. Some pay their farmers Fairtrade-like minimum prices; others do not. But they are united by their unwavering focus on yield \u2013 on squeezing more produce out of a hectare of land. They consider it the best way to protect and grow their supplies of coffee or tea or cocoa, and thus the best way to save agriculture. The investments are massive. Starbucks has sunk $100m into CAFE Practices, a programme started in 2004 to source sustainably grown coffee. Roughly 99% of Starbucks coffee now falls under this programme, said Michelle Burns, a senior vice president who heads global coffee and tea for the company. Mondel\u0113z will have spent $400m on Cocoa Life, its sustainable cocoa scheme, by 2022. Nearly half of all Mondel\u0113z cocoa is already sourced under this scheme, said Christine McGrath, who heads global impact and sustainability for the $80bn snack giant; she expects that number to have scaled to the full 100% by 2025. Both companies claimed they found existing third-party certifiers inadequate. \u201cThere were no programmes we could find that had an emphasis on quality,\u201d Burns said. \u201cNothing that was comprehensive enough.\u201d In my conversations with Starbucks and Mondel\u0113z, farmer welfare rarely came up. The tacit assumption seemed to be that if the companies help farmers improve their productivity, their lives will improve in tandem. Starbucks doesn\u2019t set a minimum price, or pay a premium for every tonne of coffee it purchases, the way Fairtrade would have it do. Instead, it pays \u201cstrategic premiums\u201d for preferred producers. As a result, last September, when coffee prices fell more than 20% to around $1 a pound, Starbucks had to inject a one-time $20m subsidy to its farmers in Central America. Mondel\u0113z also does not set a minimum price. It pays \u201cloyalty premiums\u201d to the farmer collectives with which it chooses to work, and Cathy Pieters, director of Mondel\u0113z\u2019s Cocoa Life programme, said it was up to them to decide what kind of \u201caction plans\u201d can be funded with the money. She added, though, that Mondel\u0113z commissions large NGOs to work with these cooperatives in determining and crafting these action plans. Once again, as with Sainsbury\u2019s and its Fairly Traded programme, the premiums intended to benefit farmers aren\u2019t quite wholly theirs to spend as they see fit. Fairtrade is half-owned by its producer cooperatives, so its standards and metrics are decided in large part by the representatives of farmers. The standards of Cocoa Life, CAFE Practices and other schemes aren\u2019t like that; they are written by the companies themselves, in the companies\u2019 own best interests. No independent third party certifies their success or failure in meeting these standards and publishes those results. Companies reporting on their own sustainability frequently fail \u201cto prioritise planet over profit\u201d, Hans Hoogervorst, who heads the International Accounting Standards Board, said in a speech in April. \u201cGreenwashing is rampant.\u201d Industries are increasingly left to audit themselves, in part because governments have shredded their budgets in the name of austerity. From Volkswagen to Boeing, we don\u2019t have to look very hard for evidence that companies fib and cheat when they get to mark their own homework. Bringing sustainability certification in-house is unlikely to empower farmers, or to renovate the structure of trade. \u201cBut it\u2019s simplistic to say that companies will act in ways that are injurious to farmers,\u201d said Fredrik Galtung of TrueFootprint, the sustainability analysts. In his view, the crises in agriculture are so stark that companies are motivated to protect farms and farm workers \u2013 if only to secure their own future profits. But TrueFootprint\u2019s scorecards indicate that most companies only report their spending on sustainability; almost none of them investigate the impact of these schemes on farmers or on natural resources like air and water. Galtung described it as \u201cjust being happy to check off boxes\u201d. Economists like to examine incentives, and to deduce behaviour from them. If the incentives of these companies are misaligned with those of their producers, it\u2019s only a matter of time before they produce conflict and rupture. Companies perceive Fairtrade to be rigid, and say that keeping sustainability programmes in-house gives them \u201cflexibility\u201d. That word is really standing in, though, for \u201ccontrol\u201d: control over how commodities are priced, how to select or discard producers, how farmers farm, even how they live. This may look, for firms and even for consumers, like efficiency, but the effects can be dysfunctional. When four firms \u2013 Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus \u2013 control between 70% and 90% of the global grain trade, they can bulldoze governments into clearing forested land for crops, crowd out smallholder farmers and push more and more processed grains into our diets. Many of the failings of global agriculture are not the result of multinational companies having too little control; they are the result of companies having too much. That lesson is available to students of the past as well. After the publication of Max Havelaar shocked the public, in 1901 the Dutch government formulated a new ethical policy \u2013 one that would treat Indonesia as a moral responsibility rather than simply as a territory to be exploited. Millions of guilders had flowed from these islands into the Dutch treasury \u2013 187m between 1867 and 1878 alone \u2013 and so the government committed to spending 30m guilders over the first decade on the welfare of the Indies\u2019 farmers. Not surprisingly, they received agricultural credit and irrigation canals, because the Dutch corporations were avid for better yields. They also gained more schools and more roads; they were not, however, encouraged to industrialise, because this would have inflated the cost of local labour and led to competition with Dutch businesses. The Dutch ethical policy came undone as soon as the colonist\u2019s aims started to clash with those of the colony. The harvests improved, but not enough to warrant the investment. The Great Depression set in, and the government thinned down its expenditures even as Indonesian farmers slid into debt. Educating the populace began to seem like a mistake; there was no work for young Indonesian men who had attended university, and they inevitably drifted into the nationalist movement. By 1940, the government had ceased to fund the welfare projects. An unnamed administrator, who had once supported the ethical policy, watched with disappointment as the meagre progress unravelled and said: \u201cAs soon as we withdraw our hands, everything sinks back into the marsh.\u201d But what the Dutch didn\u2019t recognise was that they were the ones who made it impossible for the Indonesians to rise from the marsh in the first place. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 July 2019. An earlier version said that Fairtrade enlists companies to pay a minimum price, which is always set above market price. In fact, the Fairtrade minimum price is charged only when market prices drop below a pre-determined level. Sainsbury\u2019s pulled its own-brand teas out of Fairtrade, rather than ceasing to sell any Fairtrade-certified teas; companies buying Fairtrade must meet other standards in addition to price; and the minimum price for bananas from Cameroon is \u20ac6.40 per 18.14kg box, not per 1kg. These have been corrected. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

The council had already committed an additional \u00a34.8m a year for children\u2019s services, recognising past under-investment, but now put about the same again into a short-term \u201cimprovement pot\u201d and set up an improvement oversight board chaired by Sir Alan Wood, who had revamped services in neighbouring Hackney. \u201cWe stripped everything \u2013 and I mean everything \u2013 back to basics,\u201d says Jones. \u201cI had an exceptionally good interim team: they were experts, they were rottweilers, they were experienced in work with other authorities that had been on the naughty step.\u201d The council\u2019s existing child protection model was ditched in favour of the acclaimed Leeds model of early engagement with families in crisis. Many existing staff left: at one stage of the transformation process, temporary agency workers were filling 78% of public-facing roles. Use of agency staff is now greatly reduced, if not eliminated, and the workforce is much more settled. Turnover of social workers fell from 33% in June last year to below 9% this May \u2013 about half the London-wide rate \u2013 and Ofsted found morale high. \u201cStaff want to work in Tower Hamlets and many agency staff are converting to permanent contracts,\u201d it reports. This, Jones points out, includes the entire emergency duty team. What now? With the pot of improvement money coming to an end later this year, Jones \u2013 who shows no sign of slowing down despite being at an age when most of her peers are enjoying the fruits of their careers in retirement \u2013 is starting the process of negotiating what she calls a \u201crealistic\u201d budget for 2020-21. This will need to account for the borough\u2019s booming population, up an estimated 19% since the 2011 census when it was counted as 69% minority ethnic, for its high poverty rate and for spiralling demand for special needs and disability support. Jones reports the latter up 45% by spending in four years and calls it \u201cthe big one\u201d in her budget projections. She will also be budgeting for the costs of dealing with teenagers caught up in gang culture and knife crime, sometimes needing to move them or their families out of the area. Together with so-called jihadi brides and misreported fostering controversies, it\u2019s an issue that has put Tower Hamlets regularly in the news. \u201cWe\u2019re always on the front pages, often for things we don\u2019t want to be but increasingly for the good stuff,\u201d says Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s an iconic borough. It gets under your skin.\u201d She still shows all the appetite for the job, and the ideas and energy of someone decades younger. Jones says: \u201cBeing a director of children\u2019s services has always been the love of my life.\u201d Curriculum vitae Age: 69.

Over the weekend, a hundred people came out to Seattle\u2019s Town Hall to present a nonstop 24-hour stage reading of the Russia investigation\u2019s findings, just days before Mueller\u2019s own highly anticipated appearances at congressional hearings. In front of hundreds of audience membersin a hall decorated with American flags, the readers took turns reading out the 448-page report. There was the occasional flurry of laughter when an especially repetitive series of redactions were read out loud, but the event unfolded exactly as it was intended \u2013 as a serious affair. \u201cIt\u2019s not entertainment; it\u2019s not Saturday Night Live; people need to read this,\u201d said Brian Faker, a local producer who, along with playwright Carl Sander and actor Sarah Harlett, organized the event. \u201cThis is a report about a country that is not dead, and the only way to keep it alive is to kind of keep track of how things are going and read this report.\u201d Faker said he felt the reading represented a response to a \u201csystematic effort to ignore or misrepresent\u201d the report\u2019s findings.

The deal marks a major victory for the Grenfell community which, more than two years after the disaster that claimed 72 lives, has suffered a series of setbacks, including delays to the public inquiry and police investigation, and a painful rehousing process, in which some families are wrestling with serious problems with their new homes. \u201cThe Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea\u2019s culture of disrespect that lay behind the ill treatment of Grenfell residents can also be evidenced by their purchase of the Wornington college freehold in 2016,\u201d Daffarn said. \u201cThe announcement of the government\u2019s intention to safeguard the future of the college is to be welcomed. Many generations of North Kensington residents have had their lives transformed through studying at Wornington and it is a fitting legacy of Grenfell that this is now set to continue.\u201d An independent report into the sale of the Wornington campus by its owner Kensington and Chelsea college (KCC) to RBKC found that a senior RBKC official was brought on to the board of the KCC, giving \u201cthe opportunity for his role to be perceived as not independent\u201d. It found both sides had the same property advisers, Lambert Smith Hampton, that there was a lack of consultation with the local community and \u201cshortcomings in determining the final sale price\u201d. James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, said: \u201cIt is essential that two years after the Grenfell Tower tragedy, the people of North Kensington continue to get the support they deserve to help them rebuild their lives. This includes access to good quality further education and training at the heart of the community.\u201d Cllr Kim Taylor-Smith, the deputy leader of Kensington and Chelsea council, said: \u201cWe are listening to the views of the community and we hope to continue demonstrating that this council has changed. We have been working closely with Kensington and Chelsea college, the Department for Education, the Save Wornington campaign and all groups to identify the best way to secure a thriving future for the college on the site. The college is so important to our community and this is welcome investment. We are committed to continuing to work with everyone to make this happen.\u201d",

The number of freeway shootings has increased on nearly every major highway in the region, law enforcement officials say, from San Jose to Silicon Valley, Oakland and San Francisco.</p> \n<p>The Bay Area has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/jun/03/gun-violence-bay-area-drop-30-percent-why-investigation\">a sharp decline in gun </a>homicides in the past decade, even as inequality and poverty have been on the rise, but highways are one of the few areas where gun violence is up.</p> \n<p>Bay Area law enforcement and elected officials do not have an iron-clad explanation of why freeways have become a more common venue for gun violence, but they point to a series of factors, including gang conflicts and the displacement of longtime residents from cities like Oakland, where the average cost of rent has exceeded many working-class families\u2019 budgets.</p> \n<p>Gun violence has become \u201cmore transitory and regional\u201d in recent years, said Mary Knox, the deputy district attorney for Contra Costa county, much like the lives of people who have been displaced from the Bay Area\u2019s gentrifying urban core to far-flung suburbs and now rely on highways to get around.</p> \n<p>Law enforcement has responded to the new threats to highway safety with the \u201cFreeway Security Network\u201d \u2013 a surveillance system complete with ShotSpotter microphones and high-resolution cameras.

But she said the increased number of highway shootings beginning in roughly 2014 was something she\u2019d never seen before.</p> \n<p>The US is a country of highways and other cities have had similar upticks. Chicago highways have seen more than 40 shootings since 2016 and Memphis witnessed over 30 of them just this year. Illinois authorities say many of the shootings in Chicago are gang-related, while officials in Memphis point to road rage as the cause of most of these incidents.</p> \n<p>In the Bay Area,<strong> </strong>the shootings occur day and night, with some of the deadliest incidents taking place during rush hour. Most of them aren\u2019t fatal, but between 2015 and 2019 at least 88 people have sustained serious injuries. As with most other homicides in the area, the victims are disproportionately black and Latino. Law enforcement have made 35 arrests over the same time period.</p> \n<p>The shootings have been most concentrated on East Bay routes connecting the cities of Oakland and Richmond to suburbs in Contra Costa and Solano counties. These include the Interstate 80, a colossal eight-lane traffic artery linking San Francisco and Oakland to the state capital Sacramento. Upward of 290,000 cars drive along some stretches of the I-80 each day, according to the state department of transportation. State Route 4, another frequent venue of highway shootings, winds through the East Bay hills connecting cities like Bay Point, Pittsburg and Antioch.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--immersive\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2019/06/bay-highway-shootings-map\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It was in Antioch that one of the more shocking highway gunfights had its start. According to Antioch police records, Jonathan Thomas and Dwayne Anderson were cruising the streets of the city on 15 May 2016, looking for another man, Kawan Hardy.</p> \n<p>They<strong> </strong>found Hardy along with several other men playing dice in the parking lot of a Quik Stop gas station and allegedly opened fire on the group with an AK-47 rifle. Somehow, no one was hit.</p> \n<p>Hardy escaped on foot, but two of the other men he was with, Karmani Ely and Jainagil Moore, fled in a small Saturn car on to Highway 4. Thomas and Anderson pursued them in a Jaguar SUV and quickly caught up to the slower, older vehicle. The two cars swerved in and out of traffic at high speed when, according to several witnesses who were driving the road that day, Thomas stood out of the sunroof of the speeding Jaguar with the AK-47 at his hip. He fired round after round at the fleeing Saturn across several lanes of traffic. From the window of the Saturn, Moore fired back with a pistol.</p> \n<p>The roving gun battle lasted several minutes, coming to a halt when the Jaguar got a flat tire.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/12/chicago-gun-violence-racial-inequality-segregation-activism\">Chicago's deadly summer: guns, gangs and the legacy of racial inequality</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Police arrested Thomas and Anderson shortly after.

The term is controversial among some violence interrupters and community activists, who worry that the label paints complex generational connections with a broad brush.</p> \n<p>The economic and demographic forces that have transformed the Bay Area over the past decade have altered the dynamics of gun violence as well, including how gang violence plays out on the region\u2019s streets, said Patrick Wentz, a captain with the Pittsburg police department. Now, a shooting in Richmond might be followed by a retaliatory shooting 35 miles away in Antioch.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese are displaced Richmond gang members,\u201d Knox said, referring to some of the fatal freeway shootings in recent years on the Highway 4 and I-80.</p> \n<p><strong>Sign up to get emails about this series, Guns and Lies in America</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" data-alt=\"Email signup\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/guns-and-lies-in-america\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guns and Lies in America\u201d data-form-description=\" get email updates on our investigation\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Wentz noted the economic development of the area. In the early 2000s, developers<strong> </strong>built thousands of new homes in east Contra Costa county cities, selling them at prices far below similar homes in San Francisco and Oakland<strong>. </strong>Many of these homes were sold to low-income buyers who borrowed from banks through subprime mortgages. When the economic crash hit in 2008, tens of thousands of people lost their homes to foreclosure and investors bought and transformed them into rental properties. Since then, many low-income people displaced from gentrifying cities like Oakland and Richmond have moved out to east Contra Costa county because of the surplus of cheaper rental homes.</p> \n<p>\u201cWith the displacement and gentrification of a lot of East Bay cities, and cities like San Francisco, Oakland and Richmond, it\u2019s creating this diaspora that\u2019s being spread to the valleys up [Interstate] 80 and Highway 4,\u201d said the Richmond city council member Demnlus Johnson.</p> \n<p>Violent social networks that were previously rooted in small, geographically bound places have spread across multiple East Bay cities. \u201cYou\u2019ve got people from North Richmond and Central Richmond both living in the El Pueblo projects in Pittsburg, and then you\u2019ve got people in Richmond living in the vistas in Vallejo,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhen all of those people get on the freeway to come back to Richmond they\u2019re gonna see each other.\u201d</p> \n<p>Knox said some of the freeway shooting cases she has prosecuted have uncovered evidence of gang members specifically talking about finding rivals on freeways and attempting to kill them there instead of on city surface streets where there could be more witnesses. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard gang members hunting each other, following each other up on to the freeways to \u2018do the dirt\u2019,\u201d explained Knox.</p> \n<p>The Contra Costa county district attorney has sought to add gang enhancements on to each of the freeway shooting cases summarized in this story. The enhancements allow up to 10 years to a defendant\u2019s sentence when applied to violent felony cases.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Line break\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Line break</a> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5f7ce38ad7cf83aa833bbfbe9e3215cb4e9e7188\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f7ce38ad7cf83aa833bbfbe9e3215cb4e9e7188/0_196_5679_3408/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Pittsburg police captain Patrick Wentz and the deputy district attorney for Contra Costa county Mary Knox monitor the Freeway Security Network command center, a system used to track down suspects in freeway shootings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Pittsburg police captain, Patrick Wentz, and the deputy district attorney for Contra Costa county, Mary Knox, monitor the Freeway Security Network command center, a system used to track down suspects in freeway shootings.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Hussin/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Shane Reiss witnessed</strong> one of these targeted, gang-related shootings in early 2016.

An on-duty Concord police officer arrived and they cuffed the man. Two other men still in the Altima were also arrested.

Authorities believe they targeted Alvarro Navarro because he is a rival gang member of the Little Town Sure\u00f1os.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is very common for gang members to work in concert in a case like this,\u201d the Concord detective Mike Kindorf wrote in a report about the shooting. \u201cIt is not uncommon in a drive by shooting for someone to drive and someone to be the shooter, which I believe based on the facts of this case to be what occurred.\u201d</p> \n<h2>A surveillance network</h2> \n<p>Law enforcement\u2019s main response to the new threats to highway safety is the \u201cFreeway Security Network\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Network was launched in 2014, and includes an array of ShotSpotter microphones that have been calibrated to detect the sound of gunshots on long stretches of highways in Contra Costa county. When the microphones pick up the sound of gunfire they automatically trigger surveillance cameras that pivot and focus on the source of gunfire.</p> \n<p>The videos feed into a surveillance center in the Pittsburg police department, where a wall of monitors displays live scenes from I-80 and Highway 4. A large monitor with a \u201clive earth\u201d interface includes everything from global wind patterns to local roadway accidents.</p> \n<p>The Freeway Security Network\u2019s task force commander and members receive alerts whenever the system detects a gunshot, and the team can access live video and other surveillance information from their cellphones.Perhaps the most powerful feature of the surveillance center is the array of automatic license plate reader (LPR) cameras that scan the license plates of virtually every vehicle traveling the highways.</p> \n<p>Wentz said the LPR allows police to track down possible witnesses, aids to identify cars involved in shootings and helps the police to preserve evidence.

      "bodyText": "Demarcus Doss and his girlfriend, Joanna Oller, were stuck in rush-hour traffic on the Interstate 80 highway in Richmond, California, when the dark gray Dodge Charger that had been ominously following them pulled into the exit lane alongside their minivan. A man was leaning waist-deep out of the back driver\u2019s side window, a black semi-automatic pistol in hand. Boxed in on all sides by bumper-to-bumper traffic, there was little Doss could do to avoid the barrage of gunfire. As bullets ripped through the passenger door and window, Doss reached over to shield Oller from the attack. He was hit by multiple bullets and died from his injuries. Oller suffered a gunshot wound to her hand, but survived the ordeal. This brazen afternoon killing in March 2017 was one of 189 freeway shootings that took place in the San Francisco Bay Area between November 2015, when the California highway patrol began keeping track, and April 2019. The number of freeway shootings has increased on nearly every major highway in the region, law enforcement officials say, from San Jose to Silicon Valley, Oakland and San Francisco. The Bay Area has seen a sharp decline in gun homicides in the past decade, even as inequality and poverty have been on the rise, but highways are one of the few areas where gun violence is up. Bay Area law enforcement and elected officials do not have an iron-clad explanation of why freeways have become a more common venue for gun violence, but they point to a series of factors, including gang conflicts and the displacement of longtime residents from cities like Oakland, where the average cost of rent has exceeded many working-class families\u2019 budgets. Gun violence has become \u201cmore transitory and regional\u201d in recent years, said Mary Knox, the deputy district attorney for Contra Costa county, much like the lives of people who have been displaced from the Bay Area\u2019s gentrifying urban core to far-flung suburbs and now rely on highways to get around. Law enforcement has responded to the new threats to highway safety with the \u201cFreeway Security Network\u201d \u2013 a surveillance system complete with ShotSpotter microphones and high-resolution cameras. Community members, violence interrupters and some local officials argue, however, that the surveillance efforts may help clear cases, but do little to prevent them. \u2018Never seen before\u2019 Over the past 30 years, Knox has prosecuted hundreds of felony assault and murder cases in east Contra Costa county, an area encompassing a string of suburbs and cities that have rapidly grown over the past two decades. But she said the increased number of highway shootings beginning in roughly 2014 was something she\u2019d never seen before. The US is a country of highways and other cities have had similar upticks. Chicago highways have seen more than 40 shootings since 2016 and Memphis witnessed over 30 of them just this year. Illinois authorities say many of the shootings in Chicago are gang-related, while officials in Memphis point to road rage as the cause of most of these incidents. In the Bay Area, the shootings occur day and night, with some of the deadliest incidents taking place during rush hour. Most of them aren\u2019t fatal, but between 2015 and 2019 at least 88 people have sustained serious injuries. As with most other homicides in the area, the victims are disproportionately black and Latino. Law enforcement have made 35 arrests over the same time period. The shootings have been most concentrated on East Bay routes connecting the cities of Oakland and Richmond to suburbs in Contra Costa and Solano counties. These include the Interstate 80, a colossal eight-lane traffic artery linking San Francisco and Oakland to the state capital Sacramento. Upward of 290,000 cars drive along some stretches of the I-80 each day, according to the state department of transportation. State Route 4, another frequent venue of highway shootings, winds through the East Bay hills connecting cities like Bay Point, Pittsburg and Antioch. It was in Antioch that one of the more shocking highway gunfights had its start. According to Antioch police records, Jonathan Thomas and Dwayne Anderson were cruising the streets of the city on 15 May 2016, looking for another man, Kawan Hardy. They found Hardy along with several other men playing dice in the parking lot of a Quik Stop gas station and allegedly opened fire on the group with an AK-47 rifle. Somehow, no one was hit. Hardy escaped on foot, but two of the other men he was with, Karmani Ely and Jainagil Moore, fled in a small Saturn car on to Highway 4. Thomas and Anderson pursued them in a Jaguar SUV and quickly caught up to the slower, older vehicle. The two cars swerved in and out of traffic at high speed when, according to several witnesses who were driving the road that day, Thomas stood out of the sunroof of the speeding Jaguar with the AK-47 at his hip. He fired round after round at the fleeing Saturn across several lanes of traffic. From the window of the Saturn, Moore fired back with a pistol. The roving gun battle lasted several minutes, coming to a halt when the Jaguar got a flat tire. Police arrested Thomas and Anderson shortly after. They were charged with attempted murder. Police declined to comment on the case, because the proceedings are ongoing. But according to court records, the alleged shooters are affiliated with Antioch\u2019s Broad Day Killers gang, and they may have been motivated to retaliate against other alleged gang members for a previous shooting in a complex and ongoing feud. Law enforcement officials, including Knox, say gang activities are behind many of the highway shootings in the Bay. \u201cHistorically, gang violence would stay in neighborhoods. It was geographically insular,\u201d said Knox. Under California\u2019s Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act, a gang is a \u201congoing organization, association, or group of three or more persons \u2026 who have a common identifying sign, symbol, or name, and whose members individually or collectively engage in or have engaged in a pattern of definable criminal activity\u201d. However, much like in other cities across the US, \u201cgangs\u201d in the Bay Area rarely resemble infamous groups like the Crips, Bloods or MS-13, but are often small groups tied together by where members live, whether a single block or a multi-unit apartment complex. Police and district attorneys across the region sometimes refer to these groups as \u201cnon-traditional gangs\u201d, because they have some of the standard characteristics of a gang, like a unifying symbol or name, but lack a clear power structure. The term is controversial among some violence interrupters and community activists, who worry that the label paints complex generational connections with a broad brush. The economic and demographic forces that have transformed the Bay Area over the past decade have altered the dynamics of gun violence as well, including how gang violence plays out on the region\u2019s streets, said Patrick Wentz, a captain with the Pittsburg police department. Now, a shooting in Richmond might be followed by a retaliatory shooting 35 miles away in Antioch. \u201cThese are displaced Richmond gang members,\u201d Knox said, referring to some of the fatal freeway shootings in recent years on the Highway 4 and I-80. Sign up to get emails about this series, Guns and Lies in America Wentz noted the economic development of the area. In the early 2000s, developers built thousands of new homes in east Contra Costa county cities, selling them at prices far below similar homes in San Francisco and Oakland. Many of these homes were sold to low-income buyers who borrowed from banks through subprime mortgages. When the economic crash hit in 2008, tens of thousands of people lost their homes to foreclosure and investors bought and transformed them into rental properties. Since then, many low-income people displaced from gentrifying cities like Oakland and Richmond have moved out to east Contra Costa county because of the surplus of cheaper rental homes. \u201cWith the displacement and gentrification of a lot of East Bay cities, and cities like San Francisco, Oakland and Richmond, it\u2019s creating this diaspora that\u2019s being spread to the valleys up [Interstate] 80 and Highway 4,\u201d said the Richmond city council member Demnlus Johnson. Violent social networks that were previously rooted in small, geographically bound places have spread across multiple East Bay cities. \u201cYou\u2019ve got people from North Richmond and Central Richmond both living in the El Pueblo projects in Pittsburg, and then you\u2019ve got people in Richmond living in the vistas in Vallejo,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhen all of those people get on the freeway to come back to Richmond they\u2019re gonna see each other.\u201d Knox said some of the freeway shooting cases she has prosecuted have uncovered evidence of gang members specifically talking about finding rivals on freeways and attempting to kill them there instead of on city surface streets where there could be more witnesses. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard gang members hunting each other, following each other up on to the freeways to \u2018do the dirt\u2019,\u201d explained Knox. The Contra Costa county district attorney has sought to add gang enhancements on to each of the freeway shooting cases summarized in this story. The enhancements allow up to 10 years to a defendant\u2019s sentence when applied to violent felony cases. Shane Reiss witnessed one of these targeted, gang-related shootings in early 2016. Reiss, an off-duty transit police officer, was driving on the highway when a silver Altima passed him at high speed. \u201cI thought that was weird,\u201d he told the Guardian. He watched in disbelief as the car pulled parallel to another vehicle and an arm reached out of the passenger side, flashed a steel revolver and fired. \u201cThe other car just kind of slowed down,\u201d Reiss recalled. Reiss dialed 911 and followed the shooters as they darted through heavy traffic. At the bottom of an off-ramp, the Altima crashed into several vehicles. Reiss approached on foot with his gun drawn as one of the suspects crawled out of the wreckage. \u201cI yelled at him to show me his hands,\u201d said Reiss. An on-duty Concord police officer arrived and they cuffed the man. Two other men still in the Altima were also arrested. Police found a .357 revolver in the back seat. The victim, Alvarro Navarro, wasn\u2019t injured. According to the Contra Costa district attorney, the three men who tried to shoot him, Zackery Lopez, Oscar Torres and Antonio Navarro, are alleged members of Concord\u2019s Varrio North Side gang. Authorities believe they targeted Alvarro Navarro because he is a rival gang member of the Little Town Sure\u00f1os. \u201cIt is very common for gang members to work in concert in a case like this,\u201d the Concord detective Mike Kindorf wrote in a report about the shooting. \u201cIt is not uncommon in a drive by shooting for someone to drive and someone to be the shooter, which I believe based on the facts of this case to be what occurred.\u201d A surveillance network Law enforcement\u2019s main response to the new threats to highway safety is the \u201cFreeway Security Network\u201d. The Network was launched in 2014, and includes an array of ShotSpotter microphones that have been calibrated to detect the sound of gunshots on long stretches of highways in Contra Costa county. When the microphones pick up the sound of gunfire they automatically trigger surveillance cameras that pivot and focus on the source of gunfire. The videos feed into a surveillance center in the Pittsburg police department, where a wall of monitors displays live scenes from I-80 and Highway 4. A large monitor with a \u201clive earth\u201d interface includes everything from global wind patterns to local roadway accidents. The Freeway Security Network\u2019s task force commander and members receive alerts whenever the system detects a gunshot, and the team can access live video and other surveillance information from their cellphones.Perhaps the most powerful feature of the surveillance center is the array of automatic license plate reader (LPR) cameras that scan the license plates of virtually every vehicle traveling the highways. Wentz said the LPR allows police to track down possible witnesses, aids to identify cars involved in shootings and helps the police to preserve evidence. With the ability to instantly detect a shooting, law enforcement can temporarily close a portion of a freeway and better preserve ballistics evidence. Knox estimates that there have been 83 freeway shootings just in Contra Costa county over the past three-and-half years. She said the Freeway Security Network has been an invaluable tool to solve cases. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten lots of interest from all the California highway patrol (CHP) districts in replicating this,\u201d said Knox. Critics worry that law enforcement\u2019s approach to the shootings is helping to spread hysteria and fuel anti-black racism in east Contra Costa county. And many community members and violence prevention workers say that although surveillance can help solve crimes after they happen, it doesn\u2019t go far in preventing them. \u201c[Freeway Shootings] are a scapegoat for racial anxieties,\u201d said the Antioch city councilmember Lamar Thorpe. \u201cI think a lot of this hysteria has led to very racist notions about where black people live and where they\u2019ve been pushed to.\u201d \u201cI think that throughout the region there is this sense that \u2018Well that\u2019s happening cause they\u2019re pushing all the poor blacks out there,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201c[Residents] will use phrases like \u2018This is what happens with gentrification, or when you have section 8.\u2019\u201d A recent investigation by the Guardian has shown that although gentrifying cities like Oakland and Richmond have seen dramatic drops in gun violence deaths, the suburban neighborhoods that people driven out of Oakland and Richmond are moving to have not seen a corresponding statistical jump in violence. Sam Vaughn, who works with young men who are considered gang members to steer them away from crime in Richmond\u2019s Office of Neighborhood Safety said law enforcement\u2019s approach is based on \u201cquick fixes\u201d. \u201cThe structure of law enforcement isn\u2019t built to prevent, it\u2019s built to respond, it\u2019s built to punish, it\u2019s built to create fear and encourage others to not make the same mistake.\u201d Vaughn agrees that gentrification and displacement have created new patterns of violence by pushing people into distant suburbs and breaking up social networks that were previously located within one city or neighborhood. But he said it\u2019s just one piece of a complicated problem that involves new and generational conflicts, and living in under-resourced communities. \u201cFor the most part these young people aren\u2019t being paid any attention until they do something, like a freeway shooting,\u201d Vaughn said. Vaughn says violence intervention programs like ONS, coupled with mental and emotional health services present a more holistic remedy to gun violence, on and off the freeway. He and his colleagues work with the young people who are involved in gun violence as both perpetrators and victims; he understands that the roots gobeyond gangs, and prevention efforts need to go beyond surveillance and long prison sentences. \u201cThose beefs arise for a number of reasons, and they last because no one is communicating.\u201d This is where Vaughn says community-based conflict resolution, life skills and mental healthcare can be most helpful. \u201cSo we try to give them the healthiest advice, the most information that we can so they can make an informed and rational decision instead of just pushing the button,\u201d Vaughn continued. But successful responses to gun violence such as community-based intervention efforts remain focused within cities and haven\u2019t been regionalized yet. \u201cThere\u2019s a slew of Richmond programming that [people] aren\u2019t able to take advantage of cause they moved to Antioch.\u201d said Johnson, adding that successful violence reduction programs like Richmond\u2019s Office of Neighborhood Safety and Oakland\u2019s Operation Ceasefire may need to be scaled up to the county level to make an impact. In November 2016, Contra Costa county\u2019s board of supervisors announced their intention to fund a county-wide Ceasefire program which could replicate the violence prevention efforts credited with reducing gun violence in Richmond and Oakland. But the program floundered for lack of funding and coordination, leaving thousands of county residents without access to services that could reduce highway shootings. Demarcus Doss\u2019s alleged killers might have escaped were it not for a witness who called 911 as the gray Dodge Charger sped down an offramp. A Richmond police officer followed the car to a house where Elliott Johnson, 24, of Richmond, and two 17-year-old boys, got out. All three were arrested. Johnson and one of the juveniles, Bryan Anderson, were charged with Doss\u2019s murder and the attempted murder of Joanna Oller. Police say a test of Anderson\u2019s hands for gunshot residue was positive. As with other freeway shootings, prosecutors say Johnson and Anderson are gang members. Doss, however, had no gang affiliations and the exact motive for his murder remains unclear. Since Doss\u2019s killing, the freeway shootings show no sign of slowing.

Demnlus Johnson, the Richmond city councilmember, said that surveillance is a necessary investigation tool, but if law enforcement and public officials want to see freeway shootings end, they need to combine efforts to invest in intervention and prevention among residents who are at risk of being perpetrators and victims. \u201cI feel as though we just displaced the problem, we didn\u2019t solve it,\u201d Johnson said.

But the party has delayed a decision on how much it should be boosted. Amid growing calls for the government to take action on the payment, the opposition decided on Tuesday that it would refer the matter to the Senate standing committee on economics, but would call on the Coalition to review and raise the $272 a week payment. Following a submission presented to caucus by the shadow minister for families and social services, Linda Burney, the party agreed that it would decide how much to boost the payment by closer to the next election, saying this would depend on fiscal and economic circumstances at the time. But despite the shift in position, MPs also agreed that Labor would oppose a Greens bill to boost the Newstart payment by $75 a week, which is being debated in parliament this week, saying they wanted to consider the figure at a later date. It also said that the Senate could not pass a so-called money bill that forces an appropriation. The Greens say the bill has been drafted in a way that does not appropriate money, and could go to the house if it was passed in the senate. A $75 a week increase to the payment costs about $3bn a year. Labor\u2019s revised position comes after MPs made the case for the party to take a bolder stance on increasing the payment, and as government MPs break ranks to also call for the payment to be increased. Before the election, Labor had pledged to conduct a review into the payment, with the intention of increasing it, but has now hardened its stance.

      "bodyText": "There were mixed fortunes for the special wildlife of Glapthorn Cow Pastures this spring. While the black hairstreak butterflies have been abundant among the blackthorns, the fluty and trilling tones of the nightingales were absent for the second consecutive year. Although these are the star turns of the wood, the summery rides thrum with a wide range of wildlife. Dark and speckled bush crickets hop and clamber in the deep grass that fills the open spaces. Little silk tepees are the motherly work of nursery web spiders, protection for their cream-coloured egg sacs. If the mothers are still on guard they are discreetly secreted away as the inside of the tents fill with little grey hatchlings. Under a piece of bark hangs an even more elaborate bit of spider mother-care, a great lantern spider (Agroeca brunnea) egg sac. This exquisite little construction is the shape of an upside-down wine glass. The pea-sized egg sac is first swathed tightly in white silk and then meticulously coated with a perfect layer of greyish mud. White sprays of richly perfumed meadowsweet leap from the ride edges and behind them mounds of bramble are laden with pink blossom. Large numbers of marmalade hoverflies (Episyrphus balteatus) drift between the flowers. These are immigrants: every summer clouds of a few species of hoverfly travel north through the continent, and this is the best year for them for some time. Buglife\u2019s vice president, Alan Stubbs, monitors their numbers daily in his Peterborough garden; his all-time record is of more than 1,000 hoverflies, but one day this month he counted 850 individuals, of which 800 were marmalades.

      "bodyText": "Labor now supports the Coalition\u2019s bill to block foreign fighters from returning to Australia, but will attempt to force it to a further review and make amendments to include safeguards. On Tuesday Labor\u2019s caucus agreed to support the temporary exclusion order bill in principle, refer it back to the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security and, if unsuccessful, move amendments that reflect 18 recommendations of that committee. Challenged about the constitutionality of the bill in caucus, the shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, responded that Labor should nevertheless support it because \u201csome of the people affected by [this bill] represent a threat to the Australian community\u201d. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, then went into the lower house and accused the government of a \u201csignificant breach\u201d of bipartisanship by \u201cfailing to implement in full at least 10 recommendations of the PJCIS without explanation\u201d. In a second reading amendment, he said it was \u201cthe first time since 2013 that this government has ever openly rejected recommendations of the bipartisan committee\u201d. Dreyfus told the house the government was \u201clooking for a cheap headline\u201d by presenting national security bills as a \u201ctest for Labor\u201d and accusing the opposition of \u201ctreason and disloyalty\u201d if they block or amend bills. What is the bill? In February, the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, introduced the counter-terrorism (temporary exclusion orders) bill into the House of Representatives. The bill would give the minister the power to block a person aged over 14 years of age \u2013 including an Australian citizen \u2013 from returning to Australia for up to two years if the minister \u201csuspects on reasonable grounds\u201d that an order would prevent support or assistance to a terrorist organisation. An order can also be issued if the person \u201chas been assessed by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to be directly or indirectly a risk to security \u2026 for reasons related to politically motivated violence\u201d. Once a temporary exclusion order is issued the person can apply for a \u201creturn permit\u201d, which the minister must grant. The permit allows the Australian government to impose conditions on their return, such as notifying authorities of a change of address, of contact with certain individuals, or future travel plans. What did the intelligence and security committee say about it? In April the PJCIS \u2013 chaired by the Liberal MP Andrew Hastie \u2013 issued a bipartisan report recommending that the bill be passed \u201cfollowing the implementation\u201d of 18 amendments or safeguards. These included amendments so that: A temporary exclusion order may only be issued by an issuing authority \u2013 a judge, a retired judge or a senior member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal \u2013 on application by the minister (recommendation 7). Prosecution for a breach of the law requires proof that the defendant had knowledge of the existence of the temporary exclusion order or of the relevant return permit condition (recommendation 11). The minister must not make a temporary exclusion order unless he or she reasonably suspects that the person is, or has been, involved in terrorism-related activities outside Australia, and an Asio assessment can\u2019t be the trigger for an order (recommendation 12). The bill lapsed when parliament was dissolved for the 2019 election. After the Coalition was re-elected Dutton reintroduced an amended bill on 4 July. What is the Coalition\u2019s position? The government\u2019s response to the PJCIS report accepted seven recommendations in full, nine in principle or in-part and \u201cnoted\u201d \u2013 but did not implement \u2013 two. The government did not accept recommendations 11 and 12, arguing: Authorities should be able to prosecute based on reckless breaches \u2013 not actual knowledge \u2013 or the deterrent effect would be reduced. Implementing the recommendation to require the minister to suspect the person is or has been involved in terrorism-related activities outside Australia would restrict the operation of the scheme to high-risk individuals only. The government amended the bill to provide \u201cadditional oversight\u201d from a reviewing authority which can review the minister\u2019s decisions to issue a temporary exclusion order, but only overturn it if the decision is \u201clegally flawed\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning What are Labor\u2019s concerns with the bill? The first concern is one of process \u2013 by putting the bill back up for debate without fully implementing the PJCIS recommendations, the opposition believes the government is ignoring bipartisanship in a bid to wedge Labor. Second, Labor is concerned that the Asio assessment \u2013 which can trigger a temporary exclusion order \u2013 is not a legally defined term, and should be replaced with a requirement for an adverse security assessment. On Tuesday, the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, added that the government \u201chasn\u2019t put forward a reason\u201d why it should be the minister \u2013 not a judge \u2013 who makes a temporary exclusion order. What will Labor and the crossbench do now? On Tuesday, Keneally called on the government to refer the legislation back to the PJCIS and release the solicitor general\u2019s advice to ensure the bill\u2019s constitutionality. \u201cLabor wants a [temporary exclusion order] scheme that works, is constitutional, keeps Australians safe and that withstands high court challenges \u2013 the government must refer the legislation back to the PJCIS to ensure this happens,\u201d Keneally said. On Sunday, Centre Alliance also called on the government to demonstrate the bill is constitutional and improve the oversight regime for issuing and reviewing exclusion orders by implementing the PJCIS recommendations. But the new Labor caucus position means if the government pushes the bill back to the Senate, unamended, it is likely to pass in its current form.",

There are fears that gases have built up in the storage tanks, which means the ship could explode.</p> <p>Mark Lowcock, the UN humanitarian coordinator, told the UN security council last week an inspection team had again been refused permissions by Houthis to visit the ship moored several kilometres outside the Red Sea port of Ras Isa, north of Hodeidah. </p> <p>The two sides in the conflict in conversation with the UN blame each other for failing to reach a solution about what to do about the ship, and its valuable cargo.</p> <p>The Houthis want guarantees that they will be able to control the revenues from the oil on the ship valued at $80m (\u00a364m), a move that might require a new oil export mechanism.</p> <p>The UN-recognised Yemen government has warned in a letter to the UN of a \u201cbad and deteriorating situation\u201d that threatens an \u201cimminent environmental and humanitarian catastrophe in the Red Sea\u201d.</p> <p>It has also produced a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Yemen_PM/status/1150149967648055297?s=20\">video warning</a> of an environmental disaster that could dwarf any previous oil spillage.</p> <p>Doug Weir, director of the Conflict and Environment Observatory, said the cause for concern was genuine. He told the Guardian: \u201cUntil a UN technical inspection takes place it is difficult to determine the precise risk that the vessel poses, however the potential for a serious environmental emergency is clear. An explosion leading to a spill would have a severe effect on the Red Sea marine environment, and on both biodiversity and livelihoods, an emergency made worse because the ongoing conflict would hamper efforts to control and respond to the pollution it would cause.\u201d</p> <p>The ship itself, known as the Safer floating storage and offloading terminal, is a testament to a time when the Yemen economy was functioning. Owned by the Yemen oil company, Safer allows vessels to moor offshore and transfer oil extracted and processed from operations in the Marib oil field in central Yemen.

      "bodyText": "A deserted oil tanker described as a \u201cfloating bomb\u201d that is currently anchored off the coast of war-torn Yemen has the potential to create an environmental disaster, according to experts. A byproduct of the battle between the Saudi-backed UN Yemen government and the Houthis, the tanker, containing over 1m barrels of oil, is said to be eroding fast, but UN officials\u2019 plans to visit the ship this week to assess the scale of the damage have been blocked. There are fears that gases have built up in the storage tanks, which means the ship could explode. Mark Lowcock, the UN humanitarian coordinator, told the UN security council last week an inspection team had again been refused permissions by Houthis to visit the ship moored several kilometres outside the Red Sea port of Ras Isa, north of Hodeidah. The two sides in the conflict in conversation with the UN blame each other for failing to reach a solution about what to do about the ship, and its valuable cargo. The Houthis want guarantees that they will be able to control the revenues from the oil on the ship valued at $80m (\u00a364m), a move that might require a new oil export mechanism. The UN-recognised Yemen government has warned in a letter to the UN of a \u201cbad and deteriorating situation\u201d that threatens an \u201cimminent environmental and humanitarian catastrophe in the Red Sea\u201d. It has also produced a video warning of an environmental disaster that could dwarf any previous oil spillage. Doug Weir, director of the Conflict and Environment Observatory, said the cause for concern was genuine. He told the Guardian: \u201cUntil a UN technical inspection takes place it is difficult to determine the precise risk that the vessel poses, however the potential for a serious environmental emergency is clear. An explosion leading to a spill would have a severe effect on the Red Sea marine environment, and on both biodiversity and livelihoods, an emergency made worse because the ongoing conflict would hamper efforts to control and respond to the pollution it would cause.\u201d The ship itself, known as the Safer floating storage and offloading terminal, is a testament to a time when the Yemen economy was functioning. Owned by the Yemen oil company, Safer allows vessels to moor offshore and transfer oil extracted and processed from operations in the Marib oil field in central Yemen. The tanker contains 34 crude oil tanks of different sizes and volumes, amounting to a total capacity of around 3m barrels. In effect, a mini-oil export terminal, the ship has not been operational since March 2015 when the region fell under the control of the Houthi rebels. Built in Japan involving a single hull, experts say is likely to be at particular risk from corrosion and in spite of the production interruptions caused by the conflict, it is thought that it may still contain around 1.14m barrels of crude. The Yemen government points out this is four times the amount of oil released in the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, generally seen as as one of the worst man-made environmental disasters in history. An increasingly frustrated Lowcock told the UN security council last month \u201cIf the tanker ruptures or explodes, we could see the coastline polluted all along the Red Sea. Depending on the time of year and water currents, the spill could reach from Bab-el-Mandeb to the Suez Canal, and potentially as far as the strait of Hormuz,\u201d he added. The unavailability of diesel fuel has meant that Safer FSO\u2019s engines have not been started for several years, and the structure has been exposed to humidity and corrosion with little maintenance. With restricted water circulation, and delicate marine ecosystems, the Red Sea, home of corals and 600 species of fish and invertebrates, is seen as particularly vulnerable to oil pollution.",

The European commission welcomed the change in policy announced by the prime minister, Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103, heaping praise on her \u201cEuropean approach\u201d. In an interview with the Guardian, D\u0103ncil\u0103 said she wanted to go back to an agenda \u201cthat is focused on the citizen, less on the justice system\u201d. But EU officials remain cautious about how her pledges will be implemented. Toma says the prime minister\u2019s decision to drop an emergency ordinance that would have given an amnesty to people convicted of corruption was a good sign, but the struggle over the rule of law has not finished. \u201cThere are many other dangers,\u201d she says, citing the work of a special department that is investigating the DNA. \u201cThere are still things to be undone and it\u2019s a matter of fact, not just [making] statements.\u201d The PSD has always rejected charges of corruption, whether from Brussels or Romanian citizens, but the response varies. When the V\u04d1 Vedem din Sibiu protest began, PSD workers drew the blinds, according to Ciocan, and issued a statement accusing the demonstrators of \u201caggressive\u201d behaviour. The response to international media feels more polished. Questions to the PSD were directed to one of their MEP candidates. Cristian Terhes, a Romanian-American priest who has been living in California for the last 16 years, subsequently won a seat in the European parliament, although his party lost ground. Sibiu\u2019s peaceful protests were \u201cclear proof that democracy is working\u201d, he said. He claimed that many politicians and officials were convicted of corruption through tampered evidence and the underhand work of secret services: accusations that echo those made by Dragnea. Terhes also said the Council of Europe\u2019s independent experts had made \u201cmany errors and missed facts\u201d, and claimed judges had more independence in Romania than any other EU country. The PSD message does not convince protesters in Sibiu. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to live in a country where corrupt people are leading us and taking our country into a mess,\u201d says Paula D\u00f6rr, 13, who was attending the protest on school break, accompanied by her father. The protesters plan to be back tomorrow.",

      "bodyText": "Police in Canada are investigating three suspicious deaths and the disappearance of two teenagers which took place within days of each other along a remote Canadian highway. At a press conference on Monday, representatives of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the two cases might be linked, despite earlier assurances that there was \u201cnothing to indicate\u201d that the double murder of Australian Lucas Fowler, 23, and US citizen Chynna Deese, 24, was related to the discovery of a burning car and a man\u2019s body some 500km south, and the disappearance of two Canadian teenagers. A bearded man seen talking to Fowler on the side of the highway last week has emerged as the key to solving the mysteries. Police released a composite sketch of the man whom police described \u201cas Caucasian with darker skin and dark hair\u201d. He was driving an older model of Jeep Grand Cherokee with a black stripe on the hood. \u201cHe\u2019s shorter than Lucas who stood six foot three (190cm) and has a possible beard or glasses,\u201d RCMP Sgt Janelle Shoihet told a media conference. Fowler and Deese were nearing the end of a two-week road trip to Alaska when their van broke down along the Alaska Highway about 20km south of Liard River Hot Springs provincial park, a popular tourist spot. Several locals stopped and asked if they needed help, but the pair appeared to have the situation under control. Their bodies were discovered by the roadside on 15 July, but it took three days for police to identify them. The RCMP believe they were killed sometime between 14 July and 15 July. On Friday, four days after the bodies of Deese and Fowler were discovered, police in the town of Dease Lake \u2013 several hours\u2019 drive south \u2013 launched a search for Kam McLeod, age 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, age 18, after their truck was discovered in flames near the town. The two youths had been travelling to Whitehorse in the Yukon in search of work. \u201cWe are hopeful that they are alive,\u201d said Shoihet at the media briefing in Surrey, British Columbia. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly investigating them as missing persons and we\u2019re hopeful that they will get in touch with us when they see this broadcast.\u201d During that investigation, the body of a man who was neither McLeod nor Schmegelsky was found two kilometres down the road, the RCMP said. The man has not yet been identified. \u201cIt is unclear at this time how this deceased male might be connected with [the] vehicle fire or the two missing men,\u201d the force said in statement. The RCMP provided a composite sketch of the dead man at a Monday press conference and appealed for help to identify him. They have not released information about the manner or time of his death. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual to have two major investigations undergoing of this nature in northern BC at the same time,\u201d Shoihet said. The police are proceeding with the knowledge that there\u2019s a possibility the investigations could be linked, she said. Shoihet cautioned the public and tourists to the area to have \u201cheightened vigilance\u201d in the remote region where there is little or no cellphone coverage. Notifying others of a planned route and periodically checking in are important safety steps, she said. Fowler, whose father Stephen Fowler is one of New South Wales\u2019s top police officers, had been living in British Columbia when Deese came to visit him from Charlotte, North Carolina. The couple had met at a hostel in Croatia in 2017 and had travelled together across the US and abroad to Mexico, Peru and elsewhere. After their bodies were discovered, a New South Wales police force spokesperson told reporters the couple \u201cmay have been shot\u201d. But the RCMP have not yet released a cause of death for the pair. \u201cOur son Lucas was having the time of his life travelling the world,\u201d Stephen Fowler said, speaking at the same press conference on Monday. Fowler said his family were \u201coverjoyed\u201d about his relationship with Chynna and the adventures they had, before their untimely deaths turned it into the \u201cworst ever love story\u201d. As for the planned van trip, he said: \u201cHe communicated with us as they were leaving. What happened after that, time will tell.\u201d Fowler declined to comment further on the ongoing investigation, beyond pleading with members of the public to come forward if they knew anything. \u201cThis investigation is in its very infancy and it is not yet clear whether Lucas and Chynna were targeted or if this was a crime of opportunity,\u201d Shoihet said in an earlier release. The RCMP released a composite sketch of a man of Caucasian descent seen speaking to Lucas Fowler who is a person of interest in the case. Some media speculated that the deaths could have been the work of a single killer or that they may be linked with the \u201cHighway of Tears\u201d \u2013 the remote stretch of road where at least 40 Indigenous women have gone missing or been found murdered since 1970. But so far there is no indication that the crimes are at all linked to the Highway of Tears investigations, Shoihet said. Several murderers are believed to have been responsible for the crimes along the notorious section of British Columbia\u2019s Highway 16 \u2013 which is approximately 1,000km away from the current investigations. Two NSW police detectives have accompanied the Fowler family to Canada and will be assisting as liaisons between the family and the investigation, Fowler said.",

Reports of the torture and murder of women accused of sorcery also appear regularly in local media. \u201cWhat is lacking is enforcement. This to me is a key hindrance to really seeing change in terms of sending a strong message about violence against women and violence in general,\u201d says Hukula. \u201cHaving said this, it is extremely difficult to police rural and remote PNG due to lack of resources and geographical constraints. This is where the role of village courts and community leadership is vital in local dispute resolution.\u201d One of the continuing tensions in Hela is that specialist police squads are assigned to secure the PNGLNG facilities. \u201cWe currently have only 40 police for the whole province,\u201d said Hela Provincial Administrator, William Bando, in the aftermath of the massacre.\u2060 \u201cOur Tari-based MS9 [police mobile squad] were taken by Exxon-Mobil to provide security, while our people are dying.\u201d",

But in a rare win for an applicant living with chronic pain, Natasha Thomson was granted access to the $450 a week payment after a two-year battle that ended up at the top level of the administrative appeal tribunal. The 26-year-old Melbourne woman had lived on the $277-a-week Newstart payment in the meantime, racking up a $5,000 credit card debt as she struggled to pay bills and cover her medical costs. The case got to the general division of the tribunal only because the department appealed after a lower level tribunal sided with Thomson. \u201cIt\u2019s hell,\u201d said Thomson, who represented herself at the tribunal. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be this hard to get the help that we need.\u201d To access the disability support pension, people must prove their condition is \u201cfully diagnosed, treated and stabilised\u201d and that they are unable to work at least 15 hours a week. The department argued Thomson\u2019s charity work shifts were often longer than three hours and that, with her work as a nanny, this proved she could \u201csustain work activity or other tasks for periods of three or more hours per day\u201d. But the tribunal said her volunteering and nannying took place with a \u201cbenign employer\u201d. At hospital, she would watch movies with sick children and comfort infants and other children who could not take part in physical activities. Thomson told Guardian Australia the department\u2019s arguments were hard to take because the hospital was \u201ca positive place\u201d for her. She described her pain as like having \u201ca white hot poker sticking through my abdomen\u201d. \u201cMy chronic pain is pretty much 24/7,\u201d the former early childhood and primary education student said. \u201cSo for me to go into the hospital, I\u2019m going in there in the headspace where I just push the pain down basically. \u201cI love volunteering because it\u2019s a way to give back; it\u2019s about helping these other people in a way that I\u2019m good at. \u201cAnd because it\u2019s volunteering, I can say, \u2018I\u2019m not up to it this week,\u2019 and they\u2019re OK with that. I\u2019m not going to get fired.\u201d Until the tribunal verdict, Thomson was among the record-high 200,000 people who are now on Newstart while sick or with a disability. Joel Townsend of Victoria Legal Aid, which provided some advice to Thomson, said the organisation was taking on more disability support pension cases. \u201cThat is, we think, partly to do with the fact that there have been quite significant hurdles put in the way of people who are seeking to obtain [the disability support pension],\u201d he said. The rate of successful claims has fallen to 30% after the criteria were tightened by successive governments.

Darren O\u2019Donovan, an administrative law expert at La Trobe University, said he hoped the case meant others would not have to \u201cengage in a unrealistic hunt for diagnosis and treatment before they can get basic support\u201d. \u201cThe fact that a person with disability tries to help out charities in their community needs to be kept distinct from their ability to sustain work in a commercial environment,\u201d he said. A doctor contracted by the department to assess Thomson\u2019s medical records also argued her claim should be denied because she had undertaken multiple overseas trips. \u201cShe would appear to only be impaired in Australia,\u201d the doctor wrote in a report cited by the department. Thomson said it \u201creally sucked that those little things were being used against me\u201d.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re ending our live coverage for the day, thanks for following along. Tune in tomorrow for what is sure to be a busy day as DC braces for Robert Mueller\u2019s congressional testimony this week. Here are some key events and links from the day: The Trump administration is working to implement a new policy to fast-track deportations of undocumented immigrants by bypassing immigration judges. Seven current and former US senators who called for the resignation of Al Franken in 2017 have said their actions were wrong. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, however, said she had no regrets and that it was wrong to blame a woman for the actions of a man. Immigrant rights groups challenged the legitimacy of Ken Cuccinelli\u2019s appointment as acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services. A new report confirmed that the Trump administration has not actually built a single mile of new border fence after 30 months in office. Former special counsel Robert Mueller is preparing to publicly testify on Wednesday in an event that one Democrat said would be \u201cdamning and explosive\u201d. Justice department officials have, however, reportedly told Mueller that the DOJ expects him to limit his testimony to only the public findings outlined in his final report. Mexico boasted of a sharp drop in the number of migrants attempting to travel through the country ahead of a US deadline for its southern neighbor to show that it is cracking down on irregular migration. The Trump campaign escalated its attacks on Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib by tweeting out misleading and out-of-context quotes. Puerto Rico saw more massive protests on Monday as hundreds of thousands lined the streets following Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3\u2019s attempt to cling on to power despite resigning as president of the ruling New Progressive party. Trump and congressional leaders announced Monday that they had struck a critical debt and budget agreement. Here\u2019s a story from today about a neighborhood in Nashville, Tennessee that apparently collectively organized to stop Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) from detaining a man: A thread from a local reporter on the scene: As \u201cknow your rights\u201d trainings and materials have spread across the country, more residents and communities have stood up to Ice in this manner, blocking agents from making apprehensions. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a 2020 presidential candidate, was asked tonight whether she regretted calling for Al Franken to resign after he was accused of groping and other misconduct by multiple women. Gillibrand said she did not have any regrets and criticized people for \u201cblaming a woman for the actions of a man\u201d: It\u2019s a question Gillibrand has received many times on the campaign trail, since she was one of the first to call for him to step down. The subject was back in the news today after the New Yorker published a piece on the allegations that included quotes from seven current and former US senators who said they now regretted their calls for Franken to resign. Gillibrand also noted that the article focused on one of the accusers, even though there were seven others: Gillibrand, her supporters and others have long argued that it was sexist for her to face such intense scrutiny over her comments about Franken. Prominent male politicians also called for his resignation at the time, and the New Yorker story delved into Chuck Schumer\u2019s role in pushing for Franken to step down. But Gillibrand\u2019s role has continued to attract significant attention: Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign has escalated its attacks on Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, this time by presenting quotes of hers in an out-of-context and misleading manner. My colleague Jon Swaine has some helpful fact checks here: The president\u2019s campaign tweeted a comment of hers from a recent speech \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m more Palestinian in the halls of Congress than I am anywhere in the world\u201d \u2013 without context. \u201cWhy not be a voice for the Americans who elected you?\u201d the Trump 2020 \u201cWar Room\u201d Twitter account added. But in the video in question, Tlaib was discussing the ways in which she has faced discrimination in Congress - how people refuse to respect that she is an American and instead treat her like an outsider. Further contradicting the presentation by Trump\u2019s team in its tweets, a minute later in the speech, as Tlaib discussed how hard it was for her to have to deal with attacks on her identity, she added: I\u2019m an American. I don\u2019t want to have to frickin\u2019 keep saying it. I shouldn\u2019t have to keep saying it. The latest attack on Tlaib resembles some of the rightwing racist attacks on congresswoman Ilhan Omar, which have also relied on taking her quotes out of context, making misleading or false statements about her positions, and questioning her status as an American. You can watch the full video of the speech here: Immigrant rights groups have sent a letter today challenging the legitimacy of Ken Cuccinelli\u2019s appointment as acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services: The groups argued his appointment was unlawful, violating procedures outlined in a federal act on how vacancies should be filled. After the resignation of the previous USCIS director in May, the agency\u2019s deputy director should have assumed the role until someone else was nominated and confirmed by the Senate. Instead, the Trump administration conducted what the groups allege was an illegal workaround to appoint Cuccinelli, a controversial conservative figure who has been busy implementing the president\u2019s anti-immigrant agenda in recent weeks. He made headlines last month when he blamed a migrant father for his death after he drowned alongside his daughter in a tragedy that sparked international outrage after photos of their bodies were published. Betsy DeVos, the billionaire US education secretary, has seen her and her family\u2019s profits soar after Trump\u2019s tax reform legislation, according to a new CNBC analysis out today. Business leaders and corporations have, as expected, earned massive benefits from Trump\u2019s tax policy. That apparently includes DeVos, whose total income had a valuation of at least $33m in 2018 through assets listed on her most recent public filing, CNBC reported. A DeVos family spokesman, Nick Wasmiller, disputed in a statement to CNBC whether the financial gains could be attributed to Trump\u2019s policies, but did offer a vague claim that the Trump administration \u201chas had a positive impact on the investments of all Americans\u201d: Like all investors, the family seeks investments that grow in value over time. These long-term investments have and do fluctuate in terms of income produced annually and that fluctuation is based on a variety of factors,\u201d he said in a statement to CNBC. \u201cIt is impossible, given the complexity and diversity of these investments, to attribute any individual shifts to specific policy changes as you suggest. Certainly, the strong economic expansion during the Trump administration has had a positive impact on the investments of all Americans \u2013 whether direct or via their 401Ks, IRAs, pensions, etc. CNBC said it did not appear that DeVos or her family had made any recent investments that pose a direct conflict of interest with her role as secretary education, though some have argued that the complexity and size of her finances make it difficult to assess ethical questions. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate democratic leader Chuck Schumer have released a statement on the budget deal, saying the bipartisan agreement would \u201cenhance our national security and invest in middle class priorities\u201d. M0re: Importantly, Democrats have achieved an agreement that permanently ends the threat of the sequester. We are pleased that the Administration has finally agreed to join Democrats in ending these devastating cuts, which have threatened our investments to keep America Number One in the global economy and to ensure our national security. With this agreement, we strive to avoid another government shutdown, which is so harmful to meeting the needs of the American people and honoring the work of our public employees. Democrats are also pleased to have secured robust funding for critical domestic priorities in this agreement. Democrats have always insisted on parity in increases between defense and non-defense, and we are pleased that our increase in non-defense budget authority exceeds the defense number by $10 billion over the next two years. It also means Democrats secured an increase of more than $100 billion in funding for domestic priorities since President Trump took office. More details from the Democratic leaders here: Trump has tweeted that Democrats and the GOP have reached a deal on a two-year budget and debt ceiling: The US was on track to run out of money in September if there was no deal: Nancy Pelosi has apparently been conducting negotiations from the coach section of a delayed flight, according to a CNN reporter: Read more about the proposed debt ceiling compromise from our earlier coverage. Justice department officials have told Robert Mueller that the DOJ expects him to limit his testimony to only the public findings outlined in his final report, two officials told Politico. The DOJ\u2019s position is that \u201canything outside the written pages of the report are things about which presidential privilege hasn\u2019t been waived\u201d, one former official said. The former special counsel has, however, already suggested that he does plan to stick to the details of his report. The White House and DOJ have signaled that they aren\u2019t going to have attorneys in the room during the hearings on Wednesday, which means they may not have any way to object if they disapprove of his testimony, Politico noted. Hello - Sam Levin here in Los Angeles, taking over our coverage for the rest of the day as Washington DC braces for Robert Mueller\u2019s highly anticipated testimony before Congress on Wednesday. A new report confirmed that the Trump administration has not actually built a single mile of new border fence after 30 months in office. The Washington Examiner pressed US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on the matter and received a statement saying all the fencing completed since Trump took office was \u201cin place of dilapidated designs\u201d, since existing fence needed to be replaced: The scrutiny from the Washington Examiner, a conservative news outlet, suggests that Trump and his 2020 campaign are likely to face ongoing questions from some rightwing pundits and supporters about his failure to follow through on his signature policy promise. The White House has blamed Democrats for blocking funding, though Trump has repeatedly pledged to \u201cbuild the wall\u201d with or without support from his opponents in Congress. In the wake of the report, CBP and the Trump administration today have continued to claim that the government has built \u201cnew border wall\u201d. But the areas in question appear to be the sections identified in the Examiner story, where fencing already existed. That\u2019s it from me today. I\u2019m handing it off to my colleague Sam Levin on the West Coast. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Details are starting to trickle out about special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s highly anticipated congressional testimony on Wednesday. The former FBI director is expected to deliver an opening statement and has been preparing for the back-to-back hearings with some of his colleagues from the special counsel\u2019s office, per CNN. The Trump administration is moving to fast-track deportations by more frequently bypassing immigration judges. Officials intend to immediately expand the government\u2019s \u201cexpedited removal\u201d policy to apply anywhere in the country to immigrants who have been in the country for less than two years. Trump kept up his barrage of attacks on \u201cthe Squad.\u201d He wrote on Twitter that the four minority congresswomen are a \u201cvery Racist group of troublemakers who are young, inexperienced, and not very smart.\u201d \u2018 Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, said social media platforms are not prepared for the 2020 election and the \u201cdeep fakes\u201d likely to come up during it. But more news is expected on the proposed debt ceiling deal and Mark Esper\u2019s likely confirmation as defense secretary, so stay tuned. The Trump administration intends to implement a new policy to fast-track deportations of undocumented immigrants by bypassing immigration judges, the Washington Post reports. The new policy will take effect immediately and apply to those who have illegally entered the United States within the past two years. The current process for \u201cexpedited removal\u201d has only been applied to migrants who have been in the country for less than two weeks and were caught within 100 miles of the US-Mexico border. The new policy will apply anywhere in the United States. Immigrants who cannot prove that they have continuously been in the country for the past two years could face quick deportation. Officials say the policy is meant to alleviate the immigration court backlog and free up space in immigration jails, but it comes as Trump has promised to deport millions of immigrants and threatened raids targeting immigrant communities. \u201cDHS has determined that the volume of illegal entries, and the attendant risks to national security and public safety presented by these illegal entries, warrants this immediate implementation of DHS\u2019s full statutory authority over expedited removal,\u201d acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said in a draft notice. \u201cDHS expects that the full use of expedited removal statutory authority will strengthen national security, diminish the number of illegal entries, and otherwise ensure the prompt removal of aliens apprehended in the United States.\u201d Mueller preparing for his testimony with members of the special counsel\u2019s office Robert Mueller is preparing for his congressional testimony by conferring with some of his colleagues from the special counsel\u2019s office at Wilmer Hale, the law firm he joined after leaving his role as FBI director in 2014. Mueller has said he will strictly stick to the details of his report in his congressional testimony, so he is likely studying it closely as he prepares for Wednesday\u2019s back-to-back hearings. The White House has been quiet about why Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s trip to New Hampshire was abruptly canceled earlier this month. Now a report has emerged that one of the prominent participants in the planned event was under investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration. One of the people to greet Air Force Two in Manchester, New Hampshire, would have likely been Jeff Hatch, a former New York Giants player who is known for warning students about the dangers of doing drugs. He has spoken openly about how his own addictions derailed his football career. But Hatch, who has previously appeared alongside Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, has been facing a federal investigation for allegedly moving more than $100,000 worth of fentanyl from Massachusetts to New Hampshire, Politico reports. He agreed on Friday to plead guilty and could be sentenced to up to four years in prison. Trump raised speculation about the trip earlier this month when he said the incident causing the cancelation was \u201cvery interesting.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll know in about two weeks,\u201d Trump told reporters earlier this month. \u201cThere was a very interesting problem that they had in New Hampshire.\u201d Mueller will make opening statement In some not exactly earth-shattering news, special counsel Robert Mueller will deliver an opening statement during his highly anticipated congressional testimony on Wednesday. Mueller\u2019s spokesman confirmed to NBC News that he would make an opening statement and reiterated that the special counsel intends to stay within the bounds of his report during his testimony. Mueller also plans to make the report his official statement for the hearing record. Protests continue in Puerto Rico as governor resists calls for him to resign Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in Puerto Rico as Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 declined to resign over leaked text messages showing misogynistic and homophobic language. Rossell\u00f3 has stepped aside as president of the ruling party and announced he will not seek re-election but has refused to relinquish his office. Our colleague Oliver Laughland reports: A general strike took place across the US territory on Monday morning, protesters chanting the now familiar cry of \u2018Ricky resign!\u2019, waving flags and banging drums. ... Puerto Rico\u2019s largest mall, Plaza de las Am\u00e9ricas, closed before Monday\u2019s demonstration along with many other businesses. Last week police used teargas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters at a huge rally outside the governor\u2019s residence in the island\u2019s capital, San Juan. In the Oval Office on Monday, Donald Trump once again laid into Rossell\u00f3 and the mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, a vocal critic of the governor and the president. \u2018He\u2019s a terrible governor. You have an even worse mayor of San Juan,\u2019 Trump said. \u2018We did a great job in Puerto Rico. They don\u2019t want to give us credit \u2026 I have many Puerto Rican friends.\u2019 Another House Democrat joins call for an impeachment inquiry Representative Joyce Beatty, a Democrat who has represented Ohio\u2019s Third District since 2013, has thrown her support behind an impeachment inquiry of Trump. Citing both his lack of cooperation with congressional investigations and his recent racist comments about \u201cthe Squad,\u201d Beatty said the time has come to open an impeachment inquiry. \u201cAs the Mueller report makes crystal clear, this president believes he is above the law and it is the responsibility of Congress to hold him accountable for his words and actions,\u201d Beatty said in a statement to Politico. Some House Democrats are expressing hope that special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s highly anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill Wednesday could shift public opinion on impeaching Trump. Our colleague Sabrina Siddiqui reports: For Democrats who took control of the House in November, Mueller\u2019s remarks could prove a make-or-break moment as they grapple with how to hold the president accountable \u2013 and whether the public will be on their side if they move ahead with impeachment. \u2018We cannot emphasize enough that this will be the first opportunity for many, many Americans to actually hear what\u2019s contained in the Mueller report,\u2019 said Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who sits on the House judiciary committee. \u2018I don\u2019t think anyone should expect there\u2019s going to be an explosive new moment where [Mueller] is going to add something the investigation didn\u2019t cover, but the contents of the report are damning and explosive.\u2019 Joe Biden once again went after Trump for his attacks on the four minority congresswomen known as \u201cthe Squad.\u201d The former vice president and presidential candidate has already criticized Trump for his racist comments, saying he is \u201cmore George Wallace than George Washington.\u201d (Wallace was a former Alabama governor who unsuccessfully ran for president several times and is best known as an ardent support of racial segregation.) Trump expresses preference for Pakistani reporters over US reporters During his Oval Office meeting with Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Trump said he preferred reporters from that country to American reporters. \u201cAre you from Pakistan?\u201d Trump asked one reporter as members of the press shouted questions at him. \u201cGood, I want a couple of Pakistani reporters. I like them much better than our reporters.\u201d The offhand comment came hours after Trump spent the morning railing against the \u201cMainstream Media,\u201d claiming that journalists \u201cconstantly lie and cheat in order to get their Radical Left Democrat views out their for all to see.\u201d Warren: An economic crash is coming Elizabeth Warren warned that the economy is showing signs of a coming crisis, comparing the situation to the events foreshadowing the Great Recession. \u201cI\u2019ve spent most of my career getting to the bottom of what\u2019s happening to working families in America. And when I saw the seeds of the 2008 crisis growing, I rang the alarm as loud as I could,\u201d the presidential candidate and Massachusetts senator wrote in a Medium post. \u201cWhen I look at the economy today, I see a lot to worry about again,\u201d she added. \u201cI see a manufacturing sector in recession. I see a precarious economy that is built on debt \u2014 both household debt and corporate debt \u2014 and that is vulnerable to shocks. And I see a number of serious shocks on the horizon that could cause our economy\u2019s shaky foundation to crumble.\u201d Warren goes on in the post to lay out a number of policies she believes will prevent such a crisis. Many are proposals she has repeatedly promoted on the campaign trail, including raising the minimum wage, canceling student debt and her Green Manufacturing Plan. \u201cCongress and regulators should act immediately to tamp down these threats before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Warren concludes. Trump also told reporters during his Oval Office meeting with Pakistan\u2019s prime minister that he does not plan to watch special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s highly anticipated congressional hearing on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be watching Mueller,\u201d Trump said, according to the pool report. \u201cWe had a total no-collusion finding.\u201d In fact, Mueller\u2019s report found that there was not enough evidence to bring charges of conspiracy or illegal coordination between Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. Trump touched on a variety of foreign policy matters while meeting with Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, at the White House. Addressing reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said he had a winning strategy on the war in Afghanistan. \u201cI could win that war in a week,\u201d Trump said of the conflict that has stretched on for nearly 18 years, per the pool report. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill 10 million people.... Afghanistan could be wiped off the face of the earth. I don\u2019t want to go that route. ... I have a plan that could win that war in a very short period of time.\u201d Trump also said it\u2019s \u201cgetting harder\u201d for him to negotiate with Iran. \u201cIran doesn\u2019t know where they are,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey are a very mixed up country. ... They lie a lot ... They are the number one state of terror in the world.\u201d A new poll conducted in the days immediately after Trump said that four minority congresswomen should \u201cgo back\u201d to their home countries showed that the president\u2019s approval rating hit its highest point since he took office. But it still stands at a lackluster 44 percent. And the NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll showed that a majority of Americans -- 53 percent -- would not vote for Trump next year. But given that 54 percent of Americans voted against Trump in 2016, that number may not prevent his reelection. Overall, the numbers seem to indicate that independent voters are not yet sold in either direction on the 2020 race. \u201cThey\u2019re not willing to grant President Trump reelection, and yet they\u2019re not persuaded by Democrats at this point,\u201d said Lee Miringoff, the director of the institute that conducted the poll. The proposed compromise largely crafted by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on raising the debt ceiling would end the mandatory spending cuts outlined in a 2011 budget law, the LA Times reports. The deal, which would avoid a disastrous default on US debt and raise the nation\u2019s borrowing limit, has not yet been approved by Trump. And the president, along with his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, may not be keen on the proposal given its reversal of the 2011 budget agreement. Some background: the massive funding cuts were backed by staunch conservatives like Mulvaney, a former congressman, who wanted to limit federal spending. But the cuts have since become unpopular with members of both parties as they have affected domestic and defense spending each year. Siemens CEO calls out Trump\u2019s racism Joe Kaeser, the CEO of the German industrial giant Siemens, wrote in response to Trump\u2019s racist comments on \u201cthe Squad\u201d that he is turning the US presidency into \u201cthe face of racism and exclusion.\u201d \u201cI lived in the USA for many years and experienced freedom, tolerance and openness as never before,\u201d he said in a tweet, arguing that Trump\u2019s suggestion to the four minority congresswoman to \u201cgo back\u201d to their home countries does not reflect American values. (All four congresswomen are US citizens, and three were born here.) Kaeser has previously called out nationalism in his native Germany and pulled out of a Saudi Arabian conference over the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Important baby news: Chelsea Clinton and her husband have welcomed their third child, a boy named Jasper Clinton Mezvinsky. He joins his older sister Charlotte, 4, and brother Aidan, 3. This is Joanie Greve, taking over for Jessica Glenza. Trump will soon meet with Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, at the White House. But he and first lady Melania Trump first stopped at the Supreme Court to pay their respects to John Paul Stevens as the late justice lies in repose. Former Texas state senator Wendy Davis just announced she will run for Congress in Texas\u2019s 21st Congressional District. Davis is best known for a 13-hour filibuster against abortion restrictions in Texas. The district represents a sliver of San Antonio and a swath north of the city, and is now held by Republican Chip Roy. The district went to Trump in 2016. Here\u2019s a brief documentary from the Texas Tribune on Davis\u2019s filibuster: The same fight has rippled out to sports broadcaster ESPN, where host Dan Le Batard skipped a show Monday after criticizing the president\u2019s comments as \u201cun-American\u201d. Le Batard criticized Donald Trump\u2019s recent racist comments and ESPN itself on air last week. ESPN later sent out a notice to employees reminding them of the network\u2019s policy of not discussing politics on air. This is how AOC responded to Trump\u2019s attack yesterday: Trump\u2019s attacks on The Squad have proved an effective way to push the four Congresswoman to the front of the Democratic party, a spotlight the squad is happy to take. From our column on the fight: The Squad have welcomed and sought out public attention because they want to use their celebrity to push the party to the left, just as the conservative movement pushed the Republican party to the right in decades past. They believe that this transformation not only will lead to progressive legislative victories, it will also win elections. A week after President Trump launched a racist attack on a group of four freshman women Congress members known as \u201cthe Squad,\u201d telling them to \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they came from, he is trying to turn the attack around on them. \u201cThe squad\u201d are a group of four women of color, including Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. Just yesterday Trump said the four female Representatives were, \u201cnot capable of loving the US\u201d. Congressional leaders and the White House appear to be on the cusp of a deal to raise the national debt limit and avoid a government shutdown. The \u201cdebt ceiling\u201d is a legislative limit on the amount of debt the US Treasury can incur. It must be raised by Congress, or the federal government shuts down, resulting in park closures, furloughed federal workers and late pay checks. The longest government shutdown in history was last January, when the Trump administration unsuccessfully tried to force Congress to approve payments for his Southern border wall. At the height of the #MeToo movement in 2017, former US Senator Al Franken of Minnesota resigned amid allegations he forcibly kissed women. Now, at least seven of his former Senate colleagues have said they regret joining calls for him to resign. The news comes in a lengthy examination of one allegation against Franken made by a conservative radio talk show host from Los Angeles. The New Yorker\u2019s Jane Mayer has found \u201calmost nothing\u201d she claimed checked out upon examination. The Trump administration named Trump National Doral, the president\u2019s Miami golf club, as a \u201cfinalist\u201d location for next year\u2019s G7 meeting. Trump\u2019s properties have featured prominently during his presidency, despite concerns about conflicts of interest. The meeting is a gathering of leaders of the world\u2019s most powerful economies. Axios reported the administration is nearing a decision after conducting several site surveys for the upcoming meeting. Here is more from House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s interview with Recode: The tech companies aren\u2019t ready,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have, I think, their policies fully thought out yet. The government isn\u2019t ready. We don\u2019t have the technologies yet to be able to detect more sophisticated fakes.\u201d And the public, by and large, when you bring up \u2018deepfake,\u2019 they don\u2019t know what you\u2019re referring to,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd so we don\u2019t have much time. It\u2019s eight months until the primaries begin to try to prepare the public, prepare ourselves, determine what other steps need to be taken to protect ourselves from this kind of disinformation.\u201d Hello and welcome to the Guardian US politics liveblog. Democrat Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, has told Recode social media platforms, the government and the American voting public are unprepared for the 2020 election and the \u201cdeep fakes\u201d likely to accompany it. New Yorker writer Jane Mayer has reexamined Al Franken\u2019s resignation from the US Senate amid allegations of forced kissing, and has found \u201calmost nothing\u201d his main accuser alleged checks out. Finally, Republicans are pledging tough questions for former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, when he finally testifies in Congress.",

The nation had been shocked by the footage revealed on Four Corners. The prime minister had called a royal commission. Everyone declared \u201cnever again\u201d. One of the first things I worked on in the desert was compiling tens of thousands of harrowing words into submissions for the royal commission. I trawled through the evidence collected by the Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service, compiling accounts of children being locked in cells for days on end, denied education and held in uninhabitable conditions. There was a sense of urgency \u2013 even at this early stage \u2013 that we had to make sure the centre was not forgotten. The explosive Four Corners footage came from an incident at Don Dale, but it was the children in Alice Springs who were being stuffed into overcrowded cells, held in watch-houses and denied access to any sort of meaningful programs or mental health care. Over the past 18 months I, with many others, have watched with bitter disappointment as the Northern Territory government has moved further away from its promises of reform, particularly in recent months as the territory election approaches.

The prison blocks had to go, highly specialised staff were essential, culturally and linguistically appropriate programs should be implemented, the age of criminal responsibility had to be raised, and deliberate steps had to be taken to keep children out of the criminal justice system. The Northern Territory government is yet to come good on these promises, and overwhelmingly it is children from Alice Springs and its surrounds who are paying the price. Last year I was appalled to find that in the Alice Springs youth detention centre up to five teenage boys were being sardined into single cells; children were being locked in cells for days and were being denied time outside and at school. I was deeply distressed for the children who talked to me about their frustration and hurt at being treated in a way that was plain to them lacked dignity, let alone care. At any time, more than three-quarters of the children being held in detention in the Northern Territory are from Alice Springs or the Barkly. Yet, it is Don Dale \u2013 above the Berrimah line \u2013 which has been allocated $70m to be rebuilt, and it\u2019s Alice Springs which is again being left behind. Instead of knocking down the Alice Springs youth detention centre and resigning it to a dark passage of history where it belongs, the NT government has decided to address the problem of overcrowding in Alice Springs by sending children as young as 13 hundreds of kilometres away from their family and community to Don Dale. The royal commission, and the media attention it precipitated, understandably focused on the shocking scenes at Don Dale captured on camera. But it would be a further injustice for limited improvements for children and communities in the Top End to come at the expense of Aboriginal children in the centre. The minister for Territory families responsible for the \u201ccare\u201d of young people in these ghastly places is the member of Braitling and lives in Alice Springs.
